A merry Progress to London to see Fashions, by a young Country Gallant, that
had more Money then Wit.
To the tune of, Riding to Rumford.


MY Mother to Heaven is gone,
ten Pounds she gave me;
Now never a Penny's left,
as God shall have me:
Yet still my heart is free,
I live at liberty,
And keep good company,
taking Tobacco.
Old Woman, fare thou well,
thanks for thy kindness,
My Plough and Cart are gone,
with my good Geldings:
I have no foot of Land,
Nor one Groat at command:
Which way then shall I stand
to a pipe of Tobacco?
My Purse will chincke no more,
my Pocket's empty:
I am turned out of door;
farewell good Company.
Friendship now slender grows,
Poverty ^^^th those
That for Drink sell their Clothes
and for Tobacco.
My Cloak is laid to pawn,
with my old Dagger:
M^sta^^ quite orethrowne,
how shall I swagger^
(...) what I can,
(...) Coward tho,
But prove my self a man,
at a ^^pe of Tobacco.
(...) Satin ^ure
(...) a Penny.
(...) ^ant^ may brag it brave:
(...) as any.
What though my Credit's lost,
Yet can I find a Post
Still to score with mine Host,
for a pipe of Tobacco.
Upon a proper Nagge
daintely paced;
To London first I came,
all with Gold laced:
Then with my Puncke each day,
Road I to see a Play;
There went my Gold away,
taking Tobacco.
Twenty good Sheep I brought,
left by my Mother:
Cawes and Lambs, Cowes and Calves,
one with the other:
With which I paid a shot,
For a Pipe and a Pot:
All these were bravely got,
and spent in Tobacco.
No companion was I then
for clownish Carters:
I wore imbrodred Hose,
with golden Garters:
My Siluer-hatched Sword,
Made me swear like a Lord,
Come Rogue, (at every word)
fill me Tobacco.
The Second part of the merry Progress to London.
To the same tune.


THen tracing the gallant Streets
of London City,
A Damsel me kindly greets,
courtious and witty:
She like a singing Lark,
Ledd me into the dark,
Where I soon paid a Mark
for a Pipe of Tobacco.
To Smithfield then gallantly
took I my iorny,
Where I left soon behind
part of my Money:
There I found out a Puncke,
With whom I was so drunk,
That my Purse bottom shrunk
away with Tobacco.
Pickthatch and Clarken-well,
made me so merry,
Until my Purse at last;
began to grow weary:
Yellow-starcht bonny Kate,
with her fine nimble pate,
Coosond me of my plate,
with a pipe of Tobacco.
Then for Good-fellowship,
to Garden-ally,
I hied me to search for
Daughters of folly:
There I found roaring Boys,
with their fair Female joys:
And the Devil making toys
to take Tobacco.
After, to Shores-ditch then,
stood I beholding:
Where I found sinners store,
of the Devils moulding:
I speak for no slander,
The Puncke and her Pander,
Like a Goose and her Gander,
took whiffes of Tobacco.
To Saint Katharus past I (...)
not without trouble:
Where my Purse lashed out,
drinking Beer double:
A Tester for each Toast
paid I there to my Host*
And the Sauce to my cost,
was a Crown for to Tobacco.
To Ratcliffe and Wapping then.
went I for Shipping;
Where as a Less lovingly
gave me a whipping:
There was a bonny Wench,
Stroke a Nail would not clench,
That taught me fiuely French,
taking Tobacco.
Then straight to Westminster
made I aduenter,
To find Good fellows (who)
willed me to enter,
Where I felt such a smoke,
As might the Devil choke,
There went away my Cloak,
with the smoke of Tobacco.
Bacward to Barbican
quickly I hasted:
There met I honest John,
My Money being wasted:
A Pipe and a Pot (quoth he)
My friend I Will bestow on thee;
Then lets to Nobody,
there is the best Tobacco.
Now farewell Good-fellowship,
London I leave thee:
Never more whilst I live,
shall they deceive me.
Every Street, every Lane,
Holds me in disdain,
London has wrought my bane,
so farewell Tobacco.
Finis.
Imprinted at London for ^. White.
