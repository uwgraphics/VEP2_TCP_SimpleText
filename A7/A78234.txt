THE CASE OF THE Censors, and other Members of the College of Physicians,
London;
HUMBLY OFFERED To the Right Honorable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, now
in Parliament assembled.
THe late Censors of the College of Physicians, Dr. Tho. Burwell, Dr. Rich.
Torless, Dr. William Dawes, and Dr. Tho. Gill, are now prosecuted at Law, for
not qualifying themselves, according to the Statute of 25 K. Chapter II.

Now on behalf of the said Censors it is humbly offered, 1. That the Censors
are nominated and chosen by the said College, in pursuance of an Act of
Parliament of the 14th and 15th of K. H. 8. to that employment, which they are
obliged to perform under a penalty without salary or profit, and do not
exercise it by virtue of any Letters Patents or Commission immediately from the
King. 2. That no one of the Censors since the said Statute, of the 25th of K.
Chapter II. ever took the said Oaths, or subscribed the said Declarations, as
Censors, or understood themselves to be obliged so to do. 3. That all these
four Censors are known Protestants, and upon other occasions have taken the
Oaths and subscribed the said Declarations, and did voluntarily sign the
Association, and have upon all occasions testified their affection and zeal for
his Majesty's Service and Government, and had readily taken the said Oaths, and
subscribed the said Declarations upon this occasion also, if any former Censor
had so done, or they had not been advised by their Council, that the Censors
were not concerned in the said Statute. 4. That if the Censors be within the
said Statute, it is conceived several other Members of the said College (as all
such who have been Presidents, Elects, Censors, Treasurers and Registers) are
liable to prosecution.


Wherefore it is humbly hoped, that the said Censors, and other Members of the
said College, that may be concerned in the like omission, shall be relieved in
this case, in such manner as your Lordships shall in your great Wisdoms please
to think fit.
