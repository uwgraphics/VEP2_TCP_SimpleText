A PROCLAMATION, Touching the speedy calling to Account of all such Persons
whose Accounts are excepted in the Act of Oblivion.
CHARLES R.

WHereas in the Act made in the Parliament begun at Westminster the Five and
twentieth day of April in the Twelfth Year of Our Reign (Entitled, An Act of
Free and general Pardon, Indemnity and Oblivion) there is contained an
Exception of the Accounts of Treasurers, Receivers, Farmers and Collectors,
other then the Sub-collectors of the several Parishes, Towns and Hamlets
respectively, for their Receipts therein mentioned, who had received or
collected the Duties specified in the said Exception. And whereas Our high
Treasurer of England by Our command has sent out several Warrants or Summons
to diverse Treasurers and other Persons residing in and about London, for
bringing in of their Accounts into the Office of Our Remembrancer in Our
Exchequer, at certain days and times in the said Warrants prefixed, to the end
that all such moneys as have been received, or any ways collected from Our
loving Subjects, and are not pardoned by the said Act of General Pardon, may be
duly accounted for, and answered unto Us, Our Heirs or Successors, and that
the Persons so accompting may have their legal Discharges according to the
course of Our Exchequer. Therefore Our Will and Pleasure is, and We do
straightly charge and command all manner of Persons whatsoever, which have
received or shall receive any Warrants or Summons from Our said high Treasurer,
for bringing in of their Accounts into Our Exchequer, that they bring them in
according to the days and times in the said Warrants expressed. And that all
and every other person accomptable unto Us it was thereby further enacted, That
in case any person or persons should resist or make forcible opposition against
any person or persons in the due and through execution of the same Act, That
every such person or persons for every such offense should forfeit the sum of
Five pounds to be divided and recovered in manner aforesaid; And in case any
person or persons should not pay the sums of money by them to be paid, by
virtue of the same Act, that in every such case distress should be made and
sale thereof, returning the overplus to the owners; And in case no distress
shall be found, that them every such party should be committed to the common
Gaol in the County where such offense should be committed, there to remain for
the space of two months without Bail or Mainprise. Provided always, and it was
thereby enacted, That the same Act nor any thing contained therein should
extend to the hindering of the planting of Tobacco in any Physick-garden of
either University or in any other private garden for Physic or Surgery,
only so as the quantity so planted exceed not one half of one pole in any one
place or garden, as in and by the same Act it does and may more fully appear.
Now to the end that all Our loving Subjects in all parts of Our said Kingdoms
of England and Ireland, and Dominion of Wales, and in the said Islands of
Guernsey and Jersey, and in our said Town of Berwick upon Twede, may the better
take notice of and more duly observe the said Act, and not ignorantly offend
against the same for the future, We have thought good to publish and declare
the same to all Our loving Subjects by this Our Royal Proclamation, And do
withal likewise signify and declare, that for the future We shall expect, and
do hereby require all dutiful observance thereof, and ready conformity
thereunto, and that not only upon the pains, penalties, and forfeitures
therein expressed, but also of Our high indignation and displeasure, justly and
deservedly to be inflicted upon all those that shall knowingly and
presumptuously offend against so just and reasonable a Law. And we do hereby
straightly charge and command all Our Judges of Assise and Commissioners of
Oyer and Terminer in their several Circuits, and all Our Justices of Peace in
their several and respective Quarter Sessions, that they give the same Law in
charge to the several and respective Iuries in their several and respective
Inquests before them, to the end that the offenses and offenders against the
same, both in the setting, planting, or sowing of Tobacco, contrary to the true
intent and meaning of the same Act, and also all forcible opposition and
resistance made or to be made against any person or persons in the due
execution of the same Act, may be punished according to Law and the demerit of
their offenses in this behalf. And We do further command and require all
Sheriffs, Justices of the peace, Mayors, Bailiffs, Constables, and all other
Our Officers and ministers whatsoever whom the premises shall or may concern,
that they from time to time as occasion shall require, be diligent,
circumspect, and careful in the due execution of the same Act in all things
according to the true intent and meaning thereof, as they will answer the
contrary at their perils.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Twenty ninth day of March, in the
Thirteenth Year of Our Reign, One thousand six hundred sixty one.
