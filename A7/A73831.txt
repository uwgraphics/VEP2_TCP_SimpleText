A very pleasant new Ditty,
To the Tune of Stand thy ground old Harry.




COme Hostess fill the pot,
for a penny will never undo me.
If thou has no money to pay the shot,
my Guest thou art welcome to me.
Come fill us a dozen of Cannes,
though they be but a pint a piece,
We swear we will drink 'em off every man,
and thou we will the Tapster fleece,
For after a while we are here,
And after a while we are gone:
And after a while we have money,
And after a while we have none.
Suppose a young man spend,
and then have no money to pay,
He has no credit, nor none youll lend,
but you will his Castor stay.
Yet still he will call for Beer,
with a full courageous note:
But when the reckoning he does hear,
now marry he has never a grote.
For after a while we are here, etc.
Good fellows enrich the house,
where they do daily use:
So long as they deal in honest sort,
and do not the man abuse.
But we are such fellows grown,
as day may appear:
That a Fleming of the female kind
is ^etter then English Beer.
(...) a while, etc.
We love good liquour well,
and will not a Can refuse:
But when the reckoning comes to pay,
we had rather gain then loose.
Yet for to gull the Tapster
we are exceeding loath,
But the chiefest fault in him we find,
he does fill his cans with froth.
For after a while, etc.
The Butcher with his wind,
does love to puff his meat:
The Cook does in his kind
delight the world to cheat.
The Tailor with his sheares
will shread a garment small,
But an honest drunkard still
is the chiefest fellow of all.
For after a while, etc.
The high-lawyer bravely goes.
on highways taking rent:
But often he pawnes his cloths,
his money being spent.
Many a man does cheat,
till to the Stocks he fall:
But your honest drunkard still,
is the chiefest fellow of all.
For after a while we are here,
And after a while we are gone:
And after a while we have money,
And after a while we have none.
The Second Part.
To the same tune.


FVll many that seem precise,
will now and then be drunk:
And others thought full wise,
will spend till they be sunk,
But it is so closely done,
the fault does seem but small,
But your honest drunkard still,
is the chiefest fellow of all.
For after a while we are here.
And after a while we are gone:
And after a while we have money,
And after a while we have none.
The Malt-man with his meals
does often times hoyst the prise,
With mingled stuff heel deal,
yet still his grain must rise
Though the Country sell it cheap.
his rate shall never fall,
But yet your honest drunkard still
is the chiefest fellow of all.
For after a while, etc.
The Courtier will intrude
to the company of a maid,
And will her with words deceive,
if she trust all that is said:
But let the shot be pais,
his expenses is but small,
But your honest drunkard still,
is the chiefest, fellow of all.
For after a while, etc.
Some Tradesman if you please,
his humor for to try,
His gain shall still increase,
or else he will swear and lie.
But if you naught will buy,
enraged he then will fall:
But your honest drunkard still,
is the chiefest fellow of all.
For after a while, etc.
Your Under-officers,
that so lately were allowed,
Will in their offices
be damnably devilish proud,
For they will abate no fee,
although the fault be small:
But your honest drunkard still
is the chiefest fellow of all.
For after a while, etc.
Some Bakers pure do show,
although they use false weights:
And Chandlors well I know,
have pretty cunning sleights.
Your cruel Sergeants will
no pity take at all:
But your honest drunkard still
is the chiefest fellow of all.
For after a while, etc.
Your Panders will be proud,
good fellows not precise:
Your officers turn wood-peckers,
when they be styled wise.
Good-fellowship will stand,
when as the rest will fall:
For your honest drunkard still
is the chiefest fellow of all.
For after a while, etc.
Come fill us each man a quart.
and give us a bottle of Ale:
I Will pledge thee with all my heart,
if our liquour be but stale.
Let us have thy Tester and mine,
and so it shall fly all day:
We Will call and always join,
though we have no money to pay.
For after a while we are here,
And after a while we are gone:
And after a while we have money,
And after a while we have none.
FINIS.
