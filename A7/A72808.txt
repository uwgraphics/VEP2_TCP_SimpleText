TO THE HONORABLE HOUSE OF Commons assembled in Parliament.
The humble petition of the Master, Wardens, Assistants, and Company of Brewers
in London, and within four miles compass of the same City.
IN all humble manner, Showing, that whereas of late years his Majesty's
Purueyor has used to come and take from your petitioners (being freemen of
the City of London) Beer and Ale for his Highness use, which anciently of
freemen within the said City has not been taken. In respect whereof, and for
that many of your petitioners were and still are very poor and needy, and
could not live and maintain their great charge if they had not ready money
for their Ale and beer so taken, or at least true payment for the same in
short time after. The petitioners to prevent their own impouerishment and
undoing, were forced to deny the Purueyor the taking of their Ale and Beer as
aforesaid, whereupon warrants were granted forth to commit such of your
petitioners to prison as refused so to do, until they should be contented to
yield to such takings, or else to pay four pence for every quarter of Malt
your petitioners should brew.

Your petitioners many of them being in prison a long time, to their great
loss and charges, and being desirous of their liberty that they might employ
themselves in their profession for the maintenance of them, their wives,
children, and great families, were then compelled to procure their enlargement
by yielding to the payment of the said four pence for every quarter of Malt
they should brew, which payments your petitioners have been ever since forced
to perform.

Now so it is, if it may please this Honorable Assembly, that the said four
pence imposed on your petitioners, as aforesaid, being a new taxation, is more
grievous and burdensome unto them, then if they paid ten Subsidies a year,
For that besides the charge thereof, The undertaker or farmer of those groats
has formerly vexed and sued your petitioners in the Court of Request, And the
now undertakers or farmers do continually threaten to sue and exhibit Bills
and Interrogatories in the Court aforesaid, to examine your petitioners and
their servants upon their oaths, unless your petitioners will condescend to
what composition they please, not contented with any reasonable gain,
notwithstanding they are brethren of one Company, to the great terror,
grieuance, and further impouerishing of your petitioners, and the general hurt
and inconvenience of the said City, and those within four miles compass
thereof.

Neither does this new taxation upon every quarter of Malt imposed on your
petitioners free them or any kind of way ease them from Subsidies, Taxes,
Fifteenes, or any such like payments, nor gains your petitioners any benefit
extraordinary more then any other Subjects have who pay no such thing.

The premises considered, May it please this High Court of Parliament for
relieuing of so great a number from this heavy burden of four pence upon
every quarter of Malt, and for preventing of the like inconvenience that may
ensue, to grant them your favor herein, And so they leave it to your Grave
considerations.

And they and their posterity shall be over bound to pray for your Honors
long health and prosperity.
