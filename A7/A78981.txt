A Proclamation concerning the due and orderly proceedings in the Court of
Wards and Liveries.
HIS Majesty having by His Royal Proclamation, settled the Court of Wards and
Liveries to be ke^^ and held in His City of Oxford, until He shall otherwise
ordain the same; to which place and (...) the Master and Council of that
Court, there all His Subjects who have affairs in that Court m^^^ and ought
during that time make their resort. But His Majesty finding a great neglect in
those w^^ should find and return offices after the death of the Kings
Tenants, and thereupon make their co^^positions for Wardships, and pay their
monyes compounded for, pay the Rents reserved and in (...) time prosecute their
Liveries in that Court, whereon a great part of His Majestyes just Revenue
^^^pends; And His Majesty being very willing and resolved to hold Himself to
such regular cou^^^ as for many years past he has prescribed to Himself, for
the good and safety of His good Subjects, and of their estate^ (...) the case
of granting of Wardships; Yet least any of them should be misled and apply
themselves to any other place o^ ^^ny other persons, and so by their negligence
or error should incur that danger or prejudice which they would o^^^^^wise
willingly have avoided, or else His Majesty to suffer in His just Revenue
through their default; His Majesty h^^ therefore thought fit to give notice,
and does by this His Proclamation give notice to all those whom it may any
ways c^^^cerne, That as He on His part is, and will be constant to His rules
of grace in the granting of Wardships and preserving (...) protecting their
estates, if those to whom the same is so graciously offered do not wilfully
neglect it; So His Majesty d^^^ hereby declare, that if those who do pretend,
or might regularly pretend to become suitors for any Wardship, or to h^^^^
compounded for the same, or to sue out Liverye of any Lands, shall neglect
within convenient time after the death of (...) Auncestor to find an office
and to return the same into the Petty Bag in Chauncery, and to transcript
the same into (...) said Court of Wards and Liveries at Oxford, according as
shall be ordered by that Court, or shall neglect within conve^^^ent time to
make their composition with His Majesty, or with the Council of the said Court
now residing at Oxf^^^ on His Majesty's behalf, or shall neglect to pay the
monyes compounded and agreed for to His Majessties Recei^^^ there, or shall
neglect to pay the Rents due and payable for the Wards Lands, or the mean
Rates paya^^^ where mean rates shall be due, or shall neglect to sue out their
Liveries, when and where by law and by the cou^^ of that Court they ought, that
in all those cases upon such neglect His Majesty must be, and will be at His
own Liberty (...) make His best advantage by granting such Wardships to such
others who will compound-for the same and pay the ^^^neys compounded for and
not paid, and shall and will take His best remedy and advantage which by the
s;trictness^ (...) Law in Justice He can for the recovery of the Rents and
other duties due and payable to His Majesty in those cases. (...) that he will
severely punish all those Escheators, Feodaries and other Ministers of the said
Court, who shall in their ^^^spective place neglect their duties, to His
Majesty's disservice.

Given at Our Court at Oxford, the Eleventh day of ^^^vember, in the Nineteenth
year of Our Reign. 1643.
