Divinity, and Fellow of Brasen-nose-Colledge In OXFORD.

Published by E. B from the Copy of that famous Divine, Mr. Robert Bolton,
late Minister of Broughton in Northhampton-shire.

THE PREFACE TO the READER.
Christian Reader,
I Had not performed a trust, had not I published this ensuing Narrative; and I
had not paid a debt which I do and shall ever owe to the Public, had not I
made it common. Mr Bolton (a man of precious memory, and famous in his
generation) desired me upon his deathbed, ^o publish such of his papers as I
^hought fit for the Press, which I have already done. This copy being found
amongst them, (though penned by another hand) I durst not withhold, being to my
knowledge intended by him for the press in memory of his familiar friend and
spiritual father, Mr Thomas Peacock; who was a very Godly Minister of Christ,
and of rare example for humility and holiness o^ life; for a Religious care in
educating his scholars, and for exceeding charity to the bodies and souls o^
poor distressed Christians. An^ yet this godly man, that for piet^ had in him
the root of an Oak, when God cast him upon his bed of sickness, and suffered
Satan to winno (...) him, he was no more in his hand then a leaf tossed too and
fro wit (...) the wind. Gods dealings wit (...) him in these his last
conflicts, ar^ of singular use in these present times in which the ends of the
world, an^ the dreggs of schism and sin an^ come upon us at once.

First, for caution to the true servants of God, to take heed of small sins;
for from the lesser sins and infirmities of Mr Peacock, the Devil did thence
take a rise to cast him into the most bitter spiritual desertion that we shall
lightly read ^f: under which he had sunk, had not God wonderfully put to his
hand, by making the issue of his afflictions more glorious and comfortable,
^hen the combat was grievous and ^errible. It was a memorable say^ng of
Francis Spira, which he spoke to his mournful children and friends, beholding
that sad specta^le of his small despair, earnestly wishing them to take heed
of committing the smallest sins against ^onscience; By this means, says he,
I fell into greater sins, till I ^ame to deny the Gospel of Christ, and after
that to renounce it in ^riting, and deliberately to subscribe to it with my
hand, though (says he) I hea^d a voice in my conscience telling me, Spira, do
not subscribe it; after which I thought I heard the voice of Christ whom I
denied before men, to pronounce the sentence of death upon my soul, and to
exclude me from salvation. And thus he dyed.

Secondly, for confutation of sundry sor^s in Religion, in these unhappy days
of Civil war, as naturally producing them as mud and filth do toads and
vermin. Some there are that quite abrogate the Law, which Christ came to
fulfill, and so make the gate of Heaven wider then ever our Savior made it, by
admitting lawless persons into it. Holy Bradford was of another mind, who was
wont to say, that the gate of Heaven was so strait, that he which halted could
not enter into it; and the way (...) narrow, that he which reeled ^^uld not
walk in it. Others there ^re, who though they do not whol^ destroy the law,
yet they cast it (...) to a dead sleep, thinking it un^^wfull in the children
of God to be ^^rry, or to mourn for sin, con^^ary to the Doctoine of the
primi^^ve Fathers, teaching this lesson, ^emper doleat paenitens, and de ^olore
gaudeat; Let the penitent ^erson always mourn, and rejoice (...) that
mourning; agreeing with ^^e rule of our Savior, Blessed are ^hey that mourn,
for they shall ^e comforted.

Nay, I lately heard it not with^^t horror; that some men, in out^ard
appearance of great sanctity, ^e hold an opinion, that it is a ^ult in godly
men to pray for par^n of sin, (all sins being pardon^^ in Christ before they
pray) contrary to the prayer of our Savior Forgive us our trespasses. Neither
Mr Peacock, nor any of thos^ godly Divines that came to comfo^^ him, knew this
kind of Doctrine neither we, nor the Churches of Go^ till within these few
late unhapp^ days.

What will become of our reformed Religion, streaming down to (...) in the
blood of so many Martyr^^ if God by a miracle of mercy shou^^ not shorten these
our miserab^^ days? For whiles some are takin^ from us the Ten Commandement^
others, the Lords Prayer, there (...) scarce any thing left us of Christ^^anity
but our Creed, and how lo^^ we shall enjoy this the Lord in He^ven knows. For
so long as t^^ civil sword of war devoures (...) much Protestants blood from
wit^out, and a worse civil war sin and separation, destroys many
Protestant souls from within, ^e may justly fear that we shall either want
sound Orthodox Prote^^ants to maintain it; or we shall ^^ant a Creed for them
to main^ain.

I shall, for conclusion, desire that Reader into whose hands this ensu^^g
discourse shall fall, to observe ^hree things concerning M^ Pea^ock, a man whom
I well knew, and bless God that ever I knew ^im.

1. That the forest and sharpest ^fflictions do very often befall the ^earest
and choicest servants of God: I mean, not outward and temporal ^fflictions,
common to good and ^ad: but inward and spiritual af^^ictions, and the heaviest
of these ^pirituall desertions, whereby God ^ithdrawes his glorious counte^ance
from his children: and Sa^an in liew thereof, shows them his ugly visage,
thereby convincing a^ secure world. That it is no easy matter to go to Heaven,
and tha^ the safest and surest way to it, is to sail by the gates of Hell. If
the righteous can scarcely be save^ (says the Apostle) where shall the wicked
and sinner appear?

2. That the deepest humiliation of Gods children, do usually determine in the
highest consolations And hereby the wicked, who like ravening wolves hunt after
such opportunities, do miss of their prey and return ashamed when they
consider what end God has made. An^ thus it fell out with Mr Peacoc^ here.

3. Lastly, Though a spiritua^^ desertion be the highest affliction that
befalls Gods child; yet it discovers in him the greatest sincerit^ of an
upright heart; For at such time he is so far from hiding h^^ sins, that he
cares not what ^ame he puts upon himself, so God ^ay have glory. For in a
spi^^tuall desertion, though the soul of Christian be extremely distressed
^^rough the terror of sin; yet at ^he same time has it a true touch (...)
grace, though not of the comforts ^f it: like iron touched with the ^oad-stone,
it stands directly North^ard, though with much tremb^ng: So does the soul of a
Christi^n stand directly Heavenward in ^his hellish agony: and the absence ^f
God and of his consolations, is ^he cause of those bitter convulsion^its in the
soul. And as soon as ever the comforts of grace shine upon ^t, those former
tremblings of heart for grief, are presently changed in^o leapings for joy;
just as the same ^prinkles of the face, which serve for ^rying when the heart
is grieved, ^erve for laughter when it is filled with joy. This was the case
(...) Mr Peacock, in this manner h^ grieved, in this manner he rejoiced and
this happy issue God made of h^ bitter afflictions. So that amid^ the numerous
and various afflictions of Gods dear Saints and Children, this conclusion of
the Prophet David remains sure and firm Mark the upright man, and be hold the
just, for the end of tha^ man is peace. So I rest,

Thine in the Lord E. B

Mr PEACOKS Visitation.
MAster Peacock, the servant of God, in the beginning of his visitation, for
the space of two weeks and four days, was full of most Heavenly consolations;
showing by sweet meditations, and gracious ejaculations, the entertainment he
found with his God in his sickness, with whom he so much desired to be
acquainted in his health. We are (says one coming to visit him) miserable
comforters. Nay (says he) Ye are good, for this is the privilege even of Gods
children, that their very presence affords comfort. Sometimes h^ craved pardon
for his actions, and for the circumstances by them badly observed: otherwhile
h^ desired to have some matter given him to meditate upon. Finally he said, his
hope was firmly settled on the rock Christ Jesus He hoped that the Lord would
give him a place, though it were in the lowest room of his Saints And he
thanked God he had n^ trouble of conscience, the Lord did not suffer Satan to
vex him In so much that some seeing hi^ great comfort, feared lest h^ would be
overtaken with sorrow before his death: he much rejoiced that the Lord had so
disposed of him, that he had see^ his friends in the Country. Her^ first was
his yielding unto death suspected, and his hoped reco^ery doubted. Calling some
of ^is friends aside, I thought (says ^e) I had been in a good estate, but
(...) see it now far otherwise: For ^hese things my conscience lays against
me: First, I brought up my ^cholars in Gluttony, letting the^ eat their fill of
meat, when they mealed ^ith me. This some endeavored ^o pull out, by putting
into his mind, 1. The preventing of ma^y inconveniences. 2. His well known
moderation. 3. The great care he took for good conference, when they were at
table with him. But (says he) while I was talking, they did undo themselves.
And further, I did unadvisedly expound places of Scripture at the table many
times; and for these I feel now a Hell in my conscience. Again, I have procured
my own death, by often eating like a beast, when I came justling up and dow^ to
my friends in the Country; An^ now I see before my face those dis^es of meat
wherewith I clogged m^ stomach. Well (says one to him If all the things you
accuse you self of were undone, would yo^ do them again? Nay: why the^ doubt
not but a Reprobate would desire to be saved, if a desire would serve the
turn: indeed he ma^^^ have a desire, but of bare willingness, not with an
intent an^ purpose in using of the means Another time a worthy friend o^ his
asking him how he did: h^ cried out, Sin, Sin, Sin What does any lie on
your conscience? Yea. What? My unconsideratenes, I did eat too much of suc^
meat to breakfast such a morning (...) my self being an eye-witnes o^ his great
abstinence, could no^ choose but admire the tenderne^ ^f his self-accusing
conscience. Well (said he) God be thanked ^here is no greater. As we must ^ot
extenuate our sins, so neither must we too much aggra^ate our sin. Let
drunkards and gluttons have those terrible ^orrours. I thank God I never
con^inued in any known sin against my conscience. He was willing that he
should pray with him: kneeling down he said, he was ^hen incapable of prayers.
Afterward he kneeled down of his ^own accord: shortly after he ^roke out into
such speeches, A damnable, wretched etc. these are nor your words (says one)
you cannot deny but you have had good experience of Gods mercies. I cannot.
Then be comforted, for whom he loves once, he loves to the end. Yet Satan
took such advantage of his infirmities, that though he could find some
comfort, yet no particular assurance. You have lived profitably (said one) I
have endeavored. You are now humbled, and the Lord looks that you should ask
mercy. M. Dod was sent for, who being come, they were private awhile,
afterward we coming in to them, M. Dod put him in mind of Gods kindenes:
whereof he showed to him four parts. 1. To take small things in good part. 2.
To pass by infirmities. 3. To be easily entreated. 4. To be entreated for the
greatest.

Sir, there is now in you the image of the old Adam, sin and sorrow: there
shall be in you the image of the new, holiness and happiness. The life to come
may be set out by three things. 1. The estate of it self, happiness, holiness,
and glory. 2. By the (...) company, every one shall ^^e you better then any
one, e^^n the best, can love you here.

The place.

There are three differences be^^een the afflictions of the good ^^d of the
bad. 1. In the cause, ^r they come to the good for ^ods love. 2. In the
measure, (...) far as they need, and are a^^^e to bear. 3. In the end, for
^^eir good.

Of those former doubts we ^^terwards heard not a word ^^om him. Upon the
Sabbath^^y he desired to be alone: after ^^on he was fearfully troubled. (...)
his countenance appeared evi^ent tokens of a sorrowful ^inde, born up with a
weak ^ody; his spirit was wounded, ^^tan had foiled him. Those his ^^rrible
wrestlings with tentations, gripes of conscience, a^^ restles terrors, none
can unde^stand, (much less express but he which felt them. S^tan had winnowed
him, an^ showed him nothing but chaff^ His tender conscience w^ goared with the
fiery dar^ of the Devil, pointed wit^ the edge of sin, an^ sense of Gods
heavy wra^^ As through a false glass, the dazzled eye of his astonished and
amazed soul, could see nothing but hideousl^ appearing sin, and the terrible
image of death an^ damnation. He had drun^ deeply of the cup of the dreggs of
Hell. His adversary had represented unto him his once most gracious God, now as
a mos^ severe Judge displeased, angry, and chiding with ^im; yea yielding him
up unto his claws: that so by ^his deadly stratagem, he ^ight take from him
all ^ope of help that way, and ^o not only stop the sen^ible flowing of Gods
grace; and cut the chains of Gods love, whereby he had tied ^im, and would draw
him after him, but finally break ^is Christian heart. Oh that you had seen, or
that we that were present had had eyes to have seen his ^eeming forlone soul.
What with barkings of conscience, and with the too heavy burden of sin,
waves of fearful thoughts, ^lustering blasts, and surging storms of Gods
heavy displeasure, he was tossed, turmoyled, dashed aga^^ the rocks of
despair, and m^^ then in danger of his souls s^^ wrack: happy were we if
^^ther through frowardnes, (...) blindenes of judgment, we inconsiderately
pass by, or p^^phanely deride Gods jud^^ments, by thinking that they ^ther
happen casually, or by f^^getting of them suddenly. (...) we could but rightly
discern (...) we should find nothing m^^ profitable, then to have the ^mage
of this gracious (thou^^ now afflicted) soul in our hear^ Hereby we may see
that t^ righteous being scarcely save^ there is no place for the wicked a^^
ungodly to appear. And tru^ we may think that God sent it ^^ven for our sake,
that we (w^^ whom it is too usual to da^ with the Lord) might kno^^ that it is
a fearful thing to fall in^o his hands. Our faith is then ^ryed in earnest,
when as the Lord hides his face from us. For if we love God above all things,
it cannot be but upon the ^osse of the relish of his favor, ^r taste of his
displeasure, our ^ouls should be in bitterness, prick^d, tormented, wounded,
thrust ^horow, yea, and swallowed up with desolation. It is a wonder of the
world, how we care^ully will seek physic, use diet, by any means to avoid a
^odily pang, and how careless we ^re of the unsupportable fits of ^he souls
mortal sickness. It is ^ot in our power to apprehend ^race when we will, and a
hard^r matter is it then we can con^eive, to lift up a poor soul cast ^^wn with
the sense of Gods wrath. If a violent passion may so far transport the min^^
what may we think of this re^les trembling, when the s^ after long tossings,
sees it (...) drowned, and wholly ov^^whelmed with the deluge (...) sorrow,
proceeding from the ^verlasting threats, and sha^^ and confusion of face in
(...) presence of the Almighty Consider the body laden f^^ a burden, neither
portable (...) evitable; and thence gather (...) stranglings of an overladen so
Consider a man ready to (...) from an high Tower unto (...) Earth; and thence
gather (...) estate of another falling fr^^ Heaven to Hell with a spiritu^^
ruin. Consider a child, wh^^ the mother hides her face fr^^ it, and
terrifieth it with a B^^boe; and herein take view of (...) estate of a poor
Christian (wh^ chiefest happiness having therein ^onsisted, (to wit) in being
joyn^d, and united to his Heavenly ^ather, having now lost his pre^ence, or
being affrighted with ^he Devil, as if he were ready to ^^y hands on him.
Consider ^he estate of a debtor, cast off by ^is best Creditours: and gather
that of a Christian being banker^^ut with his God. Consider ^he estate of a
man, once in fa^our, afterward adjudged to ^eath by a Prince, without hope ^f
pardon or repriving: and ga^her that of a Christian, who after his citation and
arraign^ent at the Tribunal seat of God, ^ands condemned, and is whol^^
deprived of obtaining pardon, and delivered into the hands of ^he Devil. The
Lord needs ^ot to seek wild beasts to punish ^s, or such like cruel
executioners of his wrath to torment u^ he may find enough within us all the
furyes and Devils cann^^ invent a more grievous tormen^ One by it apprehended
needet^ not more accusers or torment ours. His many never-though^ of sin (as
if he stirred a nest (...) wasps) come buzzing about h^ ears, and as a man
indebte^ once laid hold of, make him faster daily: his loving friends man stand
by the prison and call him but he being fast fettered, cannon stir forth. You
shall see hi^ now in his purgatory, (not the papisticall sinne-satisfying
fict^on, the Popes jayle) but that h^^ fiery furnace wherein the Lo^^ tries
his metal, whether it (...) good or reprobate. And su^pose that he had died at
t^^ worst (as in the Lords justice (...) might, to the hardening of tho^^ that
will not be softened) As no man should rather judge him by ^he inch of his
death, then the ^ength of his life; so I for my part neither did in him, nor
do ^n my self so much fear his death, as I did, and do desire his life. You
may observe the ^ourses which God takes in visiting his children to be diverse:
some are comfortable and without any great admixture of discomfort: others
heavy, but without horror: others horrible, ^et all of them are in the issue
gracious. But to leave any fur^her digression, and to come again to the matter
in hand.

When one came unto him, he ^rake out into these words, Oh ^ow woeful and
miserable is my e^tate, that thus must converse with ^el-hounds! He being with
these words strangely moved, went to call some of his best ab^^ friends to
comfort him. T^ them he complained, that t^ Lord had cursed him. Being d^manded
how he knew it: he answered, Why! the event shewet^ it. It being replied, The^
such and such were cursed: h^ answered, I have no grace. Ho^ do those then?
they once ha^ none. I was a foolish glorious H^pocrite; It is against the
course (...) Gods proceeding to save me, (...) has otherwise decreed, he
cannon Put your trust in God. I cannon no more then an horse. Do yo^ desire to
believe? No more the^ a post, then an horsshoe. I kno^ you cannot deny but that
yo^ have sought Gods glory. N^^ sincerely. There is a secret mi^ture of pride
and hypocrisy, ^ven in the best. I have no mo^ sense of grace then these
curtain ^^en a goose, then that block. Let ^he testimony of your life past
^omfort you, especially in the ^^lling of a Tutour. I did the ^^sinesse thereof
perfunctorily, when (...) handled hard Authors, I came ^ten unprepared, and
read shame^^lly. Be of good courage, and ^^e Lord will comfort your ^eart. It
is ended, there is no ^^ch matter. Why do you think ^o? You shall see the
event, God ^ill yet bring it to pass. Tush, ^^sh, trifles. What do you think
^f your former Doctrine? Very ^ood. Let it comfort you. It ^^nnot. You desire
it could. If (...) might. There is nothing un^ossible to God. Which stands with
^is decree: Oh, oh, miserable, and ^ofull, the burden of my sin ly^^th heavy
upon me: I doubt it will ^reak my heart. Behold your ^omforts. Nothing to me, I
pray you hold your peace, do not trou^^ your self idly, you vex me, y^ words
are as daggers to my hea^ Another time some of t^^ younger sort said to him,
R^member, Sir, the good counse^^ that you have given us heret^fore. Those were
ordinary. Y^^ may see many others in the li^^ estate. Not such as mine. S^^
David. What do you speak to (...) of David? Good Sir, endeavo^ to settle your
mind; Yes, to pl^^ with hell hounds. Will you pray I cannot. You were wont
her^tofore. Yes, by a custom and va^ glory. Suffer us to pray for yo^ Take not
the name of God in va^^ by praying for a Reprobate. He you may see the glory of
G^^ preferred before his own salv^tion, rather willing to have t^^ means of his
salvation neglecte^ then the Lord dishonored. Su^^er us to pray for our
selves. ^ook to it, you would now show your ^aculty in praying. Can you say,
Amen? No, but in a certain ge^^all fashion. One prayed, and ^n the mean time he
rested most ^uietly. I pray you (says he, ^hen prayer was ended) Go ^ence to
bed, do not trouble your ^lves in vain. Let not the Devil ^elude you, abusing
your mind and tongue, I know you speak ^ot these words. I wonder that
^ntelligent Scholars should speak ^hus. We are persuaded you ^re in as good
estate as our selves Look how it is with your selves in truth. One that watched
with him, asked him, Sir, how can you discern this change by the ^bsence of
God, if you never en^oyed his presence? I thought I ^ad it once, but now I see
it is far ^therwise. But God deals with you, as he dealt with the Church Isa.
54.7. He forsook it a while and hid his face from it, but I returned to it
again, and so ((...) doubt) the case stands with yo^ Never, add not affliction
to the a^flicted; Oh me wretch! groani^^ pitifully. Hope no worse (...) your
self, then we do of yo^ All of us have seen clearly whi^^ way your carriage
was still sen^ after the spirit: and we are ass^red that you will come to t^^
spirit, howsoever you seem t^ have lost your way. To a^ particulars he would
answer, desire grace generally, I did go^^ outwardly, all hypocritically. O^
asked him, Do you love such a one? his most dear, and wo^thy to be dear
friend. Yes. Why For his goodness. Why then you a Gods child, for by this w^
know we are translated from death to life, because we own ^e brethren. Many
like forcible ^oofs he would shift off with is former evasions, and after^ards
became more wary against himself, either loath to ^rant any thing, or granting
it ^aggeringly, or, what then? ^^aring lest he should be pres^ed, he wished,
that some were ^ut in mind, 1. Of their great care ^or building, and too small
care for ^cholars in them. 2. Their giving so long leave of absence from ^he
College, and desired amendment.

After noon came a worthy Governor of a College in our University, Dr Aye^
Provost of Queens College.
and requested him ^o be of good comfort, and to pluck up his spirit. I cannot.
Why can you not? Because I have ^o grace, no more then a Backstock. Why do you
think so? By this affliction. Do you des^ grace? I cannot. (He spoke m^
strongly) I can as well leap ov^ the Church. But are you (...) sorry that you
cannot desire it I cannot. Would you not be Heaven? I would not. O^ standing
by, said, The De^ himself would, if he could. B^ the way, you shall have the
^pinion of a much resp^cted Minister apposite heret^ which he gave in private.
(...) proud man, says he, w^^ scorn to seek any good from his enemy: so the
Devils pri^^ will not let him think himse^ beholding to God for Heaven if he
might get it. You have (said one) the testimony of faith you love the Brethren.
I di^ not. Do not you love us? No This conclusion was faste^ed on him before,
which now he stufts off.
The Devil now sees he should be cast into straits, if yo^ ^ould grant this;
what is it that ^oth most trouble you? I un^rtook too much upon me foolishly:
had gotten a little Logic and ^reek, and meanly instructed in ^e rules, did
set my self to read to ^holars; and afterward under^ok other business, which
distracted ^y mind and body from them, I ^ave destroyed a thousand souls. ^ou
may see the falsehood of ^m that suggesteth this unto ^ou: you never had a
thousand: ^e puts a false glass before you. ^he good effects of your pains
^ppears in many of your Scho^rs. Oh they were of themselves ^apable. Name one
in whom ^hey do not? There is one. (point^ng at a Master of Arts there pre^nt)
He justified his care of ^im, and gave thanks to God that ever he came to him.
It is ^ot so, I did foolishly. You confess you did foolishly, therefo^ not of
malice. Again, consider wh^ would have become of many them if you had not taken
the^ Better, far better. All in the C^ledge know the contrary. Bu^ feel it.
It is false, believe n^ the Devil. It is too true. Wh^ will you make amends?
G^ will give you your hearts desir^ Never. Are you sorry that (...) will not?
No, there is no grace my heart: it is dead. Such w^ David's case. What do you
compare me with him? Behold Chri^ himself. Nothing to me. Go^ can make his
death availabl^ He cannot. He is omnipoten^ In me he cannot, because (...)
stands with his purpose. Who^ God loves once, he loves t^ the end. But he did
never love m^ You have tasted of his love. (...) deceived my self in a certain
vain ^lory: I exposed my head to many things, outwardly all. You could ^ay the
Lords Prayer, and there^ call him Father. Hypocriti^ally I was wont to enquire
of Ma^ter Mason, what was meant by ^bba-father; rather in curiosity, ^hen truly
to be edified. God will ^ive a good issue. Never, I ^ave no sense. We will pray
^ith you. Do not dishonor ^od. It is well that you will ^ot have God
dishonored: ^ere he sticked, saying, I pray ^ouble me not with distinctions.
after came one, who with ve^ement action of body, pres^d and urged him to trust
in ^od. I cannot (said he) I can^^t, he will not have me saved, ^s sentence is
passed. Do ^ou desire to be saved? ^o. Do you desire to desire? ^o. Would you
be damned? No. Look at the sins of ot^^ men as great as yours, and (...) they
are saved. They were good a godly, they found grace: here is (...) difference,
my sins are horribl^ he repeated that toward (...) Scholars. All of us know
y^^ took pains. Outwardly y^^ did your best. No. I see no^ what it is, you
strictly look ba^ to your own actions, as a Ju^^ciary, who will none of Go^
mercy, and now he has jus^ met with you, your judgem^^ is just. These words
affec^ him strangely: another will him to look to it, it seemed n^ Popery. Do
you hope to (...) justified by your merits? I f^^ to be damned for my sins.
T^ other asked, whether he cou^^ say, Amen? No. Have y^^ no tongue? What is
that to (...) purpose? Name Jesus, I can^ (...) I had your tongue in my hand,
(...) would make you speak. Turn^^g his speech to a friend present, ^^h (says
he) if you did but feel my ^^eif but an hour, you would have ^^mpassion. The
other reply^d, If you were in the fire you ^ould wish to get out. I had ra^^er
be in the fire then here. I will ^ay for you. Sin not. Let ^e fault be mine.

Although my purpose was ^rely to relate the passages of ^is gracious man's
visitation, and (...) refer to your spiritual eye that you could tracke and
find ^erein, yet let your gentle con^uction withhold from me the (...) served
censure of bold blind^^s, in that now and then I point (...) some things which
your ^ick sight may sooner or bet^^ apprehend. The Devils ma^ious policy was
great toward him, in that he assaulted h^ most strongly in that, whi^ might and
ought to have be^ his greatest comfort. Again, saw that the opinion of the
Ph^sician helps somewhat in bod^ maladies or diseases, whereas (...) that his
estate, his soul remai^ed as it were incapable of comfort from the souls
Physicia^ He much respected some fe^^ He dolefully poured out his so in the
bosom of a well will on this manner; I took upon (...) too proudly many
things, and be^^ negligent, performed nothing: c^sed be the day when I took
Schol^ If I had not taken them, I had b^^ happy; with a great flourish I w^
stirring many ways, and in (...) mean space left the essence of (...) calling,
teaching Scholars. Wh^^ says the other, what shall I n^ do, when I see you
thus tosse^ W^ll, for I was an Hypocrite, and ^^w therefore there is no hope of
^mfort for me in Gods presence: have no sense of it. The sun (...) in the
firmament, though it ^ay be hid in a cloud. This ^mparison agrees not to me.
What ^^en would you counsel me to ^e? Abide within the bounds of ^ur calling:
take not too much on ^u, and the Lord will bless you. ^ill it avail me to hear
sermons. ^es, if you mean to be saved. What ^ood shall I reap thence? No^ing
from the bare hearing. oh, ^is heavy lumpish fear has oft^mes shaken me, and
now it has ^oken out. Another said, you ^ow the poor in spirit are bles^d. I
am not such. You see you ^e empty of all good, you feel ^ur burden. I pray you
go your ^ayes. He turned his head aside, ^d stopped his ears: what though you
have done but lit^ good, if you have but give^ cup of cold water, etc. He
thr^ed him away with his foot, ^ther (as some thought) be^ troubled with his
shrill voi^ or (as he replied) through (...) Devils subtilty. That even he was
grievously afflicted Sudenly he brake out; Oh if Go^ The standers by
endeavored cherish this good motion, and s^ to him, He will give you gra^^ I
doubt it. Then presently ^ter he uttered this prayer, God, give me a spark of
grace, (...) enlarge my heart that it may app^^hend it. He asked a friend, h^
he might give satisfaction (...) some speeches.

Mr Dod, although he depa^ed on Saturday, and had the an unseasonable journey,
(...) being requested by letters, ^rned on Tuesday following. ^e at the first
sight started up, as ^esirous to meet him, Oh Mr Dod, ^d in friendly sort
complained, have no grace. I will not (says ^r Dod) believe every one that
^ith he has grace, nor every ^he that says he has none: An^wer the Devil as
Christ did. A ^an must not always be led by ^nse; Let us enquire by the
ef^^cts, and it may suffice, if we can ^^nde but one, yea the least it is
^ough. You forgive your e^emies, and love them, and ^ould do them no hurt if
you buld? Yes. Then your sins ^e forgiven. An Hypocrite ^ay give alms and
fast, but this ^e cannot. That is a small matter. think it to be a great one,
yea, ^^ch an one that I had need to ^ay for; That is put for a rea^^n in the
Lords Prayer, and if Christ had thought any mo^ forcible, he would have giv^
it. Sir, that is true, but in the that are elected. Do not y^ put an
exception, where G^ has not. I would not hand you as I do, but that I kno^
your estate: I come hither cherish you, you love your go^ friends? I cannot.
Had you r^ther that bad or good men shou^ be with you? Good. Yet y^ say, you
do not love them: (...) sow will be with swine: There (...) no fellowship
between light a^ darkness. Would you belie^ your self, or the Physician touc^ing
the estate of your body? T^ Physician. Believe not your s^ then, now you are
sick, yet sh^^ be restored. It is impossible. Wh^ so? If you had sinned so mu^
as you could, you could n^ have sinned so much as Ada^ yet he is in Heaven. It
repented ^m. Does it not you? No. Does ^our sickness or sin more trou^^e you,
or had you rather ^^ve grace, or health? Grace. Well then. But it cannot be.
^od will wash you. I have (...) water. God will bring it ^ith him. He has
denied it. ^e has offered it by his Mi^^sters, which are as the buc^ets to
draw and pour it. ^ou must not look now that ^od should come to y^^ him^^lf.
Do you think it a small ^vour of God that so many ^ood friends come to you?
^od did send none to comfort ^ain or Ahithophel. Think of that ^^ying of
Manoahs wife, If the lord would kill us, he would not ^ave showed us all these
things, ^^dg. 13.23. Behold the proper^^es of Christ's sheep: They are 1. Weak,
2. Sick, 3. Brok^^ 4. Driven away, 5. Lost, EZ^^ 34.4. You are such, see

you ask me, h^ may I? it follows, Believe (...) Prophets, and you shall

^his happens to you, because ^^u credit the suggestion of ^rnall reason, and
not the word ^ther. Oh the cunning of ^e adversary! deal not with ^m by
cunning, but hold him to ^e Word, seek for strength in ^od to resist him. You

says, Is any man ^ck, etc. afflictions further pray^^, but most sicknesses
hinder: therefore behold your friends, those minds as the Lord has ^irred up
to pray for you: so will he also stir up himself to he^^ them. Their prayers
are your^ yea, you have the prayers of many which never knew you. A^^ as God
said to Cain, sin lyet^ at the door, ready as it were (...) do him an ill
turn: so his pr^mised blessing does as it we^ expect you. If your salvation
were now in your own hand^ it is likely you would yield u^ all: but your name
is written i^ the heart of Christ. Sir, let m^ watch with you this night. N^
Why? because it would hu^ you. He (fearing the conclus^on) said, Here is a
snatching a^gument: nay rather, I will not su^fer you, because you would
trouble m^ In the morning M. Dod came ^gain to him, and asking hi^ how he did,
he answered, wretc^edly, lamentably, abhominably no stamp of grace in me. Do
yo^ desire to be eased? Infinitely. Oh if God would give me a drop: I was so
foolish that I would always be doing something, but did nothing well. I pray
you tell me what was the calling of the good thief upon the cross? Do not you
think that God can put a distinction between his grace and our corruptions?
Behold the Church sometimes helples and hopeles, and Jonah in that his bed, God
sees you, though you see not him. But I feel horror. Where misery is, there
is grace much more: Then especially appears the excellency of the Physician,
when health is least hoped. The Devil does abuse your mind and tongue against
your self: but doubt not, the Lord will cast down the strong holds of carnal
reason. Only do not suppress that grace of God, which although it appears
but small as big as a man's hand, ye^ it shall be increased into a^ mighty rain,
by which your dry soul shall be moistened. Christ rising again, did first
appea^ to Mary Magdalen that sinner^ after commanded her to tel^ it first to
Peter, which ha^ denied him. See thence hi^ mercy. The godly in their
afflictions do but forget their comforts; God helps their memory, helps all.
The godly losing his sense o^ Gods favor, is like to (...) man that has lost
his purse^ which if he could find, h^ were rich enough. But the wicked cannot
be brought t^ remembrance, because they never knew it. Thus he suffered him to
rest a while, afterward returning with others, prayed. Then he was asked, how
he did. Miserably. Do not you search into the secrets of God. It is too true
and manifest. Sir, do not always be digging in at your sins. A wound
continually rubbed cannot be cured. Suffer the plasters of the Word of God to
rest upon it, that it may be helped. Oh, if I had! Oh, if it would please God!
I had rather then any thing in this or other three thousand worlds. Who now
gives this desire unto you? Of our selves we cannot think a good thought: God
gives both the will and the deed. A desire is a sure token. But I cannot truly
desire. You do not desire falsely, therefore: truly what do you dissemble?
Here is a trick. You must needs distinguish between unperfect desire and
hypocritical. Will you know whether your desire be true? There are two signs
thereof* Constancy, and a conscionable using of the means: You have found these
in you, does this argument hold? You do not feel, therefore you have it not? I
know when you would have denied such an argument: If that did follow, it should
fare well with the Reprobate, he has no sens^ of the wrath of God, therefore
he is not under it. Elizabeth said, Whence is it tha^ the mother of the Lord
should come unto me? surely from their Christian heart. Truly I could hardly
have come to you, but that I thought I was bound in conscience, because I know
you to be the servant of the Lord: When you were well, if we should have come
with proofs out of the Word of the Lord, you would have believed us. Yes. Why
not now when your judgment is blinded? Oh, the judgment of God! Call it as ^e
calls it, Corrections. Oh, any insensible heart! Oh, dead! A dead man cannot
perceive himself dead, and God quick^eth the dead. Oh, if he would ^nlarge my
heart! This desire ^s good; But it is without sa^our. God in mercy will ^eild
you a comfortable rel^ish: Consider I pray you; ^hereas man may object, The
Lord is strong and terrible. It follows, Merciful withal. But I am backward
in seeking it. He is gracious, more forward then thou can be backward: but I
have provoked. Him; he is slow to anger: but my sins are great but he is
abundant in goodness and in truth. The Lord has promised that he on hi^ part
will be our God, an^ we on our part shall be his people. For a while he
commended him to God: shortly after returning, he prayed with him Cast your
burden upon God He has rejected me. Who mad^ you his counselor? Secre^
things belong unto God, bu^ revealed things unto us: will you make Almanackes?
He dot^ manifest it: Oh mine abominabl^ bringing up of youth! he witha^ groaned
most deeply. If you had done as well as the justest man, you should stand in
need of the merits of Christ. I, or another may bring arguments, but it belongs
to the Lord to fasten them on the heart. I say to you as Noah did to Japhet,
God persuade Japhet, etc. What if your sins were as crimson, God can make
them as snow. That is true of those that are capable. Behold, we make your
estate our own, we have part in your sorrow: who has thus (think you) disposed
our hearts? God. And do you think that he which causes us to love you, does
not love you himself? I fear I did too much glory in matters of private service
to God. The nearer we come to God, the more we see our own vileness. This is
the use which I make of it, blessed be God which has not put our estate in our
own hands, but kept it in his. The Devil has now winnowed you and you think
all is gone out, bu^ God holds what is his. A^^ Artificer can distinguish
dross^ from the metal, cannot God his from yours? Well, with Jo^ lay your hand
on your mouth and hold your peace, and so goo^ rest have you: Only conside^
your comfort, though it be bu^ small, whence it came, even from Gods Word and
servants, no otherwise.

M. Dod.
When he returned again t^ take and give farewell, he began to complain: Oh,
great an^ grievous! The Lord knowet^ what power he has given you A father will
put a greater bu^ then upon a stronger son. Bu^ see the difference. When a
earthly father or master sets his on work, they must do it with their own
strength; but the Lord sets on work, and gives strength to be not
discouraged. You are now in your calling: Oh, mine heart is miserable! What
then? A father loves his son as well when he is sleeping, as when he is
waking. Sir, I have known you heretofore, and although, if I were in your case,
I might do as you do, yet I remain the servant of God, as you certainly are.
The Holy Ghost calls to your remembrance what you have heretofore taught, and
now heard: And although I shall be absent in body, yet shall I be present in
mind. Be not too covetous to seek abundance by and by. If Jacob could say to
Esau, I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, much more
should you think so of the children of God that come to you. I thank God (says
he) he has begun to ease me. He will in his good time. God grant. Thus he took
his last farewell. Although we depart from our friends in the way, yet we
shall meet at the end. One told Master Dod that he had uttered such words. Now
the Lord has made me a spectacle. Whereupon he counseled one that attended on
him, to be sparing in admitting comers in, or speakers, lest his brain should
be too much heated. A friend of his coming to him, asked him, Dare you murmr
and repine against God? Why should I so? God be blessed. It is a sign of
grace. But I have no means. You have had them offered. But not given with
effect. They shall, I doubt not. God grant: but I do not feel it.

He received a letter from a friend very respective, M. Bolton.
and much respected of them both: wherein were written these very words: I
heard, I know not how true, that our dear Christian friend Mr Peacock is in
great danger: which has much greived and afflicted my heart, and vvrung from
me very bitter tears. If his extremities be such, his tentations are very like
to be sore. Tell him from me (as one who did ever, with dearest intimatenes
know and converse with him) that I can assure him in the word of life and
truth, from a most just and holy God, whose Minister I am, That he is
undoubtedly one of his Saints, designed for immortality, and those endless joys
in another world. When it was read to him; at those words I can assure him,
etc. (he said) Oh, take heed, take heed, do you think he would or durst
assure you, unles he knew on what grounds? I did deceive my self, now God has
revealed more. Another time one requested him, that he would make his friends
partakers of the least comfort that the Lord bestovved upon him, as they had
been partakers of his grief. If I had it, I would willingly communicate it.
Search and take notice of the least. How should I have any, since God denies
the means? do you think sense is a fruit of faith? Yes, at this season,
although the husbandman has sown much, yet he sees nothing above ground.
Applications do not prove, hold your peace, my heart is broken. Then the
promise is yours. I would gladly ask you one thing, Now you will ask twenty.
Do you seek for grace in your heart? I cannot. How then can you know whether
it be there or no? It is dead. The Lord in whose hand the disposing thereof is,
dispose it for your good and his glory. I thank you. What do you think of that
place, Whose sins you remit, they are remitted, etc. You know how far they
may go. Howsoever, Sir, the bargain is not now to be made between God and you.
Shortly after came one whom he much esteemed. Oh I love (said he) your company,
for the graces in you, and much more to the same purpose. Suddenly he brake
out into this ejaculation, Oh God, reconcile me unto thee, that I may taste one
dram of thy grace, by which my miserable soul may receive comfort. One
secretly willed that man to desire him to repeat it again. Do not trouble me
with repetitions. There being a sermon, he bade them about him go thither.
After he called one, and asked him whether the preacher (being acquainted with
his course of preaching) did use his accustomed divisions. He told one, Satan
had borne him in hand, and had deluded him: to who^ the other answered, I hope
that God will restore you as before, to glorify him here. No. No. Yea, if you
were weaker, I would hope notwithstanding. I desire nothing more. God be
thanked, you have labored carefully for his glory. I would labor after
another fashion. In the night he prayed and repeated his belief. And after
resting a while, he called those that watched with him, Bear witness, I said
not, I believe, but in general, and as desiring that I might believe. One
coming to visit him, asked him, How is it with you? My mind was grievously
puZZled with sundry distractions this night, but now I feel my burden more
light, I thank God. He was put in mind of that place, Isa. 54.8, 11, 12, etc.
Oh thou afflicted and tossed with tempests, and not comforted; behold, I will
lay thy stones with fair colors, and thy foundations with Saphyrs; And I will
make thy windows of Agates, and thy gates of Carbuncles: and all thy borders
of pleasant stones, etc. For a little while I hid my self from thee, but with
everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee. He lifted up his eyes: thereupon
being asked what the Lord did say to his soul, that had long refused comfort?
Take heed, be not to^ bold, look to the foundation. And then prayed. Lord grant
m^ the comfort of thy deliverance, and forgive me my foolishnes, that I may
praise thy name. Then he complained of his idle speeches. Upon the Sabbath day
one came to him, willing him to put his hand to a note of certain debts. This
is not a day for that. We will go to Sermon. God spee^ you. Now you cannot go
to Church to serve the Lord, I pray him to come to you. Amen. He hardly
suffered any to stay with him. At evening one did read something to him in
Master Downams warfare, and asked him, do you think it to be true? Yes.
Therefore you must not trust your sense: What not such as mine are? But I will
not now dispute. When they were helping him up and putting on his clothes;
upon some occasion one said to him to this effect: A child will not much
grieve at the laying aside of an old coat, when he has anew made, When you
shall put on that, there shall be no longer nakedness, the resurrection will
amend all. To those that die in the Lord. No doubt you will dye in him, having
lived in him. I have answered you before. But I would not believe you in that
case. The next day a friend of his being to go forth of town, asked him,
whether he would have any thing with him, for he was to leave him, and knew not
whether ever he should see him again here. Look to your calling, that it be as
well inward as outward. He counseled another; To be stirring for the glory of
God. To one standing by, he said. (...) am thinking. What? On a for^ to get
grace. Put your trust in God. So I do. I omit how, and tell you that with
great patience* he continually submitted himself to advise in any means for his
good: In putting his temporal estate in order; he deal^ mercifully with his
poorest debtors, yea, with some which might well pay it. His worthy patro^ (for
so he often called him) whom for honors sake I name, Sir Robert Harley, sent
his man to him with some aurum potabile, together with a book which a Doctor
had made in the praise thereof. Coming to him, and asking him how he did, Oh
(said he) if it would please God that I might live with him. Anon after he said
to one, I have been thinking of arguments by which I might plead my cause with
God, and I ^ave found: But what if dying thus, (...) should be judged an
Apostata? Man is not the Judge at whose Tribunal you must stand or fall. There
came in many of our chief Fellows. One of them request^d him to make
confession of his ^aith willingly. But I would ^hink of it first. Musing
awhile, ^e called them. Truly my heart and soul have been far lead, and
deeply troubled with tentations and stings of conscience: but I thank God they
are eased in good measure: Wherefore I desire that I be not branded with the
note of a forlorn or Reprobate: Such questions, oppositions, and all tending
thereto, I renounce: Now help me, and put me in mind. What do you think of
your former doctrine? Most true: In it I have lived, and will dye; I have not
dealt hypocritically in it. Are you willing to die? Truly I will tell you: my
Patron who of late sent me potable gold, has taken order that I might live
with him contentedly in the Ministry: but I submit my self to the will of God.
Do you desire the glory of God, and the salvation of your brethren? Most: Help
my memory, what more? Do you forgive all wrongs? Yes, and desire that mine may
be: And now I thank you. Sir, I remember a thing wantonly done toward you,
pointing at one present. You sent me a knife for a new-years-gift; and I tied
two verses to it, and sent it back: I pray pardon me if any thing -- For mine
unconsiderate speeches in the time of my tentations, I heartily and humbly ask
forgivenes. You did then (says one) seem to rely somewhat upon inherent
righteousness, as if you sought in your self whereby you should be saved: Indeed
we knew your conversation to be unreproveable: No I dare not affirm it: I trust
in nothing but in the name of Jesus. Have you any certainty in him? I would not
be pressed to a particular assurance in this grievous agony. We desire you to
inform them that shall come unto you of your estate. My unability is great:
They then prayed, 1. Giving God thanks, that whereas before they had craved his
mercy for his servant, he had heard them, and manifested to his glory, how he
never forsakes his: And besought him, because he knew the malice of the enemy,
to perfect his good work, and not suffer him to be tempted above his strength.
Now, Sir, we tell yo^ one thing to your comfort, W^ never heard you speak any
thing against God or man, thorow^ out the time of your visitation^ but wholly
against your self I have been bold thus to argue wit^ God, If he has showed
mercy t^ such and such, why should not (...) likewise have hope? He complained
once, how, while h^ was visiting the sick, (In which work many poor souls foun^
the ready mercifulnes of hi^ heart, and now feel a great want) he lighted upon
doubts; which that he might more fully satisfy, when the like might be moved,
he studied too earnestly. One brought him a note book which he had lent
(Always willing to communicate what he had most private) Here is a book (said
he) of great pains, etc. To a stranger, a worthy gentleman that came to visit
him, he said, The Lord is merciful to me, and I have cause of rejoicing, etc.
Afterward a reverend Governor came to him, Dr A^ery.
to whom he complained of his sin and misery. You look not (said he) for any
thing in your self. No, for nothing. You would amend if you had space. Oh if I
had -- Certainly -- Think on this. As the Lord has heard the ejaculations and
groans of your spirit in your infirmity, so he will now. If he will be
glorified by your life, you shall live; Submit your self to him, let him choose
for you. My faith is weak. All, you know, are here but in part, you desire
notwithstanding to run to that which is perfect: So you may see how low many
have been brought, some (said he) have been Idolatours, was not Manasses such
an one? Yes. And behold Gods servants from the beginning of the Bible to the
end, they have slipped. Lot had shrewd slips, but yet here the testimony of the
Apostle of him; he was just and righteous. You have been wearied and heavy
laden. Yes. For such is the end of Christ's coming: your desire is a token of
favor: For by how much the nearer we come, the more we thirst. Think now on
his loving kindness; he has begun, and he will finish whom you have served. I
did endeavor, but vile imperfections, etc. It is our greatest perfection here,
to see our imperfections. Shortly after came to him many young Gentlemen, to
whom he said, Live in Gods fear, that you may die in his favor: Otherwise the
Ox and the Ass will condemn you; I spent my time foolishly and prodigally.
You have (said one) remembered that sufficiently; Remember also Christ. That is
true, Christ is to be remembered, and our sins to be remembered also.

The night following, which was Wednesday night, the Sun of Righteousness spread
gracious beams at his setting, which were comfortable tokens of a glorious
rising. His last swanlike song, as he uttered it, was penned by some as he
uttered it. One comforting him by his bead-side some two hours or more before
his death, he brake out into these speeches; Quid ^e salute mea sentiam
expectatis ^t explicarem: usque adeo indulget Deus ijs quos semel dilexerit, ut
eos nunquam deserat, atque ideo me in coelos transiturum pro certo habeo:
Felicissima sunt ea vincula in quae me conjecit Deus benignissimus; You all
expect that I should declare what I think of my own salvation: God is so
indulgent to those whom he has ever loved, that he never forsakes them, and
therefore I am assured I shall go to Heaven: Most happy are those fetters into
which I was cast by a most merciful God. One telling him, You have fought a
good fight, etc. he said, Expetit, expedit ut contendam ad coelum; Tollite,
Tollite, Eripite, Eripite, ut coelum adeam: Deus indulget ingenuitati bonorum.
It is requisite, it is requisite that I should contend for Heaven: Take me up,
take me up, carry me hence, carry me hence, that I may go to Heaven; God does
cherish the ingenuity of the good. Being put in mind of Gods mercy toward
him, he made answer: Oh, the sea is not so full of water, nor the Sun of
light, as God is of goodness, his mercy is ten thousand times more. Being
likewise remembered of Gods goodness toward him, in filling his heart with such
comforts, after so great tentations, he said: I do (God be praised) feel such
comfort from that: What shall I call it? Agony, says one, Nay, that is too
little: That had I five hundred worlds, I could not not make satisfaction for
such an issue. Being moved to lift up his heart in token of thankfulness unto
his God, he uttered these words: What, shall I extol the magnificence of God,
which is unspeakeable, and more then any heart can conceive? Nay rather let us
with humble reverence acknowledge his great mercy: What great cause have I to
magnify the great goodness of God, that has humbled, nay rather exalted such a
wretched miscreant of so base condition to an estate so glorious and stately!
The Lord has honored me with his goodness: I am sure he has provided a
glorious Kingdom for me. The joy that I feel in my heart is uncredible. He made
likewise protestation of that which he always before taught against
justification by inherent righteousness, and appealing to the knowledge of some
there present, what he continually maintained, in that (says he) I still
remain a Protestant. After three chapters read to him, Revel. 19. Revel. 21.
Romans 8. Oh, (says he) They be glorious comforts: Will you have any more read?
Yea, a Psalm, if you please, and named the 23. One beginning to read it, he
desired that it might be sung: One asking him, Will you sing? Yea, said he, as
well as I can. The Psalm being sung, afterward the 17. of John was read unto
him: One comforting him by applying to him that in particular, which Christ in
general performed for the good of the faithful, he said, Blessed be God, very
often, I am a thousand times happy to have such felicity thrown upon me, a poor
wretched miscreant. After a little rest, Lord Jesus (said he) unto thy hands:
Lord receive my soul, Lord lift thou up ^he light of thy countenance upon me,
and be merciful unto me. Then very weak he repeated the Lords prayer twice,
and his Belief once very plainly, and distinctly with a strong voice, to the
great admiration of the hearers: so he slept in the Lord.

December 4. Anno 1611.
The Postscript to the READER.
THis copy of M. Boltons, and intended by him for the press, was by M. Edward
Bagshaw (overseer of M. Boltons Will, and specially entrusted for the printing
of it) delivered about nine years since to M. George Miller, Printer of M.
Boltons works, to be by him printed, as he had done his other books, M. Miller
carried it to the Licenser, who kept it long in his hands, and at last refused
it, as too precise for those times: while it was in the Licensers hands, one M.
Milburne of intimate acquaintance with him, got a copy of it, and printed it
about five years since: but upon examination, the transcribed copy was found
imperfect, and by that means the book proved unsaleable. When this present copy
was almost printed, M. Miller had notice of such a book, and not before. This
is thought fit to be made known, that the Reader might understand that this
present copy is the only true approved copy, and Licensed by an eminent Divine
of the Assembly, as a fit and useful book for these present times.
