Children after the rate of 24 in a year,
That's 2. every month as plain does appear,
Let no man at this strange story wonder.
It goes to the tune, of Over and Under.



THere was a country gallant,
that wasted had his tallent,
Not dreading what would fall out,
would needs a wooing ride;
Unto a less of the city,
that courteous was and pretty,
This damsel neat and witty;
he would go make his Bride:
This less she had of wealth good store,
her stock was threscore pound and more,
Though some supposed her to be poor,
the same has late been tried.
Rock the Cradle, rock the Cradle,
rock the cradle John,
There Is many a man rocks the cradle,
when the child's none of his own.
Unto this less, incontinent,
the young man went with good intent,
His love was fixed and firmly bent,
to take her to his wife:
Quoth he my sweet, while life does last,
my heart is in thy bosom placed,
Let not my suit be now disgraced,
I Will love thee as my life:
Said she your suit I must deny,
for I have vowed a maid to dye,
If I lose my virginity,
it sure will breed much strife.
Rock the cradle, etc.
I have been wooed by Harry,
but I indeed will tarry,
I never mean to marry,
while I on earth remain:
Sweet William and young Thomas too,
and Richard has made much ado,
And Ned with tears did often we,
but Humphry did complain,
All these brane gallants I forsake,
I prithee John no more words make,
But to some other course betake,
I do thy suit disdain:
Go rock the cradle, etc.
The man no whit dismayed,
at that which she had said.
But with his sweet heart stayed,
and did request her still:
He did entreat her favor,
it was all that he did crave her,
That he might only have her,
his fancy to fulfill:
My heart does fry in Cupids fire,
thy beauty I do much admire,
Then yield my love to my desire,
or else a man you kill:
Rock the cradle, etc.
When she her self did understand,
she had a fool caught by the hand,
Her ship she knew was soundly maned,
her belly wondrous round:
Thought she this is a friend of mine,
its best make hay while sun does shine,
Yet to some thing I will him join,
before my fault be found,
Said she if I be made thy wife,
thou must me humor all thy life,
And careful be for fear of strife.
like to a prentise bound.
Rock the cradle, etc.
The second part.
To the same tune.
IN the morning if I thee desire,
thou must rise up and make a fire,
And other things I shall require,
which thou must undertake:
My breakefast thou must dress also,
that I from bed to it may go,
All these hard tasks and many more,
thou must not then forsake,
To brush my gown and set my band,
make clean my shoes at my command,
Thy business thou must understand,
if I the word but speak.
Rock the cradle, etc.
And when we chance to have a child,
thou must like to a father mild,
Unto the same be reconciled,
and dance it on thy knee:
Or if the infant cry for pap,
thou then must take it in thy lap,
And feed it well what ever hap,
if John will marry me:
Thou must take pains as thou art able,
to make the bed and serve at table,
And lay the young one in the cradle,
whilst I sing merrily.
Rock the cradle, etc.
Sweet heart quoth he to please thee,
I Will do all things to ease thee,
I will not once disease thee,
nor yet my love offend thee,
My hands under your feet I Will lay,
the wind shall not my love annoy,
S^e thou will be mine only joy,
I Will love the to the end,
I Will make the bed the house i will sweep,
and lull thee baby fast asleep,
What you command my self will keep,
and will my humor bend:
Rock the cradle, etc.
To this they both agreed,
and married were with speed,
For she had wondrous need,
as you shall hear hereafter:
The same day month that they were wedde
the married man was finely spedde,
His wife was safely brought to bed,
and had both son and daughter,
Which by the midwife in was brought,
quoth she you have a strange thing wroght
Two children in a month begot,
and so took up a laughter.
Rock the cradle, rock the cradle,
rock the cradle John,
Said he the children I will rock,
for why they be mine own.
He kissed the girl and loved the boy,
said he you are your fathers Joy,
There Is many are in great annoy,
because they have no child:
I knew a Lord and Lady fair,
that did desire to have an heir,
Now I my self have got a pair,
and they are both beguild,
My wife is fruitful now I see,
and will some great increase bring me,
They are your own assuredly,
then said the midwife mild,
Rock the cradle, etc.
See here the boy is like the dad,
which well may make your heart full glad
Cheer up your self and be not sad,
for that which here is done:
His ruby lips do plain disclose,
his cherry cheeks and dads own nose,
For twenty pound, I will not lose,
quoth he my little son:
So well content this fool was found,
he leapt for joy above the ground,
Did sorrows shall quoth he be dround,
since new are fresh begun:
Rock the cradle, Iog the cradle,
thus I Will have it known,
I love to rock the cradle,
the children be mine own.
Al you which now have heard this dittie,
take heed with wives how you do fit ye
For if you came to London city,
you quickly may be sped
As here you see this country Lad,
within one Month was made a Dad
Though he but little share int had,
his wife was brought to bed,
And now this simple woodkocke,
the cradle is constrained to rock,
His neighbors does deride and mock,
cause he is so bestead,
They shoute and cry, and to him say,
still the Children John,
It Is enough to make the man,
to think they be none of his own.
