TO THE RIGHT HONOrable, ARTHVRE Lord CHICHESTER, Baron of BELFAST, Lord high
Treasurer of Jreland, and one of his Majesty's most Honorable Privy Counsel,
of that KINGDOM.
Right Honorable:
BEing to expose these my unworthy Labors to public view, and universal
censure, I was imboldened in a double respect to become so humbly-ambitious, as
to desire that they may take sanctuary under your Honors all-pleasing name and
safest patronage; First, because they were solely intended for your Honors
private recreation, after your tedious employments in the affairs of the
commonwealth, being then his Majesty's most worthy Deputy, and swaying the
sword and scepter of authority amongst us, in this kingdom of Ireland; And as
your Honor has been pleased to vouchsafe unto them your private applause,
and thereby to occasion me for more variety to enlarge them to this number: So
I am bold to father them upon your Honor, not doubting but as in your
allowance of them, I made use of your goodness, so in your protection of them,
I may make use of your greatness. Secondly, it is not the least of your Honors
favors conferred upon me, to grace me with your Honorable service, and to
call me to a more immediate dependency upon your Lordship, and therefore to
avoid the black note of ingratitude, I held it my duty there to lay down my
work, where I owe my service, and to desire to be no longer known, then I may
be known with that relation I have to your Honor; that so I might leave a
perpetual testimony unto the world of your Honors favors unto me; of my
affectionate desire, in some weak measure, to express my thankfulness to
your Honor. If I have herein given content to these curious and hard-pleased
times, the thanks belongs to your Honor, whose encouragements were my motives
with greediness to undertake this task, with constancy to go through it,
with resolution to publish it, to the censorious ear of the world. If I have
come short of popular expectation, my hope is, that my mention of your
Honorable name will procure pardon for a greater offense. And thus wishing unto
your Honor a continual Harmony, composed of a comfortable delight of body,
goods, and good name, with a daily increase of Honor, I humbly take leave,
craving pardon for this boldness, and desiring always to be accounted

Your Honors to be commanded in the best of his services THOMAS BATESON.

Treasurer of Jreland, and one of his Majesty's most Honorable Privy Counsel,

Right Honorable:
BEing to expose these my unworthy Labors to public view, and universal
censure, I was imboldened in a double respect to become so humbly-ambitious, as
to desire that they may take sanctuary under your Honors all pleasing name and
safest patronage; First, because they were solely intended for your Honors
private recreation, after your tedious employments in the affairs of the
commonwealth, being then his Majesty's most worthy Deputy, and swaying the
sword and scepter of authority amongst us, in this kingdom of Ireland; And as
your Honor has been pleased to vouchsafe unto them your private applause,
and thereby to occasion me for more variety to enlarge them to this number: So
I am bold to father them upon your Honor, not doubting but as in your
allowance of them, I made use of your goodness; so in your protection of them,
I may make use of your greatness. Secondly, it is not the least of your Honors
favors conferred upon me, to grace me with your Honorable service, and to
call me to a more immediate dependency upon your Lordship, and therefore to
avoid the black note of ingratitude, I held it my duty there to lay down my
work, where I owe my service, and to desire to be no longer known, then I may
be known with that relation I have to your Honor; that so I might leave a
perpetual testimony unto the world of your Honors favors unto me; of my
affectionate desire, in some weak measure, to express my thankfulness to
your Honor. If I have herein given content to these curious and hard-pleased
times, the thanks belongs to your Honor, whose encouragements were my motives
with greediness to undertake this task, with constancy to go through it,
with resolution to publish it, to the censorious ear of the world. If I have
come short of popular expectation, my hope is, that my mention of your
Honorable name will procure pardon for a greater offense. And thus wishing unto
your Honor a continual Harmony, composed of a comfortable delight of body,
goods, and good name, with a daily increase of Honor, I humbly take leave,
craving pardon for this boldness, and desiring always to be accounted

Your Honors to be commanded in the best of his services THOMAS BATESON.
