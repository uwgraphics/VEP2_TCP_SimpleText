depiction of monkey and cat playing cards I Will trump that sir



Puss my aple against thy mouse jle lay
The gam's mine jf thast never a trump to play
Mister apes face thart deceiud in me
I have many trumps hers one do see
For a pint of wine the drawer call
I come o prittie do you see this squall
Apes and Catts to play at Cards are fit
Men and women ought to have more wit
