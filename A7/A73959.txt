By the King.
WHereas in the Parliament holden in the seven and twentieth year of the Reign
of our most noble Progenitor Edward the third late King of England, It is
enacted, and ordained amongst other things, That all Woolpackers, and Winders
of Woolls should besworne, and take a corporal oath before the Mayor of the
Staple for the time being, truly and justly to Wind and pack all the Woolls
within the Realm; By force of which Statute the fellowship of Woolwinders,
otherwise called Woollmen, are bound justly and truly to wind and pack all
such Wools, as they meddle with throughout the Realm, to the public good and
commodity of the whole Realm, By force of which Statute, and by the good
Ordinances made by the said fellowship, the said Woolls have been ever since
justly and truly wound and packed, until now of late diverse and many persons
(contrary to the same Statute) taking upon them to be Woolwinders in many
places of this Realm, neither being sworn, nor expert in winding and folding
of Woolls, of which some be Glouers, Tailers, Weauers, Cordwainers, Barbers,
Husbandmen, and other Artificers, have gone about, and daily do go about
thorowout this Realm in many places, practizing themselves in Winding and
folding of the said Woolls, by the procurement and means of the Owners, and
Breeders of the said Woolls, and do wind up, and deceitfully put into the said
Fleeces of Wool, sand, stones, dust, pitch, tar, clay, iron, lead, double
marks, shorlocks, doung, lambs wool, Clockets, locks, hindershanks, tails,
washlocks, cummer, and many other deceiuable things, not only to the great
stander of this Realm, but to the great loss and prejudice of his Majesty's
Subjects, using the craft and feat of Clothmaking within this Realm, and to
the great abuse and deceit of Merchants, and others, buyers of the same.

For reformation and redress whereof, The Kings most excellent Majesty, by
the advice of his Privy Counsel, straightly charge and commands, That no
manner of person or persons, whatsoever he or they be, at any time hereafter go
about, or take upon him or them to Wind or fold any manner of Woolls in any
Country where Woolls are accustomed to be wrought, had or used, Or in the
Counties of Northampton, Lincoln, Leicester, or Rutland, for any Merchant of
the Staple, Clothier or buyers, before he or they shall be admitted and allowed,
by the Master, and Wardens of the Company and fellowship of the Woolmen of the
City of London, or one of them for the time being, to the intent that he and
they shall be expert, and have knowledge in the said craft or mystery, for the
true Winding and folding of Woolls. And that every person and persons so
allowed and admitted for an able and lawful workman, or workmen in form
aforesaid, shall have a Testimonial or Certificat of his allowance and
admittance, under the Seal of the Mayor of the Staple at Westminster for the
time being; And that none of the said persons so allowed and admitted, or that
shall be so allowed and admitted, shall go about, or take upon him or them, to
Wind or fold any Woolls before he or they have taken a corporal oath before
the said Mayor for the time being, That he or they shall truly and justly
without deceit Wind, or fold all and singular such Wool, or Woolls, as he or
they shall take upon him or them to wind or fold, and shall not commit, use,
or practice any deceit or guile therein, upon pain that every person which
shall take upon him to Wind or fold any manner of Woolls being not admitted
and sworn, as is aforesaid, or which shall commit, use, or practice any deceit
or guile therein against this our Proclamation, or against any the Laws and
Statutes, in that behalf made and provided, shall suffer imprisonment ten
days, and to be set upon the Pillorie in the next Market town, with a Fleece
of Wool hanging about his neck, according to the tenor of a Proclamation
heretofore set forth in the fifth year of the reign of our late deceased
brother of famous memory King Edward the sixth, And of one other Proclamation
set out by our late sister Elizabeth the Queens Majesty deceased, bearing
date the tenth day of August in the fourth year of her reign.

And his Majesty further straightly charge and commands that no Grower,
Breeder, Brogger or gatherer of any Wools in any his Highness Counties where
Woolls are accustomed to be wrought by sworn men, or in the said Counties of
Northampton, Lincoln, Leicester, and Rutland, shall at any time hereafter set
on work any Woolfolder, or Woolwinder, to fold or wind his or their Wool or
Woolls, unless the said Woolfolder, or Woolwinder bring with him or them a
Testimonial, or certificat, under the Seal of the said Mayor of the Staple at
Westminster for the time being: Testifying him or them to be sworn and
admitted for an able workman to fold and wind Woolls in manner and form as
is aforesaid, upon like pain as is above expressed.

And further where by an Act made in the three and twentieth year of the
reign of our most noble Predecessor King Henry the eight of famous memory yet
standing in force, It was enacted that no manner of person do wind or cause to
be wound any Fleece of Wool, not being sufficiently Riuered or washed, ne
wind, or cause to be wound within any Fleece any deceiuable things
particulerly mentioned in the same Act, or any other thing, whereby the Fleece
may be the more waightier, to the deceit and loss of the Buyer, upon pain the
Seller of any such deceitful Woolls, to forfeit for every such Fleece six
pence; His Majesty has been certainly informed, That notwithstanding the said
good Act and Statute, much deceit is used in washing, winding, folding and
packing of Woolls, and that for the most part of unskillful persons, contrary to
the said Act and Statute: His highness therefore minding to have the said
clauses of the said Statute, and all Acts and Statutes touching or in any wise
concerning the avoiding of the said deceits, or made, and provided for the true
and lawful winding, folding, and packing of the said Wools, by expert and
skillful persons, shall be from henceforth duly observed, and put in execution,
and the offenders against the same, to be corrected and punished according to
the effect and true meaning thereof, does straightly charge and command all
and every his Subjects whatsoever, to whom it shall and may appertain, To
observe the true meaning of the said Acts, upon pain of forfaiture of the
penalties therein contained, and as they will avoid his highness further
displeasure. And further his Majesty by the advice aforesaid, straightly
charge and commands all and every Justices of Peace, Majors, Shiriffes,
Bailiffes, and all other his highness Officers and ministers whatsoever, to
whom it may appertain within their several Liberties, and precincts, That they
and every of them cause every such Offender and Offenders, to be punished for
such offense and offenses above mentioned, in such fort as is above limited,
appointed and declared. And that every and whatsoever Justice of Peace, Mayor,
Shiriffe, Bailiffe, or other Officer, do refuse, or do not punish, or cause to
be punished every such person or persons, so to him or them presented,
according to this present Ordinance, his or their faults being duly proved,
shall forfait to the Kings Majesty twenty pounds to be paid into his
Highness Court of Exchequer; And further shall incur his highness
displeasure.

Given at our Manor of East-Greenwich the 18. day of June, in the second
year of our reign of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the seven
and thirtieth.

Majesty. Anno 1604.
