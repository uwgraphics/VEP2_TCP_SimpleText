royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
A Proclamation by His Majesty, requiring the Aid and Assistance of all His
Subjects on the Northside Trent, and within twenty Miles Southward thereof, for
the suppressing of the Rebels, now marching against Him.
WHereas diverse Persons, bearing an inward Hatred and Malice against Our Person
and Government, and ambitious of Rule and places of Preferment and Command,
have raised an Army, and are now traitorously and rebelliously, (though under
the specious pretense of Our Royal Name and Authority, and of the defense of
Our Person and Parliament) marching in Battle Array against Us their Liege
Lord and Sovereign, contrary to their Duty and Allegiance, whereby the common
Peace is like to be wholly destroyed, and this flourishing Kingdom in danger to
perish under the miseries of a Civil War, if the malice and rage of these
persons be not instantly resisted: And as We do, and must rely on Almighty
God (the Protector and Defender of his Anointed) to defend Us, and Our good
People against the malice and pernicious designs of these men, tending to the
utter ruin of Our Person, the true Protestant Religion, the Laws established,
the Property and Liberty of the Subject, and the very being of Parliaments;
So We doubt not but Our good People will in this necessity Contribute unto Us,
with all Alacrity and Cheerfulness, their assistance in their Persons,
Servants and Money, for the suppression of the same Rebellion: And therein We
cannot but with much contentment of heart acknowledge the Love and Affection of
Our Subjects of Our County of York, and diverse other Counties, in their free
and ready assistance of Us; which We shall never forget, and Our Posterity
will, as We Hope, ever remember for their good.

Nevertheless, in this Our extreme necessity, though We have been most
unwilling, We are now enforced for Our most just and necessary defense, again
to call and invite them, and all other Our Subjects, of the true Protestant
Religion, residing on the North side of Trent, or within twenty Miles
Southward thereof, whose hearts God Almighty shall touch with a true sense and
apprehension of Our sufferings, and of the ill use which the Contrivers and
Fomenters of this Rebellion have made of Our Clemency, and desire of Peace,
That according to their Allegiance, and as they tender the safety of Our
Person, the Property of their Estates, their just Liberties, the true
Protestant Religion, and Privileges of Parliament, and indeed the very Being
of Parliaments, they attend Our Person upon Monday, the two and twentieth day
of this instant August, at Our Town of Nottingham, Where, and when We intend to
erect Our Standard Royal, in Our just and necessary Defense, and whence We
resolve to advance forward for the suppression of the said Rebellion, and the
Protection of Our good Subjects amongst them, from the burden of the Slavery
and Insolence, under which they cannot but groan, till they be relieved by Us.

And We likewise call, and invite all Our Subjects, of the true Protestant
Religion, in the remoter parts of this Our Kingdom, to whom notice of this Our
Proclamation cannot so soon arrive, That with all speed possible, as they
tender the forenamed Considerations, they attend Our Person in such place, as
We shall then happen to Encamp; And such of Our said Subjects, as shall come
unto Us (either to Our said Town of Nottingham, or to any other place, where We
shall happen to Encamp) Armed, and Arrayed with Horse, Pistolls, Muskets,
Pikes, Corslets, Horses for Dragoons, or other fitting Arms and Furniture, We
shall take them into Our Pay, (such of them excepted, who shall be willing, as
Volunteers, to serve Us in this Our necessity without Pay.) And whosoever
shall, in this Our Danger and Necessity, supply Us either by Gift, or Loan of
Money, or Plate, for this Our necessary Defense (wherein they also are so
nearly concerned) We shall, as soon as God shall enable Us, repay whatsoever is
so lent, and upon all Occasions Remember, and Reward those Our good Subjects,
according to the measure of their Love and Affections ot Us and their Country.

Given at Our Court at York the twelfth day of August, in the eighteenth year
of Our Reign. 1642.
Imprinted at York by ROBERT BARKER Printer to the Kings most Excellent
MAJESTY: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. MDCXLII.
