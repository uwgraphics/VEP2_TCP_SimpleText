THE CASE Of the LADY WANDESFORD.
THat King Charles the first by his Letters Pattents 4. Car. I. did for a great
and valuable consideration grant unto Dame Mary VVandesford, and William
VVandesford, and their Heirs, all the Land in Hampshire between High and
Low-water-marke, reserving 4. d. per Acre Fee Farm Rent.

That the Inning of the said Lands, and securing them from the Sea, will be a
very great and chargeable undertaking, but being imbanked from the Sea, will be
of great profit and advantage to the Kingdom, whereas now they yield no
benefit to any; not one Blade of Grass growing upon them.

That for the encouragement of those who are to adventure their Money upon so
hazardous a work; the Lady VVandesford has been advised to present a Bill to
this Honorable House, which has been read and committed.

That at the reading of it many clauses in it did appear to be unreasonable,
all which the Committee have expunged.

That there is a Proviso for the saving all Rights, so that nothing is passed
to the Lady VVandesford by this intended Act, if it was not legally granted by
the said Pattent.

And she does humbly pray, that in regard this Bill, if it be passed, cannot be
a prejudice to any person; and if it does not pass, will be her utter undoing,
(having spent her whole Estate upon it) That by the justice of this Honorable
House it may pass.
