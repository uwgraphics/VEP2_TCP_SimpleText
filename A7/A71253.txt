THE DESCRIPTION AND THE PRACTICE Of the four most admirable BEASTS; Explained
in four SERMONS, Upon REVEL. 4.8. Whereof the first three were preached before
the Right Honorable, JAMES Duke of ORMOND, And Lord Lieutenant of IRELAND his
Grace, And the two Houses of Parliament, and others, very Honorable Persons.

By the Right Reverend Father in God, Gr. Lord Bishop of OSSORY.

London, Printed by Tho. Roycroft, for Philemon Stephens, and are to be sold at
the Golden Lion in St. Paul's Churchyard. 1663.

TO THE Most virtuous and the most honorable of Ladies, THE LADY ELIZABETH,
Duchess of ORMOND Her Grace.
Elect Lady,
YOur daily Orator, that formerly has written Books and Epistles to mighty
Kings and most honorable Princes, does now beg leave to dedicate these ensuing
Sermons unto your Graces view. I know many Scholars expecting their preferment,
will not be wanting to express the noble Acts, unparaleld Fidelity, and most
justly deserved Honors and Praises of the thrice honorable your dear Husband,
the Duke of Ormond's Grace; but my age bids me expect my dissolution, and not
worldly promotion: and therefore only challenges that presumption to dedicate
these few Sermons unto your Graces view, not as some others use to do, to beg
for any patronage or defense, for any thing that I have said therein; (for what
is good will justify it self, and what is amiss, let it be justly blamed, I
will never protect it) but to show unto the world how highly I do honor your
Grace, and would needs find out, by what ways I should propagate and
perpetuate your Graces Worth, Piety, and Virtue to the indelible view and
remembrance of all your Offspring, for their glory and the glory of all their
Posterities, for their example throughout all the remainder of these last Ages
of the World: for I believe that I may truly say it, without error, that
neither Gorgonia, nor Trasilla, nor any other of those glorious Stars, that in
their times shined in the Firmament of the Church, and which are registered to
Posterities for their everlasting praise by Saint Nazianzen, Saint Jerome, and
other Fathers of the Church were comparably so blessed in the choicest of the
blessings of this life, Id est, in their Husbands and Children.
nor were they so patient in their afflictions, so pious in their conversation,
so humble and so meek in their demeanor toward the worthiest of Gods
Ministers, as your Grace has always showed your self to be unto all even the
meanest of Gods servants, and especially to me, when in a very mean condition,
I came to wait upon your Grace in Donmore, before the King came into the
Kingdom; and I must pass over your wise, discreet, and most prudent carriage
of great affairs, and in such desperate times, to the benefit and preservation
of many good men and faithful Subjects to his Majesty, in the midst of a
froward, subtle, and perverse Generation, without which they had been utterly
destroyed: And I pass over these things and many other most eminent virtues and
endowments of your Ladyship; because I am not sufficiently able to characterize
and delineate the same, so sweetly and so commendably as your Grace has
showed; to the full measure of your deservings: but though mine ability
reaches not to express your worth, yet this my devotion shall never be wanting
to show my desires with the best of my prayers, and all the faculties of my
soul, to be your Orator unto God, and to make your name and memorial in the
World, like the remembrance of Josias, fair as the Lilly, and sweet as the
precious ointment that is made by the art of the Apothecary: So I rest,

Most honorable Lady Your Graces most faithful Orator and Servant while I am
Gr. Ossory.

TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.
My dear Brother,
MY only aim and desire has always been, to promote the glory of God, the
honor of my King, the benefit of the Church of Christ, and the good of all my
Neighbors: To those ends I have labored, I have preached, I have printed many
books. And the best way, that I conceived to do good unto my Neighbors, was,
to teach them to observe, and never to depart from the society and practice of
Justice, Obedience, and Charity; Justice among themselves, and toward all men;
Obedience to their King, and to all their superior Governors; and Charity or
mercy to the poor and oppressed. These were the main marks I always shot at;
and to further these exercises, I thought my self obliged to do it with all my
might, without either fear or flattery. And therefore let neither Kings,
Princes, nor Magistrates frown at me, when I reprove them, if they be unjust;
for the great men do the more usually, as being the more able, commit the acts
of injustice: and let not the rebellious Subjects, nor the seditious Sectaries
rail at me for painting out the ugly shapes and loathsome visages of their
Treasons and Wickednesses against their Kings and Governors, whom God has set
over them, and commanded them to obey: neither let the rich, covetous, and
wretched worldlings, whose hearts are as hard as stones from yielding any the
least drop of relief unto the poor and needy, and those that are ready to
starve in the streets, blame me, if for these unmerciful cruelties, and cruel
neglect of mercies, I shall thunder out God's judgments, and pour forth the
vials of God's wrath, that are prepared against them; for as Nehemiah said,
when his friends persuaded him to fly away for fear of his enemies, that sought
to destroy him, Is it fit that such a man as I should fly? Neh. 6.11.
So I conceive, it is not fit, that such a man as I, (that am a Bishop, and an
aged man, ready for my dissolution, and no other translation, but to be
translated unto my fathers) should now flatter any person, or be afraid to
speak the truth, or to reprove sins, worthy to be reproved, for fear of the
frowns, threats, or malice of any man. And therefore, as the Poet says, Me,
me, adsum qui feci, in me convertite ferrum. And as I said with Pilat, in the
first Sermon that ever I printed, (...), what I have written, I have written,
Nec poterit abolere vetustas.

Jehovae Liberatori.
The Description and the Practice of the four most admirable Beasts.
REVEL. 4.8. And the four Beasts had each of them six wings about him, and they
were full of eyes within, and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy,
holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.


I Have begun to treat of these words in this place long ago; and let no man
marvel, that I intend by Gods help to prosecute the explication thereof at this
time; because this Text seems to me, like the Ocean sea, so large, that it
cannot be measured, and so deep, that it cannot be fathomed by any humane wit;
the same being omnia in omnibus, all in all: For

First, Here is God the Creator of all things, and all that is knowable or may
be known concerning God, as that ineffable mystery of the Trinity, or three
persons in the one only Essence of the Deity; and therefore appointed to be
read for the Epistle on Trinity Sunday; and all the chiefest Attributes of God,
as

1. His Purity and sanctity in the words (...) three times repeated, to show
the three persons of the Deity, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

2. His Power, authority and dominion, in the word (...) that is set down in
the singular number, to show the Unity of the Godhead.

3. His Wisdom, knowledge and providence, in the word (...), which is derived
(...), because he sees all things, and all things are patent to his eyes, and
attingit a fine usque ad finem, and dispouit omnia suaviter.

4. His Omnipotency, in the word (...), Almighty, quia voluntas ejus potestas
ejus, because he can do whatsoever he would do, he needs but say the word and
it is done.

5. His Eternity, in the words, (...), which crowns all the rest of Gods
Attributes, that otherwise would be of no such value, if it were not for this
Eternity, that makes him to be whatsoever he is for ever.

Secondly, Here are the creatures of God, and the chief of all Gods creatures;
as

1. The Lion, which is the King of all the Beasts of the field.

2. The Calf or the Ox, which is the most painful and most useful creature for
the service of man, and the most acceptable in the sacrifices of God.

3. The Eagle which is the Lord and Master of all the Fowls of the Air; and,

4. Man which is the Prince and Ruler of all those, and of all the Beasts of
the field, the Fowls of the air, the Fishes of the sea, and whatsoever walks
through the paths of the seas.

Thirdly, Here is Religion, and the best of all Religions, the Christian
Religion, most amply, though enigmatically and mystically, set forth unto us;
for,

1. Here is both the natures and the offices of Christ, and the chiefest things
that he did, and that we are to understand and believe for our salvation; they
are all here expressed unto us; as,

1. His divine nature, under the notion of the Eagle and her lofty flight.

2. His humane nature is noted unto us, by him that had the face and appearance
of a man.

And as his natures and the quality of his person are here thus mystically
expressed; so his offices, that he was to discharge, are here likewise in the
same manner, of the Egyptian Hieroglyphics, set forth unto us; as.

1. His Regal and Kingly office, whereby he was to rule and govern his Church,
is here to be understood by the Lion, which is the King of all the Beasts.

2. His Priestly office, whereby he was to teach and to instruct his people,
and to offer sacrifice unto God, to appease his wrath and so to take away the
sin of the world, is here most aptly expressed by the Ox or Calfe, that was
deemed the most acceptable sacrifice, that could be offered unto God: Number. 23.1.
as you may see by the sacrifice of Balaam.

And, as his natures and his offices are here thus to be understood; so the
chiefest things that he was to do, and the chiefest points that we are to
believe, are likewise here fairly expressed under what is signified by these four
Beasts; as, 1. His Incarnation, by him that had the face of a man. 2. His
Passion, by the Ox, or Calf. 3. His Resurrection, by the Lion. 4. His
Ascension, by the flying Eagles.


Fourthly and lastly, not only the foresaid particulars concerning Christ and
these main points of Christian Religion are hereby to be observed, but also all
the whole duty of man, and the chiefest points that every Christian ought to
discharge, if he looks for eternal happiness, are here expressed unto us, under
the qualities, conditions, description, and practice of these Beasts, as
hereafter I shall more fully declare unto you.

And so you see, here is sententia brevis, a short speech, but materia
uberrima, an Ocean of matter to sail over. And do you think that I can pass
through such a world of most weighty points within the compass of one inch of
time, less then one little hour? that cannot be, by a far better head then
mine.

Therefore I must crave leave only to go as far as I can, until I shall have
your Grace and this honorable audience leave to proceed at some other time
unto the rest of these points.

And for our more orderly proceeding at this time, I shall humbly desire you to
observe these three points: 1. The number of these Bests. 2. The description of
these Beasts. 3. The practice of these Beasts.


1. 1. The number of the Feasts sonr^ Genesis 31.7.
For their number, it is said they were four Beasts. And you must remember,
that sometimes a certain number is put for an uncertain, as when Jacob said
unto Laban, Thou have changed my wages ten times; that is, several times. But
here I take this number to be as it is set down, to signify four Beasts, and
neither more nor less.

2. 2. The description of the Beasts.
The description of these Beasts is twofold; 1. Particular and proper to each
one. 2. General and common to them all.


1. 1. The proper and particular description of the Beasts.
Touching their particular description: we are to consider.

1. Who and what they are that are thus expressed by these Beasts.

2. Why each one of them is so expressed, as they are here described unto us.

For the first, Aug. de civit. Dei^l. 8. c. 3.
I may truly say with St. Aug. Alii^atque alii aliud atque aliud opinati sunt,
several men have had their several interpretations of them; and I find four
expositions of them to be most of all respected, 1. Of the Papists. 2. Of the
Puritans. 3. Of some latter Writers of the Protestants. 4. Of the Ancient
Fathers.


1. The Papists, interpreting this vision of the Militant Church, do understand
the same by Heaven; and by the seat that was set therein, they understand the
authority of the Church of Rome: by the Lamb or him that sat on the seat,
their universal Bishop the Pope: and by these four Beasts, they would have us
to understand the 4, Patriarchships, 1. Of Antioch. 2. Of Ephesus. 3. Of
Jerusalem. 4. Of Alexandria.
Which have always had the greatest power and chiefest authority next after the
Church of Rome. And by the 24. Elders, that sat upon the 24. seats, they
understand the six Arch Bishops that were in every Patriarchship, as 1. in
Antioch. The Archbishop, 1. of Mesopotamia, 2. of Ninivee, 3. of Babylon, 4.
of Assyria, 5. of Parthia, 6. of Media.

2. In Ephesus. The Archbishop, 1. of Smyrna, 2. of Pergamus, 3. of Thyatira,
4. of Philadelphia, 5. of Sardis, 6. of Laodicea.

And so the rest of Jerusalem and of Alexandria. But this exposition seems
furthest from the truth.

I. Because they interpret it of the Priesthood, Church and Government
thereof, altogether externally, Whereas indeed the Kingdom and Priesthood of
Christ is altogether spiritual, Non quod hoc etiam temporaliter non possideat.
Chrysostom. hom. 82. in c. 18, Johan.
sed quod in coelis habeat imperium, as St. Chrysostom. says.

II. For that the Church of Rome was not as then Empress and chief Lady of all
other Churches, nor afterward, till the time of the Emperor Phocas, In
Regist. ejusdem Gregorii.
as it appears by the Epistles of Gregory Bishop of Rome unto the Emperor
Mauritius.

III. Because that if this exposition were true, the Arch-Bishopricks of Italy,
Spain, France, Britany, Germany, and the like, should be excl^ded, which were
too great a wrong from this vision; or they could not tell under which
Patriarchship they should be comprehended.

Exposition is of Brightman and his followers, that say, these four Beasts do
signify the fourfold state, quality, and condition of the Ministers of the
Church of Christ, from the time of our Saviors Ascension to his coming to
judgment. As,

1. Age.
1. In the infancy of the Church they were bold and stout like Lions to preach
the Gospel of Christ, so that although, as Eusebius says, Alii flammis exusti,
alii ferro perempti, alii patibulo cruciati, Eusebius. l. 8. c. 11 and 12.
and alii flagris verberati, Some were burned to ashes, some slain with the
sword, Some hanged, and others whipped to death; yet they ceased not to publish
the truth of Jesus Christ, because they knew, that as S. Bern. says, Vere tuta
pro Christo and cum Christo pugna, in qua nec vulneratus, nec occisus
fraudaberis a victoria; To fight for Christ and with Christ is very safe, when
neither wounded nor killed, we should not be deprived of the victory.

2. Age.
2. In the next age of the Church, after Constant. the Great, that closed up
the days of Persecution, the Ministers of Christ were as painful and
laborious in their vocation of Preaching the Gospel of God, as the Oxen are in
tilling our ground or treading out the Corn for us. And so their voluminous
works and pious devotions left behind them, do sufficiently testify what pains
they took: so much, that it made the Emperor Maximinus to wonder, to see how
sedulous they were in doing good, and propagating the Gospel of God.

3. Age.
3. In the third age of the Church, and this last Century of years, they are
said to have faces like men, because that now since the time of Wiclef, Luther,
Melancton, and the rest of our Protestant Writers, the people, and diverse of
the Priests that formerly (by reason of the Latin Liturgy) understood no more
what they prayed, or what was said unto them, then Balaams Ass understood her
own voice, were now made to become like men, so rational, that they understand
both the Sermons and the Service of the Church.

4. Age.
4. In the last age of the Church, the Ministers of the fifth Monarchy so much
dreamed of by the Phanatick Sectaries of our time, are expounded by them to be
here understood by this flying Eagle; because that by reason of their swift,
extemporary and undigested sudden Meditations and Sermons; they will most
speedily pour out their words into all Lands, as Lucilius did his Verses,
Horat. Sermon. l. 1. p. 212. And send forth their voices to the ends of the World
for the converting of the dispersed Jews, and all other Pagans and worldlings
to the faith of Christ, and to bring them back again out of Scythia into
Palestina; which is easier said then done, and is far enough from the meaning
of the Holy Ghost in this place, as I have fully and amply showed the vanity of
this fiction in the sixth Book of my true Church. third exposition to be of
some of the best Protestant writers, whereof notwithstanding each several one
has his several exposition: as some interpret them to signify the four
Elements, others, the four special faculties of the soul; others, as Bullinger
interprets them, Bullinger in Loc.
to signify the four great Monarchies of the world; and others, as Baconthorp
and Albertus apud Balaeum, by these four Beasts, do understand the four great
Prophets, Esaias, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.

But Aretius and Maier do with Rupertus interpret them to signify the four
greatest Mysteries of our Christian Religion. As,

I. The Incarnation. II. The Passion. III. 1. Incarnation.
The Resurrection. And IV. The Ascension of our Savior Christ: and it cannot
be contradicted but that these things are thereby signified. As,

I, His Incarnation which is the assuming of the nature of man unto the person
of God, and that, as Nazianzen speaks, Permanendo quod erat, and assumendo
quod non erat, by still remaining what he was, and taking upon him what he was
not, is here understood by him that had his face like a man.

II, 2. The Passion.
His Passion is signified by the Calf; because all the Sacrifices, that were
offered unto God, were either 1. Zebach, which they properly termed Sacrifices,
or, 2. Mincha, which they called Oblations.
And the first sort was of living Creatures, and the second sort was of dead
things, as the first fruits of Corn, Wine, Oil, and the like.

And the first sort also, was either 1. Of the Herds, or, 2. Of the Flocks.


And of the Herds were offered, 1. Oxen. 2. Cows. 3. Calves.
and of these, The Calves were most usually offered, both among the Jews and
Gentiles; Heb. 9.19. Virgil. Eclog. 3.
for Moses took the blood of calves and sprinkled both the book and the people:
and Virgil says, Cum faciam vitula pro frugibus ipse venito. And therefore
Christ, being to offer up himself a sweet smelling Sacrifice for our sins, his
Death and Passion could not be better signified by any thing, then by the Calf.

III, 3. The Resurrection.
His Resurrection is understood by the Lion; because that he, Qui agnus
extiterat in passione, ^ern. De resurrectione.
factus est leo in resurrectione. ^or though by Esay's Prophecy, he should be
led as a sheep to the slaughter; yet by Jacob's Prophecy, he should come from
the sp^il like a Liens whelp, and so declare himself mightily to be the son of
God by his resurrection from the dead. Romans 1.4.


IV, His Ascension is understood by the flying Eagle, IV, The Ascension.
which mounteth up on high; according as the Prophet says of Christ, Thou art
gone up on high, thou have led Captivity captive, and received gifts for men.

fourth Exposition is of the ancient Fathers, as Irenaeus, Venerable Bode, St.
Hierome, St. Augustine, St. Gregory, Lyra, and almost all of them did agree,
Iren. l. 3. c. 2.
that by these four Beasts are understood the four Evangelists, St. Matthew,
St. Mark, St. Luke, and St. John. Beda in hunc loc.


But to reconcile all or most of these Interpreters, I say, that,

1. The reconciling of the Interp^eters.
Primarily we may and ought to understand the four Evangelists by these four
Beasts.

2. All the Magistrates of the Commonwealth, and all the Ministers of the
Church and Preachers of God's word.

3. And lastly, All Christians whatsoever they be, ought to be like unto these
four Beasts, both in their description and in their practice.

First then, I say, that by these four Beasts we are to understand the four
Evangelists. 1. Saint Matthew by the Lion, though Saint Gregory would have
Saint Mark understood by it. 2. Saint Luke by the Calf. 3. Saint Mark by him
that had the face of a man. 4. Saint John by the flying Eagle. For,
I find two special things that may well confirm and make good this
Exposition; as first, the manner of their description; and secondly, the
general practice of the four. For if you mark it, they are described two manner
of ways.

1. Generally. 2. Particularly.
And first in their general and common description, they are all alike; for
they had all six wings about them, and they were all full of eyes. And secondly
in their Practice, they all sung the same song, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord
God Almighty, whis was, which is, and which is to come.

But in their particular or proper description, each one of them differs from
the other, as you see. The first was like a lion, the second like a calf, etc.

So the four Evangelists in general aimed at the same thing, to set forth the
life and death of the Messiah, and to bring us all to believe, that Jesus
Christ is the Son of God, the Savior of the world; and that in believing on
him, we shall have eternal life.

But if we look into their more special end and aim, we shall find, that each
one of them differs very much from the others. For,

1. 1. St. Matthew proves Christ to be a King.
St. Matthew seems principally to aim at the declaration of the Regal or
Kingrick office of Christ, and to prove him to be that Lion of Judah which the
Jews long expected for to come to be their King, to sit upon the Throne of
David, and to govern the people of God: and this he proves by many Arguments.
As,

1. 1 Argument from his Pedigree. Ambrosius in Luc. 3.
A Prosapia, from his Progenitors; for he deriveth him lineally from King
David, and he reckons fourteen Kings in his Pedigree: and after that, he
brings him from Zorobabel in the blood royal unto Joseph. Whereupon Saint
Ambrose says, that St. Matthew deriving his generation by and from Solomon,
and St. Luke by Nathan, they seem to show, Alteram regalem, alteram
sacerdotalem Christi familiam, the one family to be from the Kings, and the
other from the Priests; Quia fuit vere and secundum carnem regalis and
sacerdotalis familiae, because he was both of the Royal and of the Priestly
family: Et sic Rex ex Regibus, and Sacerdos ex Sacerdotibus, and so both a King
and a Priest.

2. 2 Argument from the doings of the Magi. Numb. 24.
Saint Matthew proves him to be a King ab adoratione Magorum, from the doings
of the Wisemen; for the Star of the Messiah being prophesied of by Balaam, and
left as a Tradition among the Gentiles by Zoroastres King of the Bactrians,
(that was excellent in all learning) that it should appear to show the birth of
this King of Kings; though Virgil flatteringly and falsely applied it to
Augustus, saying, Ecce Dionaei praecessit Caesaris astrum. Yet these Magi
being, as St. Chrysostom writes, upon the Mountain Victorialis, worshipping
their God, a Star did appear unto them in the likeness of a little child,
Fulgent. sol. 657. in sermon. de Epiphan.
and they rejoicing thereat, conceived that, as Fulgentius says, Puer natus,
novam stellam fabricavit, the long-expected child being now born, did create
this fore-prophesied star, to testify his birth unto the world; and therefore
they did forthwith begin their journey to Jerusalem.

And how they came so great a journey in thirteen days after his nativity,
Rhemigius answers, Puer, How the Magi came so speedily to Jerusalem.
ad quem properaverunt, potuit eos in tam brevi spatio temporis ad se addueere,
The child, to whom they hastened, was able to help them in so short a space to
come unto him: and St. Augustine says, that Tres Magi iter unius anni in
tredecim diebus peregerunt, They performed in thirteen days the journey that
might well require a whole year to finish it; especially if you consider, that
these Magi were Kings themselves, Cypr. in se^m. de Baptismo. Chrysostom. hom. 6.
in Matthew. 2. Ps 72. 10.
as St. Cyprian delivers from the tradition of the Church, and St. Chrysostom.
dissenteth not much from his opinion: when as the Prophet David says to
intimate the same thing, The Kings of Arabia and Saba shall bring gifts

And now, when these Magi, these three Kings, had found out this King, they
fell down and worshipped him; for though, as St. Chrysostom. says, Viderunt
puerum hominem, They saw this child to be a man; What the Magi did.
yet Agnoverunt redemptorem, they acknowledged him to be their Redeemer. And
though he was, In gremio pauperis matris positus, and pannis vilibus involutus,
and nullum regiae dignitatis humanae signum habens, lying in the lap of his
poor mother, and wrapped in vile clouts, and without any sign of royal Majesty;
yet, as both Chrysostom and Fulgentius say, Ex stella didicerunt cum esse
regem, They were taught by the Star, to understand that he was a King: and
therefore they did homage to him as to the king of kings, and they offered to
him gold, myrrh, and frankincense, the gold, to show his regal dignity, the
frankincense, his deity, quia thus ad honorem divinum concrematur, and myrrh,
to show his mortality, because they use to put myrrh to the bodies of the dead.

And so by this their action, they showed,

1. Their humility, quia prociderunt, because they fell down.

2. Their Faith, quia adoraverunt, because they worshipped him. And

3. Their Charity, quia munera obtulerunt, because they offered these their
gifts unto him.

But how comes this to pass, Why the Magi do neglest Herod and adore Christ.
quod volunt adorare regem nuper natum, and infantem lactantem, and non adorant
regem aute annos aliquot ordinatum and populos imperantem? That they will
worship the King newly born, and an infant sucking on his mothers breasts, and
worship not the King that was ordained long before, and was ruling and
commanding all the people? What is this, qu^d ille natus in palatio
contemnitur, and iste natus in diversorio quaeritur? that he which is born in
the palace, and laid in a bed of silver is neglected, and he that is born in
the stable, and laid in the manger is enquired after and adored?

It is answered, because that this child which is but parvus in praesepio est
immensus in caelo, small in the cratch is great and immeasurable in heaven; and
he whom these Magi call King of the Jews, is the Lord and Creator of the
Angels. And so you see how Saint Matthew by the testimony of these Magi, and
the worship that they do unto him, does prove him to be a King.

The third Argument that he uses to prove him to be a King is drawn ab Herodis
timore, from the fear of Herod; 3 Argument From the feat of Herod.
for when the Magi came near unto Jerusalem, abscondita est stella, says
Saint Chrysostom, and quod ante apparuit, rursus disparuit, and that which
appeared before was vanished again, says Saint Basil. And that for three
special reasons.

1. That the Star being hid, they should be forced to enquire concerning
Christ: that as they were first moved to seek him by a celestial sign, so
secondly, they should be confirmed by the pro^hetical saying, Chrysostom. Ju^^^
Man. ^a^^l. Se^m. de humana Christi generatione. fol. 138.
and the answer of the Hebr^w Doctors, says Saint Chrysostom.

2. That the testimonies of Christ's enemies might be, long praestantiora
fideque digniora, says Saint Basil, received without question.

3. That they, (that is, the Magi enquiring after him, that they might first
honor him) the Jews should be justly condemned, qui illum cruci affixerunt,
quem alieni adoraverunt. Strange that his own Countrymen should crucify him,
when these strangers came to adore him. Therefore the Star was obscured, and
they enquired, where is he that is born King of the Jews?

Whereupon Herod, though it should have moved him to cast his Crown at his
feet, yet was he vexed with grief at the heart, and troubled with horrible fear
which the Magi b^ought to this King of the Jews, by their enquiring after
another la^^-born King of the Jews. And therefore being full of fear, least
this spiritual King should take away his temporal Kingdom, as he had formerly
slain Hyr^anus, Joseph. l. 15. c. 9. and 11.
Aristobulus and his three Sons in his furious rage: so now, being more
incensed with ire, through this Frantique fear, he put to death his own wife
Mariamne, his mother Alexandra, and forty of his chiefest noble men of the
tribe of Juda, and he slew all the great Sanhed^im, that is, the 72 Senators of
the Jews, and fourteen thousand infants in and about Bethlehem (as some do
think) and among the rest he slew his own infant born of a Jewish woman, as
Philo writes, which made Augustus say, P^ilo ^^^aeus in l. de tempor^
That he had rather be his pig then his son; And all this he did in hope to
root out and destroy all the royal blood of Juda, least this King and Lion of
Juda should deprive him of his Kingdom. And what insanable, incurable madness
is this? and how vain is the thought? For this King, which is now born,
Innaniter ergo invidendo timuisti successorem, quem credendo debuisti quaerere
Salvatorem. Fulgent. Sermon. de Epiph. fol. 652.
does not come, says Fulgentius, reges pugnando superare, sed moric^^do
mirabiliter subjugare, not to overcome them by fighting, but wonderfully to
subdue them by dying; and therefore he is not born, ut tibi succedat, sed ut in
eum mundus fideliter credat, That he should succeed thee, but that thou and all
the World should believe in him, and so be saved by him

And therefore it was but a vain thing for Herod to fear where no fear was, and
to foster fear where he should have faith: but this fire of anger and this fear
of heart, does sufficiently show that Herod knew the Messiah should be a King,
though he understood not what manner of King he should be, and so Saint Matthew
sets down this his fear and cruelty for the third argument, to prove the
kingrick office of Christ, and Christ to be a King.

The fourth argument that Saint Matthew uses to prove Christ to be a King is,
4 Argument. From Chists riding to Jerusalem upon the ass.
from his riding to Jerusalem upon an ass; and he tells us plainly, that
Christ did this, to show that he was the King of the Jews; for he says, that
all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet,
Matthew. 21.4, 5. Chrysostom. hom. 67. in Matt.
saying, Tell ye the da^ghter of Sion, behold thy King comes unto thee meek,
and sitting upon an ass, and ask the Jews, says Saint Chrysostom, quisnam
regum asina vectus Hierosolymam intravit, which of all their Kings entered
Jerusalem upon an ass, and they shall never be able to name any other besides
Christ. For the other Kings rode in Chariots, to show their pomp, and this
King only rode upon an ass, to show his humility, Bedalib. 5. in Luc.
and yet, neque amittit divinitatem, nec regiam dignitatem, cum nos docet
humilitatem, by teaching us humility, he neither loses his divinity, nor
abateth any thing of his royal dignity: when as clemency and humility in
Majesty do shine like a precious diamond well set in the purest gold. And Saint
Ambrose says, that when Christ rode to Jerusalem upon an ass, the people that
followed him, What the people did.
did three special things. 1. They repeated the Prophecy, to show that they
were not deceived. 2. They acknowledged his Deity, in saying, Hosanna, Salvum
fac: save Lord. 3. They called him their King, because he was the Son of David.
And all was to show, that this meek and humble King was the promised Messiah,
the glory of Israel, and the expectation of the Gentiles.

The fifth Argument that Saint Matthew uses to prove Christ to be a King is
from the marriage of the kings son; 5 Argument. Matthew. 22.^, 2. From the
marriage of the kings son.
for venerable Bede demands who is the Kings son, but he, of whom the Prophet
speaks, homo est and quis cognoscit eum? And the marriage of this son is the
union, and joining together of the Godhead with our humane nature in uno
supposito, in one person. The servants that he sent to invite the guests, were
the Prophets and Preachers of the Gospel: Beda super Luc. l. 4.
those that were first invited were the Jews: the three sorts of refusers are.

I. Rich Worldlings that say villam emi, Who were the refusers to come to the
Wedding.
and do love the things of this World better then the things of God.

II. Sensual men, that have 5 yoke of Oxen, and do follow the lusts of their 5
Senses: the lusts of the eyes and pride of life.

III. Lascivious wanton men, that cry uxorem duxi, and are led away with carnal
pleasures.

Or as Saint Ambrose says, we may understand.

I. The Gentiles, by him that said villam emi, I bought a farm.

II. The Jews, by him that said, I bought 5 yoke of Oxen, because they were
under the heavy yoke of the Law, and the 5 books of Moses, that were such a
yoke as that neither they nor their fathers could bear it; and therefore they
cried out, Psalm. 2.
dirumpamus vincula, let us break these bonds asunder, and cast away these
cords from us. And

III. The Heretics, Schismatics, and the like Fanatique Sectaries, that are
wedded to their own obstinate and foolish opinions, which like Eva tempts
them, and as another Dalilah destroys them, may be understood by him that had
married a wife, and therefore neither could nor would obey the truth, and so
come unto the marriage of this King, which is h^re showed unto us by the
Evangelist, but tell us flatly, they neither can nor will do it: their wife
(which is their obstinate opinion) will not suffer them.

The sixth Argument that Saint Matthew produces to prove Christ to be a King,
6 Argument.
is, from the inscription of Pilate, Jesus of Nazareth, Beda in ^^c
King of the Jews. Whereupon Beda says, that because he was both King and
Priest together, when he offered up that invaluable sacrifice of his flesh upon
the Altar of his cross unto God his Father, he fitly challenged (and it was
rightly given unto him) the title of his royalty, which did belong and was so
due unto him, and that title was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, which
were and are the three most special languages of the World, that all the World
might read it, and believe it, that Christ by his cross non perdiderat sed
potius confirmavit and corroboravit imperium, has not lost, but rather
strengthened his right unto his kingdom: So that although God suffered them to
take away his life, yet they could not take away his kingdom from him, but when
he was dead upon the cross, yet still the title remained, that he was Jesus of
Nazareth king of the Jews. And it was written in Hebrew in respect of the Jews,
that gloryed in their Law, and in Greek, in respect of the Gentiles, that
boasted of their wisdom, and in Latin in respect of the Romans, which then
ruled and domineered over most and almost all the Nations of the World; that
the Jews, will they, nill they, may see, that omne mundi regnum, omnis mundana
sapientia, and omnia divinae legis sacramenta testantur, quia Jesus est Rex,
every kingdom of the earth all the wisdom of the World, and all the sacraments
of the divine law, do bear witness, that Christ is King, and this Lion here
spoken of in this Text. And the difference betwixt this Lion and all other
Lions, is, that, as Franciscus Vallesius de sacra Philosophia^c. 55. says, Mos
Leonis est sibi tantum praedam capere, and non Leaenae: but Christ took the
prey for his Church, and not for himself.

And we find that his kingdom by three special prerogatives excels all
other kingdoms of the world; that is, 1. P^ehemi^e^ce of Christ's kingdom
threefold.
1. Eternity; 2. Purity; 3. Largity;


1. The Prophet says, thy Throne, O God, Psalm. 110.
is for ever and ever, and thy Dominion shall endure throughout all Ages: but
transibit gloria mundi, all other Kings within so many years shall not govern,
and after so many days they shall not be; for death spares none, but sceptra
ligonibus aequat. And as Nazianzen says, Constantinus Imperator and famulus
meus, ossa Agamemnonis and Thyrsitis, death makes no difference betwixt the
bones of King Agamemnon and base Thyrsites, the Emperor Constantine and my
servant; but when their race is run and their glass is out, we may say of each
of them, as Horace says of his Friend Torquatus. Non Torquate genus, non te
sacundia, Hor^t.
n^n te
Restituet pietas. --
But this King has a prerogative above them all, for he was, Rex a seculo, a
King from everlasting, and he shall be a King in secula seculorum world without
end; for so the Angel Gabriel testifies, that of his kingdom there shall be
no end. Luke 1.33.


And this should batter down the pride of Tyrants, that say with
Nebuchadnezzar, Is not this great Babel that I have built? For mean, mean,
tekel, peers, their glory is but as the grass of the field; or otherwise, if
they were immortal, they were intolerable. And this should teach us to labor,
to become the Subjects of this King, in whose kingdom there shall be, Aug. l 1
c. 10. de Trinitate.
as Saint Augustine says, requies sempiterna, and gaudium quod nunquam
auferetur a nobis, An everlasting rest, and joy that shall never be taken from
us.

The second pre-eminence of his kingdom is purity; 2. Pre-eminence.
for of this King the Prophet speaks, thou have loved righteousness and hated
iniquity, and the scepter of thy kingdom is a scepter of righteousness. For
this King is not like Ahab, that would take away Naboths Vineyard, nor like
Rehoboam, that would oppress his Subjects with over-grievous Taxes, but he is a
righteous King, and a most just Judge, far unlike some Judges of former days,
that for a word have made a man a transgressour, and for a syllable or one
letter, have quite overthrown a man's cause and right, and so have made the Laws
a nose of wax, to bend and turn as they pleased, and to be rete Vulcanium, like
Vulcans iron net, to catch the poor and friendless: but tela aranea, like the
spiders web, so easy for the rich and powerful to pass through it. But
blessed be God for it, we have few such now, and we hope we shall not provoke
God so far, as to send such amongst us; for if you suffer oppression and
wrongs, when as the Poet says, Mensuraque juris vis erit. Then surely,
peaceable men shall not be able to live in the Commonwealth. But the equity
and justice of this King should persuade all other Kings to follow his Example,
and as the wise man says, S^p. 1.1.
to love righteousness, all they that are Judges of the earth.

The third pre-eminence of his kingdom is, 3. Pre-eminence.
that God anointed this King with the oil of gladness in all things above his
fellows; for their time has an end, their dominion a limitation, but his time
is not limited, and his rule has no marches: but exivit in omnem terram, it
has gone forth into all Lands, because he is the King of all the earth: and
when as all other Kings are but Reges Gentium, Kings of some few Nations, he is
Rex Regum, and Dominus Dominantium, the King of all other Kings, and the Lord
of all Lords.

And therefore Eusebius says, that the distinction or difference betwixt this
true Christ and the other imaginary Christ's, that were anointed Kings before
him, may truly and very easily be discerned; Eusebius. l. r. c. 1. Eccl. Histor.
quia illi priores Christi nulli pene nisi genti propriae cogniti sunt, those
former Kings were scarce known to any, but to their own proper people: but not
only the name, but also the rule, power and kingdom of this true King is
extended over all Nations, and per universum orbem terrae, and through the
compass of the round world.

And though, when the Jews would have crowned him King, Rex fieri noluit, he
refused the same; yet to show that this Dominus Angelorum, was also Rex
Judaeorum, Beda l. 5. in c. 19 Luc.
as Beda speaks, when he rid to Jerusalem upon the Ass, he willingly
permitted the people to cry Hosanna, and to entitle him King of the Jews, and
he confessed as much himself unto Pilat, that he was a King.

And what means this, says the Venerable Bede, that he now willingly
embraces, quod prius fugiendo declinavit? that which before he declined, and
fled from it; and the kingdom, that while as yet he lived in the world, he
would not accept, he now denies not to take it, when he is by and by ready to
go out of the world.

He answers, that he formerly refused it, Beda l. 3. in c. 11. S. Mar.
because of the gross imagination of the Jews, that conceited him to be a
temporal King like unto others; but he does now accept it, to show, quod non
temporalis and terreni, sed aeterni in coelis Rex esset imperii; that his
kingdom was not of this world, as himself said unto Pilate, but as the King of
Heaven he ruled all the world.

Well then, seeing Saint Matthew does by so many inanswerable arguments prove
Christ to be a King, What we may learn from this Doctrine, that Christ is our
King.
and that he is a perpetual, universal and principal King, and here expressed by
the Lion in this Text, we may collect and draw matter both of comfort and fear,
both of joy and of grief. For

1. Seeing Christ is King, then, as the Psalmist says, Psalm. 97.1.
exultet terra, let the earth rejoice; for if we will obey him, and be ruled by
him, he will appoint over us such Viceroyes and under-rulers, that will lead
us, sicut oves, gently and lovingly, like sheep, as he did the Israelites by
the hands of Moses and Aaron. And

2. Psalm. 99.1.
Seeing Christ is King, then as the same Prophet says, contremiscat populus,
let the people tremble; for if they fall to be unruly, as we were of late, let
them be never so impatient, this King can as easily gather unto himself the
spirit of his under-Princes, as we can slip a cluster of Grapes from a Vine,
and he can send them a Rehoboam without Wisdom, or a Jeroboam without
Religion, or Ashur a Stranger, an Usurper, as we have had, to be our King, or
nullum Regem, no King at all, but a disordered Anarchy, which is the worst of
all; Psalm. 10.4.
and all this, quia non timuerunt Jehovam, because they cared not for God,
neither was God in all their thoughts.

But to end this Point, seeing Christ our King is this Lion here mentioned, we
need not fear our spiritual enemies; for though he be a Lion, and a roaring
Lion, that is against us; yet you see we have a Lion with us; and as Saint John
says, he that is in us is greater then he that is in the world, 1 John 4.
and is stronger then the strong man armed, and able, as the Apostle says,
Romans 16.20. Vide the abridgment of the Gospel, fol. 26. and 27.
to tread and bruise Satan under our feet; and therefore we ought to stand fast
in the Lord without fear, because as Saint Chrysostom well says, non debet
timere hostem fortem, qui habet Regem fortiorem, he need not fear the strongest
enemy that has a stronger King: as our King is, blessed be God for it.

2. 2. Saint Luke is understod by the Calf.
as Saint Matthew is here understood by the Lion, ( quia selet res quae
significat ejus rei nomine quam significat nuncupaeri, as the bread, that
signifies the body of Christ, is termed the body of Christ) because he proves
Christ to be the King of the Jews, and that Lion of Juda, which was so long
expected to come into the world: so, for the like reason, Saint Luke is here to
be understood by the Calf, because he principally aimed to prove Christ, that
is signified by the Calf, to be that Priest, of whom the Lord swear, thou art a
Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedeck.

For I told you before, that of all the sacrifices of the four footed Beasts of
the Herds, which the Hebrews called bakar, that is, majores hostias, the
greater sacrifices, the Calf was most acceptable unto God, as the Prophet
shows, Psalm. 51.19. Heb. 9.19. Exodus 24.8. Esaias. 11.6, 7.
when they offered young bullocks, id ^st, goodly Calves upon his altar. And the
reason is, because the Calf is mecker and more gentle then either of the rest;
in regard of which meekness, the quiet and peaccable man is metaphorically
called a Calf.

And therefore by the Calf is here signified the Priestly office of Christ,
whereby he offered up himself as a meek and immaculate Calf unto God, that by
the blood of this Calf, we might be sprinkled and purged from all our sins;
because that without shedding of blood there is no remissin, Heb. 9 21
as the Apostle speaks.

And of all the rest of the Evangelists, Saint Luke only does most specially
aim to prove Christ to be a Priest, and to show his Priestly office; for both
the Alpha and Omega of his Gospel is concerning the Temple and the sacrifices
thereof, when as he begins the same with the Priesthood of Zacharias and his
sacrifice of incense, and ends the same with the sacrifice of the Christians
that were continually in the Temple praising and blessing God. Luc. 24.53.


For though that before the birth of this Priest, the other Priests were to
burn incense in the Temple of the Lord, as Zacharias did; yet this Priest being
now born, and ascended up to heaven, the sacrifice that the Christians are to
offer unto God, is to be continually praising and landing God in the Temple, as
Saint Luke says the Apostles did. For the true propitiatory sacrifice being
exhibited, the Types and Figures thereof must now cease and be abolished, and
in the place thereof, the gratulatory sacrifice must be established, And
therefore Saint Luke begins his Gospel with the propitiatory sacrifice of
Za^harias, because Christ was not as yet incarnate: John 1.
but he ends the same with the gratulatory sacrifice of the Apostles, because
that now the word was made flesh, and Christ had ascended into Heaven,

And lest this should not be sufficient to demonstrate Christ to be a Priest,
S. Luke proves Christ to be a Priest by 3 special Arguments.
he proceeds to prove him to be that Priest which was after the order of
Melchisedech, by three other special Arguments.

1. A Prosapia, from his Pedigree. 2. From the true qualities and properties of
a Priest. 3. From the performance of the duties and office of a Priest.
1. 1 Argument from his Pedigree.
In that St. Luke deriveth his Genealogy by Nathan, S. Ambrose says, it was to
show his Priestly office; and Venerable Bede says, that because Saint Matthew
intended to show the Regal office of Christ, and St. Luke his Priestly office,
therefore St. Beda l. 1. in c. 3. Luc.
Matthew derives his person from King Solomon, and St. Luke from Nathan: and
so, says he, in the Chariot of the Cherubims, the Lion which is the strongest
of all Beasts, designs his Kingly office; and the Calf, which was the sacrifice
of the Priest, denotates his Priestly function: and says he, Eandem uterque
sui operis intentionem in genealogia quoque salvatoris texenda observavit, And
both the Evangelists in like manner observed the same intention of their work
in setting down the genealogy of our Savior. And then immediately he adds two
excellent Observations to confirm the same point. As,

manner of setting down his genealogy S. Beda ibid.
Matthew descended from Abraham to Joseph, to note his Kingly office, and to
show that he partaked with us of our mortality: but S. Luke by ascending from
Joseph unto Adam, and so to God, does rather design his Priestly office in
expiating our sins, and so bringing us to immortality. And theresore, in the
descending generations of S. Matthew, the taking upon Christ our sins is
signified; but in the ascending genealogies of S. Luke, the abolition of our
sins is noted unto us. For so the Apostle says, God sent his Son in the
similitude of sinful flesh, there is the acception and the taking of our sins
upon him; and for sin, or by the sacrifice for sin, Romans 8.3.
condemned sin in the flesh; there is the explation of our sins. And,

Matthew in his genealogy descended from David by Solomon, with whose mother
David sinned: but S. Luke ascended by Nathan unto David, by a Prophet of which
name God absolved him from his sin.

The second Argument, 2 Argument from the quality of a Priest which should be
1. knowledge. 2 uprightness. Ps. 7 2.1.
whereby S. Luke proves Christ to be a Priest, is from the quality of a
Priest, what manner of man he should be; and that is, to be endued with
knowledge and uprightness, or judgment and righteousness: for which cause the
Prophet prays, Give the King thy judgment, O God, and thy righteousness unto
the Kings son: For who is this King, and this Kings son, but this Priest, the
Messiah of the world? And so Moses prays in like manner, Let thy Vrim and thy
Thummim be with thy holy One. or as some read it, upon the man of thy merry:
for who is this holy One, Deuteronomy. 33. 8,
or this man of his mercy, but this our truc high Priest, called the man of his
mercy,

1. Because he is the man that is full of mercy.

2. Because that God out of his mere mercy did give this man unto us.

3. Because by this man only and none else, we obtain mercy.

And according to those two men's prayer for those two things to be given unto
the high Priest, God gave them most am^y, without measure, unto the Messiah,
that is, Play. (...) Jer. 23.5.
our high Priest: For, I have put my Spirit upon him, says the Lord, there is
knowledge; and be shall bring forth judgment unto the Gentiles, there is (...).

And S. Luk (...), that Christ had Vrim and Thummim, (...) Christ his knowledge
Luke 11.49.
knowledge and uprightness without measure. For,

In regard of the (...), he plainly calls him, the wisdom of God. And his
wisdom (...),

1. In his wise, unreprovable and unrepliable answers to Satan, that subtle
Serpent; to the Heredians, that feigned themselves to be just men, and were
sent to entrap him in his speech; and to the chiefest Doctors of the Jews, to
whom he did so wisely answer, Luke 20.7.
that they durst not ask him any thing at all: and if he asked them any
question, they answered, They could not tell how to answer him.

2. In his heavenly teaching of his followers, so truly expounding the
Prophecyes of the Prophets, so profoundly speaking to them in parables, so
plainly delivering the Law unto them, and so sweetly comforting all that came
unto him, that the eyes of all were fastened upon him, Luke ^.20.22.
and they wondered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth. And,

In regard of the second, 2 His uprightness. Mork 7.37. 1 Pet. 2.22.
that is, his uprightness, S. Mark says, that the people testified he did all
things well. And S. Peter says, There was no guile found in his mouth. And S.
Luke confirms the same throughout his whole Gospel.

The third Argument whereby S. 3 Argument from the office of a Priest,
threefold.
Luke proves Christ to be a Priest, is from the duty and office of a Priest,
which is specially threefold: 1. To expound the Law. 2. To pray for the people.
3. To offer sacrifice for their sins.


1. The Prophet Malachy says, The Priests lips should keep knowledge, Mal. 2.7.
and the people should seek the law at his mouth. And S. Hierom says, It is
the duty of the Priest, to answer all that ask him concerning the Law; and
therefore if he be the Priest of the Lord, Hieron. super Hagg.
let him know the law of the Lord: or if he be ignorant of the law, he is no
Priest of the Lord.

And therefore S. Luke shows, That Christ taught the people most diligently,
expounded the Law most truly, and answered all questions that were asked of
him, most readily. And,

2. Luke 22.32.
He shows, That he prayed for S. Peter, that his faith should not fail: And
S. John shows, how he prayed for all those whom his father gave him; and for
all them also, which should believe on him through the word. And, John 17.11.
and 20.


3. How, as a Priest, he offered sacrifice for the sins of the people (which he
did both in the Garden and upon the Cross.) S. Luke shows it more amply then
any of all the Evangelists; for though S. Matthew and S. Mark do tell us that
he was in heaviness, or exceeding sorrowful, Matthew. 26 38. Mar: 14.35.
Aristotle sect: 11. probl. 30. et Basil. in c. 17. Isaiae.
when he came to the garden: yet S. Luke expresses the matter more fully and
more lively then both of them: for he says, that he fell into a sweating
ag^ny, that is, a perplexed fear of one that is entering into a grievous
conflict, as both Aristotle and Saint Basil testify. And such a perplexed fear
is a most acceptable Sacrifice in the sight of God, as the Prophet says, Ps.
51.17.
The Sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit, a broken and a contrite heart O God
shall thou not despise; and such a broken heart was the heart of this Priest at
this time, for here is both' (...) and (...), a combat and a Sacrifice, a
troubled Spirit and a fresh bleeding Sacrifice,

1. 1. He offered up his soul in prayer. Leo Sermon. 7. de pass. The quality of
Christ his prayer. Brevis oration penetrat coelum.
He offered up his soul while he was in the Garden in a fervent Prayer to God,
and that Prayer, says Pope Leo, was in omnibus perfecta, in all things
perfect, and for all men. And it consisted like a faithful Prayer plus
gemitibus quam sermonibus, rather in sighs then in words; for it was says
Saint Augustine, very short, but very pithy, few words but full of ^erven^y,
and therein his intention was earnest, for he went a stones cast from his
Disciples; his love was great, for he often ing^^^^ated, Father, Father; his
faith was steadfast, for he said my fa^h^r his aff^^tion was vehement, for he
cried, O my father his humility was unfaigned, for he kneeled down, and with
great reverence he fell grovelling upon his face, as Saint Matthew. witnesse^h;
his constancy was apparent, for he prayed three times; his obedience was
unreprovable, for he said, Not my will but thy will be fulfilled; and his
fervency was admirable, for every word drew drops of bloed: and therefore this
prayer was directed as an incense in the sight of his father, Ps. 14.2.
and the lifting up of his hands as an evening sacrifice. And as the Apostle
says, he was heard in that which he feared; and he had all that he desired;
for whereas S. Bernard demands, Quidoras domine, quid sudas, and quid sitis?
for what do thou pray O Lord, and why do thou sweat? Saint Hilary
answers, Hilarious l. 10. de T^init.
Pro nobis oration, pro nobis sudor est, his prayer and his sweat, and his
thirst and all, was for us, and he obtained all for us. And then,

2. As he thus offered up his soul in a fervent prayer for us; so, Esaias 53.10.
when it pleased the Lord to bruise him, as the Prophet says, 2. He offered up
his body to be broken, and his blood to be shed for our sins. Levit. 17.11.
Heb. 9.22.
he offered up his blood in a swe^ting fervor, and his body to be breken for
our sins; and as the Angel whose name was secret, kindled the fire upon the
Altar, and at length the flame increasing, himself also ascended in the same:
so here in this agony of Christ, our Savior kindled the fire of his love, and
then as a faithful high Priest he offered up himself, as a sweet smelling
sacrifice unto God. And seeing blood must make an atonement for the soul, and
as the Apostle says, without shedding of blood there is no remission;
therefore this our Priest shed his own blood, to procure the forgiveness of our
sins: the blood of his head when he was crowned with thorns, the blood of his
heart when he was pierced with a spear, the blood of all parts when he was
whipped, and the blood of his whole body when he sweat the drops of blood, not
a watery dew, but nimbus sanguinis, a bloody shower, when as totus sudore
defluit, Ps. 130.7.
it passed through and through his garment and trickled down to the ground, as
Saint Luke testifies; that there might be, as the Psalm. says, plenteous
redemption. And as Eleazar the high Priest was to take the ^loud of the heyfer
with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the Tabernacle of
the Congregation seven times; Number. 19.4. Levit. 8.11.
so Christ our Priest shed his blood seven times to purge away our sins.

1. In his Circumcision, 2. In the Garden, 3. When he was crowned with thorns,
4. When he was whi^ed, 5. That Christ shed his blood seven times to deanse us
of our sins.
When his hands were nailed, 6 When his feet were fastened to the Cross, 7. When
his side was pierced with a spear. And then as the sin of man was maledictio
terrae, the curse of the earth; so this blood of Christ is medicina terrae, the
medicine of the world. And therefore the Apostle says, (...)
that the blood of Christ speaks better things then the bloudof (...) for by
the shedding of Abels (...), Gods wrath was kindled, but by the shedding of
Christ ^^oud, Gods wrath was ap^^cased; the blood of Abel gave life only to
himself, but the blood of Christ gives life to (...); the blood of Ab^ cried
for vengeance against his brother, but the blood of Christ cries for mercy
unto his enemies, and the blood of Abel cried a while, and then ceased, and
then it was no more availeable, but the blood of Christ still cries and never
cease, and (...) available for us forever.

And so you see how Saint (...) proves Christ to be the Priest, which is to be
the Priest for ever, after the order of Melchisede^^, and therefore he is here
understood by the calf, that was the ^^his first sacrifice of the Priests.

3. By him that had the face of a man, (...)
the fathers do understand Saint Mark, because his principal aim was to show
that Christ was a true and perfect man, the son of a poor Carpenter, and in all
things like unto us, sin only excepted. And th^^ truth was so manifest that
his very enemies confessed it, and would have stoned him because that he being a
man made himself a God: for their eyes saw that he had flesh and blood like
other men, and that he did hunger and thirst and was (...), and touched with
all the blameless passions and affections of other men, and therefore Saint
Mark is very short in (...) Gospel, not above (...) Chapters in all* because he
needed not to use many Arguments, when as all that saw him did readily confess

whole Gospel you may easily (...) is to prove that the son of Mary is the son
of the eternal God, coeternal and coequal with his father, and especially
because he proves him,

1. To be the Creator of all things, c. 1.

2. To be (...), the knower and searcher of the secrets of our hearts, c. 2.25.

3. To be the worker of such miracles, as the raising up of Lazarus, and the
like, which none could do but God.

And it was requisite that the mediator betwixt God and man, should be God and
man; Man, because man had sinned, and therefore meet that man should make
satisfaction, and not Ziba make the fault, and Mephibosheth bear the
punishment, which should be very unjust; and God, because our nature should,
but could not bear the burden, which was the weight of Gods wrath for our
sins. But God, as God, could, but ought not; and therefore, seeing the one
ought but could not, and the other could but ought not, God and man must be
joined together in one person, that man might do what he ought to do, and
suffer what he ought to suffer; and so go thorough the work of our redemption.

And therefore, as Saint Mark had proved Christ to be a man: so Saint John
proves him to be the true and eternal God. And so you see that by these four
Beasts we are primarily to understand the four Evangelists.

Secondly, Secondly, all the good Magistrates and Ministers are understood to
be like these four beasts. 1. Like the Lion. Jos. 1.7.
As the four Evangelists are in the first place to be understood by these four
Beasts, for the reasons before showed; so likewise all Magistrates and all
Ministers ought to be like these four Beast. As,

1. Like the Lion for courage, without fear, Confidens ut leo absque terrore;
for so the Lord commanded Joshua to be strong and of a good courage, saying,
Only be thou strong and of a most valiant courage: and so Jethro tells Moses,
That his Judges should be men of courage and undaunted, Quia timiditas Judicis
est calamit as innocentis. So when the Jews told Pilat, if thou let this
man go, Thou art none of Caesar's friend, he was afraid; and through that fear
he condemned the Son of God. And so does fear cause many others to wrong the
Innocents. And therefore to you that are the Judges, to settle the disturbed
Estates of this Kingdom, I say, that it cannot be, but that many, and many
great men will frett and chase, and be discontented at your doings, though you
do never so justly: but it is your duty to do that which is just; and in
doubtful cases, when evidences on both sides are in aequilibrio, to incline to
that which tends to the service of God's Church, Sap. 1.1.
and the honor of the King's Majesty: and you ought always to remember what
the Wiseman says, Love righteousness ye that be Judges of the Earth; Proverb.
for righteousness exalts a Nation. And this righteousness you cannot
preserve, unless you be like Lions, without fear, either of threatenings or
dangers.

And as the Magistrates, so the Ministers and Preachers of God's word should be
like Lions, to do their duties without fear; for so the Lord says unto
Ezechiel, Ezech. 2.6.
I send thee to a rebellious Nation, but thou son of man, be not afraid of
them, neither be afraid of their words, nor dismayed at their looks, Quia
timiditas Predicantis est calamitas Audientis, Because the fear of the Preacher
is the calamity of the Hearer, when the fear of reproving men's fins hardens
them in their sins, and encourages them to sin more and more. And therefore I
say, that we should remember what the Lord commands us, Cry aloud, and spare
not, Esaias 57.1.
lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and
the house of Jacob their sins. And if the great men of the world threaten us to
rob us of our lands, or deprive us of our liberties, let us look what the Lord
says, I, even I, Esaias 51.12, 13.
am he that comfort you; and who art thou, that thou should be afraid of
a man that shall dye, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass, and
forgettest the Lord thy maker, that has stretched forth the heavens, and laid
the foundations of the earth, and have feared continually every day, because of
the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destrey?

And it is well that he says, I, Ezech. 2.3, 4.
even I am he that comfort you, seeing it is with us as it was with
Ezechiel, that Briars and thorns are with us, and we dwell among scorpions, a
rebelli^us Nation, that are impudent and stiff-hearted; for I must humbly crave
leave to tell you a story of truth and no fiction. When I came first to lie in
the Bishops house in Kilkeny, I dreamed, that the Bishops Court was full of
people, Citizens, Soldiers, and Gentlemen, with Drumms, Swords and Muskets,
and being affrighted with the sight of them, before they had entered the house,
or done any hurt, I presently awaked, and looking out at the window for them, I
saw none: then for many days I often mused, what this meant, at last I found
that the Citizens of Kilkeny on the one side, the Soldiers on the other side,
and the Knights and Gentlemen round about, came about me like Bees, to rob God
of his honor, and the Church of her right, by dividing her Revenues amongst
themselves as the Soldiers did the Garments of Christ. And I neither fear nor
care what any man thinks of what I say, my duty telling me what I should say.

But though they threaten to be my ruin, and to cause me to spend what I
intended to the repair of the flat-fallen Church, to preserve the Revenues of
the Bishopric, yet seeing the Lord says, I, even I am he that comfort
thee, and that have delivered thee from so many dangers, and so many times from
the hands of most mercyless Rebels, and bids me not to fear, I must not be
dismayed; but as Elias told Ahab, and J. Baptist told Herod of their faults
without fear: so I, and all others, that are God's Ministers, ought to be bold
as Lions, to reprove the sins of the people, and especially those sins, that
are most frequently committed, and are most prejudicial to the service of God,
and most pernicious to their souls; least as Lucian says, (...), by escaping
the smoke of man's anger we shall fall into the fire of God's fury, when we fear
men more then God. And therefore, my dear brethren, I had rather you should
blame me for my boldness, then that God should punish me for my fearfulness;
and I know, that as the Drunkard cannot endure to be told of his drunkeness, or
the proud man of his pride, or the Rebel of his rebellion: so no more can these
sacrilegious persons abide to hear of their sacrilege. And must we therefore
hold our peace, for fear of their sayings, jeeres, or threats? By no means.

2. As we should be bold as Lions without fear; so we should be diligent and
painful in our places, like the Oxen, without laziness, to pray continually,
and to preach constantly, and as the Apostle says, in season and out of
season; that is, not so frequently, as our late Fanatiques would have us, to
preach Sermons full of words without substance: but as St. Augustine expounds
it, Volentibus and nolentibus, For to the willing hearers it comes in season,
and to the unwilling it comes out of season, whenever it comes.

And when we do this, then, 2. That the Magistrates and Minist. should be like
the Ox, painful and diligent to do their duties.
as the mouth of the Ox that treads out the corn should not be muzzled, so
ought not we to be molested, nor detained and held with vexatious suits, to
hinder us, to discharge our necessary duties: lest the punishment of our
neglect should fall upon the heads of them that cause it. For we are sure, that
our God is so just, that he will not punish any one for not doing that, which
he is not suffered to do; as, for not going into his Church, when the ways
are so stopped, that he cannot possibly pass it,

3. We should be, not like the horse and mule, 3. The Magistrates should be
like men, sober and rational, and not voluptuous, like Beasts.
that have no understanding, and whose mouths must be holden with bitt and
bridle, lest they fall upon thee; but we should be endued with reason, like
unto rational men, that, as Cicero says, Agere qu^equam nunquam debent, cujus
non possunt rationem probabilem reddene, ought never to do any thing, whereof
they could not yield a very probable reason. And God knows, how many things we
do, for which we can yield no reason at all. For what reason had we to wax
weary of our peace and of our happiness, and to rebel against a most gracious
King to destroy our selves? And what reason have we to expect God's blessing,
and yet to continue sacrilegious to rob God of his dues? Or is there any
reason, that any Commonwealth should keep Soldiers to protect them, and not
regard them, nor countenance them, nor pay them their wages? Surely they are
very necessary to preserve our peace, and they ought not to be slighted; and
John Baptist says, They should be content with their wages: but they should
therefore have their wages: and how should they have their wages if the
Superior officers defraud the inferior Soldiers, or the close-handed people
detain their taxes? I know not where the fault is, if there be any; but I know
his Majesty and his Immediate Governors, would have all things done with
uprightness, and according to the Dictate of right reason.

But to leave these and the like unreasonable men, that do these and the like
things without reason.

4. 4. They should be endued with the properties of the Eagle.
We should all be like the flying Eagle, and the chiefest properties of the
Eagle are, 1. A sharp sight. 2. A lof^y flight.


And both these are expressed in the Book of the Righteous, Job. 39.32.
where the Lord demands of Job, Does the Eagle mount up at thy command, 1 The
sharp sight of the Eagle.
and make her nest on high? She dwelieth and abides on the Rock, upon the crag
of the Rock and the strong place, there is her lefty flight; then he
proceeds, and says, From thence she seeks the prey, and her eyes behold
afar off, there is her sharp sight: and of this sharpness of sight, Saint
Augustine says, How sharp our sight should be in spiritual things.
that, being aloft in the clouds, she can discern, Sub frutice leporem, and sub
fluctibus piscem, Under the shrubs an hare, and under the waves a fish.

Even so should we that profess Religion, especially we that are the Ministers
of God, should have Eagles eyes, to see the Majesty of God in a bramble-bush,
Exodus 3.2.
like Moses; to discern the presence of Christ with us in the fiery furnace,
Dan. 3.25.
like Abednego; to behold an Army of Angels ready to defend us in our
straightest siege, 2 Reg. 6.17.
and to consider the assistance of God to help us when we are molested and
compassed with the greatest heaps of ^fflictions, Romans 8.18.
like the holy Apostle S^ Paul.

But this the children of this Generation cannot do; The worldly man's quick
fight.
for though the understanding of the worldly man, which Nazianzen call eth,
(...), the eyes and lamp of reas^n, be pi^reing, sharp, and cunning enough to
make a large sh^kel and a small Epha; Amos 8.5. Luke 12.56.
and very well able to discern the alterations of the skies, as our Savior
witnesses; yea, and to enter, like Aristotle, into the secrets of nature, and
the deepness of Satan, to find out the plots and practices of his craftyest
instruments: yet being but a mere natural man, he cannot perceive the things
that be of God, 1 Cor. 2.14.
as the Apostle shows, neither can his understanding reach any further then
(...), such things, as may be manifested by demonstration, as St. Clement
says. For,

If you talk of Christ's conception in the womb of a pure Virgin, without the
help of a man, then the Heathen, His dimness and blindeness in spiritual things.
like Sarab, laugheth at it; and the wise Philosopher, as being in darkness,
stumbleth at it, and cannot conceive how this thing can be. If you talk of
Christ's death, and say, that our God should dye, and by his death procure to
us eternal life, then the Jews will storm at our folly, and the Grecians count
it a mere madness, and a great reproach to our Religion. And if you talk of his
glory and power, that being dead and buried, he should raise himself again, and
now reign as a King of Kings in Heaven, then the children of infidelity deem it
(...), a feigned thing. And the reason thereof is rendered by St. The reason of
the worldly man's blindeness.
Augustine, that as the eye of man, if it be either blind or purblinde, cannot
thereby discern the clearest object; even so faith he, animus pollutus, aut
men's turbata, a soul defiled with sin, or a mind disturbed with worldly cares,
can neither see God, that is present with him, nor understand the things of
God, that belong unto him.

Yet the spiritual man, that has the Eagles eyes, The spiritual man's quick
sight.
which Philo calls fidem oculatam, faith enlightened by Gods spirit, can
discern all the deep things of God, even the most excellent mystery of
godliness, which is, as the Apostle says, God manifested in the flesh,
justified in the spirit, seen of Angels, 1 Timothy 3.16.
preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and received up into
glory. For in the unspeakable birth of Christ the Eagles eye does behold a
divine miracle, in his accursed death it sees a glorious victory, and in his
return from death it conceives an assured hope of everlasting life.

2. 2. The lofty flight of the Eagle.
The next Property of the Eagle is her lofty flight, for the Poets feign, that
the Eagle fled up to Heaven, and laid there her eggs in Jupiter's lap; and the
Prophet Esaias alludeth to her lofty flight, Esaias. 40. ult.
when he says, that those which wait upon God shall renew their strength, and
shall lift up their wings as the Eagles; Jexem. 49.16.
but Jeremiah goes on further and says, that the Eagles do build their nests
on high: and yet Ezechiel goes beyond them both, for he says, that the great
Eagle with great wings, leng-winged, full of feathers, which had diverse
colors, came unto Lebanon, Ezeth 17.3.
and took the highest branch of the Cedar, where you see, she takes first the
highest tree, and then the highest branch of that tree. I know it was a Vision
that showed the state of Jerusalem; but yet you may see thereby the lofty
flight of the Eagle. So St. John flew as high as Heaven to begin his Gospel;
and so we, considere debemus in coelis, ought to have our minds set, Ephesians.
2.6.
not on the fooleries and vanities of this world, but on heavenly things and
heavenly places, that, Esaias 58.14.
being mounted up, super altitudines terrae, above all the high places of the
earth, as the Prophet speaks, we may behold all the things of this world to
be tanquam muscas, but as gnats and flies; or like the spiders web, that though
it be never so curiously woven, yet will it make no garment for us; and so all
the titles of honor to be, but folia venti, the windy blasts of a fleshly pair
of bellows, too weak an air to carry up a noble Eagle; How to deem of all
worldly things.
all the pleasures of this world to be, but lilia agri, like the lilies of the
field, that are more delectable in show then durable for continuance, and all
the allectives under heaven to be but vanity of vanities, and altogether
vanities. For thus by a contemplation and continual consideration of heavenly
things, it would appear unto us, quam abjecta sunt, qua jam alt. videntur, how
base are all the things of this world, in our judgments rightly informed,
which now seem so precious in our imaginations, being corrupted.

And therefore if we would be like the noble Eagles, What the spiritual men
that are like the noble Eagle should do.
mounting up to Heaven; then, as Moses builded his tent without the host, and
far from the host: so should we build our habitation out of this world, and
far above the world; and as Elias when he journeyed toward Heaven in his fiery
Chariot, and was flying up in a whirlwinde, bestript himself of his mantle, and
threw it down to the earth, lest the weight of it should press him downward,
and so hinder his ascent to Heaven: even so, if we desire to ascend to Heaven,
we must bestrip our selves of all worldly impediments, that are as heavy as a
talent of lead, and do not only hinder us from ascending upwards, but do press
many men down to the bottomless pit. And as the Prophet David, in all
distresses, comforted himself with that pious meditation, saying, Whom have I
in heaven but thee, and what is there on earth that I desire in comparison of
thee? so do all those, that make their unum necessarium, their chiefest purpose
and design to go to Christ to have an everlasting house and lands, satisfy
themselves with the hope of obtaining their desire.

And this is the reason, that seeing God has given them all that they have,
they weigh not a straw if they be driven to spend all that they have, for the
benefit and good of the Church of Christ, and to promote the service of God.
And if the wise men of the world laugh at our folly, and say, we shall spend
ten times more then we shall ever get. We may answer, that for our losses and
expenses they are but as feathers, and that shall never trouble us; but our
hope is, that we shall attain unto our desire, which is, to mount up with the
rest of God's Eagles unto the Kingdom of Heaven, and that will countervail all
our losses. And so much for the peculiar and proper Description of these Beasts.

THE SECOND SERMON.
REVEL. 4.8. And the four Beasts had each of them six wings about him, etc.


2. 2. Their general and common description.
FOR their general and common description, it is said, they had each one of
them six wings about him, and they were all full of eyes. Touching which you
must observe.

1. Some things about their wings.

2. Some things about their eyes. And,

1. 1. Of their wings.
About their wings. These two things are to be noted;

1. What are these six wings. 2. To what end they had these wings, or what use
they made of them.
1. 1. What they are.
Rupertus and others say, these six wings are the six works of mercy, visito,
^oto, cibo, redimo, tego, colligo fratres, that is, as our Savior sets them
down, to give meat unto the hungry, Matthew. 25.35.
drink unto the thirsty, lodging to the stranger, cloathe to the naked, and to
visit the sick, and those that are in prison: others understand hereby the six
spiritual works of piety and mercy, which are to correct the offender, to
instruct and consell the ignorant, to comfort the afflicted, to bear patiently
all injuries, to forgive all trespasses, and to pray for our enemies and
persecutors: but Balaeus and Lambert say, that these six wings are faith, hope,
charity, justice, mercy and truth; and I think they come nearest unto the
truth, for by those six we shall be able to shun and fly away from all the
mischeifs of the world; and these six wings are able to mount us up unto our
father in Heaven. And they that have not these six wings are rightly said to be
like the Ostrich, which often spreads her wings but seldom flies.

But they that have these six wings are most happy, and need not fear the
greatest dangers, nor the malice of their greatest enemies. For,

1. Faith is radix omnium virtutum, the root of all virtues; and you know what
mighty things Saint Paul sets down, to have been done through faith.

2. Spes alit afflictos, hope preserves the afflicted, and makes not ashamed,
says the Apostle.

3. Charity covers a multitude of sins; and of all the three divine graces,
(...), the greatest of them all is charity.

4. Justice is such a cardinal virtue that Theognis a Heathen says, (...),
justice comprehends all virtues.

5. Our Savior says, blessed are the merciful, for that they are sure to
obtain mercy. And,

6. Truth as Zoreb. proves, is so great, that it will prevail against all
oppesitions, for though that by the tricks and delays of sutle heads, it may
be clouded for a time, yet at last it will bud forth and appear.

But I fear the Lord has a controversy with the Inhabitants of this Land,
because as the Prophet says, there is no truth, nor mercy, I may add, nor
justice, nor knowledge of God in the Land; or if these be, then I am sure you
will not build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity, because the
Lord loves neither House nor Lands that are unjustly obtained. I cannot stand
to examine it, or to handle the particulars that might be said concerning these
six points; for that might require six hours to do it at least: but I will
proceed and say,

2. 2. What use they made of their wings.
If you would know to what end they had these wings, or what use they made of
them, the Prophet Esaias tells you in the practice of the Seraphims, that it was
for these three special ends: That is, 1. To cover their faces. 2. To cover
their feet. 3. To fly about.
For he says, that with two of their wings they covered their faces, Esaias. 6.2.
and with two they covered their feet, and with two they did fly.

And this they did for these three ends: That is, 1. To check our curiosity. 2.
To show our misery. 3. To teach us industry.


1. It is the nature, and the foolish disposition of man to be always prying
and searching into every thing, the screts of God, the mysteries of state, and
the obscurities of nature. And yet the Seraphims that stand in the presence of
God are fain to cover their faces, not to hide their sins which they had not,
but because they are not able to behold the brightness of Gods glorious
Majesty; and if the Angels hid their faces from the brightness of Gods Glory,
how dares sinful man pry into it? because, as the Apostle says, he dwells in
the light that no man can attain unto it, 1 Timothy 6.16. Exodus 34.20.
and the Lord says himself, that no man could see his face and live; for
though we walk in the cheerful light of the Sun, yet we are not able fully and
directly to look upon the Sun when he shines in his full strength and
brightness, but it will dazzle our eyes, and make them to see a thousand
colors. And as a pure crystal glass cannot endure the strong working of the
fire, but it will break all to pieces; even so the weakness of man's mortal
nature, though it lives by the enjoying of Gods presence, yet it cannot bear,
nor comprehend the glory and brightness of Gods Majesty; but that, in looking
upon so clear an object, the eyes of his understanding shall be dazzled, and he
shall fall and be swallowed up into a thousand errors. For seeing, as the
Apostle speaks, our knowledge of God in this life is but in part, 1 Cor.
13.12.
like the beholding of a man suddenly passing by us, when we can look upon
nothing but only his back parts, it is impossible for any man in this
mortality to know perfectly and exactly the being and ways of the most highest.

And therefore this checketh the curiosity, and reproves the boldness of those
men that like Phacton will fly and mount up too high to search into the
Heavenly mysteries: for as the wise man says, Ecclus. 1.2.
who can number the sand of the sea, the drops of rain, and the days of time?
who can measure the height of Heaven, the breadth of the Earth, and the depth
of the Sea? Who can find out the wisdom of God which has been before all
things? For if we consider either the nature and essence of God, or if we look
into the counsels and works of God, Danaeus. Isag.
we shall easily perceive that they are all incomprehensible. Et si quid facit
Deus naturae nobis assuetae repugnans, nihil tamen facit rationi repugnans, And
if God does any thing that seems repugnant to our accustomed nature; yet we
may be sure he does nothing that is repugnant to reason. And though all that
God does be exceeding good, yet we cannot always perceive many of them to be
good; and yet this makes them not to be unjust, Gregor. in Job. c. 9.
because we understand them not to be just: for as St. Gregory says, Qui in
factis Der rationem non videt, He that sees not the reason of Gods doings, let
him consider his own infirmity and blindness, and rationem videat cur non
videt, and he shall soon see the reason, why he sees it not: and if we seek to
know more then we are able to understand, we shall understand less then we do:
And therefore Solomon gives good counsel to these Gnostics, saying, Eccles.
7.18
be not thou just over much, neither make thy self over-wise. For the mystery
of the Lords commanding Adam, that he should not eat of the tree of knowledge,
was very great, because the knowledge that he should get thereby, would not
only cause his present fall, That we ought not to be too curious to search
into divine mysteries. Genesis 3.5. V. 7.
but also make both him and all his sons for evermore to fall.

And therefore the subtle Serpent that aimed at the readiest way to destroy
them, promised unto Eva (and he kept his promise) that if they would eat of the
tree of knowledge, their eyes should be opened and they should be as Gods,
knowing good and evil, and so it was; for the text says, that their eyes were
opened, and they had the knowledge both of good and evil, the good that they
had lost, and the evil that they had fallen into; for they knew that they were
naked.

And so this knowledge did but direct them a way to run away from God, and
teach them the art to sow fig leaves together, to cover their shame, and to
hide their wickedness and themselves from the sight of God, which they could
never do: And therefore happy Adam had thou been if thou never had had this
knowledge, for this knowledge made thee to fall; and so the Prophet Esaias says
of Babylon, Esaias 47.10.
thy wisdom and thy knowledge have caused thee to rebel, or to turn away; and
so Ovid says of himself.

Ingenio perii qui miser ipse meo. My wit and my knowledge has undone me. And
I fear that many other men will cry out, that their too greedy a desire
inconcessae scientiae, of unlawful knowledge, and prying too far into hidden
mysteries has hurried them into most desperate conclusions; for though it be
very true, that no other creature upon earth has reason and understanding but
only man: yet it is as true, that no other creature goes so far from reason
as man alone. And therefore I do not say, happy are the beasts that want
reason; but I say unhappy is that man, qui cum ratione insanit, that runs
mad with the reason that God has given him, and by aspiring to get unlawful
knowledge, does fall into unavoidable mischief.

And therefore the Devil could wish that all his servants were as knowing as
Berengarius, and as subtle as Duns Scotus; because he has more excellent
execrable service from one of them, then he can have from a thousand others:
for it is a true saying, That inferior conceits have inferior sins, and non
nisi ex magnis ingeniis magni errores, and the great errors never came but from
great wits, such as Arius, Pelagius, and the rest of the great Heretics had.
And as it was the Giants and Lucifer that highly rebelled and warred against
God, and as it was the Princes and the Kings of the earth that stood up and
took counsel against the Lord and against his Anointed; So it is the great
Lords that were the great rebels, and the mean men that were infirmiores in
exercitu, are but as the tail of the Dragon which the great men drew after
them. And so it is the curious wits, the pryers and searchers after
unsearchable knowledge and secret mysteries, that hatch the cockatrice eggs,
and produce the most desperate errors.

And therefore, seeing the ambitious desires of attaining more knowledge then
beseems us, and the knowledge of those secret things, Deuteronomy, 29, 29.
that as Moses says belong unto the Lord our God, are the Devil's splendida
peccata, his glistering sins, and generosa scelera, his noble projects, his
jewels, and most honorable stratagems which have caused many men not only to
fall away, The Seminary Priests and Presbyterians, the most dangerous people in
the Church of God.
but also to run away from God, we ought to take the counsel of Saint Augustine,
Magis metuere cum in intellectu habitat diabolus quam cum in affectionibus, to
fear more when the Devil dwells in the understanding then when he corrupts
our affections, when as a Pestilent Heretic, or a Seminary Priest, or a
Fanatique Nonconformist, does more mischief then either a dissolute drunkard,
or a covetous merchant. And when we can not comprehend the Majesty of God, we
should say with our selves, it is no marvel; because he dwells in the Light,
that none can attain unto it: so when we can not understand his ways, nor dive
into the depth of his counsels, and his decrees of election and reprobation and
the like, we should say with the Prophet David, Ps. 77.19.
thy way is in the sea, thy paths in the great waters, and thy foot steps are
not known. And so when we can not see the reason of his judgments, why this man
prospers, and that man is punished, and as Homer says (...). Homer Iliad

Annuit hoc illi divum pater, abnuit illud.
Why he gives this thing, and denies that thing, why he raises it is man,
throws down that man, we should cry out with the Apostle, O the deepness of
the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his
judgments, and his ways past finding out?

And therefore, least (as they say) Pliny burnt himself in Mount AEtna by
searching too far into the cause of its continual burning, and Aristotle
drowned himself in the sea of Oseria, by diving too deep into the causes of its
extraordinary flowing; So our eyes should be dazzled with the brightness of Gods
presence, and our selves swallowed up in his bottomless counsels, we should not
presume to look too fully upon so glorious a Majesty, we should not dive too
far into the depth of those bottomless mysteries: but, as these heavenly
beasts, and the holy Cherubims did cover their faces with two of their wings,
So should we; because we are no ways able to dive into the depth of them.

But as the Poet can say to every boy Mitte arcana Dei caelumque inquirere quid
sit; That the secrets of State ought not to be pried into by the vulgar people.
So you must know, that besides arcana Dei, there are also mysteria imperii,
secrets of State, which we must not search into but with these beasts cover our
faces with two of our wings; for if there were no government both in the Church
and Commonwealth, but Anarchy, and as the Poet says Totaque discors:
All things in confusion;
We were in a worse condition then the bruit beasts. For they are governed by
the law of strength, when the weakest must yield and obey the stronger, as all
the beasts unto the Lion, the sowles unto the Eagle, and the fishes unto the
Whale: But God ordered that men, endued with reason should be guided and
governed by Laws, not only those that he delivered himself, but also those
that are made by the wisest of men, as Moses, Solon, Lycurgus, and the like,
Kings and Princes; and their under-Magistrates to rule and to govern the people
according to their Laws: and this government is a matter of great weight and
moment. And therefore the Prophet says, that Christ his government is upon his
shoulders, (...) 9.6.
not in his hand, or at the arms end, but upon his shoulders, which are the
bearing members of all heavy things: and government requires not only strength
and strong shoulders to bear it, but also wisdom, and a good head, to guide
it; because it is ars artium gubernare populum, it is one of the hardest things
in the World, and the chiefest of all arts, to govern the people, especially
when turba begins to be turbata multitudo, that is, wayward and froward. And
therefore the Prophet David compares the government of the unruly people, to
the appeasing of the raging seas, saying unto God, Thou stillest the rage of
the sea, How hard a thing it is to govern the unruly people.
and the noise of his waves, and the madness of the people.

And this madness of the people requires grave Judges, and wise Lawyers, that
can truly interpret the Laws, and judge all differences according to Law, which
otherwise would be made like a nose of wax, to be turned which way you will.

And least their madness should stop the current both of the Law and Religion
too, and so destroy both the learned Lawyers that preserve our right, and
without whom we were not able to live in the Commonwealth; and the Preachers
of the Gospel that maintain Religion, without which we were most miserable (as
of late years they intended to do) The Kings and Princes that are the
governors of the people, must maintain soldiers and Captains to suppress
their madness, and to preserve peace and religion both in the Church and
Commonwealth. And therefore the soldiers as I showed not long since, are not to
be slighted, but to be cherished and satisfied for their wages, that, as John
Baptist says, they may be contented therewith, and not forced through want to
oppress the people.

And seeing all these things and abundance more of like sort, that are
requisite for the government of the people, can not be done without a great
deal of counsel, and wisdom, and policy, and strength, and power, and the
like; it is not for the common vulgars to steal fire out of Heaven, to search
out the reasons, and to pry into the causes and all the actions of their
Superiors: but as the maxim of all wise men is, curabit praelia Conon, let
the secrets of the Prince be to the Prince; and as the Medes said to Deioces,
when they chose him to be their King, do thou what thou will about the
government of us, both in war and peace, and we will obey thy commands and
follow our husbandry, our trades, and our occasions; Josh. 1.16.
and as the Jews likewise said to Joshua, All that thou command us we will
do, and whether soever thou sendest us we will go, and whosoever he be that
does rebel against thy commandment in all that thou command him, he shall be
put to death: so should we and all other people, study to be quiet, as the
Apostle speaks, and to follow their vocation, and to learn obedience, which
is better then sacrifice, and never to be so curious and censorious, as to pry
into the secrets, and to condemn the actions of their Governors, but rather
with the Cherubims, and these Beasts to cover their faces with two of their
wings.

And as they ought to do this about the secrets of State, The Church affairs
ought to be left to the disposal of Aaron and the Priests.
so they should do the like about the Church affairs, which they should leave
to Aaron and the Priests to dispose of; and not with the men of Beth-shemesh to
pry into the Ark of the Lord: 1 Samuel 6.19.
lest they suffer as they did, when the Lord smote fifty thousand, threescore
and ten men for their curiosity in prying into the secrets of the Church. For
what have Laymen to do with the ordering of holy things, that the Lord God has
committed unto the Priests? Ne Suitor ultra crepidam. said Apelles The Shoemaker
must not touch the thigh
Unless his art does reach so high,
And will they order things in the Church of God, that have so much disorder in
their own house, and can not tell how to mend it: therefore they ought rather
to hide their faces with two of their wings, then to pry into the Government
of the Church.

For as I told you even now, that the Government of the Commonwealth was a
matter of great moment, and to be borne upon the shoulders, which are the best
able to bear it: so the Ark of God, 1 Chronicles. 15.15.
wherein all the Government of the Church was included, was to be carried upon
the shoulders of the Levites, 1 Chronicles. 13.10.
1 Chronicles. 15.15. To show that this Government of the Church is no ways of less
moment, then the Government of the civil State.

Therefore when this Arc was put, not upon the shoulders of the Priests,
Numbers 4.15.
according to the first institution, but to be carried upon a new cart, the
Lord made a breach upon his people, and smote Vzza that he died; and so they
may well fear the anger of the Lord will be kindled against those that take
this Ark of God from the shoulders of the Priests, and put it, as it was of
late, into the hands of those that had nothing to do with it.

Secondly, 2. Why they covered their feet.
As the Cherubims and these Beasts did cover their faces with two of their
wings, to check our curiosity, because we are not able, and therefore ought not
to pry into secret mysteries: so they covered their feet with two of their
wings, to show our misery, because we have defiled our selves and fouled our
feet by our walking in the wicked ways and the dirty paths of sin and
iniquity. And so we are no ways able to stand and to justify our selves in
the sight of God: for we are all become abominable, and there is none that does
good, no not one, But in all men there is corruption, in the best men there is
defection, What the best of all our actious are.
and in the Angels unfaithfulness has been found.

And therefore God has shut up all in unbelief, that every mouth should be
stopped, and all the world culpable before God; for if you look into the best
of all our actions, and the choicest ways that we walk in, you shall find that
the righteousness which we have by nature, is but justitia Gentilium, splendida
peccata, as Saint Augustine calls them: or the wisdom of the flesh, not
sanctified by faith, as Saint Paul calls it. The righteousness that we have by
the Law is but justitia Pharisaeorum, which as Saint Chrysostom says, was in
ostentatione non in rectitudine intentionis, in locutione non in opere, in
corporis afflictione non in mandatorum observatione, and so it was but sceria
obducta, sin gilded and unprofitable, because never perfectly performed, no
not by the strictest Pharisee. And the righteousness which we have by grace, is
but justiciae viatorum, inchoated and imperfect, and at the best but as
menstruous clothes full of stains; but Jehova justitiae nostra, the Lord is
that righteousness which must save us.

And therefore we should never exalt our selves with high conceits of our own
worth, like the proud Pharisee; but rather fall down upon our knees with the
humble Publican, and say, Lord be merciful unto me a sinner: and to cry out
with the Prodigal Child, we have sinned against Heaven and against thee, and we
are no more worthy to be called thy Sons. For if God should enter into
judgment, and be extreme to mark what we do amiss, O Lord, who could abide it?
For no flesh living could be justified. That we ought not to hide and cover our
sins.
And therefore we should not stand to justify our selves and our ways before
God, but rather with these Beasts and those holy Cherubims to cover our feet
with two of their wings.

But by this covering of our feet, we must not understand the hiding and
covering of our sins, as most of us use to do; for Solomon tells you plainly
that he which hides his sins shall not prosper, Prove. 28.13.
but who so confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy; 1 John 1.8.
and Saint John says if we say we have no sin we deceive our selves and the
truth is not in us: but if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to
forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

And therefore though we ought to cover our feet, that is, not to justify our
ways before God: yet we must not cover our sins, but confess them with an
humble, lowly, penitent and obedient heart, if ever we look to obtain
forgiveness of the same.

3. 3. Why they did fly.
As they covered their feet with two of their wings, so with the other two
wings they did fly; and that was to show the readiness of their obedience to
do the service of God, and to teach all others to be industrious and diligent
to do their duties: for here you see the Cherubims, and these holy Evangelists
do not only go or run, but fly very swiftly to do the work of God, and to
execute his will; and therefore the Prophet says, How ready and dlligent we
should be to do the works of God.
he rode upon Cherub and did fly he came flying upon the wings of the wind,
that is, his Messengers, that he sent to perform his commands, were as ready
and as swift as the wind. He needed no more but say to this man go and he
goes, and to another come and he comes, and says, in me mora non erit ulla,
Luean. Phars. lib. 1.
as Curio said unto Caesar.

So we should all be swift to hear, and diligent to do our duties; not lazily
to go about them, like the Snaile, of whom the Poets fain, that when Jupiter
invited his Creatures unto his Feast, the Snail came last of all, which
admonishes us, says Alciat. -- Sectanda gradu convivia tardo, To come slowly
to revellings and pleasures, but to the Lords Table, and to other holy
exercises we should not be like the Snail, or the sluggard that cries, yet a
little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep, but we
should go nimbly like those that have wings to fly to do their business,
because as Saint Chrysostom says, sicut in unoquoque matter est diligentia,
ita universae doctrinae and disciplinae noverca est negligentia: diligence is
the mother of every good act, and sloth or negligence is the stepmother or
fetters that entangle and choke all learning and discipline. Sloth and
negligence the hinderance of all good things, Cantic. 8.14.


And as we ought to use diligence in all that we take in hand; so we ought more
specially to use it in the service of God, and to go to our Savior Christ,
that bids his Church and every member of his Church to make have, or to fly
away, as the original word imports, and to be like to a Roe, or to a young Heart
upon the mountains of spices, where she runs and skippeth for very haste to
get away: so Abraham made haste to make provision for the Angels that came unto
him; and so David says, O God, thou art my God, early will I seek thee: and so
the women that sought Christ came early, while it was yet dark, unto the
Sepulcher.

And so all worldlings are diligent enough, and have wings like Pegasus to fly
about the affairs of this world, -- Currit mercator ad Indos: The Merchant runs
to get Commodities unto the Indians, and the O pressours are most greedy to rob
both God and man, and the malicious man has his feet swift to shed blood, and
the Fanatic schismatic flies about, and compasses Sea and Land to make a
Proselyte; and yet we that profess to journey toward Heaven, do walk as it
were upon leaden feet.

For you may see the Citizens of this World, how diligent they are and spare no
cost to repair and beautify their own houses in the fairest manner; and how
slow they are, and how backward to do any thing to set up the houses of God
upon their feet. But are like the Dog in the manger, that will neither eat hay
himself, nor suffer the Ox to eat it; so they will neither raise the Church
themselves, 1 Chronicles. 29.1, 2, 3.
nor suffer those that would, to enjoy the Revenues of the Church to raise the
same.

But you know how heavily the Lord complains of those that dwell in sieled
houses themselves, Hag. 1.4.
and suffer the house of God to lie waste; and that use their wings to fly
about their own worldly affairs, and have scarce any feet to walk in Gods ways.

And therefore our Savior tells us, How diligent the worldlings are about their
own affairs.
that the children of this World are wiser in their generation then the
children of light; because they omit no opportunity to gain their wicked ends;
and we neglect all the furtherances that may help us forward to the Kingdom of
Heaven.

For so you see how Judas watched and walked unto the High Priests, and from
the High Priests to the Garden, and from the Garden to the High Priests again,
and from the Highpriests to the gallows, and most of this while Saint Peter
and the rest of the Disciples slumbered and slept.

But the reason why we are so slow in our flight toward heaven, is, because
our wings that should carry us, are birdlim'd and entangled with abundance of
cares about worldly wealth, or drowned in the vain delights of sinful
pleasures, or pressed down with the weight of those vanities, whereof the least
is heavy enough to sink a ship; that being burdened with such hindrances, and
hindered with such burdens, we cannot serve God with that readiness as we ought
to do. For is it not strange to consider, how many men's hearts are filled with
the cares of this World, and their heads loaded with a world of vanities? and
how should they fly about Gods service, that are thus fettered with such
obstacles?

And therefore, What hinders our readiness to serve God, and our diligence in
his service.
as we see the birds that fly, will carry no more weight upon their backs, but
what necessity does require: And as the runners of a race, will ease themselves
of all heavy burdens; so we being to fly up to Heaven, and to run our race
toward the spiritual Canaan, should cast away both deliciarum putredinens and
curarum magnitudinem, our worldly cares and our sinful delights, and all other
things that may hinder us to run readily to do the Lords service, and to fly
with the Cherubims and these Beasts, about the Lords affairs.

Which if we do, we shall be crowned not with a garland of slowers, as the
Romans used, but with a crown of eternal glory, as the Apostle speaks. And if
this cannot allure us to be ready and diligent in Gods service, but still to
load our selves with the garbages of the earth; then I must turn from the
Apostles promise to the Prophets threatening, and say, Jerem. 48.10.
Cursed shall all those be that do the work of the Lord negligently: cursed in
this life, and cursed in the life to come, cursed for a time, and cursed for
ever.

And therefore if we desire to avoid this curse, let us with these beasts use
two of our wings to fly about the service of God with all readiness, and
rather strive to be the first in the Church of God then the last; for so we
shall gain the blessing for ever. And so much for the wings of these beasts,
and the use that they made of them.

2. 2 The next part of their description is, that they were full of eyes.
You must observe about the next part of their general description (which is
common to each one of them) that they are said, First, To be full of eyes. And
Secondly, More particularly, that they were full of eyes, 1. Within. v. 8. 2.
Before. v. 6. 3. Behind. v. 6.
For so it is in the 6. v. that they were full of eyes before and behind, and
here in this verse, that they were full of eyes within.

First then you see, that they were full of eyes, which shows their
illumination, that they could see like Argos every way; and our Savior says,
that the light of the body is the eye; and those beasts being full of eyes,
Matthew. 6, 22 c. 5.14.
they are rightly said to be the light of the World.

And here I might Philosophically dilate unto you the nature, quality, and
excellency of this little part of the body, which is, the eye, and the
inestimable benefit of our sight, which is the chiefest of all the five senses,
but to explain all these, my time will not permit me.

And therefore I will only say, that as these beasts were full of eyes, to see
all things and to enlighten all others: so should all Christians be like unto
them, full of eyes; and especially, 1 All Magistrates. 2 All Ministers.


All the Magistrates and all the Judges of the earth should be full of eyes; 1
That all the Magistrates and Ministers of justice should be full of eyes.
because they are not only to look unto themselves, and to see to their own
ways, but they are also to guide and to lead many others. And if they be blind,
and yet undertake to lead the blind, the blind Magistrates to lead the blind
people, they both shall fall into the ditch, as of late amongst us both have
done; because both wanted their eyes, and so both were blind, and he is blind,
says Saint Chrysostom, that has not both his eyes in his head.

And these two eyes in a Magistrate and a Judge are, 1. What are the two eyes
of the Magistrate.
The eye of Knowledge and understanding of the Law, and of all cases and causes
that shall come before them. 2. The eye of doing justice and executing
judgment according to the truth and merit of every cause.
And for the first point, 1 The eye of knowledge and understanding the truth of
the cause that is brought before them in every circumstance thereof.
the understanding of all things aright, one eye will scarce serve the turn;
but they must be like these beasts full of eyes: one eye to look to the
Complainants charge, another to mark the Defendants answer, and another to
observe the quircks and subtleties of the Pleaders: and all this they must
behold and see, not without a great deal of patience, and a great deal of
circumspection; for as Seneca says. Qui part judicat inaudita altera, aequum
licet statuerit, ipse haud aequus est.

And therefore though the cry of Sodom and Gomorrha was great, and their sin
very grievous; yet the Lord would not destroy them, but he says, I will go
down now and see whether they have done according to the cry of it: and if not,
I will know. Genesis 18.21.
So there is another cry amongst us, that the power and privilege of
Parliament does many ways wrong men, and against many poor men stop the current
of justice. It were well to do as God did, to see whether it be altogether
according to the cry of it; for you may be sure, that privilege is accursed,
and woe be to that power that maintains wrong, and stops justice: and it will
be a great deal more for your honor to lay aside that power, and to suppress
such a privilege then to support it. And I think few but such as never were in
power before would use it.

So when the report came, that the men of any City became Idolatrous and the
seducers of the people to idolatry, Deuteronomy. 13.14.
as now our Anabapt^sts and Quakers withdraw their neighbors to their faction
and rebellion, the Lord says, then shall thou enquire, and make search, ask
diligently and behold if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such
abomination is wrought: Then for the second point, If thou find it true, V.
15,
that thou see they have done it, thou shall surely smite the inhabitants of
that City with the edge of the sword, and destroy it utterly. For, 2 The eye of
doing justice, that offenses should not be suffered to go unpunished. Aug.
Epist. 182. ad Bonifac.


2 when with these eyes they do see the offense, they should not let the
offender escape, quia impunitas delicti invitat homines ad malignandum, because
the leaving of sin unpunished is the chiefest encouragement to invite other men
to sin; for by favoring one, you hearten many: and as Saint Augustine says,
Illicita non prohibere consensus erroris est, not to restrain sin when you see
it, is to maintain sin in them that do it, and he that suffers it, which
should hinder it, is as culeable as he that commits it. And Solomon says, He
that justifies the wicked, or says unto him, thou art righteous, and so let
him go unpunished, and quasheth all that shall be proved against him, him shall
the people curse, and Nations shall abhor him; and such a Judge deserves very
well to be accursed. Prove. 24.24.


And it is most certain, that the suffering of oppressors, intruders, and the
like malefactors to pass away unpunished, will bring the curse of God upon any
Nation, and especially upon them that should hinder it and will not do it. For,
nil doctores nisi ductores, the Ministers of mercy can do no good though we
preach never so well, except the Ministers of Justice will maintain that good,
because we can but forbid the corruption of the heart, and they must prohibit
the wickedness of the hand; when as we only have the words of exhortation, and
they only have the sword of correction.

And therefore seeing the eye of Justice should not wink and connive with the
transgressors, the false-hearted subjects and traitors, the oppressors and
plunderers of their brethren, be they of what Nation you will, Jew or Gentile,
and of what condition you will, high or low, which might think it favor enough
to have their wickedness pardoned, though they be not honored and magnified,
when the same deserves rather to be severely punished, then any ways to be
connived at; but I will pass from this point, that is too hot to be held long
in my hand. And yet I must tell you that this should no ways countenance the
condemning of any man that is innocent; for the Scripture is very plain, that
justum and innocentem non condemnabis, neither is it any justice to punish
Mephibosheth for Ziba's fault, but as every horse should bear his own burden,
so should every man suffer for his own faults: so let the rebels that were
murderers and traitors suffer and spare them not, but let the innocent go free.

2. I say, that as the Magistrates and Judges should be like these Beasts, full
of eyes; so should the Ministers and Preachers of Gods word be likewise full of
eyes: For otherwise it were to no purpose either for the Judge and the
Magistrate, or for the Preacher and Minister to be like Lions, full of courage,
unless they were also full of eyes, and their eyes should be sharp and
quick-sighted like the Eagles eyes: for the blind Lion may soon fall into the
snare or ditch, and then his strength and courage will avail him nothing. And
therefore as well the Minister as the Magistrate should be like unto these
Beasts, full of eyes, and especially to have two eyes at the least.

1. The one of famous learning and knowledge. And, 2. The other of a blameless
life and conversation. 2. That the Ministers and Preachers should be full of
eyes.

And if the Minister wants either of these, he is but monoculus, an one-ey'd
Priest, not fit by the Law of God to serve at Gods Altar, that would have his
Priests without blemish.

1. The Priests lips should preserve knowledge; 1. The eye of Learning. The eye
often signifies the understanding.
and the eye by the idiome and customary phrase of the Hebrews is often put
for the whole mind and understanding of a man, quia oculi sunt praecipui
mentis indices, because the eye is the most principal index and declarer of the
mind; so impudicus oculus impudici cordis est nuntius, an unchaste eye is the
witness of an unchaste heart, says St. Hierom, and a pitiful eye is the
testimony of a good merciful man.

Therefore he eye put for the mind and signifying the understanding, the
Ministers that ought to be full of eyes, ought to be full of knowledge and
understanding; for if they want knowledge, how shall the people get the
knowledge of Gods Laws from them that know nothing themselves? The people must
needs perish, and they shall be liable for their destruction; for when they
perish through the Preachers fault, I will require their blood at the Preachers
hand, says the Lord. Ezech. 3.20.
And therefore those Ministers that have taken upon them the charge of souls,
and do either want the eye of learning and the light of understanding, or else
keep it in themselves like the fire that is in the flint stone, and warmes no
man, or the candle that is put under a bushel, and lights no part of the house,
are in a fearful case, because that as our Savior says, Matthew. 5.^3,
when the salt has lost his savor, The desperate condition of ignorant and
negligent Ministers.
it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under
foot; so when the crier has lost his voice by being choked with junkates, and
the watchman has lost his eyes by too much sweating after worldly wealth, and
the Minister cannot preach either through ignorance or negligence, they are
thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and thrown into the bottomless
pit. But, 2. The eye of a blameless life.


2. As the Ministers of Christ should have the quick sighted eye of learning
and knowledge, so they should have the clear eye of a blameless life and
conversation, otherwise as Penelope to delude her woers, is said to untwist in
the night what she spun in the day: so by the darkness of their evil life, they
pull down all that they built by the light of their preaching.

The Lord says, Exodus 20.26,
that the Priest shall not go up by steps unto his Altar, that his nakedness be
not discovered thereon: and Saint Bernard says, there are four things
necessary for every Priest ne quid nuditatis appareat, that his nakedness may
not appear. And they are,

1. Four things necessary for every Priest.
Capiti velamentum, a veil for his head; and that is prudent discretion which
covers all his folly and imbecility, and is not only a virtue but the
guider and moderatrix of all virtues.

2. Corpori vestimentum, a garment for the body, and that is fervent devotion,
because it is the office and duty of the Minister to pray for all; 1. For the
good men, that they may continue good and not fall. 2. For the evil men, that
they may rise from their fall. And prayer without devotion, is like the body
without a soul.


3. Manibus munimentum, a covering for the hands, and that is good works;
because that as our works are strengthened through our prayers, Hieron. in
Lament. c. 3.
so our prayers are available through our works, says Saint Jerome.

4. Pedibus fulcimentum, propps and shoes or sandals for the feet; and that is
a pure and an upright life and conversation, because bad Ministers do not
dispensare but dissipare bona Domini, and rather dishonor then honor their
Lord and Master Christ: And therefore the Heathen Priests at their sacrifical
solemnities, were wont to say, Innocui veniant, procul hinc, procul impius esto;
Casta placent superis, pura cum mente venite.
And as the Magistrates and Ministers should be f^ll of eyes, That all good
Christians should be full of eyes.
so all Christians in like manner should be full of eyes, to look unto
themselves and to their ways; for though, as the Apostle speaks, they were
once darkness, while God winked at the time of their ignorance: yet now they
are light in the Lord, even as the Prophet showed they should be, The people
that walked in darkness have seen great light, Esaias. 9.2.
and they that dwell in the Land of the shadow of death, upon them has the
light shined, because it cannot be denied but that as Daniel says, knowledge
is increased, and as our Savior says, light is come into the world.

And therefore the people should take heed that they love not darkness more
then light, or that they be not like the fool Harpaste that was as blind as a
beetle, and yet would not be persuaded, as Seneca says, that she was blind
but that the room was dark* For I fear that we have too many men that think
they want no eyes, but that the house of God is dark and wants light; but that
is because they are bleere-ey'd like Leah, and look a squint and cannot see the
truth.

There be many others that are full of eyes, Many are full of eyes, yet not
like these beasts, but of all evil eyes.
but their eyes are oculi nequam evil eyes, such as Saint Peter speaks of; and
others have eyes far worse. My time will not give me leave to discover them.

But if the Lord should say unto me, as he said to his Prophet Amos, what see
thou: I must answer, Amos. 8.2.
I dare not tell what I see: and if the Lord replies, should they that are to
be like Lions become as fearful as the Hares, that run away from the noise of
the Hounds? Have I not often delivered thee as I did Elisha after he had
delivered his message unto Jehu, when he presently shut the door and fled? 2
Reg. 9.3. and v. 10.
therefore I command thee to tell me, what see thou.

Why then, if thou command me, I must tell; and I must say with the Prophet,
that I have seen unrighteousness and strife in the City; moreover I saw the
place of judgment, and wickedness was there; Eccles. 3.16.
and the place of righteousness, and iniquiquity was there: ^. 4.1.
and I saw the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comfort because
power was on the side of their oppressors. And worse then the parable of
Menenius Agrippa, when all the members conspired against the stomach, I have
seen a monstrous ill-shap'd body cutting off his own most excellent and
unreprovable head; and the worst Parliament that ever England saw, rebelling
and warring, and doing far worse to the best King that ever England had. And I
have seen the Commons-house of that Parliament encroaching by little and little
upon the rights and privileges of the Lords, as the Plebeians did upon the
nobility of Rome, till at last they had quite supplanted them: felix quem
faciunt aliena pericula cautum, I hope, O Lord, that I shall never see the like
again.

Yet I see one thing more that troubles me much, many men that say (excepting
the conscience of their religion, that should not undo them) they are innocent
from any offense done either against their King or against their neighbors, and
yet to be driven out of house and home, and those that were known to be rebels
and to have fought against their King to enjoy their Lands and Livings, and to
become great men, and to hold in their fingers the Lands of Innocents, of the
King, of the Church, and of God himself, which can as hardly be plucked out of
their singers, as it was to pluck the club out of Hercules's hands; for they
have got possession of them, and possession being as they say eleven points of
the Law, twelve Juries cannot dispossess them.

But for the trial of the truth hereof, his Majesty has most graciously
appointed, and his Grace here does most favorably countenance these wise and
religious men that shall justly and religiously determine these things. And I
am confident that being wise men as they are, they will show themselves men of
courage, bold as the Lion to do justly, and to stand for the right Interest, be
it of the Jew or of the Gentile, without fear of the greatest, and not caring
what the meanest or the vulgar say of them; quia nec meliores si laudaverint,
nec deteriores si vituperaverint, because their praise makes them never a whit
the better if they do unjustly, nor their dispraise one jot the worse when they
do right, which is the only thing that all men ought to do without fear. And
by their just and unpartial dealing betwixt party and party, I doubt not but
they will as they have hitherto, show themselves to be full of eyes to see to
every thing, to search into every cause, and to find out the truth of every
matter and every charge that shall be brought before them.

THE THIRD SERMON.
REVEL. 4.8. And the four Beasts had each of them six wings about them, and
they were full of eyes within, etc.


2. 2. The distribution of their eyes.
AFTER that they are said to be full of eyes, the Evangelist tells us more
particularly that they were full of eyes within; and in the precedent 6. v. v.
6.
it is said, that they were full of eyes before and behind, so they were Full
of eyes, 1. Within. 2. Before. 3. Behind.


1. They were full of eyes within, 1. Why these beasts were full of eyes
within. Jer. 17.9.
and that was to look into their own hearts and consciences, for the heart of
man is deceitful above all things: It is but a little member, vix ad unius
milvi refectionem sufficere possit, scarce sufficient to servone Kite for his
breakfast; Hugol. 3. de anima.
and yet as Hugo says, magna cupit, and totus mundus ei non sufficit, it
affects great things, and as Juvenal says of Alexander, the whole World will
not suffice that Pellaean youth.

And it is very true, that In omni creatura, quae sub sole vanitatibus mundanis
occupatur, nihil humano cord sublimius, nihil nobilius, nihilque Deo similius
reperitur; quapropter nihil aliud quaerit a te Deus nisi cor tuum, In all the
creature which under the sun is occupied in these worldly vanities, there is
nothing more sublime then man's heart, nothing more noble, and nothing more like
to God himself; and therefore God requires nothing of thee but thy heart, Pro.
23.26.
when he says, My son, give me thy heart.

But then the heart must be pure and sincere, free from all vanities, and void
of all iniquity; for otherwise, qui de suo partem faciunt Deo, and partem
diabolo, iratus Deus quia sit ibi pars diabolo, discedet, and tetum diabolus
possidet; They that give part of their hearts to God, and part to the Devil,
God being angry that any part is left for the Devil, departs and leaves all
unto the Devil, S. Aug. in Johan. Matthew. 5.8.
as St. Augustine speaks.

And therefore the Scripture says, blessed are the pure in heart, for they
shall see God; quia Deus non exterioribus oculis sed puro cord videtur, says
Saint Augustine, because God is not seen with our outward eyes, but with a pure
and upright heart. But Vae duplici cord, woe to him that has a double heart,
Quod ingratum est ad beneficia, infidum ad consilia, saevum ad judicia,
inverecundum ad turpia and impavidum ad pericula. Bernard. l. 5. de considerat.
which says one thing with his tongue, and thinks otherwise in his heart; and
woe to him that has a wicked heart, which speaks friendly unto his
neighbor, but means mischief in his heart; and woe to him indeed, which has
a hard heart, which as St Bernard says, nec compunctione scinditur, nec
pietate mollitur, nec precibus movetur, which is neither broken with
compunction nor mollified with piety, nor moved with prayers, nor terrified
with threatenings, nor yet yielding with any judgments: but is unthankful for
all benefits, regardless of all counsel, and senseless of all dangers, and so
still growing worse and worse, until like Pharaoh, he be quite destroyed.

And yet how many men have we that are double hearted and false hearted, and
more deceifull then the wily Greeks that lurked in the belly of the Trojan
Horse, or the subtle Serpent that beguiled Eve? And that which is worst of all,
which do deceive and betray their own souls? For as of all murders felo de se
is most impardonable, so of all deceits, he that deceives his own soul is most
desperate, and in the most woeful condition. And yet as Apollodorus the tyrant
dreamed that he was taken and flead by the Scythians, and his heart thrown into
a boiling Caldron, should say unto him, I am the cause of all this my self,
because I have deceived thee in all thy ways, and in all thy plots and
projects: so how many simple, foolish, and beguiled souls are in the world,
that in all their wicked plots and practices, and in all their covetous designs
and mercyless oppressions of the poor, John, 16.2.
do beguile themselves and betray their souls unto the Devil? When, as our
Savior says, they shall put his servants out of the Synagogues, out of their
places and offices, as they have done of late, and out of their means and
maintenance, as you do still amongst us, and shall kill them and put them to
death, and think that they do God good service, and believe that they have the
Eagles wings to mount up the readyest way to Heaven, when as indeed they ride
Post upon Pegasus the broad way to Hell.

And therefore, seeing the heart of man is so deceitful, as many times to
persuade him he holds God by the hand, when the Devil has him fast fettered by
the heels, it is requisite that we should be like these Beasts full of eyes
within, to look into our own hearts, that they do not deceive us, and to
examine our own ways, that we be not mistaken in them; lest, while we aim to
go to Jerusalem the City of God, we shall with the Army of the King of Syria, 2
Reg. 6.19.
that he sent to Dotham to fetch Elisha, be carried blindefold into the midst
of Samaria, the City of our greatest Enemy; for so the Prophet David says, he
did commune with his own heart, Ps. 77.6.
and his spirit made a diligent search, that is, into his actions, lest his own
heart should deceive him: Ps. 4.4.
and so he advises us to do the like, saying, Stand in awe and sin not,
commune with your own heart, that is, to examine diligently, whether the things
that you do be sins or not: and do not trust the suggestions and suppositions
of your hearts, until you make a search, and a diligent inquisition into the
true nature of them, because many men do think, they do not sin at all, when
they do most highly offend the Lord.

And the reason is, Why men deceive themselves.
because they have no eyes within, to look into their own hearts, and to
examine their own actions; but they are only full of eyes without, to pry into
the doings, and to censure all the acts of all others, which is the humor of
them, that take delight to spy out the least mote that they see in the eyes of
others, but never look into the beam that is in their own eyes, those horrible
sins that lurk in their own hearts.

And this multiplicity of eyes without, and the want of all eyes within, when
those that should be within are turned out, is the cause that there are so many
reformers of our Church, and censurers of our State, Etiam opifices quorum res
fidesque in manibus sitae sunt, Yea, that even mere. Mechanics,
Handicrafts-men, and Ploughmen, whose credit, wealth, and wit lies in their
hands, as Salust speaks of the seditious Plebeians of Rome, do so impudently
prate and censure the Government both of the Church and Commonwealth.

But as our Savior said to St. Peter, when he would needs know what should
become of St. John, Quid ad te? What is that to thee? Do thou follow me: so I
say to these men, Quid ad vos? What have you to do with the mysteries of
State, or the matters of the Church? It becomes you to do as the Apostle
advises you, 1 These. 4.11.
To study to be quiet, and to meddle with your own business; and, as my Text
says, to be full of eyes within, to look unto your own actions, and not
immittere falcem in alienam messem, and to do as many Gentlemen use to do, that
is, to travel over France, Italy, and Spain, to understand the custems and
fashions of other Countries, and to be altogether ignorant of the Laws,
customs, and conditions of their own Country. But,

2. These Beasts are not only said to be full of eyes within, 2. Why these
beasts were full of eyes behind.
but in the sixth verse they are also said to be full of eyes before and
behind. And that was to this end.

1. They were full of eyes behind, to look backward, and to behold the times
and things that are past.

2. They were full of eyes before. 1. To consider the times and things that are
present. 2. To foresee the things, and to provide for the times that are to
come.
And Moses, the man of God, that was faithful in all God's house, thought that
this threefold sight and consideration of the times past, present, and to come,
would surely make the children of Israel to fear the Lord their God, and to
walk in his ways; or if these things would not do it, he knew nothing in the
world that could do it: and therefore a little before his death, in his last
farewell, and in the chiefest and most affectionate Sermon that ever he made
unto this people, this is the chiefest wish that ever I found expressed therein,
Deuteronomy, 32.29.
O utinam saperent and intelligerent, ac novissima previderent! O that they
were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter
end! that is, Vtinam saperent praeterita, intelligerent praesentia, and
providerent futura, I would to God, that this people did remember and call to
mind the things that are past, that they understood the things that are
present, and that they would consider the things that are to come, and shall
inevitably fall upon them.

And as Moses, so do I wish to Almighty God, that all and every one that
hears me this day, would do as Moses here desires, and would be, as these
Beasts are here described, that they might do what is here required. And that
is,

1. To be full of eyes behind, to behold the times, and to consider the things
that are past; for the want of this sight and consideration is a main cause of
so much wickedness among the people, and so much ignorance and impudency in our
late Fanatique Leaders of their seduced followers: for if they would have done,
Dent. 32.
as Moses advises us, To remember the days of old, and read the
Ecclesiastical Histories, Councils, and Canons of the Church, and other
Histories, the Records of time, both of the Greeks and Latins, I persuade my
self they would never have been so disloyal and rebellious against their Civil
Governors, and so averse and refractory to the Prelates of our Church, Quia
ignorantia matter inobedientia.

And therefore with Moses, we have great reason to wish that our men were, like
these Beasts, full of eyes behind them, to behold the times and things that
are past; and especially; for I will name no more at this time, but, 1. God's
dealing toward man. 2. Man's requital unto God.


1. It is a true saying of St. Augustine, Antequam conditi essemus, nihil beni
merebamur, Before man was made he could deserve no good, he could merit no
favor; and yet if sinful man had any eyes behind him, to see what great
things God has done for him, he should find cause enough to cry out with the
Psalmist, What God did for Adam in Pa^adise.
O God, what is man that thou art so mindful of him, and so exceeding
gracious unto him? for thou made him a man, when thou might have made him
a beast: and he made him in his own image, and after his own likeness, in
righteousness and true holiness, and he placed him in Paradise, the sweetest
place of all the world, in a garden of God's own making, and an orchard of his
own planting, that brought all manner of fruits, and all kind of pleasant
flowers, at all times of the year: and he made him Lord and Master over all his
creatures, the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, the fishes of the
sea, and whatsoever walks through the paths of the seas: and these he needed
not to run after them, and take pains to tame them as we do, but they were to
come unto him, and to be obedient to him of their own accord. And because that
among all these there was not a mate found meet for man, God made him an helper
fit for him, a Lady more excellent then Helen, whom he loved, and delighted in
her at first sight.

And were not these, Beneficia nimis copiosa, multa and magna, privata and
positiva? Blessings and benefits, for number beyond number, and for excellency
beyond expression; for as the Psalmist says, Who can express the noble works
of the Lord, and show forth all his praise?

But how did man requite all these benefits? How Adam requited God.
God gave him but unum breve, leve, and utile mandatum, one short, easy, and
most profitable Precept if he had observed it; no positive injunction of any
hard work, but that which is far easier to be kept, a negative inhibition, that
he should not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, this was all, and
no great matter, how easily might he have done it? Yet this man sold his God,
that had done such great things for him, and brake his Commandment for an
Apple. What moved Adam and Evah to offend God? Ambition.
And what moved him to do this, but that which moves all his children ever
since, to destroy themselves and all the Kingdoms of the earth, Ambition? That
he might be as Lucifer desired to be before him, similis Altissimo, like Gods,
knowing good and evil.

And this infernal weed, that first took life in Lucifer's breast, has
poisoned all his Posterity ever since, and especially all the great men of this
world, that desire to be greater, and affect and contend for honor and
greatness above measure. For as Eudoxus the Philosopher desired of the Gods,
that he might behold the Sun very near, to comprehend the form, greatness, and
beauty thereof, and afterward be burnt of it, as the Poets say Phaeton was: so
Ambition is the boldest and the most disorderly passion of all those desires,
which trouble men's minds, and fills their heads with an unsatiable greediness
of obtaining those things, which they should no ways desire; and by that
means, as Adam did, they undo themselves and many thousands more: for so Mar.
Crassus, the richest man in Rome, M. Crassus.
burning with ambition and an excessive desire of new triumphs, presumed at
sixty years of age to undertake the war against Arsaces, King of the
Parthians, and therein his whole Army was discomsited, himself miserably slain,
twenty thousand of his men killed, ^. Marius.
and ten thousand taken Prisoners: So Caius Marius weakened with old age, but
strengthened by Ambition to continue in sovereign authority, would undertake
the war against Mithridates King of Pontus; and thereby he was the cause of
his own utter overthrow, and of that great slaughter, which imbrued all Italy
and Spain with the deluge of blood, that Sylla, by his extreme cruelty, brought
upon them.

And the like may be said of Spurius Melius the Roman Senator, Spurius Melius.
Marc. Manlius. Hen. 5.
of Marc. Manlius, of Henry the Fifth, whose ambition deprived his own father
from the Empire, and caused him to dye miserably in Prison; and indeed of those
threescore and thirteen Emperors, that, within the space of one hundred years,
dyed all of them (excepting three that dyed of sickness in their beds) by
violent deaths. And as the ambition of the Triumvirate Octav. Antonius, and
Lepidus, had wellnigh ruinated the Roman Empire; Pet. de la Primauday. fr.
accad. page 223.
so Peter de la Primauday says, that the ambition of the Dukes of Orleans and
Burgundy had almost utterly consumed the Kingdom of France, and was the
occasion, that more then four thousand men were slain within Paris inone day:
and so I may say, that this wild plant and bitter root of Ambition, that first
sprang up in Paradise, and afterward grew worse and worse in the accursed
earth, was the cause that moved the late Usurper, and many others of those
Traitors and Rebels that followed him, to bring all the calamities, that we
have both seen and felt in these Dominions.

And therefore we ought to detest this cursed Plant, that brought forth such
bitter fruits of undutifulness, unthankfulness, and rebellion to be rendered
unto God for all the great good that he had done for man.

But now, after that man had fallen, and thus disloyally sinned against God,
Non dignus est peccator pane quo vescitur, nec lumine coeli quo illuminatur,
The sinner, even the best of us all that are Adam's seed, is not worthy of the
bread that he eats, or the light of the Sun that shines unto him; for if
before his being, he deserved no good; how much evil does he now deserve, when
he has so foully defiled himself, and so highly offended his God?

And yet, Vtinam saperent, How graciously God dealt with Adam, after he had
sinned.
I would to God we would cast our eyes behind us, to behold and see the
goodness of God, and what wonders he has done for the children of men; for he
pittyed Adam when he was naked, and made them coats of skin to hide and cover
their nakedness, and to preserve their bodies from the storms of winter, and
the scorching heat of summer. And when all the World had corrupted their ways
before God, he saved Noah and his family, And with the seed of Adam.
when the deluge destroyed all other flesh: and afterward he snatched away
Abraham out of the very flames of Idolatry, that was begun to be kindled in his
father Terah's house, and then he delivered him out of Egypt, and preserved him
out of all his troubles: And for the seed of Abraham, The Israelites.
the children of Israel, Moses tells you what God has done for them; for, when
he divided to the Nations their inheritance, Deuteronomy. 32.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
he took Jacob for the lot of his own inheritance; and though he found him in a
desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness, yet he led him about, he
instructed him, and kept him as the apple of his eye, and he made him ride on
the high places of the earth, that he might eat the eucrease of the fields, and
he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the fliuty rock,
butter of kine, and milk of sheep, fat of lambs, and ramms of the breed of
Basan, and goats with the fat of kidneys, of wheat, and to drink the pure blood
of the grape.

And the Prophet Ezekiel does amplify the great goodness of God toward this
people more at large, saying, that their birth and their nativity was of the
land of Canaan, their father was an Amorite and their mother an Hittite, (i.
e.) an accursed people; and in the day that thou wast born, thy navel was not
cut, neither wast thou washed in water, nor salted, nor swadled at all, no eye
pittyed thee to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open
field to the loathing of thy person: and when I saw thee polluted in thine own
blood, I said unto thee, live; and I washed thee with water, and anointed thee
with oil, I clothed thee also with broydered work, and shod thee with badgers
skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk, I
decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thine hands, and a
chain on thy neck, even as our fine Ladies have in these days, and I have put
a jewel on the forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful Crown
upon thy head, and thou did eat sine flower, E^ech. 16.3. ad v. 15.
and honey, and oil, and thou becamest exceeding beautiful and perfect through
my comeliness which I had put upon thee, says the Lord God.

And what reward did this people render unto God, How unthankful and undutiful
they were to God.
and what requital have they made unto him for all these great benefits, that
this good God had done unto them? First Moses tells you, They waxed fat, and
then they kicked, as we lately did, and forsook God that made them, and lightly
esteemed the rock of their salvation; They provoked him to jealousy with
strange Gods, and moved him to anger with their abominations: They sacrificed
to Devils and not to God, to Gods that they knew not, that came newly up, whom
their-fathers feared not, which was and is the fruit of every new Religion, as
of late days we have fully seen amongst us.

And then, as they forsook God that formed them, so presently they rebelled
against his servants, they muttered and murmured and rejected all their
Governors; and as the Psalmist says, They angered Moses in their tents, and
Aaron the Saint of the Lord: for these two, to forsake God, and to rebel
against their Governors, do always go together. And if you look into the
foresaid sixteenth Chapter of Ezekiel, you shall see how the Prophet shows
their wickedness, and how they have multiplied their abominations above
measure, and as many of us, over-wickedly and unjustly seeking to make our
children great in this world, do bring them unto the Devil in the world to
come; Ezech. 16.21.
so did they slay their children, and cause them to pass through the fire, and
as the Psalmist says, Ps. 106.37.
They offered their sons and their daughters unto Devils: and the Lord himself
assures us, that Sodom had not done so wickedly as they had done, Ezekiel.
16.48.51.
and Samaria had not committed half of their sins.

And what an intoierable ingratitude was this? The most monstrous thing that
ever was; not possibly to be described, quia dixeris maledicta cuncta, cum
ingratum hominem dixeris; because thou say all the evils that can be said,
when thou namest an ungrateful man; especially to God, that has done such
great things for us.

For we read of many bruit beasts, that for small benefits, have been very
thankful unto men, as of the Dog, that for a piece of bread, will follow and be
ready to die for his Master, and the Lion that for pulling a thorn out of his
foot, preserved the slave that did it, from all the beasts of the forest, and
afterward his life on the Theater in Rome; and Prima^day tells us of an
Arabian infidel, that, being taken prisoner, and afterward set at liberty by
Baldwin King of Jerusalem, in token of his thankfulness for that favor, Pet.
Prim. c. 40. p. 431.
he went to him by night, into a Town where he was retired, after he had lost
the field, and declared to him the purpose of his companions, and conducted
him, until he had brought him out of all danger.

And when bruit beasts and Pagans are thus thankful unto us, shall man be
unthankful unto God? No, no: He should be truly thankful.

And Seneca says there be four special conditions of true thankfulness.

1. Grate accipere; to receive it thankfully. 2. Nunquam oblivisci; Never to
forget it, for he can never be thankful that has forgotten the benefit. 3.
Ingenue fateri per quem profecerimus: Four conditions of true thankfulness.
ingeniously to acknowledge by whom we are profited. 4. Pro virili retribuere:
to requite the benefit received in the best manner that we are able.
But this people scarce observed any one of them, I am sure not the second, and
therefore not possibly the third and fourth; for the Prophet David tells us
plainly, that after the Lord had showed his tokens among them, and his wonders
in the land of Ham, and had brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen
with gladness, and had given them the lands of the Heathen, Ps. 105.42, 43,
so that they did as many have done amongst us, to take the labors of the
people in possession, Ps. 106.13.
Yet, within a while, they did as we do, forget his works, and would not abide
his counsel: V. 21.
yea, they forgot God their Savior, which had done so great things in Egypt,
wondrous things in the land of Ham, and fearful things by the Red sea.

But to let this people pass, that were destroyed for their unthankfulness, let
us look unto our selves and have our eyes behind us, to behold and see.

First, What God did for us, the people of these dominions. Amos 3.2.
What God has done for us. And, Secondly, What we have done for the honor and
service of God. And,
First, As the Lord said of the Jews, You only have I chosen of all the
families of the earth: so I believe the Lord may justly say of our Kings
dominions, that he showed more love and favor unto them, then he did to any
other Kingdom of the World; for whatsoever good he did to others, he did the
same to us. And he showed two more signal favors to us, then he did to any
other Kingdom of all Christendom; As

I. He raised the good Emperor Constantine, the Son of Helen out of Britain,
to close up the days of persecution, and shut the doors of the Idol-Temples.

II. When the mysts of ignorance, and errors, and superstition had covered and
overshadowed almost all the Church of Christ, God sent successively no less
then five such excellent Protestant Princes, King Edward the sixth, Queen
Elizabeth, King James, and King Charles the I. and II. (as no other Kingdom had
the like) to protest against all the Popish errors and superstition, and to
make such a perfect reformation of Religion, that, both for Doctrine and
Discipline, no Church in Christendom is so purely and so perfectly established,
as these Churches of our Kings dominions are, such love and such mercies of God
to us, as exceeded all the blessings of the earth, and showed to no other
Nation of the world in such a measure, but to this.

And what reward, I pray you, What requital have we rendered unto God.
have we and our people rendered unto God for those great unparalleled benefits
that he has done unto us? I do profess I have been a man ever faithful to my
King, and ever fearless of all the dangers of the world; and therefore, I must
say the truth, as Saint Steven told the Jews, though I should fare as Saint
Steven did, that as they were a stiff-necked people, that have always resisted
the Holy Ghost, and persecuted the Prophets, and been the traitors and
murderers of Christ: so have the major part of us showed themselves a
rebellious Nation, that confederated to assist the Devil, to requite Gods
extraordinary signal favor to us, with extraordinary signal contempt of Gods
service, and signal malice to all his servants above any other nation of the
World, by raising out of us, and bringing in amongst us, the great Antichrist,
that is, the great enemies of Christ, you know whom, The Long Parliament.
to slay the two witnesses of Jesus Christ, which were Cohors Magistratuum, and
Chorus Prophetarum, 1. the best and blessed King Charles the First, that like a
goodly Oak, or the Cedar of Lebanon, was cut down with all his boughs and
branches of Magistracy; and 2. all the Seers, that were the eyes, the light,
Those were the 2 witnesses
and the reverend Governors of Gods Church: and instead of them to bring in
the wild bore out of the wood, the great Usurper, to destroy the vineyard of
Christ; and Gebal and Ammon, and Amalec, Ps. 83.7.
the Philistims, with them that dwell at Tire, the whole rabble of
Presbyterians, Independants, Anabaptists, Quakers, and other sects, which are
the false Prophet, to devour the revenues of the Church, and to destroy all the
houses of God in the land: and so to corrupt the whole Service of that good God
that had so graciously done such great things for us, as I have fully showed it
heretofore, and will hereafter be manifested for truth, every day more and more.

And if these things be a good requital, or a just thankfulness to God for all
the benefits that he has done unto us, judge you.

But to leave these monsters of men for their imparalell'd ingratitude, What
God has done for every one of us in particular. 1 What good things he has
bestowed on us.
let us return to our selves here present, and see what God has done for every
one of us; for he made thee a man or a woman, when he might have made thee a
beast; and he gave thee all thy limbs, thy sight, and thy senses, when thou
might have beenborn, like him that was so, blind from his mothers womb. I am
sure thou would be very thankful to that Surgeon that would but preserve
thy finger; and what thanks owe thou to him, that gave thee all thy members,
and whatsoever else thou have? good wit, larg memory, strong body, comely
proportion, loving wise, sweet children, riches, honor, favor, preferment,
and all that thou have; all is from God. And that which is far better then all
these; for herein, Dedit te tibi Deus, He did but only give thee unto thy
self, and those temporal blessings that are momentary: but he redeemed thee
from the pit wherein there is no water, and in this thy redemption, Dedit se
tibi Deus, God gave himself unto thee, and his only Son to die for thee, he
sends his servants to teach thee, and his Holy Spirit to work all the good
gifts that are in thee to make thee a good Christian here, that thou may be
for ever blessed hereafter. And

2. 2 From how many evils he has preserved us.
If thou had these eyes, to look behind thee, thou might see, not only
how much good the Lord God has bestowed upon thee, but also from how many
evils he has preserved thee: for Satan, like a roaring Lion would have
devoured thee, thine enemies that rose up against thee would have undone thee,
if the Lord himself had not been on thy side; Ps. 124.1, 2.
and, as the Psalmist says, they would have swallowed thee up quick, when they
were so wrathfully displeased at thee; yea thine own self many times, by thy
desperate riding, running, jumping, or the like, might perhaps have broken
thy bones, thy limbs, or thy neck, if thy good God had not reached his hand to
save thee from falling, as he did to Saint Peter to preserve him from sinking.

And are not these things blessings worthy to be remembered?

O that we would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness, and declare the
wonders that he does for the children of men? And that we would sometimes cast
our eyes behind us, to see what requital we have rendered unto God for all
those benefits that he has done for us; and especially for bringing our
Gracious King unto us, and restoring both the Church to her purity, to her
rights, and service of God, and the Commonwealth to its peace and tranquillity.

For as the Prophet David says, I called mine own ways to remembrance: So
should every one do, call his ways to remembrance; that, if he finds, he
has been careful in God's service and a faithful Steward in God's house, it
may be a comfort unto his Conscience, Quia immensa est laetitia de memoria
transactae virtutis, because the remembrance of former virtues, and of our
Service and thankfulness unto God, will bring a great deal of joy and comfort
unto our selves; or if he has blasphemed Gods Name, neglected his Word, robbed
his Church, and offended his Majesty, he may repent, and as Job says, abhor
himself in dust and ashes.

But that I may the better and the sooner persuade you to fear God, and to
serve him, Two things to be considered to move us to serve God.
and to do that which is just and honest in his sight, I shall with Moses
desire you to remember the days of old, and consider the years of many
generations, and therein to observe but these two things.

First, How God blessed those that walked in his ways. Secondly, How he
plagued those that neglected his service, and transgressed his commands.
1. 1. How God blessed those that served him.
Enoch walked with God, and God took him to himself: Noah was a just man, and
God preserved him from the deluge: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph feared the
Lord, and the Lord blessed them in all that they took in hand: and the Prophet
David generally says, Psalm. 112.1, 2, 3.
blessed is the man that fears the Lord, that has great delight in his
commandments, his seed shall be mighty upon earth, riches and pienteousness
shall be in his house, Proverb 10.7. etc. 20.7.
and his righteousness endures for ever: and Solomon says the like, that the
memorial of the just is blessed, and his children are blessed after him. And
therefore if thou love thy children, and would have them to grow great and
to prosper in the world, be just in all that thou do, and neither rob God of
his right, nor oppress, cozen, or defraud thy poor neighbor; which not done
are the chiefest, if not the only things, that will bring the curse of God
upon thee and thy Posterity. For,

2. 2. How God plagued those that transgressed his commandments and neglected
his service.
Do but cast thine eyes behind thee, and consider how God plagued the
unrighteous Generations; and you shall find, that when the old world corrupted
their ways, the Lord swept them all away with the deluge; when the cry of
Sodom and Gomorrha came to the ears of God, God destroyed them with fire and
brimstone: so when the cry of the innocent servants of Christ shall not be
heard to have justice done unto them, because of the great friends and power of
their oppressors, then as the Psalmist says, The Lord will hear their cry and
will help them.

And here to terrify offenders from their wickedness, I could willingly
enlarge my discourse, to show the fearful examples of Gods judgment against
many sorts of Malefactors; but my short allowance of time will scarce permit me
to give you the sight of some few judgments against and upon these four
predominant sins, that are so rife amongst us, and so pernicious unto us, 1.
Rebellion, The four usual sins of these days.
2. Perjury, 3. Injustice, 4. Sacrilege.


1. For Rebellion, this our last Age, 1. Rebellion.
and the many Plots and Practices of wicked and fanatic Rebels now peeping
forth amongst us, do sufficiently show how apt we are to fall into it, though
it be as bad as the sin of witchcraft, which is the giving of our souls by a
Contract unto the Devil: but the dreadful vengeance of God for the Rebellion of
Corah, Dathan and Abiram against their Governors, when the earth opened her
mouth and swallowed them down quick to Hell, and the heavy judgment of God
upon Absolon for rebelling against King David, which followed him hard at the
heels, until he came to the bough where he was hanged, and the shameful yet
most justly deserved death of our late Rebels, and of many more the like
Viliaines, that I could quote to you out of Histories, should deter them from
this unnatural sin of Rebellion, and keep them within the bounds of their
obedience to their Governors, which is more acceptable in the sight of God
then any sacrifice that we can offer him: or if this can not do it, then may
they look for the like end, as those that committed the like sins.

2. For Perjury, it is so pernicious a sin, and yet so general, 2. Perjury.
that I know not how to express the hainousness thereof. But I find this
perjury to be like the three headed Cerberus.

1. Of those Inferiors, that either for bribes and reward, 1. Of Inferiors.
or for fear of their Landlords or other great men, will most falsely swear
before Judge or Jury to the taking away of the goods, lands, or life of many
innocent men, 2. Of Superiors.
which is a sin worthy to be punished by the Judges, as being the utter ruin
of many men, fatherless and widows.

2. Of Superiors which break their says and oaths that they make unto their
Inferiors. And such a forsworn wretch was Lysander the Admiral of the
Lacedaemonians, Lysander.
Tissaphernes that brake his oath which he made with the Grecians,
Tissaphernes. Cleomenes.
and Cleomenes King of Lacedemon that did the like with the Argians, but he was
sufficiently plagued by the just judgment of God for his perfidiousness and
perjury, when the women of Argos overthrew the greatest part of his Army, and
he with a knife killed himself. And many more Tyrants and Commanders I could
name of this kind, that neither feared God, nor regarded their faith with men;
and therefore were plagued by the just judgments of God.

3. 3. Of the middle sort.
The other sort of perjurers are of a middle size, and great men, that either
through discontent or hope to be made greater, Eccles. 8.2.
do break their faith, and falsify the oath of God, as Solomon calls it; and
so prove Rebels and Traitors unto their Kings and Governors.

But how does the just God reward these perfidious and perjured Villains? 1.
How Neclas served Duringus for his treachery to the Son of Vratislas.
And how do most wise men deem and deal with them? but as Neclas did with
Duringus, who to secure Neclas, as he said, in his Throne, falsified his faith
to his Prince, and killed the Son of Vratislas, that was the next Heir unto the
Crown; hoping that for his good service he should be much favored and well
rewarded of Neclas: but the wise Prince abhorring such perfidiousness, said
unto him, that perjury and treachery could not be mitigated and wiped away by
any good turns or after-service; and therefore whereas he expected a reward for
his good service done unto him, he should have it according to his merit. For
of three things he should choose which he would. 1. To kill himself with a
poinyard; Aenaeas Sylv Hist. Bobem. c. 11.
or, 2. Hang himself with an halter; or, 3. Cast himself down from the Rock of
Visgrade: and he hanged himself upon an Elder tree, which while it stood, was
called Duringus tree, 2. How Selim used Ladislas, Kerezin. Camerar. Hist.
Meditat. l. 1. page 20. c. 7. Johan. Menarius Histor ^urc, l. 4. c. 22.
as Aenaeas Sylvius writes.

And though Ladislas Kerezin did a very good turn to Selim, in yielding up to
him the strong place of Hiula; yet for his perjury and perfidiousness he caused
him to be brought to a most miserable death, which you may see in Camerar. And
the same Selim did the like to a Jewish Physician, whom after the good service
he had done unto him, he caused to be beheaded for his treachery against his
Father, saying, that upon the least discontent or hope of reward, he would not
stick to do to him as he did to his Father; and therefore he had no reason to
let him live, because commonly Traitors are double Traitors, and as unfaithsul
to him whom they serve, as to him whom they have betrayed And so Soliman his
Son promised his Daughter with a very great dowry to a certain Traitor for
yielding unto him the Isle of Rhodes; and when he got the Island, 3. How Soliman
used the Traitor that yielded to him the I Will of Rhodes.
he brought his Daughter in a magnifical pomp unto him, and said, thou see I
am a man of my word; but forasmuch as you are a Christian, and thy Wife a
Mahumetan, and I am loath to have a Son in Law, that is not a Musulman;
therefore it is not satisfactory to me, that in hope of favor and gain thou
turn thy coat for fashion sake: Camerar. l. 1. c. 7. p. 21.
but thou must also put off thy skin which is baptized and uncircumcised, and
so he caused him to be flead alive. And the same Solomon used the betrayers of
Nadast that defended the Castle of Buda in like manner.

And the King of Henetia having promised Marriage to Romilde the Wife of Prince
Sigulphus, 4. How the King of Henetia served Romilda the Wise of Sigulphus.
Aventinus l. 3. Annal. Bavar.
which had fallen in love with him, as Potiphars Wife did with Joseph, so soon
as she delivered unto him the City of Friol, did after her marriage and one
nights lodging with her, cause her to be set, and married to a sharp stake, as
a worthy punishment of her treachery.

And the Emperor Aurelian did not much better use the Traitor Heraclemon, nor
Brennus Demonica, 5. How Aurelian served Heraclemon.
that betrayed into his hands the City of Ephesus, as Titus Live. says the
Daughter of Sp. Tarpeius betrayed the City of Rome unto the Sabines, and for
her reward lost her life on the Tarpeian Hill.

But though I could produce to you very many more examples of this kind, 6.
How Mahomet served John Justinian.
yet I will close up this point with what Mahomet did to John Justinian of
Genua, who promised to deliver Constantinople into the Emperors hands, so he
would make him King of such a place that he desired. And Mahomet yielded and
assured him that he would do it, Pet. Primauday c. 39. page 423.
and so he did; for as, soon as ever the said Justinian had betrayed the City
into his hands, he presently made him King for that good service which he had
done unto him; but for a reward of his treachery to his Lord and Master
Augustulus, he cut off his head within three days after.

And so all the wise men that I have read of, do conceive that no good service
done to succeeding Kings, can merit the blotting out of the perjury and
perfidiousness of Traitors to their former Kings and Masters; but that after
they be rewarded for their good turns done to the latter, they should likewise
receive the merit of their perfidiousness to the former.

And the reason is rendered by the foresaid Sages. Theodorus in Collect. l. 2.
The reasons why perfidiousness should not be pardoned.


1. Because that as Theodoric the Arian said, when he cut off the head of an
Orthodox Deacon whom he loved, because he revolted, (to please Theodoric, as he
thought) to Arianism, they that keep not their oaths and faith to God, can
never be faithful to any mortal man.

2. Flav. Vopisc. in vita Aurelian.
Because that as Aurelian said, when he suffered Heraelemon, which had done him
so good service, to be slain, he could not believe that he which would betray
his Country, and prove faithless to his own Prince, could ever continue
faithful unto him; but that upon the like discontent or hope of a greater gain,
such Traitors as will turn the leaf, and sail with every wind, will become as
treacherous to their latter benefactors, as they have been unto their former
Masters. And therefore though we should forgive them as Christians; yet it is
neither Wisdom nor policy to believe them as friends, because not only the
Fable of the Snake, but the Son of Syrach also teaches us, what little credit
is to be given to reconciled friends, Eccles. 10.12. And the wise heathen bids
us, semper diffidere, to suspect such faithless men continually.

Pardons unto the Traitors for some special service done unto them: Can they
afterward punish them for their precedent offenses unto others?

Cicero says, every man is bound (and much more it is for the honor of a
Prince) to keep his word and promises inviolable; though upon some exigent
necessity, he may be constrained to make the same to his prejudice, and against
his will: and it was well said, that the bare word of a Prince should be of as
great force as the oath of a private man.

But though Kings and Princes should inviolably observe their words in their
Pardons granted unto Rebels and Traitors and other Malefactors; Not to
countenance and favor those that have been ^ray^ors: and why.
yet as Philip King of Macedon answered Lasthenes, that betrayed the City of
Olynthum, and Augustus Caesar said to Rymetalces King of Thracia, that had
forsaken Antonius, to join with him, that he loved the treason that did him
good, but he could not endure the Traitor that betrayed his Master. And
Alexander Severus was of the same mind, but that he joined cruelty with his
hatred unto the Traitors; for when he had enticed many Captains of Piscennius
Niger, his Competitor of the Empire, to disclose their Masters secrets, and had
served his turn of them, and settled his affairs, he made all those Traitors,
Herod. l. 3.
and their children also to be put to death, as Herodian writes. So the wisest
men conceived that they ought not to countenance and favor those that had been
Traitors unto other Princes; though they had done good service unto them: and
that for these three reasons.

1. For that he which has turned one leaf can turn another; and he that has
betrayed my Father, may upon the like hopes and surmises betray me likewise;
and he that has been a Rebel, knows the way to become a Rebel.

2. For that this honoring and magnifying of Rebels and Traitors to former
Princes, for their good service done to latter Masters, may prove to be an
encouragement for others to become Rebels and Traitors in like manner against
their Kings. For when amongst many thousands of Rebels, they see but few
punished, the rest pardoned, and many of them favored and preferred, why may
not the seditious think, that they shall either prevail; or if miss of their
enterprise, they may escape the fortune of those few that shall be punished,
and be magnified like those that they do see thus rewarded?

3. For that this favoring and countenancing of those that have been Rebels
and false, is a great offense and discouragement to those that have ever
continued saithful and loyal, especially if they see themselves postponed and
neglected.

And therefore the Kings and Princes that I told you of, thought it neither
wisdom nor policy to regard and favor those, whom they pardoned for their
treachery to their former Princes, though they had done never so good service
unto themselves; and if all Kings did so, I believe fewer Traitors would spring
up among the people.

And this appears plainly by our new Plotters of Rebellions and Treasons now
amongst us in this Kingdom of Ireland; for who and what are they that do thus
murmur and mutter against both God and his Anointed, the King and his
Lieutenant, the Church and Commonwealth? But those that have been members of
the Beast, and limbs of the great Antichrist, the Rebels and Traitors that
rose and warred, and some no doubt, but had their hands or fingers dipped deep
in the blood of that blessed Saint and glorious Martyr, our late most gracious
King Charles the First: and having escaped their just deserved shame and death,
and being so highly rewarded by their Grand Masters for their great wickedness,
with the lands of the Irish, without distinction, whether they were bloody
Murderers and Rebels against their King, or innocent Papists, that were both
loyal unto their King, and succourers of the Protestants, and now seeing the
touchstone of truth and justice, rendering to every one his own, according to
his merit, either of nocency or innocence, they stamp and stare, and being
moved with madness, like boys at blind manbuff, they let fly their Arrows,
even bitter words; nay, false scandalous, rebellious, and treacherous words
against the King, against his Lieutenant, and against the peace and happiness
of this whole Kingdom: they care not whom they traduce, so they may stir up the
coals of contention, and move the discontented to a new Rebellion.

And what ways do they take for this, but the very same which they had learned
and practiced before in England under the Long-Parliament.

1. To tax and to traduce the good King for doing that they know not, nor ever
shall be able to prove that he did; but the Scots say that he did: and so they
do say a thousand things more then I believe to be true: and they should
believe nothing, especially what they know not, against their King, when as all
other men, that are both wise and honest, can sufficiently answer and justify
all that ever his now Majesty did. And I, that am not worthy to be of his
counsel, and to know the reasons of his actions; yet could show you very just
and sufficient reasons for every thing that ever I heard his Majesty did: and I
would do it, but that Himself and his Council, I know, can justify all his
actions, with many far deeper reasons then I can dave into.

Therefore these very firebrands of sedition, knowing this, would a little
excuse his Majesty, by laying the faults upon his Counselors, that seduced
him. And who are they? They speak in general, and in universalibus latet error;
so did the long Parliament against our late King: there they learned their
lesson, and they walk in the same paths. But the former Parliaments could name
their names, the Duke of Buckingham: so can these men name the Duke of Ormond.
And what has he done? I observe two things that they charge him with.

1. To testify what he knew to be truth, and these men conceived to be
otherwise; A mighty fault! because they had not their eyes open to see the
truth, his Grace offended to testify the truth.

2. In obeying his Majesty's gracious goodness, by relieving those that were
necessitous, and perhaps, for ought that they know, had done his Majesty very
good service, and, for ought that we know, had done no injury to any of our
men; and this is a sin unpardonable with these uncharitable men. I, but they
will say, by relieving these he lets the Army starve: and I demand, what
Subject ever did pawn his own lands, melt his own plate, lay out his own moneys
to relieve the King's Armies, and to show himself, I will not say more
faithful, but I say, near so faithful to his King, and so bountiful a
benefactor and friend to all the King's loyal Subjects, as the Duke of Ormend
has always been? I must, and ever will, with all thankfulness acknowledge it;
when the long Parliament and their whelps had robbed me of all that I had, all
the relief and subsistence, which I had from all the friends in the world, was
that bountiful gift, which this noble Duke sent me by Sir George Lane: And I
could name the many many more, to whom his Grace did the like; And are these
things, faults worthy to be reproved? And I am sure he hated the Rebellion, and
disowned the Rebels of this Nation as much or more then any man: and would you
have him to be an enemy to the postnati, and a stranger to the innocent? God
has made him a more honorable, and a more gracious man.

I, but we are not yet come to the quick, the English interest, by the favor
of the Duke unto the Irish and the Judges of the Court of Claim, is much
shaken, and is like to be dismembered and left inanimate.

But would you have the English interest to continue, be it right or wrong? or
would you have it so to continue, that God might bless it, and it to prosper?
If so, then let it be rooted in justice and established in truth; or otherwise,
the breath of the Lord will scatter it, and the wrath of God will soon destroy
it; and instead of blessing, will, as Jacob said, bring the curse of God upon
you and your Posterity. And you might see if you had your eyes open, the great
care of my L Duke, and the great pains and diligence of the Court of Claim, to
search out the truth of every cause, that the innocent should not be made
guilty, nor the nocent carry away the victory. And what more would you have
done?

Yet, as I said before, they that have learned the way to be Rebels, do know
the way to be rebellious still.

But if they will needs charge our good King and the Duke's Grace for any
fault, let them do it for their being too merciful and mild, in suffering
them and others that are like them, to live, that had so justly deserved to
dye; and especially if they would suffer them to enjoy the Lands of the Church,
and the Possessions of them that are innocent.

3. The next reigning sin, that spreads it self amongst men, 3 Injustice.
is injuftice: and I wish we would cast our eyes behind us, to see how God
hates, and has plagued this monstrous vice, which brings forth so many
pernicious effects, and destroys all the duties of honesty. The wise Solomon
says, That oppression makes a wise man mad; Prove. 7.7.
and oppression is but one branch of injustice: and therefore injustice is far
worse then any oppression. For if justice be such a general virtue, as
Aristotle says, that he which has it, has all other virtues; then certainly,
he that is unjust must be filled with an huge heap of vices, when as this is
such a cardinal sin, as never walks alone. And therefore as Justice exalts a
Nation; so Injustice translateth a Kingdom from one Nation to another people,
as it did the Monarchy of the Assyrians unto the Medes, and that of the Medes
and Persians unto the Grecians. And it pulls down the wrath and vengeance of
God, not only upon the person that is unjust, and does injustice; but also
upon the heads, many times, of all his posterity: as, for the Injustice done to
Naboth, God destroyed Ahab, Ahab.
and rooted out his whole offspring. And I could spend my whole hour in
examples of this kind, but I will content my self with two or three. As,

1. Of Ferdinando the fourth King of Castile, Ferdinando.
who did most unjustly condemn two Knights to death; and one of them cried, O
thou unjust Judge, we do cite thee to appear within thirty days before the
Tribunal of Jesus Christ, to receive judgment for thine injustice; and so upon
the last of those days he dyed, to receive his sentence according to his
summons. And one Lapparel, a Provost of Paris, Lapparel.
caused a poor man, that was prisoner in the Chastilet, to be executed by
giving him the name of a rich man, who being guilty and condemned, was set at
liberty in the place of the poor man: but the just judgment of God discovered
his injustice, and being accused and condemned, he was hanged for his labor;
and so Philip King of Macedon was killed by Pausanias a mean Gentleman, Philip
Micedo. Demetrius.
because he denied to do him justice against Antipater that had wronged him;
and Demetrius for throwing the petitions of his subjects into the River, and
denying to do them justice they all forsook him, and Pyrrhus took away his
Kingdom. And many other men I could name to you, that their injustice has
undone them.

And therefore all men should take heed of committing this horrible sin of
injustice, either by doing wrong, or denying right unto others.

And yet I am ashamed to speak it, The injustice of some Judges.
though I shall not be afraid to Write it, how gravely some Judges have sat
upon the feat of judgment to pronounce unrighteous judgments, and think to
cover all their iniquity with the fig leaves of the formalities of their Laws
to overthrow the reality of justice.

Oh beloved, Monstrum horrendum ingens est, it is a most horrible thing to have
injustice done from the seat, and from the Ministers of justice; when a man is
apparently wronged, oppressed, and expulsed out of house and home, and shall
with a deal of travel and a great deal of expenses come to a Court of justice
to be righted, and instead of being redressed, he shall see there seelus
sceleribus tectum, his former wrongs finely handled and loaded with far greater
wrongs. Do you think that this is well pleasing unto God, or that such
injustice shall escape unpunished? no, no; for they shall find that there is a
God which judges the earth, and that his judgment will be according to truth,
without partiality, either to Jew or Gentile, which here among men I see is not
so.

But as I read that Diogenes seeing some petty thieves led to the place of
execution laughed exceedingly, and being demanded why he laughed? he answered
to see the great thieves lead the little thieves to the Gallows: so if he
should see men forcibly expelled out of their possessions, and the forcible
entrers legally acquitted; or if he should see the poor Irish Catholics driven
out of house and home, either because they were Irish rebels which justly
deserved it, or because they were Romish Catholics, which should not therefore
be destroyed; and should see the great English Sectaries (that had been greater
rebels) countenanced and magnified, and to enjoy the others Lands and Livings:
would he not laugh at this justice? which is just like that which we read of in
l. 1. of Philip Commines when Charelois lost the Field, and his Captains, and
their Troopers fled away, he gave the offices and places of them that fled ten
leagues to those that had fled twenty leagues beyond them.

Therefore I say to you, whom God and the King have made Judges of these things
for the settlement of this Kingdom; As you have done hitherto, so still ride
on with your honor and have no respect of Persons, nor of Nation, nor of
Religien: but do that which is just and righteous in the sight of God, and as
God has blessed you and preserved you hitherto, so he will still bless you and
preserve you for ever more.

And for the preservation of better justice then I see in many places, I shall
speak more of it in another place, and after another manner; for you may be
sure, that Kingdom shall never be happy, where oppression is frequently used,
and iniquity protected by injustice, and especially by the Courts of Justice.
And therefore to the end that true justice might be truly observed, I could
wish the Parliament would make some Acts and Laws against many abuses
practiced by some cunning Lawyers in the very Courts of Justice; The abuse of
some cunning Lawyers in quashing of Indictments.
and especially against the frequent and abusive quashing of Indictments, which
is a sin of no slender malignity. For when a poor man far from the fountain is
by vielence oppressed, and he indicts his oppressors, then presently comes a
Certiorari and removes it to the Kings Bench, and there the Lawyers are so
skillful in the tricks and quiddities of the Law and the Cases of John A-Nokes
and John A-Stiles, that they say there can hardly be any indictment framed, but
they are able to find a flaw to quash it, which I was told by great Lawyers.
And what a wrong is this to his Majesty in his fines? what an injury to the
poor men that are oppressed, and what encouragement to all those wicked men
that are so ready to offer all violence unto their neighbors which are not
able to indict the same offenders three or four times over, till they shall
find a man able to draw a faultless indictment.

And if this be not a grievous greivance worthy to be redressed, if you desire
the preservation of justice, judge you. And therefore it were good that some
better way were devised for the framing of Indictments or the not quashing of
them so easily and so frequently as they are reported to be.

4. 4. Sacrilege.
The last frequent sin that I shall at this time desire you to cast your eyes
behind you, to behold Gods detestation of it, and his punishments that he
pours out upon the offenders, is sacrilege, which is the taking away and
withholding of those Revenues which God has appointed, and godly men have
dedicated for the maintenance of Gods service, and the religion of Jesus
Christ, and so the robbing of God himself, both of his honor and service: a
sin so general, that the custom of it has quite taken away the sense of it,
and men think it to be no sin at all.

But I know what some may here say, that now I plead mine own cause.

I will briefly answer as Samuel did unto the people, 1 Samuel 12.3.
and I say, that I sued indeed for the Church right: but I testify before the
Lord, and your Grace, and you All, that I did it not to enrich my self; for I
thank God I have enough both for my self and my relation, wife, children and
friends: but I did it for the right of the Church, and I resolved and vowed
that whatsoever I recovered, I would by the grace of God wholly bestow it upon
the reparation of the Church; so that recovering it I should be not one penny
the richer, and loosing it, not one penny the poorer. And I desired nothing but
what I conceived to be the right of the Church, because I know God loves not to
be honored with unjustly gotten goods.

But now finding that as the Prophet says, I have labored in vain, and I have
spent my strength for naught; and seeing the partiality and injustice of men, I
will with patience submit my self to that strength which is beyond my ability
to oppose, and study to serve my God another way: because I see that as Davin
says, the sons of Zervia are too strong for me, because we that were faithful
to our King were fleeced and bareshorne, and left poor and beggarly, and they
that served the Beast and adheared to the long Parliament, and were arrant
rebels against our late good King, have got all our Lands and our Moneys to
make friends withal, and to keep us still under hatches: and so though nos
fuimus Troes, yet now they are the men, and without envy, let then enjoy their
prosperity, so they forsake their iniquity, and repent them of their former
impiety.

And so desiring you to bear with this my just defense, I shall proceed in this
discourse, for none other end but to discharge mine own duty, and for the good
of your souls, to avoid the just wrath of God for a sin so highly displeasing
unto God; and to that purpose I shall desire you to read the 2 Mac. c. 3. where
you shall find how that when Simon the mutinous traitor both to God and his
Country, had informed Seleucus King of Asia, of the riches and the treasure of
the Church of Jerusalem, and incited him to seize upon it, and he had sent
Heliodorus his treasurer to fetch it, and Heliodorus came like a Fox,
pretending it was to visit and to reform the disorders of Phoenice and
Caelosyria, but Onias the high Priest perceiving that the goods of the Church
was his errand, his countenance was quite cast down, and the people not
enduring sacrilege, ran some to the Temple, some to the City Gates, and some
gadded up and down the streets as frantic men, like Bacchus froes, and all
lifted up their hands and eyes and voices unto God for the defense of his
Church, and God heard their cry and did help them. For,

Heliodorus was no sooner entered into the treasury, to take away the spoil,
but there appeared to him a terrible man in complete armor of gold, mounted
upon a barbed horse that ran very fiercely at the Kings Treasurer, and trampled
him under-foot; and withal, there appeared two other men of most excellent
beauty and strength, whipping him so, that he was carried out of the place
speechless, and without any hope of life, until God restored him upon the
earnest prayer of the Priest and people.

And to let you see how dangerous a sin is sacrilege to rob the Church, Act.
5.5.
the end of Ananias and Sapphira can bear witness; for though their death was
the punishment of their lying: yet all must grant they were drawn to that sin
by the cord of sacrilege. And if a greedy desire of withholding that from the
Church which themselves had given, was sufficient to open such a window unto
the Devil that he came presently to cast them as a prey to the Jaws of Hell;
how many foul fins do they commit, and how many grievous plagues may they fear
to fall upon their heads, which take away from the Church, that which they
never gave?

And you may remember, that when Egypt in the time of Joseph felt so extreme a
famine, Genesis 47.22. and v. 26.
that the fifth part of the Land was sold to relieve the Land; yet the Patriarch
in all the care that he had both of the Country and of the King, to succor the
one and to enrich the other, never attempted the sale of the Lands of the
Priests, nor once to diminish any jot thereof. And if the holy man in so great
an extremity, never ventured to take away the possessions of the Idolatrous
Priests, though it were to the releif of a whole Kingdom, I wonder with what
face dares any man in the world curtal the maintenance of Gods Church, and take
away those Lands and houses that by religious Princes and other pious men have
been consecrated to Gods service. But, Foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula
cautum. You might be happy, if you would cast your eyes behind you, and by the
examples of Gods judgments upon other sacrilegious persons learn to escape the
punishments of sacrilege, because they are all written for our instruction.
And we read Celce, the Constable of Gertrund King of Burgundy, having, under
the authority of the King his Master, enriched himself, and enlarged his
Territories with the Goods and Lands of the Church, and being one day in the
Church at his Devotion, and hearing thee words of the Prophet, that proclaimed
a woe to them that join house to house, and land to land, he suddenly shricked
in the Congregation, and cried out, This is spoken to me, and this curse is
upon me and upon my Posterity; and so afterward died most miserably. And we
read in the Annals of France, that although Lewis the Sixth, surnamed the Great,
was once the Protector of the Church, and had caused the Count de Claremont,
the Lord de Roussi and other great men, that had pillaged the Bishoprics, to
restore their robberies unto the Church again; yet in his old age when he began
to pull the Church, he was sufficiently punished for it, by the sudden death
of his Eldest Son, which was indeed the very staff of his age, though he was
urged unto it with extreme necessity: They that would see more examples of this
kind, let them look into my Declaration against Sacrilege, and Doctor
Saravia's vindicie sacrae, translated into English by James Martyn.

And if for all this, men will needs have the portion of Gods Church, let them
eat it with that sauce, which God has prescribed in Psalm. 83. and which like
the leprosy of Gehezi, will stick to them and their Posterity for evermore.

they were full of eyes before: 3. Why these beasts were full of eyes before.
and so should we be. And that is to behold and see.

And touching the first, Saint Augustine says most truly, Si quid arrisisset
prosperum, taedebat apprehendere; quia priusquam pene teneretur, avolabat, if
any prosperous thing in this world did seem to smile and offer it self unto me,
I was loath to take it, because that before I could scarce enjoy it, it was
presently snatched from me. For,

1. Friends are like the waters of T^ma sliding away, and turning as the wheel
of your fortune turns.

2. Riches, says the wise man, betake themselves to their wings as an Eagle,
and the sea can drown it, fire consume it, servants waste it, and thieves
bereave us of it.

3. Prove. 23.5.
Honor is but Virtues shadow, a wind that makes fools to swell, but cannot
satisfy any wise man.

4. Beauty is such a thing, as the Daughters of Vanity can tell you that the
Sun will tanne it, a scarr will blemish it, sickness waste it, and age consume
it away, as we read fair Helen wept when she saw the wrinckles of her old face,
which all your black patches cannot make young.

5. And for our Health, which is the greatest happiness in this life, we see
man's body is subject to a thousand diseases, fraught with frailties within,
wrapped in miseries without, uncertain of life, and sure of death.

And so all the things of this world are but like the Apples of Sodom,
pleasant to the eyes, and provoking to the appetite; but vanishing into smoke
when they are touched with the teeth.

And therefore our whole life is but painted over, as some Ladies do their
faces, with vain semblances of Beauty and Pleasure; and it is attended on the
one side with whole troops of sorrows, sicknesses, wants and discontents; and
on the other side with uncertainty of continuance and certainty of dissolution.
And,

2. 2. The uncertainty of our state. Romans 9.21.
For our state, all is in the hand of God, as the clay is in the hand of the
Potter, who can of the same lump make one vessel to honor, and another to
dishonor; and the Heathens conceived all was at the disposing of fortune,
which they according to their ignorance, took for God, and said, -- Te facimus
fortuna Deam. When they saw that, as the Poet says, Vna eademque manus vulnus
opemque tulit: The same hand that has cast us down can raise us up: and the
same God that raised us to honor, can bring us down to the dust; and can
either prolong our days, or cut them off at his pleasure.

And who then would not serve such a Master, and be afraid to offend such a
Lord, as has our life, our wealth, and our woe in his own hands and at his own
disposing? O consider this all you that forget God, and think of it, lest he
take you away, and tear you all to pieces: or if this cannot move you to fear
God. Then,

2. Cast your eyes before you, 2. To look unto the things that are to come.
to look unto the things that are to come, and must fall upon the world: and
they are many, but especially and inevitably these four, 1. Death. 2.
Judgment. 3. Heaven. 4. Hell.


And these are quatuor novissima and terribilissima, the four last things, and
the most terrible things that can be to all wicked men to think of them; and
they may serve as four excellent Preachers, to dissuade and terrify all men
from evil, and to call them continually to the service of God. For the Son of
Sy^ach says, Whatsoever thou take in hand, Eccles. 7.36.
remember the end, and thou shall never do amiss. And,

1. Death makes an end of our life, 1. Of death.
and before it shuts the eyes of our bodies, it commonly opens the eyes of
our consciences. And then every man shall see his own state, though he seldom
or never thought of the same before. For,

1. 1. The state of the wicked. Revel. 12.12.
The wicked man shall see all his sins set before his face, and Satan will now
bestir himself to gain his soul; for he knows that his turn is short, and
therefore he will tell him, that if he would have entered into life, Romans 2.13.
he should have kept the commandments, that not the hearers, but the doers of
the Law shall be justified, that if the just shall scarce be saved, where shall
he, being such a wicked wretch as he is, appear? when as the Apostie tells him
plainly, that neither adulterer, nor fornicator, nor covetous person, nor the
like, Traitor, Rebel, Perjurer, 1 Cor. 6.9, 10.
or such other, shall inherit the kingdom of God: and so what the Preachers of
God now cannot beat into the thoughts of these careless men, this damned spirit
will then irremovably settle in their deepest considerations.

O then what agonies and perplexities will tear the woeful hearts of these
wicked men? In that day (says the Lord) I will cause the Sun to go down at
noon, Amos 8.9, 10.
and I will darken the earth in the clear day, I will turn their feasts into
mournings, and their songs into lamentations, that is, I will make all those
things that were wont most sweetly to delight them, now most of all to torment
them; for now that pleasure which they had of sin, shall turn to be as bitter
as gall, when they do see, that as the Father says, transit jucunditas non
reditura, and manet anxietas non peritura, and now they must die, and live they
can no longer; and Satan, whose will they did, and whose ways they followed
all their life, will not forsake them at their death, but will say, Me you have
served, and from me you must expect your wages.

For so we read, that the Devil assailed some of the best Saints, as Saint
Martin, Saint Bernard, Ignatius, Eusebius, and others; and if these things be
done in a green tree, what shall be done in a withered, says our Savior? If
he be so busy about the Saints, what will he do to sinners? And this is the
state of a wicked man at his dying day. But,

In the death of the godly it is not so; 2. The state of the godly.
for having served God all his life, Prove. 14.32. 2 Timothy 1.12.
he has hope in his death: and he knows not whom he needs to fear, because
he knows whom he has believed: and when his body is weakest his faith is
strongest: and therefore with Saint Paul, he desires to be dissolved, and he
longs for death, that he may be with him which was dead, and is alive, and
lives for evermore: and he is well contented, that his body shall go to the
grave, that his soul may go to glory: and that his flesh shall sleep in the
dust, that his spirit may rejoice in heaven. And this is the state of the godly
man at the day of his death.

And therefore, if men would feriously consider this before they come to this,
then certainly the fear of the most fearful death of the wicked, and the love
of the most comfortable death of the godly, would make them to have some care
of Godly lives, and to repent them of their wickedness. And therefore well did
Moses, and we with Moses, wish, that men would consider their latter end. And
yet this is not the end of all; for after death comes judgment. And so,

Secondly, This judgment is either 1 Particular, 2 Judgment and that two fold.
or 2 General


1. As soon as ever the soul is parted from the body, 1. Particular.
before the body is laid in the grave, the soul of the wicked is fetched by the
Devils, and carried into the place of torments, and the soul of the godly is
received by the Angels into Abraham's bosom, Luke 16.22, 23.
as our Savior shows most plainly in the story of Dives and Lazarus. And

2 Because the whole world, 2. General.
both of men and Angels might see and approve the just judgment of God; and
that the whole man, both body and soul might receive the full reward of their
due deserts, the Lord has appointed a day, says the Apostle, in the which he
will judge the world in righteousness, Act. 17.31.
that is, by Jesus Christ.

And this is that day, which Christ and his Apostles, and all the faithful
preachers of Gods word, would have all men always to remember, and to set it
before their eyes. For so Saint Hierom says, Whatsoever I do, whether I eat
or drink or whatsoever else I am about, me thinks I hear that doleful voice of
the Archangel sounding in mine cares, and saying, surgite mortui and venite ad
judicium, arise you dead, and come to judgment, says the Holy Father,
Itremble all my body over; and so Felix, though he was but a Heathen, trembled,
Act. 24.25.
as Saint Paul reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come.
And so indeed, it should make any heart to tremble, that would seriously
consider but these two things.

1 The manner of Christ his coming For, Two things to be considered concerning
this judgment.
2 The terror of his proceeding For,
First in that day, there shall be signs in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in
the Stars, The Sun shall be darkened, the Moon shall not give her light, the
Stars shall fall from the skies, and all the powers of heaven shall be moved,
the Elements shall be dissolved with heat, and the earth shall be consumed with
fire.

Whereby you may see, what a dreadful thing is sin; for what have these
senseless creatures deserved, that they should be thus severely punished, and
thus travel in sorrow and pain, but because they rose not up against us, when
we rose up against God? He will therefore fight against them, because they did
not fight against us, when we do fight against him. And what a fearful
contagion of sin is this, that subjecteth the very heavens unto vanity? And
therefore most wretched are we, in whom dwells nothing else but heaps of sin
and iniquity. But to go on.

Then the distress of nations shall be great, The distress of Nations how great.
and men shall wither away for fear (says our Savior) for when destruction
shall be dispatched as a whirlwind, and God shall burn the earth, as
Holophernes did the Country of Damascus, what fears think you, shall then
affright the hearts of men, and what heaps of perturbations shall run upon the
damned sort, when they shall see all these things playing their last act upon
the fiery stage of this world.

And then they shall see the son of man clothed with the clouds, as with a
garment, riding upon the heavens, The glorious ma^cr^^ Christ ^is coming,
as upon an horse, and coming flying, as upon the wings of the wind, in the
glory of his father with his Angels; and what manner of glory is that?

Moses tells you, that the Lord our God, is a God of Gods, Deuteronomy. 10.
and a Lord of Lords, a great God, mighty and terrible, that accepts no
person, nor takes reward: and Daniel describing the great Majesty of God,
says, that his garments were as white as snow, the hairs of his head like the
purest wool, his throne like the fiery flame, and his wheels like burning
fire: Dan. 7.9, 10.
and there issued forth a fiery stream and went ont from before him; a thousand
thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thous and stood before
him. And it is recorded of the Angels, that one of them slew all the firstborn
of Egypt in one night, and that another of them made such a havoc in the army
of the Assyrians, that, a hundred fouresoore and five thousand of them were all
slain in one night, and were laid on the ground, as corn by a sickle.

And if one Angel could do such Tragic feats, The great power^ (...) the
Angels.
what shall become of the enemies of God, and wicked men when Christ like a man
of war shall buckle his harness unto his side, and come in the glory of his
Father, with so many myriads of heavenly Angels attending him?

Eusebius Emysenius demands, Si talis and tantus sit terror venientis, quis
poterit terrorem sustinere judicantis? if his coming be such and so terrible,
who shall be able to endure the terror of his judgment? And if the Israelites
durst not abide his Majesty, when he came to deliver the Law, how shall the
wicked abide and stand before him, when he comes to render vengeance unto
them, for transgressing his Laws?

And yet they must endure it, And it will be very terrible unto them. For

2. In that day (says our Savior) He, i. e. God shall send his Angels with
the sound of Trumpets, and with a mighty cry, to raise the dead, and to gather
together the Elect from the four winds, and from the one end of the world to
the other, and to bring all men before the judgment seat of Christ; for I have
sworn by my self, Esaias. 45.23.
says the Lord, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall
not return, that every knee shall how unto me, and not one man shall be hidden
from my presence. Alas beloved, if all the bodies of one Army did lie ^^nked
upon one heap, what a ruthful sight would it make? And what a spectacle then
will that be, when so many myriads of men, like the sand of the Sea, shall
stand quaking and trembling before the face of Christ? For,

Then their eyes shall be opened; and what shall the wicked see, but all things
crying vengeance against them, for above them shall be an angry Judge, beneath
them Hell like a boiling furnace, ready to receive them, on the right hand
their sins accusing them, How the wicked shall be encompassed with miseries.
on the left hand the devils ready to torment them, within them a guilty
conscience like Prometheus vulture, continually gnawing them, without them all
damned souls bewailing, and on every side the world burning.

O good God, what will these wicked wretched sinners do, being thus enclosed
with such miseries? how can their hearts sustain these anguishes? Our Savior
tells us that they shall cry to the Mountains, that they would fall upon them,
and so hide them from the face of Christ, but that cannot be; for then Satan
will begin to play his part, How Satan will now play his part.
and say, not bone Deus, O good God, to move him to clemency, but just Judex,
O just Judge, to sharpen him to severity: though these wretched men were thine
by creation, yet now they are mine by transgression, and though thou have
s^ffered for them, yet I have beguiled them, for they have forsaken sacramenta
tua, thy holy sacraments, and they have followed blandimenta mea, my wicked
allurements, they would not be porswaded by thy Preachers, but they would needs
follow their own pleasures.

And therefore, O thou just Judge, seeing they belong unto me, let them even be
condemned with me. So he that before seemed to be an Angel of light, is now
become a Devil of darkness; he that enticed them to all vanities, will now
bring them to all miseries; and he that in paradise would make them like Gods,
does now prove that he made them like devils: And so now he shows himself to
be a devil indeed, and never so much a devil as now, or rather he seems now
to become a Saint, because now he calls for justice.

Then the Lord will look upon them; How wrathfully Christ will look upon the
wicked.
but how shall they be able to endure his looks? for fire is kindled in his
wrath, and it shall burn to the bottom of Hell; out of his mouth go lamps,
and sparks of fire leap out; out of his nostrils comes smonk, as out of a
boiling Caldron; his countenance will be so grim, his lips so burning, and his
face so full of indignation, Job. ^4.13.
that the very Saints will be afraid of his looks, and holy Job cries out, who
shall hide me until the anger of God passes over? or as our last Translation
has it, O that thou would hide me in the grave, that thou would keep me
secret until thy wrath be past? Malach. 3.2.
and the Prophet Malachy demands, who may abide the day of his coming, and
who shall stand when he appears? for he is like a refiners fire which is the
quintessence of fire, and like a Fullers soap which scoureth all things to the
uttermost, and leaves no filth behind it: and therefore how shall the wicked
abide his looks? and if not his looks, how shall they abide his words? For now
they shall hear that fearful sentence pronounced against them, I lictor, liga
manus, go Satan thou executioner, Ps. 149.8.
bind those Kings in fetters, and those Nobles with links of iron and go ye
all, or depart ye accursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his
angels, and then they shall be adjudged to be cast into utter darkness, Matthew.
25.41.
where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. This is the doom of the ungodly.

But upon the righteous, and those godly men that served him he will look with
such an amiable and cherful countenance that the very sight of it will banish
away their fear, and replenish their hearts with joy and gladness; and he will
say unto them, come ye blessed of my father, you have walked in my ways, you
were careful of my service, How Christ will look upon the righteous men that
served him.
you have suffered for my sake, and you have relieved and comforted my poor
members; therefore be you clothed in white robes, and receive the Kingdom
which was prepared for you before the beginning of the world. And this is the
sentence of their absolution,

Well then, if we were like these Beasts full of eyes before, to look, and to
consider of these things now, before they come to pass, would it no whit move
us to seek for the ways of godliness? if not, I would they that regard it not,
would look a little further and behold Gehinnon, the place where they shall be
carried to be tormented. For,

3. 3. The torments of the wicked in Hell.
The wicked being as I told you before, adjudged by God to receive their doom
according to their desert, they shall be forthwith carried by the devils into a
Lake or darksome Vault that is in the midst of the earth, and which burns
with fire and brimstone for evermore. And there in that Lake their music shall
be horrors and howlings, their meat shall be balls of fire, their drink shall
be fountains of tears distilling down always from their eyes, their torments
shall be intolerable, their time endless, and their companions devils: for as
Saint Augustine says, In inferno nec tortores defisient, nec torti miseri
morientur, Aug. de tempore sermon. 55.
sed per millia millia annorum cruciandi, nec tamen in secula liberandi, In
Hell the tormentors shall never fail, nor faint to punish, nor the miserable
wretches ever die, but for thousand thousands of years punished and never to be
delivered; quia ibi erit semper velle quod nunquam erit, Isidorus de summo
bono, The perpetuity of their miseries.
and semper nolle quod nunquam non erit, for there shall be a will never
satisfied, and a nill never gratified; never enjoying the case they would, and
ever suffering the pains they would not And if you dive into the depth of that
dolef^ll Tragedy of miserable Dives, you shall see this truth more sully
consirmed. But,

4. 4. The joys of Heaven.
On the other side, if you cast your eyes on the joys of Heaven, you shall
find that neither eye has seen, nor care heard, nor heart of man can conceive
how inestimable and unexpressable it is: for there our bodies shall be freed
from all sorrows and all tears shall be wiped away from our eyes: and our
minds shall be satissied with all the good that can be desired; for if thou
would have riches, riches and plente^usness are in his house; if thou would
have pleasure, in his presence is fullness of joy, and at his right hand there
is pleasure for evermore; if thou would have life, he gives thee a long
life, even for ever and ever; and in brief, there is a freedom from all evil,
and a full fruition of all good things. Most happy are they that shall be there.

And so you have heard of the four things that are before us, and that are so
imminent, hanging over our heads, that we do not know how soon they may fall
upon us. And therefore we should be full of eyes before us, that we might
always look for the coming of them before they come, that when they come, they
may come to our comfort; for either the continual consideration of these things
will keep us from the ways of wickedness, or we are past all hope of true
happiness, and we may be pitied but not helped.

And therefore let us all most earnestly and humbly pray to God to grant us
these eyes with these beasts, continually to behold and to consider all these
things, that we may escape the dreadful doom of the wicked, and attain to
everlasting happiness through Jesus Christ our blessed Lord and only Savior,
to whom with the Father and the Holy Spirit be ascribed all honor and glory
for ever and ever. Amen.

THE FOURTH SERMON.
REVEL. 4.8. And they rest not, or, ceased not day and night, saying, Holy
holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.


AFTER that the holy Evangelist had described these Beasts, he sets down their
practice, and the exercise that they used. Touching which, we are to consider,
1. Their Constancy, They ceased not, or rest not day and night. 2. Their
Harmony, saying, Holy, holy, holy, etc.


The which Harmony consists of six special parts. That is, 1. The mystery of
the Trinity of persons, in the Unity or one essence of the Deity. 2. The
sanctity, purity, and equity of God, in the word (...). 3. The power,
authority, and dominion of God, in the word (...). 4. The knowledge, sight, and
providence of God, in the word (...). 5. The strength and omnipotence of God,
in the word (...). 6. The continuance and eternity of God, in the words (...).


And these six Points cannot well and fully be explained by any humane wit,
they all and every one of them being, as God is, ineffable and incomprehensible.

And therefore (as Synesius says) as the Geographers use to draw the great
Universe and Compass of the world in a little Map; so I can speak and express
but very little of these great and unspeakable Attributes of the great God.

And here, dear Brother, that read the same, and look for the prosecution
of these parts, I must crave thy patience to bear with me; for that the whole
Sermon that I made of these Points, I quite forgot to take with me to London,
so that I could not have it printed with the former three: out by the grace of
God I intend to set it forth as soon as conveniently I can send it to the
Press. In the interim, I commend us to our good God, to whom be all glory and
honor for evermore. Amen.

Jehovae Liberatori.
