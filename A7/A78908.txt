His Majesty's MESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
HIs Majesty taking notice of an Order lately made by the House of Commons,
whereby that House has unduly assumed to themselves, Authority to Order,
direct and dispose of one hundred thousand pounds, part of those moneys, which
the Adventurers, for the reducing of the Rebels of Ireland, have paid to that
end only to that purpose, to other uses and intents, contrary to the express
words of the Act of Parliament concerning the same, wherein it is enacted, That
no part of the Money which should be paid in according to that Act, shall be
employed to any other purpose, then the reducing of those Rebels, until they
shall be declared to be subdued, Out of His Piety and Princely care for the
conferring and re-establishment of Gods true Religion in that His Kingdom of
Ireland, for the relief of His distressed Subjects there, for the suppressing
of that horrid and bloody Rebellion, for the supply and payment of His Armies
there now in great want and necessity, does strictly require the House of
Commons, as they will answer the contrary to Almighty God, His Majesty, and
those that have trusted them, That they immediately retract, that mischievous,
illegal and unjust Order; wherein His Majesty expects their speedy Answer and
Obedience; and the rather, that He may thereby be secured, that such part of
the four hundred thousand pounds, as is or shall be collected from His good
Subjects of England, by virtue of the late Act of Parliament, whereby the same
is granted, may not likewise (under false pretenses) be diverted from it is
proper use, for which it was intended and misimployed to the disturbance of the
Peace of this Kingdom in a war against His sacred Majesty.

THE ANSWER Of the House of COMMONS To His MAJESTY'S MESSAGE of the 13. of
Aug. 1642.
THe House of Commons having received a Message from His Majesty of the 13. of
August last, whereby they are required to retract an Order made by them for the
borrowing of one hundred thousand pounds of the Adventurers money for Ireland,
supposing that Order very prejudicial to the affairs of Ireland, and contrary
to an Act of Parliament, made this present Sessions, do in the first place
declare that the directions given by His Majesty for the retracting of this
Order, is an high breach of Privilege of PARLIAMENT. And that they cannot
without a deep sense of sorrow call to mind, how Popish and Prelaticall
Counsels, did so far prevail with his Majesty, that two Armies were brought
within the bowels of this Kingdom, and two Protestant Nations ready to w^lter
in each others blood, that when both those Armies had bin a long time defrayed
at the charge of the poor Commons of England, and at length by Gods blessing
upon the endeavors of the PARLIAMENT, quietly disbanded; the same wicked
Counsels (prevented of that design) did soon after raise this bloody and
barbarous Rebellion in Ireland, the suppressing whereof, (for the better
color) was recommended to the care of the Parliament, who out of a
fellow-feeling of the unspeakeable miseries of their Protestant Brethren
there, (not suspecting this horrid plot now too apparent) did cheerfully
undertake that great Work, and do really intend and endeavor, to settle the
Protestant Religion, and a permanent peace in that Realm, to the glory of God,
and the great honor and profit of his Majesty, and security of his three
Kingdoms. But how they have been discouraged, retarded and diverted, in and
from this pious and glorious work, by those Traitorous Counsels about his
Majesty, will appear by many particulars; some whereof, they shall upon this
just occasion call to remembrance. That when the Lords and Commons, had upon
the first breaking out of the Rebellion, immediately provided and sent over
Twenty thousand pounds, and engaged themselves and the whole Kingdom for the
reducing of the Rebels, Yet his Majesty after his return from Scotland to
London, was not pleased either by Word or Message to take notice of that,
until after some in the House of Commons, had truly observed how forward those
mischievous Counselors were to incite his Majesty against his Protestant
Subjects of Scotland, and how slow to recent the proceedings of his Papist
Traitors in Ireland. That although the Rebels had most impudently styled
themselves the Queens Army, and professed that the cause of their rising, was to
maintain the Kings Prerogative, and the Queens Religion, against the Puritan
Parliament of England, And that thereupon both Houses of Parliament did humbly
and earnestly advise his Majesty, to wipe away this dangerous Scandal, by
Proclayming them Rebels and Traitors to his Majesty and the Crown of England,
which then would have mated and weakened the Conspirators in the beginning, and
have encouraged both the Parliament here, and good people there, the more
vigorously to have opposed their proceedings, Yet such was the power of those
Counselors, that no Proclamation was set forth to that purpose, till almost
three Months after the breaking out of this Rebellion, and then Command given,
that but forty should be Printed, nor they to be published till further
directions should be given by his Majesty. That after both Houses of Parliament
had found out a probable way to reduce the Kingdom of Ireland, by the
Adventure of private men, without any charge to the Subject in general, and
which they are very confident would have brought in a Million of Money, had his
Majesty continued in or near London; those malicious Whisperers that durst not
hinder the passing of the Bill, which was so specious in it self, and so
generally approved; yea have by practice, by drawing his Majesty from his
Parliament, by keeping him at this distance, and advising him to make war
upon his people, so intimidated and discouraged the Adventurers and others that
would have adventured, that they have rendered that good Bill, in a manner
ineffectuall. That the Parliament and Adventurers, had long since designed
5000. Foot, and 500. Horse, for the relief of Munster, to be sent as a
Brigade, under the Command of the Lord Wharton, had made Choice of, and Listed
all the Commanders, and prepared Money, Arms and other provision for that
Expedition, and all to be at the charge of the Adventurers, and when nothing
was wanting but a Commission to the Lord Wharton, to enable him for that
service; such was the power of those Counselors, that no Commission could be
obtained from his Majesty, by reason whereof Lymerick was wholly lost, and the
Province of Munster is now in very great distress.

That when diverse pious and well affected Persons, had prepared 12. Ships, and
6. Pinnaces, with a 1000. or more Land forces at their own Charge, by way of
Adventure for the service of Ireland, and desired nothing but a Commission from
his Majesty, to enable them thereunto. That Commssion after twice sending to
York for the same, and the Ships lying ready to set sail for three weeks
together, at the Charge of near Three hundred pounds a day, was likewise
denied, and those Adventurers (rather then to lose their expedition) were
constrained to go, by virtue of an Ordinance of both Houses of Parliament.

That although the Lords Justices of Ireland have three months since earnestly
desired to have two pieces of battery sent over, as very necessary for that
service, yet such Commands are given to the Officers of the Tower that none of
his Majesty's Ordnance must be sent to save his Majesty's Kingdom, That
although, whilst the Earl of Leicester stayed here in the service of the
Parliament and in providing for his long expected voyage into Ireland, a
Message was sent to the Parliament from his Majesty to hasten him away, and
Letters were written to the said Earl from his Majesty, that he should make
no stay at York for his dispatch, but that his instructions should be ready
for him against he came. And although it is notoriously known, that the
affairs of Ireland do exceedingly suffer by wanting the personal assistance
of a Commander in Chief, to give both life and motion to the Army there; Yet
the said Earl has been stayed with his Majesty in the North a month and
more, and as yet can get no dispatch; That notwithstanding the bleeding
condition of Ireland, yet diverse Commanders and Officers in pay, and in actual
employment there against the Rebels, have been called away from that important
service by the express Command of his Majesty, as Charles Floyd Engineer, and
Quartermaster general of the Army in Ireland, and diverse others. That
Captain Green Comptroller of the Artillery, a man in pay, and principally
employed and trusted here by the said Lieutenant of Ireland, for the providing
and ordering the train of Artillery which was to be sent to Dublin, and who
had received great sums of money for that purpose was commanded from that
employment and trust to serve his Majesty in this most unnatural War
against his loyal and best affected people. That the Parliament having made
great provision of clothes for the poor Soldiers in Ireland for their present
succor, and sending six hundred suites, part thereof toward Chester the last
week, the man that undertook the carriage of them one William Whitacker by
name, was assaulted by his Majesty's Cavaliers then lying about Coventry, who
took away those six hundred suites of clothes, and the Wagon and Horses of
the poor man, although they were told that the six hundred suites of clothes
were for the Soldiers in Ireland, and notwithstanding the poor Carrier was
five times with the Earl of Northampton to beg a release of his Wagon. That
three hundred suites of clothes with a Surgeons Chest of Medicaments being
likewise sent for Ireland by one Richard Owefield, who was employed by the
Parliament to carry them to Chester, a Troop of his Majesty's Cavaliers under
the command of one Captain Middleton met with them upon the rode, and took
away the clothes and Surgeons Chest, together with the poor Carriers horses
and Wagon for his Majesty's pretended service here. That a great number of
Draught-horses prepared by the Parliament for the Artillery, and baggage of the
Irish Army were sent to Chester for that purpose, and being there attending a
(...) passage, are now required by his Majesty, for his said present service in
England.

That his Majesty's Forces are so quartered in and about the common Rodes to
Ireland, that neither money, clothes, victuals, or other provisions can pass
thither by Land with any safety. That Captain Kettleby the Admiral, and Sir
Henry Stradling the Vice Admiral of those Ships which were directed to lie
upon the Coast of Ireland, to annoy the Rebels, and to prevent the bringing to
them Ammunition and relief from foreign parts, are both called away from
that employment by his Majesty's Command, and by reason of their departure from
the Coast of Munster, to which they were designed, the Rebels there have
received Powder, Ammunition, and other relief from foreign parts, by which
and many other particulars too long to relate, it may seem, as if those
Barbarous Irish Rebels are kept on foot, and countenanced there of Design to
assist the Northern Cavaliers, and according to the Earl of Straffords
unheard of advice to have an Army in Ireland, with which his Majesty may reduce
this Kingdom, especially considering those confident Rebels have presumed very
lately to send a Petition to his Majesty, intituling themselves his Majesty's
Catholic Subjects of Ireland, and complaining of the Puritan Parliament of
England, and desiring that since his Majesty comes not thither according to
their expectation, that they may come into England to his Majesty, which
Petition we may justly fear, is but a Prologue to that tragedy they have
designed to Act here, in case their coming over be not prevented by the care
and vigilancie of the Parliament, and good people of England. But least the
House of Commons might seem to excuse the making of this Order by a way of
recrimination, They for a satisfaction to the World, protest before Almighty
God the Searcher of all hearts, that they have as great compassion and sorrow
for the present sufferings of their distressed Brethren in Ireland, as if
themselves were in their case (into which they are confident, those horrid
Traitors, those Monsters of men about his Majesty do labor to bring this
Kingdom) That they have and shall ever really endeavor by all means possible
(with a due regard to the present estate of this Kingdom) to supply and
support them in this their great affliction notwithstanding the malice and
obstructions of all opposers. That the House of Commons lively apprehending the
imminent danger of this Kingdom, and finding that whilst they were active here
to subdue the Rebels of Ireland, there were Papists, Traitors and Delinquents
more active in the North to conquer and destroy the Parliament and good people
of England, thought it necessary to provide for the safety of both by preparing
a competent Army for the defense of King and Kingdom, and although multitudes
of well affected persons had cheerfully brought in great store of plate for that
purpose, yet in regard the plate could not be coined with such expedition, as
the importance of the service did require, and well knowing that one hundred
thousand pounds might for a short time be borrowed out of the Adventurers money
for Ireland, without any prejudice to the Affairs of that Kingdom (whose
subsistence depends upon the welfare of this) and resolving to make a real,
and speedy repayment of what money should be so borrowed did make this Order
which that it may appear to all the World to be neither mischievous, illegal,
nor unjust (as his Majesty, by the instigation of those malignant VVhisperers
is pleased to term it) the house of Commons thought fit to recite it in haec
verba, and instead of retracting the Order to repay the money with all possible
speed.

The thirtieth day of July, one thousand six hundred forty two; It is this day
ordered by the Commons House of Parliament, that the Treasurers appointed to
receive the Moneys come in upon the Subscriptions for Ireland, do forthwith
furnish by way of loan, unto the Committee of the Lords and Commons, for the
defense of the Kingdom, the sum of one hundred thousand pounds for the
supply of the public necessity for the defense of the King, Parliament, and
Kingdom upon the public faith to be repaid duly and carefully within so short
a time, that it shall not be diverted from the purpose, for which it was
intended, or any way frustrate the Acts already made in the behalf of that
Adventure. By which order, and that which has been here truly set down, it
will easily appear to all the indifferent people of his Majesty's three
Kingdoms, Whether the King and his Cavaliers, or the King and his Parliament
do most affect and endeavor the settling of true Religion, and a firm and
constant peace within that bleeding and distracted Kingdom.

FINIS.
