Saturday I am coming last
Trusting on the time well spent
Having ever mind steadfast
On that lord that harowed hell
That he my sins will expel
At the instaunce of his Mother
whose goodness does far excel
whom I serve above all other amen.
The commandments of (...) given by Moses / and expounded by (...) to our
Mother tongue / very necessary and expedyent for Youth and all other for to
learn and to know.
(...)

I Am the Lord thy god / which have brought the out of the land of Egypt and
out of the house of bondage (...) Thou shalt have none other gods i^ my
sight. (...) Thou shalt make the no graue^ Image: neither any similitude that
is i^ heaven above or in the earth beneathe / or in the water that is beneath
the earth. Se that thou neither bow thy self to them: neither serve them.
For I the lord thy god am a gelouse god / and vysite the sin of the fathers
upon the children unto the third and fourth generacyo^ of them that hate me /
and yet show mercy to thousands among the^ that love me and keep my
commandments.

(...) Hear Israel / our lord god is one lord: and thou shall love thy
lord god with all thy heart / with all thy Soul / with all thy mind / and
with ali thy strength. Thou shalt worship thy lord god / and him only shalt
thou serve.

(...)

^Hou shall not take the name of the lord thy god in vain. For the Lord will
not hold him gyltlesse / that takes the name of the lord his god in vain.
(...)

^Ye have herd how it was said to the^ of old time. Thou shall not
forswear thy self / but shalt perform thyn oaths to the Lord.

^say unto you / swear not at all: neither by heaven / for it is gods seat /
nor by the earth / for it is his footstool / neither by Jerusalem / for it is
the City of ye great king. Neither shall thou swear by thy head: because
thou can not make one white hear or a black. But let your communicacyon be:
yea / eya and nay nay: for what soever is more then that / comes of evil.

(...)

^Emembre the Sabbath day that thou sanctify it. (...) Six days may thou
labor / and do all that thou have to do / but the seventh day is the Sabbath
of the Lord thy god. In it thou shalt do no manner work / neither thou / nor
thy sone / nor thy daughter neither thy manseruaunt / nor thy maid servant /
nor thy catell: nor yet the stranger that is within thy gates. For in six
days the Lord made heaven and earth / and the sea / and all that is in them /
and rested the seventh day wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day / and
hallowed it (...) It is lefull to do a good deed on the Sabbath day. For the
sone of man is lord even of the Sabbath day. The Lord says by his prophet.
(...) That his sabbath is hallowed and kept / when we rest and cease to do our
own will / to follow our own ways / and to speak our own words: when we
in word / thought / and deed fulfill his well (I say) and not ours: and when
we suffer him to do his works in us / that at the last / we may come to that
Sabbath and true rest / even eternal life / which Christ the Lord of the
sabbath has opteyned for us by his blood.

(...)

^Onoure thy Father and thy Mother / that thy days may be long in the land
which the lord thy god gives the.

honor thy father and thy mother.

(...) Honor father and mother: this is the first commandment that has any
promise that thou may be in good estate: and live long on the earth. By
this commandment Christ teaches us not only to have our father and mother
in reverence / and to obey them / as he him self was subject unto his Mother
the virgyn Mary: but also to minyster unto their necessytes.

(...) ^Hou shall not kill. Matthew. v. Ye have herd how it was said unto them
of the old time. Thou shall not kill. who soever kyilleth shall be in danger of
judgment. But I say to you: who soever is angry with his brother shall be in
danger of judgment. who soever says to his brother / Racha: shall be in
danger of a counsel. But who soever says: thou fool shall be in danger of
hell fire. (...) Ye have herd how it is said. Thou shalt love thy neighbor:
and has thyn enemy. But I say unto you / love your enemies / bliss them
that curse you / do good to them that has you pray for them that do you
wrong and persecute you: that ye may be the children of your father which is
in heaven. For he makes the son to arise on the evil and on the good: and
sends his rain on the just and on the unjust.

(...)

^Hou shall not break wedlock. Math. v Ye have herd how it was said to them
of old time / thou shalt not commyt aduoutry. But I say to you / that who
soever looks on a wife / luslynge after her / has committed aduoutry with her
all ready in his heart. (...) Let wedlock be had in price in all points / and
let thy chamber be undefiled / for hoore kepers and aduouterers God will judge.

^Hou shall not steal. (...) Steal not: defraude no man. If any man will sue
the at the law / and take thy come from the: let him have thy cloak also: give
to him that asks: and from him that would borowe: turn not away. (...) Now
is there vtte^lye a fault among you: because ye go to law one with another?
Why rather suffer ye not wrong? why rather suffer ye not your selves to be
robbed? yea / even your selves do wrong and rob and that the brethrene.
Ephesi. iiij. Let him that did steal / steal no more / but let him rather
labor with his hands some good thing that he may have to give unto him that
needs.

^Hou shalt bear no false witness against thy neighbor. (...) Bear no
false witness I say to you / that of every idle word which men shall have
spoken they shall give aecomptes at the day of judgment. (...) Wherefore put
away lyng / and speak every man truth to his neighbor / for as much as we
are members one of another. Let not fylth communycacyon proceed out of your
mouths: but that which is good to edifye with all / when need is / that it may
have ^au^ur with the hearers. Ephe. v. Let al bytternesse / fearsnesse and
wrath / rorynge and cursed speaking / be put away from you. Let no fylthynesse
/ folysshe talkyng / nor jesting (which are not comely) be ones named among
you: but rather gyuyng of thanks.

^Hou shall not coueyt thy neighbors house. Neither shall thou coueyt thy
neighbors wife: his man servant / his maid his ox / his ass / or ought
that is his. (...) What soever ye would that men should do to you: even so do
ye to them. To love a man's neighbor as him self / is a greater thing then
all burnte offerynges and sacryfyces. Be not ouercomme with lust / for the
care of this world and the disceytfulnesse of riches choke te world.

(...) Let your conuersacyon ^et without covetousness / and be content with that
that ye have al ready. Godlynes is great riches / if a man be content with that
he has. For we brought nothing in to the world / and it is a plain case /
that we carry nothing out.

When we have fode and raiment / let us there with be content. They that will be
rich / fall in to temptacyon and snares / and in to many folysshe and noysom
lusts / which drown men in perdicyon and destruction. For covetousness is the
rote of all evil: which while some lusted after / they erred from the faith /
and tangled the^ selves with many sorrows.

^hese words which I command the this day shall be in thine heart / and thou
shall whette them on thy children / and shall talk of them when thou art at
home in thy house / and as thou walk by the way / and when thou lie down
/ and when thou rysest up: and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy
hand. And they shall be papers of remembrance between thine eyes / and thou
shalt write them upon the posts of thy house / and upon thy gates.

^ake head and hear al these wodes which I command the / that it may go well
with the / and with thy children after the for ever / when thou do that
which is good and right in the sight of the lord thy god.

(...) Se thou do that which is right in the sight of the lord / that thou
may prosper.

(...) Ye shall do after nothing that we do here this day / every man what
seems him good in his own eyes. But what soever I command you / that take heed ye do / and put nothing thereto / nor take ^ght therfrom.

(...) Cursed be he that contynueth not in all the words of this law / to do
them.

(...) If ye love me / keep my commandments. (...) Happy are they that hear
the word of god / and keep it. (...) who soever shall keep the hole law / and
yet fail in one point / he is gylty in all. For he that said. Thou shall not
commyt aduoutry: said also: thou shall noc kill. (...) They that fear the
lord keep his commandments.

The symbol of Athanasius.
(...)

(...) ^Ho soever will be saved / before all things it is necessary that he
hold the true Catholic faith.

which faith / but if every man will keep hole and inuyolate: without douth he
shall eternaly perisshe.

^his truly is the very Catholyke faith / that we worship one god in trinyte:
and the trinyte in unity.

^eyther co^foundyng the persons: neither seperatynge the substance.

^he person of the Father is one / the person of the Sone an other / the
person of the holy Ghost an other.

^ut of the Father / of the Sone / and of the holy Ghost / there is one
dyuinyte / equal glory coeternall majesty e.

^uche as is the Father / such is the Son such is the holy Ghost.

^he Father is uncreate / the Sone vncreat / the holy Ghost is vncreat.

^he father is without measure / the Son with out measure / the holy ghost
without measure.

^he Father is everlasting / the Sone everlasting / the holy Ghost everlasting.

and not withstandyng there be not. iij. everlasting / the holy Ghost
everlasting.

^uyn as there be not three vncreat: nor. itj. vnmesurate / but one vncreat / et
one vnmesurate.

^ykewyse the Father is almighty / the Son almighty, and the holy Ghost
almighty.

and yet they bet not three Almyghtyes / but one god almighty.

^o the Father is God / the Son God / the holy ghost is God.

and yet they be not. iij gods / but one god.

^o the Father is a lord / the Sone a lord / the holy Ghost a lord.

and yet they be not. iij. lords / but one lord.

^or as we be compelled by the Christian veryte to confess seperatly every one
person to be God and Lord.

^o are we prohybite by the Catholic relygyon of Christ's faith to say that
there be. iij. Gods or three lords.

^he Father is made of none: neither created nor gotten.

^he Sone is from the Father alone: neither made ne create / but gotten.

^he holy Ghost is from the Father / and the Sone / neither made created / nor
gotten but procedynge.

and so there is but one Father / not three Fathers / one Son / not three
Sons / one holy Ghost / not three holy Ghostes.

and in this Trinyte / there is none before or after another / nothing more or
less: but all the three persons be coeterne / and coequall to them selte.

^o that by always as now it has been above said the Trinyte in unite / and
the unite in Trinyte may be worsshypped.

^e therefore that will be saved / let him understand thus of the Trinyte.

^ut it is necessary unto everlasting health / that every christian believe also
faithfully the in carnacyon of our lord Jesus christ.

^t is therefore the right faith: that we believe and confess that our lord
Jesus Christ the Sone of God / is God and man.

^e is god by the substance of the Father gotten before all worlds / and he is
man by the substance of his mother: borne in the world.

^erfyte God: perfyte man: being of a soul reasonable / and offlesshe humayne.

^quall to the Father by his Godhed / less the^ the Father by his manhed.

^hiche though he be God and man / yet is there not twyane but one Christ.

^ruely he is one not by turnyng of his godhed in to ma^hed / but by
assumptynge of his manhed in to godhed.

^^ynge one to all intentes / not by confusion of ^ub^ance / but by unite of
person.

^or as the reasonable soul and the flesshely body is or makes one man / so
God and man is one Christ.

^hiche suffered death for our salvation / descended to hell / and rose from

The preface and ye manner to live well.
(...)

FOr to begin the manner of salutary or health full living. And to come to
perfection (how well I have more need to be instruct than for to teache other)
yet keep these small doctrines here following to your powers. First rise up at
vj. of the clock in the morning in all seasons and in your rysyng do as
follows. Thank our lord of test that he gave you that night, Commend you to
god / byssed lady saint mary / and to that saint whilh is feested that day /
and to all the saints of heaven. Secondly beseech god that he preserve the that
day / from deedly sin / and at all other times. And pray him that all the
works that other does for you may be accept to the lawde of his name / of his
glorious mother / and of all the company of heaven. Uvhan hye have arrayed you /
say in your chamber or lodgyng: maryns / pryme and hours if ye may. Than go to
the church or ye do any worldly works if ye have no needful business and
abide in the church the space of a low mass while where ye shall think and
thank god of his benefytes. Think a while on the goodness of god / on his
dyuyne might and virtue. Think what gift he has given to you to create you so
nobly / as to his image and likeness. Think also what grace he has done to
you in the sacrament of baptysme / clensyng your soul from sin. Think how
many times ye have offended him sith ye were cristened. Think how mekely he
has abyden your recournyng from sin. Think from how many dangers he has
preserved your body and soul. Think how ill ye have be stowed the time that
he has given you to do^^naunte Think how many times he has forgyue^ you
inshryft / et how many times ye have fallen to sin again. Think in what
pain ye had be^now et ever if god had taken you out of this world when ye
were in deedly sin. Think how derely he bought you from the danger of the
devil suffryng co^tynuall pains in this world / about the space of. xxxn.
years going barefote i^ cold and heat / suffryng ho^gre / and thyrst / and
many shameful ^^uryes and how derely he redeemed you gyuyng his p^^^ous body /
his blod / and his soul. and at this point co^sydre all the pains of his
woeful passion / as god will give you grace Think also what pain his dear and
glorious mother suffered all yt while. Consydre his sharp judgment at the hour
of death. And touching this death think osten the ron / and that ye can not
escape it / nor knows when / nor how, in what estate: nor what place nor time
day: nor hour. Think tha^ what shall become of the worldly goods that ye
have gadred and spared with great labor and how loathe ye shall be to leave
the^ and all your friends and kynsfolke. An yt more is wha^ your soul i^ great
pain shall leave your body to rotte in the earth. Consydre tha^ what shall
become of your strenght: be aute / you the health and other welthe of the body.
Think what the poor soul shall do when it goothalone without company where
it was never Think what it shall do wha^ it sees the horrible enemies that
would draw it to perdicyon if ye deye in deedly sin. Think how woeful a
journey it shall he when ye must yield a general rekenyng of all your works /
words / and thoughts without excepcyo^ of any thing Think how god shall hyue
you grace. Think on ye horrible pains of hell / and on the cruel conpany of
deuylles: where without end ye shall never / have releas if ye deye in deedly
sin. And think on the ine stimable joy of the saints i^ heaven / ye w iche
out lord has promised you if ye live out of deedly sin: et love him above
all thing. And have ye a perfyte hope if yelyue well ye shall come to that
glory. Ame^.

And yt by any other reasonable business ye may not be so long in the church
/ at is it said he re before. yield thanks to god of his goodness. And thine
on the resydew in your hows ones in the day or in the night if ye may.

Wha^ ye are come fro ye church take heed to your household or occupacyo^ till
dinner time. And in so doing think so^ time that ye pain yt ye suffer in this
world is nothing to the regard of ye in fynite glory yt ye shall have if ye
take it mekely, Tha^ take your refeccio^ or mele reasonably without excess or
over much for beryng of your meat for there is as much danger i^ to little
as in to much if ye fast ones in a weke it is ynought / beside vigilles and
ymbre days out of lenten. And if ye tynhe ye fasting be not good nor
prouffytable do by counsel Rest you after dinner an hour or half an hour as
ye think best / prayeng god that in that rest he will accept your health / to
ye end y^ after it ye may serve him ye more devoutly. The resydew of ye day
bestow i^ your besinnesse to the pleasure of god. As touchyn your service say
un to tiers a fore dinner. and make an end of all be fore souper. And when ye
may / say dyryge. and co^mendacyons for all chrysted souls at the leest way on
the holy days and if ye have leaser say them on other days / at the leest
with three lesso^s Shryue you every weke to your curate except ye have great
let. and beware ye pass not a fourtenyght except very great let. If ye
be of power refuse not your alms to the first poor body that axeth it of
you that day. If ye think it needful. Take pain to here and keep the word
of god. Confess you every day to god without fail / of such sins as ye
know that ye have done that day. Co^sydre often either by day or night when ye
do a wake what our lord did at that hour the day of his blyssed passion /
and where he was at that hour. Seek a god and says full fre^ de of god
co^uersacyo^ to whom ye may dyscouer your mind secrets Enq^re and prove him
well or ye trust i^ him. And wha^ ye have well proved him do all by is
counsel. Day little / and follow ^^uous company. Eschew ye felaw ship of
them yt ye wol de not be like. After all work praise and ta^ke god / love hi
above all things / and serve him and his glorious mother dilige^tely. do to
nouer there but that ye would were done to you love the wealth of another as your
own^. And in going to your bed have so^e good tought either of the passyo^ of
our lord / or of you sines / or of ye pains y^ souls have purgatory. or so^e
other good spiritual toughtes And than I hope your living shall be acceptable
and pleasyng to god.

The gospel of saint Johan.
(...) IN ye begynni^g was the word And the word was with god And ye word was
with god. The same was in ye begynni^g with god. Al things were made by it /
and without it was made nothing. That was made in it was life and the life was
the light of men / and the light shyneth in ye darkness / but the darkness
comprehended it not. There was a man sent from god / whose name was Johan. The
same came as a witness to bear witness of the light / that all men through
him might believe. He was not that light / but to bear witness of the light.
That was a true light / which lyghteth all men that come in to the world. He
was i^ the world / and the world was made by him: and yet the world knew
him not. He came among his own / and his own received him not. But as many
as received him / to them gave he power to be the sons of god / in that they
believe on his name / which were borne not of blood nor of the will of the
flesh / nor yet of the will of man / but of god. And the word was made
flesh / and dwelt among us. And we saw the glory of it as the glory of the
only begotten son of the father: which word was full of grace and verite.

The gospel of saint Luke.

THe Angel Gabriell was sent from God unto a City of Galylee / named
Nazareth / unto a virgyn spoused to a man / whose name was Joseph / of the
house of David: and the virgyns name was Marye. And the angel went unto her
and said. hayle full of grace / the lord is with the / blyssed art thou
among all women. Uvhen she saw him / she was abashed at his saying / and
cast in her mind what manner of salutacyon that should be. And the angel
said unto her. Fear not Mary / for thou have found grace with god. Loo /
thou shalt co^ceyue in thy womb / and shall bear a Sone / and his name shall
be called Jesus. He shall be great / and shall be called the sone of the highest.
And the lord god shall give to him the seat of his father David: and he shall
reygne over the house of Jacob for ever: and of his kingdom shall be no end.
Then said Mary unto the Angel. How shall this be / saying I know not a
man^ And the angel answered and said unto her. The holy ghost shall come
upon the / and the power of the highest shall ouershadowe the. Therefore that
holy thing which shall be borne / shall be called the sone of god. And behold
thy cosyn Elizabeth. she has also conceived a sone in her old age. And this
is her. vi. mo neth though she be called barayne / for with Bod shall nothing
be impossible. And Mary said. Behold the hand maydene of the lord / be it
unto me even as thou haste said. Thanks be to god.

UHen Jesus was borne in Bethleem (a town of Jury) which in time of Herod
the king: behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem / saying.
Uvhere is he that is borne king of the Jews. Uve have seen his star in the
East / and are come to worship him. Uvhen Herod the king had herd this / he
was troubled / and all Jerusalem with him / and he gathered all the cheyf
Priests and Scrybes of the people / and demanded of the^ where Christ should
be borne They said unto him / in Bethleem / a town of Iewry. For thus it is
written by the prophet.

And thou Bethlee^ i^ the land of Iewrye / art not the leest concerning the
princes of Judah. For out of the shall come a captain / which shall gouer ne
my people of Israel. Then Herod pryuely call led the wise men / and dilyge^tly
inquired of the^ the time of the. Star that appeared: and sent them to
Bethlee^ / saye^ge. Bo and sercheye dilygently for the child / and when ye
have found hi^ / bring me word that I may come and worship him also.
Uvhen they herd the king they departed. And loo the Star. which they saw
in the East went before until it came and stood over the place where the
child was. Uvhe^ they saw the Star they were merueylous glad / and went in
to the house and found the child with Mary is mother / and knele down and
worshypped him / and opened their treasures / and offered unto him gifts.
Bold / Frankenscens / and myrre. And after they were warned of god in a dream
/ that they should not go again to Herod / they returned i^ to their own
country by another way.

(...) AFter that he appeared unto the eleue^ / as they sat at meat / and cast
i^ their teeth their vnbelef and hardensse of heart / because they believed not
them / which had seen him after his resurreccyon. And he said unto the^.
Boy i^ to all the world and preach the gospel to all creatures. He that
believes and is baptized / shall be safe But he that believes not shall shall be
dampened. And these signs shall follow them that believe. In my name shall they
cast out deuylles / and shall speak with new tongues / and shall kill
serpe^tes. And if they drink and deadly thing it shall not hurt them.

They shall lay their hands on the sick / and they shall recover. So the
lord Jesus after he had spoken to them was receive in to heuyn / and sytteth
on the right hand of Bod. And they went forth and preached every where. And
our lord wrought with them / and confyrmed the word with miracles that
followed.

The passion.
UHe^ Jesus had spoken these words he went forth with his discyples over the
broke Cedro^: where was a gardeyn / i^ to the which he entered with his
discyples. Judas al so: which betrayed him / knew the place for Jesus of times
resorted thither with his discyples. Judas the^ after that he had received a
bond of men / and mynysters of the hye priests and pharisees / came thither
with lanternes and fyerbro^des and weapons. Then Jesus knowing all things
that should come on him / went forth and said unto the^ / whom sekeye? They
answered him. Jesus of Nazareth Jesus said unto the^ / I am he. Judas also
which betrayed him stood with him. But as soon as he had said to them. I am
he: they went backewardes and fell to the ground. And he asked the^ again /
whom sekeye? They said Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus answered / I said unto you /
I am he. If ye seek me / let these go their way / that the saying might be
fulfilled / which he spoke. Of them which thou gave me / have I not lost
one Simon Peter had aswearde / and drew it / and smote the hye priests
servant / and cut of his right ear. The servants name was Malcus The said
Jesus unto Peter: shall I not drink of the cup / which my father has
given me. Then the company and the captain / and the mynysters of the Jews
took Jesus and bound him / and led him away to Anna first: for he was
father law unto Cayphas / which was the hye priest that same year. Cayphas
was he that gave counsel to the Jews that it was expedye^t that one man
should dye for the people. And symo^ Peter followed Jesus / and another discyple
that discyple was known of the hye p^este / and went i^ with Jesus i^ to the
palayes of the hye priest. But Peter stood at the door without. Then went that
other discyple which was known unto the hye priest and spoke to the da^sell
that kept the door / and brought in Peter. Then said the damsel that kept
the door unto Peter. Art not thou one of this man's discyples? He said. I
am not. The servants and the ministers stood there / and had made a fire of
cooles / for it was cold: and they warmed them selfs. Peter also stood among
them and warmed him self. The hye priests asked Jesus of his discyples / and
of his doctrine Jesus answered him. I spoke openly in the world. I ever taught
in the synagoge and in the temple / whereal the Iues resorted / and in secret
have I said nothing. Uvhy ask thou me? Ask them which herd me / what I
said unto them. Behold / they can tell what I said. Uvhen he had thus spoken
/ one of the ministers which stood by: smote Jesus on the face / saying
Answerest thou the hye priest so. Jesus answered him? If I have spoken evil
bear witness of the evil. If I have speken well / why smytest thou me. And
Annas sent him bound unto Cayphas the hye Preeste. Simon Peter stood and
warmed him self. And they said unto him. Art thou not also one of his
discyples. He denied it / and said. I am not. One of the servants of the hye
priest (his cosyn / whose ear Peter smote of) said unto him. Did not I se the
in the Bardeyn with him. Peter denied it again / and immediately the cock
crewe. Then led they Jesus from Cayphas into the halle of judgment. It was
in the morning / and they them selfs went not in to the judgment halle /
lest they should be defiled: but that they might eat the paschall Lamb.
Pylate then went out unto them / and said. Uvhat accusacyon bring you
against this man. They answered and said unto him. If he were not an evil
doer / we would not have delivered him unto the. The^ said Pylate unto them.
Take ye him / and judge him after your own law. Then the Jews said unto
him. It is not laufull for us to put any man to death. That the words of
Jesus might be fulfilled which he spoke sygnyfyenge what death he should dye.
Then Pylate entered into the judgment hall again / and called Jesus and said
unto him Art thou the king of the Jews? Jesus answered. Say thou that of
thy self / or did other tell it the of me. Pylate answered. Am I a Jew. Thine
own nacyo^ and hye Priests have delivered the unto me. Uvhat haste thou done.
Jesus answered. My kyngedome is not of this world. If my kyngedome were of
this world / then would my mynysters surely fight / that I should not be
delivered unto the Jews / but now is my kyngedome not from hense. Pylate
said unto hi^. Art thou a king the^. Jesus answered. Thou say that I am a
king For this cause was I borne / and for this cause came I i^ to the world /
that I should bear witness un to the truth. And all that are of the truth
hear my voice. Pylate said unto him. what thing is truth. And when he had
said that he went out again unto the Iues / and said unto them: I find in
him no cause at all. Ye have a custom that I should deliver you one loose at
Easter.

will ye that I loose unto you the king of Jews? Then cried they al again
saying. Not him / but Barabas. That Barabas was a robber. The^ Pylate took
Jesus and scourged him. And the soul diours wound a crown of thorns and put
it on his head. And they did on him o purple garment / and said: Nail king
of the Jews. And they smote him on the face. Pylate went forth again and said
unto the^. Behold I bring him forth to you / that ye may know / that I find
no fault in him. The^ came Jesus forth wearynge a crown of thorn and a robe
of purple. And Pylate said unto the^. Behold the man. When the hye preesles
and mynysters saw him / they cried / saye^g Crucyfye him / Crucyfye him.
Pilate said unto the^. Take ye him / and crucyfy him. For I find no cause in
him. The Iues answered him. We have a law / and by our law he ought to dye /
because he made him self the sone of god. When Pylate herd that saying / he
was the more afraid: and said unto Jesus: whense art thou? but Jesus gave him
none answer. Then said Pylate unto him. Speak thou not unto me. Known
thou not that I have power to loose the? Jesus answered. Thou could have no
power at all against me / except it were given the from above. Therefore he that
delivered me unto the / is more i^ sin. And from he^s forth sought Pylate
means to loose him. But the Jews cried / sayng. If thou let him go thou art
not Cesars friend. For who soever makes him self a king / is against Caesar.
When Pylate herd that saye^ge / he brought Jesus forth / and sat down to give
sentence / in a place called the Paueme^t but i^ the Hebrew tongue Babbatha. It
was the Saboth even: which falls in the Easter feast and above the syrte
hour. And he said unto the Jews: Behold your king. They cried / away with
him / away with him. Crucify him. Pylate said unto them. Shall I crucify your
king.

The hye priests answered / we have no king but Caesar. Then delivered he him
unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus and led him away. And he bare
his cross and went for to a place / called the place of dead men's sculles
(which is named in Hebrewe / Golgatha (where they crucified him. And with him
two other / on either side one / and Jesus in the mydes. Pylate wrote his title
/ and put it on the cross. The wrytinge was. Jesus of Nazareth / king of the
Iues. This title red many of ye Jews. For the place where Jesus was crucified
/ was nygh to the cite. And it was writ in Hebrewe / Greek / and latin. Then
said the hye priests of the Iues to Pylate / writ not king of the Jews:
but that he said / I am king of the Iues. Pylate answered. What I have written
/ that have I written. Then the soldiers when they had crucified Jesus / took
his garments and made. iiij. parts: to every souldyour a part and also his
cote. There was a cote without seem / wrought open throughout. And they said
one to another. Let us not deuyde it: but cast lottes who shall have it. That
the scripture might be fulfilled / which says. They parted my rayme^t among
them and on my come did catte lottes.

And the souldyours did such things in deed. There stood by the cross of
Jesus / his mother / and his mothers sister / Mary the wife Cleophas: and Mary
magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother: and the discyple standing / whom he
loved / he said unto his mother: woman / behold thy sone. Then said he to
the discyple. behold thy mother. And from that hour the discyple took her for
his own. After that when Jesus perceived that all things were performed /
that the scripture might be fulfilled he said / I thryst. There stood a
vessel full of vynegre by And they filled a sponge with vynegre / and wound
it about with ysope: and put it to his mouth. As Soon as Jesus had received of
the by negre / he said. It is finysshed. And bowed his head / and gave up the
ghost The Jews then because it was the Saboth eue^ / that the bodies should
not remain upon the cross on the Saboth day (for yt saboth day was an hye
day) besought Pylate that their legs might be broken / and that they might
be taken down.

Then came the souldyours and brake the legs of the first / and of the other
/ which was crucyfyed with Jesus But when they came to Jesus: and saw that he
was dead already / they brake not his legs but one of the souldyours with a
spear / thrust hy min to the side / and forth with came out blood and water.
And he that saw it bare record and his record is true And he knows that he
says true / that ye might believe also. These things were done that the
scripture might be fulfilled. Ye shall not break a bone of him. And again
another scripture says. They shall look on him / whom they pearsed. After that
Joseph of Aramathia (which was a discyple of Jesus but secretly for fear of
the Iues) besought pylate that he might take down the body of Jesus. And
Pylate gave him license. And there came also Nicodemus which at the beginning
came to Jesus by night / and brought of myrre and Aloes mine gled together:
about an ho^dred pound wayght Them took they the body of Jesus and wound it in
lynnen clothes with the odoures / as the manner of ye Jews is to burye. And i^
the place where Jesus was crucified / was a gardeyn / and in the gardeyn a new
sepulcre / where in was never man laid. There laid they Jesus / because of the
Iues Saboth even: for the sepulcher was nigh at hand.

The seven Psalms.
THy that these. vij. psalms following are called penitenciall / and be cheyfly
noted above other / the common opinion and mind of many writers is and has been / that the king and the Prophet David compunt and stryken with herty
repentance of his grievous adultry committed with Barsabe and the detestable
murder of Urie her husband being his knight and servant (after he was
admonysshed by Nathan the prophet of god) should make them specially to declare
his inward sorrow / and deep contricion that he took for the same: but whether
it were done upon that occasyon or not that I refer to the judgment of other
/ because that in the Psalter they stand not together ordrely: yet this is
very certain that they may well and of good co^grue^ce be called penitenciall
/ for so much as penance in the^ is so dilyge^tly / often / and manyfestly
treated / repeted / and commended / as i^ the self Psalms is easily perceived.

^He making of this service (that we call Dirige) some do ascrybe to saint

much / for certain it is / that all that is contained therm (the collettes

^ryteth) Palagius / bishop of Rome did first ordeyne the commemoracyon / or
prayenge for the dead. Uvhiche thing (after the mind of Isodore was received
as a tradicyo^ of the apostles. Howbeit S. Ambrose affyrmeth / that it was
deryued of an old custom had among the Hebrews / which used long
lame^tacyon for the dead after their departing: as they did for Jacob the
space of. xl. days / and for Moses. xxx But we that are under the new law /
are taught of god by the mouth of saint Paul his apostle / not to mourn or
be sorry for them that be departed in the faith of Christ / but to rejoice / as
in the^ that rest in the sleep of peace (for so is it daily remembered in the
Mass) until they shall be called unto the last judgment. Nevertheless I

Commendacyons.
(...)

^His psalm following / according to the nombre of the hebrew letters is
divided in to. xxij. Chapiters / which are called Octonaries: because every of
the^ co^teyneth eight uses. But why is it called the co^mendacyons of souls /
I much marvel: For if they mean it of the souls departed / then after my
judgment do they greatly err / namely syns it is / nor can not otherwise be
applied / but either as a spirytuall meditacion of the ryghteous in the laws
of god: or else to be the voice of those blessed souls / which being risen
with Christ in a newnes of life / ^o co^tynually cry and call upon him / to be
enstructed and live after his word and commandment. For the understanding
whereof two things are to be noted. The one / that we do make therein a fervent
and herty peticyon unto god / that he vouchesafe to teach / dyrecte and guide
us in the way of justice and veryte. The other / that in all points touching
our salvation / we should in no wise cleave to the doctrynes or persuacions of
men. And therefore is the hole psalm garnysshed with these words (thy law thy
ways / thy precepts / thy judgments / and such like) which glyster every
where: like to bright and radyant sterres / as who should say that all the
laws / ways / and judgments of men are fallyble / and therefore not to be
followed. Also it is a complaynt of the godly congregacyon / expressing how
sore it greueth them to se the laws of god rejected and set at naught / and
man's ways and inuencions to be received in stead thereof: pronunsynge them
only to be blessed / which walk in the way of the lord / and are holy
given to search his law / being night and day earnestly occupied in divine
studyes. To al such does his Psalms give high and synguler commendacyons.

The argument of the Psalms of ye Passyo^.
(...)

^Or asmoch as in these psalms following diverse prophecyes concerning the
passyo^ / death and resurreccyon of our sauyoure Christ are contained /
therefore are they called Psalms of the passyo^: wherein David expressyng / and
being the figure of Christ / does first / as it were in a song / record and
express his great deieccyon and downefal / and after that his sodeyn
exaltacyon and rysyng again / the co^fucyon of his adversaries the restoryng
of his kingdom with the increase and dilatynge of the same / even to the
uttermost part of the earth / and finally the contynuaunce thereof unto the
worlds end. And even so did our medyatour Christ / first suffer the death of
the cross / which to the face of the world was right shameful and
sclaunderous / and after that rose again with high glory and trymphe /

when he had obtained vyctory against the devil / death / and sin / and
deliver his kyngedome (which is the Church) from the strayghte oblygacyon and
bond of death in the which it was wrapped by the offense of Ada^ / and
destroyed the Church Malygnant / the kingdom and Synagoge of Satan with the
mighty spirit of his mouth / I mean the virtue of his everlasting word /
whereby he shall preserve and continue his said kingdom or Church unto ye
worlds end. Uvhiche as he did at the beginning by his apostles / so shall he
by his true preachers dilate and exte^de the same in to all the costs of the
world / and at the latter resurreccyon / shall deliver it up unto his father /
pure and unspotted / to be immortally gloryfyed in body and soul: even as
verily as he him self arose again from death / and ascended unto his father in
body and soul eternally to reygne with him in heuyn.

thou gave me to do. And now glorifye thou me father with thy self with the
glory which I had before this world was made of the I have publysshed thy name
to the men whom thou gave me of the world. They were thine and thou gave
the^ to me / and they kept my word. Now they know that all that thou gave
me come from the. For the words which thou gave me I gave them / and they
took them / and knew verily that they came from the / and they believed that
thou sentest me. For them I ask / for the world I ask not / but for them
which thou gave me because they be thine and all mine be thine / and thine
mine / and I am glorified in them. And I am now no longer in the world: but
they be in the world still: For I come to the / holy father save them for thy
names sake whom thou haste given me / that they may be one as we be one. when
I was with them in the world / I did keep the^ in thy name. Uvhome thou gave
me I kept and none of them perysshed / but only the sone of perdicyo^ that
the scripture might be fulfilled. But now I come to the / and these I speak in
the world that they may have my joy replenyshed in them. I gave them thy word
/ and the world hated them because they be not of the world: like as I am not
of the world. I asked not that thou should take them away out of the world /
but that thou keep them from the wicked. They be not of the world / like as I
am not of the world. Make them holy in thy truth. Like as thou have sent me
in to the world / so have I sent the^ in to the world / and for the^ I do
sanctifye my self / that they also may be sanctified in the truth. And I pray
not only for them / but also for the^ that shall believe in me through their
preachynges: so that all they may be one. Like as thou (father) art in me and
I in the / that they also may be in us / that the world may believe that thou
have sent me. And the glory which thou have given me / I gave it them that
they might be one: like as we be one / I in them / and thou in me / that they
may be made perfyte in one / and that the world may know that thou have sent
me / and loved them as thou haste loved me. Father / they whom thou haste
given me I will that where I be / they may also be with me that they may se my
glory which thou gave me / for thou have loved me before ye making of the
world. Just father / the world knows the not: but I know the and these
know that thou have sent me and I have made known unto then thy name and I
will make it known / to the intent that the love wherewith thou love me might
be in them / and I in them.
