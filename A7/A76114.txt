Printed in the year 1661.

A true and real Manifestation of endeared and unfeigned Love flowing through
a Brother, from the endless Life, Unto the Scattered, (yet United) flock who
are of the SEED ROYAL.
OH! Ye living Branches of the trve Vine; ye Children of the day whose light
is come, on whom the glory of the Lord is risen, ye hungering Lambs and
little ones, and thirsting souls after righteousness, and all ye in whom true
desires are begotten, after the knowledge of the Lord; and whose faces are
turned toward Sion, more especially to all ye amongst whom I sometimes have
had my Conversation in the Gospel of Christ Jesus the light of life; unto you
all, (without respect of persons) endeared everlasting love, from melting
bowels, from me freely flows and reaches, and in which receive the dear
Salutation of me your Brother, fellow Traveller and Companion, toward and in
the promised Inheritance; and now a Prisoner for the Testimony of that Truth
and Gospel which in the fullness of time has been in the demonstration of the
Spirit and Power of God revealed and declared in and amongst you; yea in
fullness of love and life am I even constrained hereby to salute and embrace
you: and let you know that I am yet alive, and that that life and power lives
in me which shall subdue Death it self; and him that has the power of it, in
which life power and love I earnestly desire and wish that grace mercy love,
life and peace eternal, may be abundantly shed abroad and multiplied in and
amongst you all.

Oh! my dear and evrlastingly beloved Brethren and Sisters, what shall I say or
what words shall I use to express my love union and nearness to and with you,
ye bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh, and love of my life; surely I am
full, yea I am full of Love toward you, and have (even as it were) traveled
in pain for some time waiting to bring forth a manifestation of it: And now
truly rejoice that the time is come for me to ease my self unto you, and the
gates being set open, let my love swiftly run forth toward you as a mighty
Stream that runs down a steep Hill, and bears down all opposition before it;
When I look back and call to mind the day, when the Lord uttered his Voice
amongst us, and when his call reached to his own in us, and when he bowed our
hearts to answer his call, and when I with many of you turned my face toward
Sion, and began to advance out of Egypt, and took our Journey together through
the wilderness in a path unknown unto us; yea, my dear hearts, when I remember
now in this time of my restraint and Captivity, what freedom and liberty once I
had amongst you, when I went with joy and gladness with them that kept
holy day, when I assembled amongst the little ones of my Fathers family to wait
upon him, and when sometimes as the least of his little ones, I Ministered before
him amongst you out of that everlasting Treasury from whence I received a
portion to distribute, when he uttered his Voice through me, and when his
witness in many of you answered and testified it was not the voice of a
Stranger; When his glory even filled his house, and his presence appeared in
the midst of us to the shaking of the earth removing the mountains and rending
the rocks, when his living streams swiftly run through the little valleys, and
watered and refresh't his pleasant heritage, when the broken in heart were
bound up, and comfort and glad tidings Proclaimed to Sions mourners, when the
Lambs skipt upon the mountains, and the morning Stars rejoiced together, when
with one accord from the life Eternal, in its dominion we breathed forth
praises unto Sions King, yea when these things are set before me in this my
captive (yet contented state) verily, my bowels are even turned within me, and
in remembrance thereof mine heart affects mine eyes, and mine eyes answers my
heart, and often tears plentifully runs down upon my Bed in the night season; Oh
my dear and precious ones! feel ye my melting, panting, yearning bowels
over and toward you; Let not my tears be spilt in vain in remembrance of
you, what though I am here shut up, and numbered amongst transgressors, and
separated from your sosciety? ye know it is only for bearing record to the
living hope begotten in you, even the hope of Israel: Oh! how can I forget the
Lords pleasant Heritage, whose beauty, whose love has even overcome me; ye
excellent ones, surely my delight is in you, my union, my fellowship, my life
is with you, nay if I forget you, (in whom my soul rejoices, and in whose love
I am foulded) then let the pitiful tender mother forget her innocent tender
Infant of a span long, the fruit of her womb which she has brought forth
through sore pangs and sorrow; yea then let mine eyes forget to guide or direct
my feet, and let my right hand forget his service for its fellow members, for
if I forsake or turn my back from the little ones of the Camp of Israel, when
in the wilderness in the day of trial, when Amalecks forces approaches near
them, yea or at the Lions mouth or Dragons Den, then let my right hand be dried
up, and my peirceing sword (which the Captain of Israells host has girt
about me) return into mine own bowels, and let the sharp Arrows of my Bow
(which abode in its strength when the Archers shot at me) swiftly pass through
my own Breast, yea then let the enemy persecute my soul and take it, and lay
mine honor in the dust, and tread my life down to the ground, and let me be as
them that go down to the grave and shall never see light, nay ye are written
and sealed in my hearts love with indeligable Characters, even as with the
point of a Diamond, in the bright pollished Marble; what instrument or power
shall ever be able to raze you out; or make a separation between us! yea though
my outward man be here in bondage, my love, my life, my spirit is at liberty;
and on a rock am I set above mine Enemies, my Trials and Sufferings (wherein
my spirit) I often behold the Innocent Lambs, feeding in the pleasant pastures,
under the good Shepherds conduct, and drinking at the living Fountain, where I
see the harmless little ones feeding in the Banqueting house in the Fathers
presence; and the Banner of love displayed over them, and where I truly feed
drink and am refreshed with and among them, to my unexpressable joy and great
delight; yea the Innocence of the Lambs, and simplicity of the Babes often times
even overcomes my heart with love unto them, and the spirit of Courage and
Valor which my God has raised up in them in this day of his power, (by which
they are made willing to Ieapard their lives in the high places of the Field)
even fills my soul with joy, and my mouth with songs of praises for them; Oh
dear Lambs! let me have a habitation amongst you, and in your love and life
let me have a resting place, yea stretch forth your Arms to embrace my
breathing soul; and let your hearts be open to receive my love, for I am your
Brother, one of your Mothers Children, let me be near unto you; And further my
dearly beloved Brethren and Sisters, let me put you in remembrance that the
enemies of your everlasting peace are many, subtle and Potent, yea when I have
beheld the rageing sea, casting up her Monsters, when I have reviewed the
strength of Amalecks Army, with the Midianitish wiles, the long wilderness
uninhabited, and the unknown path to be passed through, with the many Briars
and Thorns, fiery Serpents and wild Beasts, the sons of Anak to be overcome,
and fenced Cities to be won in the ardency of my spirit, and fervency of love,
my soul even cries Lord preserve the Innocent and upright in heart, and carry
thy little ones in thy Bossome, and let thine everlasting arm encompass them,
for what Power, what Wisdom, can deliver from those Enemies and lead through
those straites difficulties and distresses, but the Power and Wisdom of the
Lord of Hosts. And therefore in all estates and conditions whatsoever, let
your eye be unto him, from whom alone salvation comes, and in diligence and
faithfulness wait upon him, that with his wisdom and power ye may be
thoroughly furnished, by which ye may be able to encounter with and overcome
all hardships, and enemies whatsoever; for truly dear hearts, when I veiw the
strength, the subtilty, the vigilance and cruelty of these Enemies, my heart
would faint, but that I also see and know the work is the Lords, and his power
is over all, whose council shall stand; Who is bringing up his chosen with joy,
and his redeemed with gladness, to the mountain of holiness and habitation of
Justice, where the weary find rest, and the hungry and thirsty are plentifully
fed and refreshed and nourished up and preserved unto everlasting life, and
where salvation is appointed for Walls and Bullworkes. And therefore Oh ye
seed of Abraham! and little ones of the house of Israel, lift up your heads and
rejoice, fear not neither be ye dismayed, look ye not out at enemies,
neither their power, malice, subtilty, nor rage, but stay your minds in that
light that first convinced you of sin, wait very diligently in it, and be
faithful to its leading and commands in the least appearance, although you may
(as to the outward), suffer great loss by so doing; and take diligent heed to
watch against that which would draw your minds from it, under what color or
pretense soever; Dear hearts take heed of self in every thing, for its in
League with the Prince of Darkness, and is a chief Leader in his Army; self
love, self wisdom, yea, beware of the wisdom of the flesh, which will some
times exercise it self in the things of God, and will be prying into and
trying, and examining, and judging, that which it understands not; but in the
end it betrays Simplicity and Innocence, beware of self Exaltation under what
show soever, but keep to that which keeps you in the Cross to the carnal part,
that ye may dye daily thereunto, yea remember the time of your first love, and
day of your espousalls, when the dread of the Lord was over you, and when you
durst not utter words until tried and Judged, when simplicity and Innocence
was sought after, to be Guide and Leader. Oh then Unity and Love increased, and
the little ones grew strong in the Lord, Take heed of Covetousness, of the
mind, secret stealing again into the Earth, beware of haste and rashness in
any thing, but let the meek and gentle Spirit, Guide and Lead in every thing,
and be kind and tenderly affectioned one to another, bearing and forbearing
each other in love, looking always to the better Part, where the unity stands,
unto that which in your selves discovers secrets, but covers and hides
infirmities in the Brethren; and if any be overtaken with a fault take heed of
hasty Judging and Reproving, for that will not restore, but in Pity and Love
bear; Verily when I have beheld the strong, subtle and many Enemies that the
poor weak and little ones have to encounter withal, many strong Lusts and
riseings within, and great temptations and trials without, by which many times
they are overcome, and sore wounded, my soul in secret is even melted and drawn
out in love and pity toward them; and gladly could I help bear their burdens
and War against their Enemies! yea my life would not be dear unto me to save a
Lamb from the Lions mouth.

Let bowels of love reach one to another in every condition, And ye that have
of this worlds goods, shutt not out from you the sense and feeling of others
wants, but wait to have that eye open that beholds and feels others
necessities, yea let your bowels be drawn forth to the hungry and needy, that
their bowels also may bless the Lord for you; and take heed of excuses when
truth and necessity requires your aid; what if some be slack and negligent
herein, let others be So much the more bountiful and liberal by such example
to provoke or make them ashamed, that it may appear that the earth is under
your feet, and that you are Children of the Lord, because you love the
Brethren, and in all that the sense and feeling of the love of God toward you
reach forth one to another as the root and offspring of all, then shall peace
extend to you as a River, and righteousness run down as a mighty stream, then
shall there be noe mourning nor complaining in our streets, nor beggar in our
Israel, but Unity, joy, and gladness within our Habitation, Oh its a blessed
thing to have an open heart and liberal hand; a sacrifice well pleassing to
the Lord.

And dear hearts, take heed of that eye that will watch for evil one against
another, or be too watchful to spy others faults, take heed of suffering
prejudice or offenses to arise in any case within you, for if it once have got
footing there, it is not easily removed, and if that which is evil in another
rise against any of you, Then diligently watch over your own hearts, least the
same evil rise in you and contend with the other, And this does but gender
strife and break Unity; but in case of wrong or injury done against you, seek
not too eagerly to vindicate your selves (though inocent) but in Gods wisdom,
true patience and love to the offender, bear and forbear, and suffer wrong
rather then to increase discord, waiting patiently on the Lord, who in due time
will clear your innocence as the light. And so all dwell in love together, and
let the God of peace an Unity rule in your hearts forevermore. Then shall your
hearts be filled with joy and gladness, and your mouths with joyful praises,
Oh praise the Lord forever, and exalt his Name in the Congregation of the
righteous, for he has done marvelous things, he has regarded the low estate
of the poor and needy, he has heard the cries of the Oppressed, and sighing of
his Prisoners, and with his Arm has he brought Salvation, and with his own
right hand has he gotten himself the Victory. Oh! ye Innocent and upright in
Heart, lift up your heads and be glad in the Lord, for his Council concerning
us shall stand, that he will never leave us until he has set us in full
Possession of the promised Inheritance: Settle it in your hearts that he has
not raised us out of the dust and brought us hitherto, now to let us fall in
the wilderness, and give us over as a Prey to our Enemies; What then shall
become of his great Name which he has exalted and is exalting in the sight of
the Nations, and for which it is that he has done these great things for us?
not for your sakes nor worthiness, (Oh Seed of Israel) has he remembered his
Covenant with you, but for his own name sake has he wrought deliverance for
you; yet know this for your consolation, for your sakes will he reprove Kings
in the day of his wrath, and pour contempt upon Princes, yea and (rather then
his work of deliverance shall sail) will overthrow Kingdoms and Nations if
they stand in his way: praise him forever, and give thanks in remembrance of
his hollyness, for it becomes the just to be thankful, and praise is comely
for the upright, And when you draw near unto him make mention of your Brother
before him, that his loving kindness may be continued toward me, and I
preserved in faithfulness to him, and Unity with you all, yea let all my true
hearted Brethren and Sisters know, that he has dealt very bountifully with me,
and all his ways have I found to be Mercy and Truth unto me, for when by his
grace he first called me, I obtained Mercy to be found faithful, and when
through my Labors and Travells in his Vineyard wherein he set me, my Testimony
for him there was finished, and my outward strength near exhausted, he gathered
me to my expected rest in peace, and though mine Enemies (in eager pursuit of
their malice and envy) causelessly cast me into this Iayle amongst thieves and
evil doers, yet my God had a design of Love toward me in it, who has made
it a very pleasant Habitation, and is himself become a little Sanctuary unto
me, where in his presence I am preserved in perfect joy and peace, having the
Testimony of his spirit in many of you of my faihtfull service for him toward
you, and the same Testimony also in my self that I never consulted with flesh
and blood, or disputed his Commands when and where ever he sent me, and that I
this day stand clear of the Blood of all men; And now my dear and precious
Ones, in veiw of your goodly Tents and pleasant Habitation I leave you, and
with plenty of tears I kiss and embrace You, my heart being as full of love
toward you, as when I began to write, for while the streams thereof swiftly
runs unto you, such is my simpathy with and nearness to you, that I am filled
with the Returns of Yours to me, it being as natural to my heart to receive
it, as the parched ground the drops of rain; Oh bless ye the Lord for me, and
let us magnify his Name together.

Well then dear hearts, in your love am I even rouled as in a Garment, and
bound with everlasting cords, and sealed in a perpetual Covenant which out
lasts the day and night, in this love let me live, yea in it let me dye, yet in
the same I shall out live death it self, where (in his everlasting Arms who
is love, and who never slumbers nor sleeps) I rest and solace my self with and
in you, And so receive ye this as a token of that indeared love flowing forth
from me which shall abide when I shall be no more, but yet a hope lives in me
that he shall once again see the faces of many of you Who is

Your dear Brother (a Prisoner for the hope of Israel) JASPER BATT.
