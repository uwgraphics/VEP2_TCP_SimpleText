A Posie of rare Flowers, Gathered by a Young Man for his Mistrisse.
To a delectable new tune.


THe Summers Sun ore-heating,
Within a harbor sitting,
Under a Marble shade,
For my true Love the fairest,
And flowers the rarest,
A P^sie thus I made.
The first and last for trusting,
Is called Everlasting,
I pulled from the Bay,
The blue and crimson Columbine,
The Dasie and the Woodbine,
And eke the blooming May.
The sweetest flowers for posies,
Pinkes, Gilliflowers and Roses,
I gathered in their prime:
The flowers of Musk-millions,
Come blow me down sweet-William,
With Rosemary and Time.
The Larksh^^le, and the Lilly,
The Flag and Daffadilly,
The Wall-flower sweet of smell*
The Maidenblush and Cowslip,
The Peagle and the Tulip.
That does in sweet excel
The Violet and Grediline,
The odoriferous Eglantine,
With Thrift and Honesty,
The Muskerose sweet and dainty,
With others flowers plenty,
Oxlops and Piony.
The Gilliflowers variety,
Of every color severally,
The Lady smacks and Pancy:
The Batchelors button, fair and fine,
The Prime rose and the Sope-in-wine
With them the Maidens fancy.
The time-observing Marigold,
Most fair and lovely to behold,
I plucked amongst the rest,
The white and red Carnation,
The senses recreation
With other flowers the best.
The flowers fit for smelling,
Whose sweet is far excelling,
All the perfumes of Art,
I pulled up each several,
And made a Posie therewithal.
To bear to my sweet heart.
The second part,
To the same tune.




SWeet Basil and sweet Margerum
The Cowslip of Jerusalem,
The Crowfoot and Sea-flower,
The Start-vp and kiss me,
A flower that shall not miss me,
In my true Lovers bower.
The Lady of Essex fair,
A flower passing sweet and rare,
I in the midst did place.
Because my Love is fairest,
And of all maids the rarest,
In body, and in face.
These flowers being culled,
And their branches pulled,
Did yield a fragrant sent:
Observing their fit places,
I bound them in bridelaces,
And to my Love I went.
In hope she would receive them,
To the end that I might give them,
As pledges of my love,
To her whose radiant beauty
Did bind me to this duty,
Hoping she will never remove.
Her permanent affection
To me, who by election
Am hers while life does last:
These flowers did resemble
My thoughts which never dissemble.
But hold both smell and taste.
When I had made this Nose-gay,
With joyful heart I took my way,
To find out my true Love:
Who for my absence mourned,
Until that I returned,
As does the Turtle Dove.
At last I found her sporting.
With other Maids consorting,
Close by a River side:
My posie not refused,
When she the same perused,
Upon her arm she tide.
(Quoth she) although these flowers
Will wither in few hours,
Yet take my word, Sweetheart.
My love to thee shall never decay,
Till death does my life away,
From thee I Will never depart.
The like to her I vowed,
And whilst the time allowed,
About such things we talked:
At length because it waxed late,
We for that time did leave our prate,
And from each other walked.
When with a mild behavior
She thanks me for my favor,
And wore it for my sake:
With enterchanging kisses,
The rest remains in wishes
Unwilling leave we take.
FINIS.
