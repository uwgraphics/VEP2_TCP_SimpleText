A Quip for a scornful Less. Or, Three slips for a Tester.
To the tune of Two slips for a Tester.




ALl you who have heard
How I did regard
a peevish disdainful Less,
Who proud of her beauty,
Forgetting her duty,
did seek to make me an ass:
Hear likewise my part,
Who have in my heart
resolved evermore to detest he,
Since she was in the fault,
I well may revolt,
and give her three slips for a tester.
There once a time was,
When I loved that less,
more dear then I did mine own life
And firmly was bent,
If she would consent,
with speed to have made her my wife:
The foolish nice creature,
Looked I should entreat her,
such madness and folly possessed her:
No more I Will be vexed,
My humor is fixed,
I Will give her three slips for a tester.
As she was to me,
To her will I be:
for so all my friends do advise,
If I should her meet,
I would not her greet,
nor afford her a glance from my eyes:
As I on the way
Was walking one day,
to meet me straight way she addressed her:
Which I to prevent,
A contrary way went,
and gave her three slips for a tester.
She came the other day
To the house where I lay,
to speak with me was her desire,
She said that she would
See me if she could,
but I said I scorned to come nie her:
Yet through the glass
I peept on my Less,
good Lord how brave she had dressed her
In hope to allure,
But let her be sure,
I Will give her three slips for a tester.
She staid at the door,
An hour and more,
to wait for my coming in sight:
At last I came to her,
But not like a wooer,
though once she was all my delight,
But that I was loath
To infringe mine oath,
I had gone very near to have kissed her
She seemed so fair,
I could hardly forbear,
yet I gave her three slips for a ttester
What lack you fair maid,
Unto her I said,
or what is your errand with me
She prayed me so come
To her father at home,
to which I denied to agree:
And made a reply,
That never more I
intended my mind to pester,
With any small thought
That concerned me ought,
but to give her three slips for a tester.
The second part.
To the same tune.




AT last I went with her,
And so both together
did come where her father did dwell.
I wonder, quoth he,
That we cannot you see,
what have you forsaken my Nel^?
Your daughters too fine,
Quoth I to be mine,
therefore it is in vain to molest her:
Yet take this from me,
I Am as scornful as she,
and I Will give her three slips for a tester.
Then she standing by,
Put finger t'th eye,
and sorely began to weep:
Sir quoth the old man,
Do all what we can,
where love cannot go it will creep.
All this would not serve,
I still did reserve
my vow, and I Am glad that I mist her,
Thus I took my leave,
And they all did perceive,
I would give her three slips for a tester.
Yet since at a Wedding,
Where she came a gadding,
among other maids of the town,
She came to the board,
Of her own accord,
and close by me she sat down,
Thought I this is strange,
To see such a change,
I wished that my tongue had a blister.
When I made that vow,
But I must keep't now,
and give her three slips for a tester.
It makes me to muse,
That she who did use
so much to reject me before,
Should follow me so,
Where ere I do go,
yet she has incensed me so sore,
My heart is so hard,
I cannot regard
her beauty which brightly does glister.
I would have had feign
What now I disdain,
I must give her three slips for a tester.
If I had not sworn
To hold her in scorn,
I would not so hardly deal with her.
Oh had she been true,
As to lovers is due,
ere this we had married together,
For me she shall stay,
Yet needs must I say,
that love is a sore that will fester:
I pity her state,
But help is too late,
I must give her three slips for a tester.
Let every maid
Mark what I have said,
and leave off all scornful disdain,
Take leave while it is profferd,
And time while it is offered,
or else you may wish for it in vain:
My love when time was
Did make me an ass,
and played upon me like a Iester:
But the worst is her share,
I scorn to take care,
but I Will give her three slips for a tester.
FINIS.
