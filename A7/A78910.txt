His Majesty's Message to the House of Peers. April 22. 1642.
HIs Majesty having seen a Printed Paper, entitled, A Question answered how
Laws are to be understood and obedience yielded; (which Paper He sends together
with this Message) thinks fit to recommend the consideration of it to His House
of Peers, that they may use all possible care and diligence for the finding out
the Author, and may give directions to His learned Council, to proceed against
Him and the Publishers of it, in such a way as shall be agreeable to Law and
the course of Justice, as Persons who endeavor to stir up Sedition against His
Majesty; And His Majesty doubts not but they will be very sensible how much
their own particular Interest (as well as the public government of the
Kingdom) is, and must be shaken, if such License shall be permitted to bold
factious spirits to withdraw His Subjects strict obedience from the Laws
established, by such Seditious and Treasonable distinctions. And of Doctrines
of this nature His Majesty doubts not but that their Lordships will publish
their great dislike, it being grown into frequent Discourse, and vented in some
Pulpits (by those desperate turbulent Preachers, who are the great Promotors of
the distempers of this time) That humane Laws do not bind the Conscience;
which being ones believed, the civil Government and peace of the Kingdom will
be quickly dissolved. His Majesty expects a speedy account of their Lordships
exemplary Justice upon the Authors and Publishers of this Paper.

Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1642.
