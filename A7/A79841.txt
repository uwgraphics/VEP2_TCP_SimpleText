An EPISTLE To the Reader.
Reader,
IF thy faith retains Virginity, and is not violated by believing because the
Church believes, nor on the other hand beguiled, with empty, vain, flattering
conceptions, superficial and irregular principles and notions, such as exclude
the written rule; it is not doubted, that thou will prejudge the series (here
discussed) by the Frontispiece or Index, and so be deterred from reading,
trying and waighing. It is hard to determine, whether the weak head, that
treasures up all yellow metals, in stead of, and reputes it Gold; or the
carelessly disdaineful hand, that seeing the former mistaken, rejects gold,
supposing it brass, without trial, be most culpable. We all confess the Gospel
to be truth, and all men liars; let no man then think of men above what is
written: for though all men must acknowledge themselves to be short, and know
in part, yet most men endevaour to withhold others from transcending
themselves, which is and has bin observable in the gradual dawnings of the
truth, such thickets do especially exercise the eyes and understanding of him
that traveleth toward the good Land, the professed opposers their hearts or
affections. I thought good to premonish he of both, that with the wise builder
thou may fore cast thy costs: when thou losest, consider it is usual with
travelers; moreover, has what thou losest, bears no proportion with the most
excellent things thou daily gainest. Consult not therefore with flesh and
blood, that it is easiest swimming with the stream; for they will with Peter,
tell thy spirit, Master, it is good for us to be here; or with Pharaoh, You may
worship in Egypt, or go not far away: but Christ calls the first Satan, and
God by Moses calls the other the house of bondage. When thou beginnest thy
Journey, thou will as hardly forget the fleshpots, as the weaned child the
breast; yet this the child must do, and so become a man. Content not thy self,
that thou read, and in general terms professest the doctrine and practice
of the Apostles, if thou follow not Christ in the regeneration, and all truth
for his sake, and for that it is the fame with thy new nature. To know truth
from error, is peculiar to the children of the day; Christ from Antichrist, to
the Martyrs, witnesses and redeemed of the Lord Jesus; the voice of the true
shepherd, from strangers, to the sheep. No marvel then, if the form, carcass
and shadow of truth (like a magnificent Image) be adorned with curious carving,
engraven with acute wits, painted with deceivableness of unrighteousness,
clothed with the stern looks of worldly authority and dignities; decked, with
silver, Gold and pearls, enricht with the merchandise of slaves and souls of
men; before whom, vain glorious trumpets, and all sort of music echo, and are
disported: no marvel (I say) that we see such throngs of worshippers on the
face of the earth, nothing is wanting to them, why then should not the town go
on to be built? Promises of privileges of all sorts, to as many as will fall
down and worship, and receive the mark: contrariwise, they shall not buy or
sell. Gutta cavat Lapidem, continued drops we are a stone. Now trust men and
multitudes no longer without Trial; lest the light they show, be a Parelii, or
mock-sun: take not thy highth by it, lest thou meet with contradictions; for
assuredly, if thy compass be not rightly touched, thou will mistake thy course,
meet with rocks and perilous shores. But if thy heart be upright, and willing
to be taught of God, the great Lodestone draws infallibly true, irresistibly
strong, making apparent difference between God and Mammon; the wisdom from
above, and that which is from beneath; the doctrine and discipline of Christ,
and that of antichrist; realities and resemblances. The whole discourse is very
brief, and the concurrence of Scripture answers the same on every leaf;
which have the words of many written, to save the pains (as much as might be)
of turning to them, which may be better employed in considering, comparing, and
commenting in thy serious and judicious thoughts and mind on the whole Tract,
as well the form and matter, as how it is proved. Which course I was induced
unto, from my observation of many excellent works, which notwithstanding do
paraphrase in most texts on that part conducing to the interest or imagination
of the compiler, and in a sort impose their sense on the reader (more like
Critics then Christians) concealing and waving that other part, which makes
against it: I have therefore endeavored to bring all to a fair impartial
trial: hoping, that having to do with the understanding part of man, this may
be a call to many, no farther to precipitate themselves Ignorantly, into the
snare of the fowler. Also an invitation to such, whom the mercy of God has in
some measure freed to enquire, how far; that so they may not think they have
answered the will of God, when having a Jubilee from the Egyptian servitude,
will travel no further then the wilderness: and lastly, that it may be an
exercitation to the wise, to proceed and contribute their abilities for
enlightening of their generation; which has bin the character and employment
of the people of God in all ages. Wisdom is justified of her children.
Wherefore, that thou good reader, and those who now despise her, may so know
wisdom, as to justify it, has bin the thing endeavored in this brief
discourse, and shall be the Prayer of

Thine in the service of the Lord Jesus, Ambrose Clappe.

AN ADVERTISEMENT To the READER.
WHereas, in the seventh sect and second part of the ninth, it is said, man was
not under the Covenant of works for life, since Adam; and that in Jer. 33.31.
and Heb. 10.16. is mention made of two Covenants: whence lest any should
suppose, the Jews were under a Covenant of works, for eternal life, it must be
considered, that Gods Covenant made with Israel, at their coming out of Egypt,
required outward acts of obedience: thereunto also were annexed diverse promises
of outward and Temporal Blessings, as the Land of Canaan, etc. And
contrariwise, on disobedience, threatenings of temporal Judgments; the end
whereof was, to manifest Gods choosing them from all Nations, according to the
promise made to Abraham, To show his name and will in and by them; what man
lost by the fall to Typifie Christ the promised seed, and show what was to be
performed by him, (viz.) to fulfill the whole law of God given to them, and be
a Satisfactory sacrifice; and so by Christ's fulfilling the Covenant of works,
(intended in the abovesaid sections) the Covenant of grace is established.
Wherever in this discourse it is said, that Christ did somethings as God, and
others as man; it may not be understood, that the two natures were divided, but
were in union still, and the acts peculiar to each, had their particular
effects, through all Generations on man; according as they had an union with
one or both natures.

This Discourse treats of man, what 1. By Creation; and so 1. Perfect, and
under the Covenant of Works. 2. Fallen, and under the Covenant of Grace.
2. By Redemption; and that 1. Promised. The instrument or person by whom: 1.
His names: 1. Son of God. 2. Son of man, Emmanuel.
2. His offices, King, Priest, and Prophet.


2. Performed in the fullness of time, By two natures united.
3. Manifested, by two Signs, viz. the water and blood.



The two natures were, 1. Humane to suffer: wherein are 1. For what; viz. For
the transgressions against the first Testament only. Whence it is that Man's
eternal state is, but his eternal happiness is not from the suffering and
passive part of the death of Christ.
2. For whom: For the whole nature in which he suffered. The Reasons.
Objections answered.
3. Why, and yet himself righteous: By imputation, because found in the nature.

2. Divine, to fulfill all righteousness: 1. In what: In the actual fulfilling
the whole Law of God, by the power of the divine nature. Whence it is that the
actual righteousness of the Saints is not in the suffering of Christ, but in
his righteousness.
2. For whom: For those only who are united by faith to the divine nature. The
Reasons. Against the Reasons is one Objection made, and answered.
3. Why for them only, and they unrighteous, even as others: By Imputation,
because made partakers of the divine nature.




All which is manifested by the knowledge of 1. Gods threefold discovery of
himself in relation to man, viz. 1. Father, i. e. Creator. 2. Son, as Redeemer,
1. As God, working righteousness, 2. As Man, sufferer for the whole Nature.
3. Holy Spirit, Regenerator, working faith where God pleases, and not
promised to all.
2. By the two Testaments. 3. By Similies in both:


They having 1. Different Testators. 2. Different People. 3. Different Ends. 4.
Different Signs. 5. Different Effects. Law, 1. Moses. 2. People or seed of
Abraham. 3. To show Gods choice of that people, and Christ to come of them. 4.
Circumcision, 1. To show the choice, 2. What is required. 1. One of that Seed,
i. e. Messiah, should satisfy justice as a Sacrifice. 2. Should fulfill all
righteousness.

5. To convince of sin.
Gospel. 1. Christ. 2. All Believers. 3. To show a chosen people, viz. the Seed
after the Spirit. 4. Baptism, 1. To show the choice, 2. What was required. 1.
Faith in what Christ has done and suffered. 2. Living in, and walking
according to the power of his love.

5. To convince of Righteousness.




On the right and distinct understanding of the former Fundamentals, are built
these Truths. In Doctrine. 1. Man was created good, and fell. 2. Was redeemed,
and abused it. 3. Whosoever were saved in all ages, it was by union with Christ,
wrought by the Spirit; not promised to all. 4. No Free Will. 5. No Falling
away. 6. No Desperation. 7. No judging Infants. 8. Heathen sinners against Law
and Gospel. 9. All shall rise. 10. Christ to judge all, 1. Why. 2. For what.

In Discipline, 1. Gods choice the ground of practice. 2. God has two distinct
choices succeeding each other. 3. The Signs of each concern not the other. 4.
The Law given by each Testator, required obedience from those only who were
under the choice. 5. Antichrist consists more in Principles then in Professions.



And contrariwise, expressed, or implied. Errors in Doctrine. 1. No extent of
the virtue of Christ's death to the whole nature. 2. No resurrection of the
unjust. 3. That Christ shall not be their Judge. 4. That the most of men sin
not against the Gospel offered. With other errors and contradictions discussed.
Errors in Discipline confound the choice. 1. In the Signs. 2. The Interest.
3. The Testators. 4. The Testaments. 5. The Ends. 6. The Effects. 7. Witnesses
of Christ, 1. The Spirit. 2. Water. 3. Blood.
and Antichrist, 1. Earthly power. 2. Riches. 3. Pomp.

Emmanuel manifested.
I.
MAn being created, was under a perfect Law or Covenant of works for life.

II.
Man brake this Law of Works.

III.
(a) God promised, the seed of the woman (b) should break the Serpents head (or
power:) (c) which is the Covenant of Grace.

IV
(a) Christ the promised seed, consisting of two natures, was (b) manifested in
the name Emmanuel: (c) which natures, are distinct in their acts and (d)
effects conducing to the restoration of man; (e) and must so be declared in
preaching the Gospel.

V.
(a) Christ as man, or son of man, was made passive, to bear the curse on
fallen man; and as God, (b) or son of God, was the fulfiller of the Fathers
will, in completing actual righteousness, (c) made effectual to all his
members: (d) and were both signified, the one by the blood, the other by the
water: which coming out of his side, (e) are called two witnesses.

VI.
(a) These two natures are further distinguished in two dispensations, by two
Testaments. (b) In the first, God chose a people to bear his name in the world,
viz. Abraham, and his seed after the flesh, by generation. (c) In which choice,
Christ was manifested to be the son of Abraham, (d) and a branch of the root of
Jesse, (e) in whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed. (f) In the
second, is Gods choosing Christ and his seed according to the Spirit, by
regeneration, (g) to glorify his Name in the world, (h) Christ being in this
Dispensation or Testament the root, and his people the branches.

VII.
(a) In the first Testament or Dispensation, God gave Circumcision for a sign
of the Messiah to come of that line, (b) to fulfill the whole Law of God, in
doing and suffering whatsoever was required of man: (c) The which Circumcision,
and all the Mosaical sacrifices, did imply. (d) And though called the Testament
of the Law, yet was under the Covenant of Grace, (e) and only a Schoolmaster.

VIII.
(a) Christ was, as man only, capable of suffering, and by his passion did
redeem every man, that is, the whole nature of man, from the guilt (c) of Adams
sin, (d) which was imputed to him, being found in our nature. (e) So that by
his suffering, he satisfied the justice of God, in bearing the curse due to man
(f) for Adams breach of the Law of works, and not otherwise.

IX.
Christ could not suffer for the actual transgressions of any individual man,
since Adam's fall; as may farther appear.

1. (a) Because himself could not transgress, (b) but bare the curse due for
the breach of the Law committed by Adam, (c) and thereby impressed on man's
nature, (d) of which Christ himself was.

2. (a) Because, man was not under the Law of works for life, after Christ was
promised, (b) any otherwise then as a Testament: showing, (c) what was to be
performed by Christ. By (d) which it appears, that man could transgress only
against the Covenant of Grace since Adam, (e) which Christ fulfilled actually
for believers only, (f) and so his suffering was only for the Law of Works,
broken by Adam's transgression, as has been proved.

Object. 1.
Whereas it is asserted, that Christ could not suffer for the actual
transgression of any man, since Adam's fall; it is contradictory to the
Scripture, and therefore to be rejected.

Answ. 1.
For answer, the Scripture contradicts it not, as may appear, for that of
Isa. 53.6. and 1 Pet. 2.24. say, Christ bare the iniquities of us all: which is
done: for first, (a) the disobedience of Adam, was the disobedience or
iniquities, whereof all mankind was thenceforth guilty; (b) because they in
him, thereby brake the whole Law of God.

(c) Secondly, this Christ bare, and so bare the inquities of us all: that
being ours; but (d) because he was the Lamb without spot, it must be only
imputatively. And was made a curse, because he was (e) found in the nature
whereon the curse lay.

Answ. 2.
The other Scriptures say, The blood of Christ cleanses us from all sin. By
which words recited, and the cohaerence of them, is demonstrated the (a)
application of Christ's death unto his by faith, and that two ways: first, (b)
by persuading the soul of the (c) sufficiency, and reality of his death, in
satisfaction of Gods justice: so the guilt of sin is done away from the
conscience, and it reconciled to God thereby.

Secondly, (d) the efficiency of his blood (applied by faith) does unite them
to Christ: thereby cleansing their consciences, (e) from the filth, pollution
and power of sin, by the power of Christ, in the Covenant of Grace, made in
him, who is made unto his (f) wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and
redemption; who by (g) beholding him, as in a glass, are transformed into the
same image, from glory to glory.

Object. 2.
Whereas in the ighth Section, it is averred that Christ died for all, it is
objected, That Christ * prayed not for the world, and consequently it is not
imaginable, he would spill his blood or the^^ for whom he would not spend his
breath.

Answ. 1.
It Is answered, that Christ's prayer in this chapter, consists of four parts
or branches:

1. For Himself.

2. For the Apostles, and for them by way of eminency: and so, not for any
other, as to their present great work.

3. For them that should believe on him, through their words.

4. For the world, and for them, that they might have (a) faith, and (b)
knowledge, that God sent Christ. And for them he prays twice, and also
teaches, that this knowledge (c) is life eternal.

(d) And for all (that the world may know) he prays, that they may know, the
truth of which (assuredly) they (e) shall know, if not whilst it is yet to day,
yet, when the Son of Man comes with his Angels. In the m an time this
knowledge (f) is to be taught them.

Answ. 2.
(a) Whatsoever was written aforetime, was written for our learning, whence it
follows, (b) that it is the declared will of God, that his people should pray
for all. Unto which duty are urged in one place five motives:

1. Because it is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior.

2. Because God our Savior, would have all men to be saved.

3. Because there is one God, and one Mediator, who are one.

4. Because they were all purchased by him.

5. Because the justice of God may be cleared, by his seasonable testifying his
love though all men abuse it.

X.
(a) In the second Dispensation or Testament, God gave baptism to discover
Christ, and to be (b) the sign of the choice of his seed, (c) by regeneration
through faith. They, being the branches (d) of that root, (which was (e) the
fulfiller of all righteousness) who were made righteous, only by (f)
imputation of that righteousness, which he fulfilled in himself, through his
union with the Father. And so Baptism is the sign, and Regeneration the
substance of the New Testament.

XI.
So that Circumcision, is not a Type of Baptism, as generally has been taught:
but a sign of God's choice of Abraham and his Seed after the flesh, to bear his
Name in the World: and Baptism also a sign of Christ, and of Gods choice of his
Seed by Regeneration, to honor him in this Testament. The blood in the first
dispensation, signifying Christ's humanity: the water in the later, his
divinity.

XII.
The two natures of Christ are farther manifested by his threefold Office.

First, as King, he is King as man, or in his humane Nature, (a) over the
kingdoms of the World, in (b) Righteousness, typified by (c) David, was also
called the (d) King of the Jews, and so is said to rule the Nations with a (e)
rod of iron.

Secondly, He is King as God, or in his divine Nature, (a) King of Saints, King
(b) of Peace; typified by (c) Melchisedeck, ruling in the (d) hearts of his
people, by his Spirit: and so his (e) kingdom is not of this World; and
therefore not governed by (f) Worldly force or power.

XIII.
Secondly, as Priest, he is a Priest, as man, or in his humane Nature, wherein
he suffered; typified in the sacrifices under the Priesthood of Aaron.

2. In his divine Nature, so he is a living Priest, ever making intercession
for his, (typified by the Priesthood of Melchisedech) by interposing his
righteousness. Which is farther evident; for that, the Spirit of God makes
intercession, in the prayers of the Saints.

XIV.
3. As Prophet, he is a Prophet as Man, or in his humane nature: typified by
Moses, who was the Prophet of the legal administration, under circumcision.

2. In his divine nature: typified by (a) John the Baptist, id est, Elias, who
was the Prophet of the Evangelical under Baptism. In which respect, John is
said to be the greatest Prophet: and both were present at Christ's
transfiguration on the Mount.

XV.
The two natures of Christ are farther declared, by diverse similes in
Scripture, as follows,

(a) He is called the Son of Adam, as Man; and Before the World was, as God.

(b) He is called the Son of Abraham, as Man; Before Abraham was, as God.

(c) He is called the Son of David, as Man; and David's Lord, as God.

(d) He is called a Branch of the Root of Jesse, as Man; the Root or Vine of
Regeneration, as God.

(e) He is called the Son of Man; the Son of God, and Emmanuel.

(f) He is said to be a Lamb slain, as Man; the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, as
God.

(g) Expressed by the Vail, which is his flesh, i. e. humanity, within the
Vail, i. e. his divinity.

(h) The Rock parted, in which Moses was put, i. e. Humanity and Divinity.

(i) Expressed, by two Witnesses on Earth, Water and Blood: coming forth of his
side, the Water-Divinity, the Blood his Humanity.

(k) In all things made like unto us (sin only excepted) signifying humanity.
Glorified with the Father before the world was, divinity.

(l) Expressed by two Mountains, one of cursing, the other of blessing: on each
of which were six stones, for the twelve Tribes of Israel.

(m) He is said to be the fulfiller of the Law, id est, of works, humanity. The
Lawgiver, id est, the Law of Grace, divinity.

XVI.
It is farther manifest in diverse other Scripture, viz. (a) By the parting of
the Mount of Olives, where the people shall be saved in the later day. (b) By
the sacrifices and Scapegoat. By the sin-Offering and Meat Offering. (c) By
the banks of a River, the streams whereof make glad the City of God. (d) By the
two Olive Trees, on each side of the banks of the River for food and medicine.

(e) By the two Olive Trees emptying Oil into the Lamps. (f) By the Wells of
Consolation. (g) By a yoke of two Dispensations, Humiliation, and Exaltation.
(h) By a Cornerstone (supporting two walls,) God's chosen people, under the
Law and the Gospel. (i) By a Way, and Jacobs Ladder conveying God's love to
man, and raising man's heart to God. (k) By the Office of the Mediatorship, a
propitiatory Sacrifice, and an Advocate with the Father. And is abundantly
illustrated with many of the like kind, as the (l) chewing of the cud, and
cleaving of the hoof of the clean beast, etc.

XVII.
From the cloud of Witnesses before recited, necessarily follows. (a) That
Christ perfected actual Righteousness, only in the power of the Divine Nature;
(b) which is savingly effectual to those above, who are made one with that
Nature through Regeneration, (c) and not otherwise.

Furthermore, it is to be known, that by all those Scriptures which say, the
Father gave his Son for, or unto the world; is meant most especially, (d) as he
was man, and so to suffer. And those Scriptures which say, (e) God gave a
people in a peculiar way to Christ; it is (f) by their being united unto, and
made partakers of the divine nature by Regeneration through faith. And thus
they are his (g) seed and members really, and called his (h) branches
metaphorically, and in him they are eternally happy, who is their head, glory,
(i) strength and song.

XVIII.
(a) In some respects, the death of Christ may be said to be, the free act of
his own will ( I lay down my life, etc.) and so is part of his actual
righteousness before spoken of, and effected only by the power of the divine
nature, effectual (b) to none but his sheep, and is no (c) part of his
suffering, as man; for so (d) he says, Father I will that this cup pass from
me, etc. By this the Objection of laying, etc. for his sheep only is prevented.

XIX.
Man is not made eternally happy by the passion of Christ; that being the act
of his (a) humane nature: but (b) thereby he has a forbearance from the curse,
which was, In the day thou eatest, etc. (c) Has also a resurrection, and (d)
eternal subsistence; And indeed, the redemption from that curse on man for
Adam's sin, Christ being made a curse in his suffering. But the happiness of
that eternal state, is made ours (e) by the union of the soul to the divine
nature, by the new birth, through faith in the love of God, first manifested in
Christ's sufferings.

XX.
So that it appears, that God's declaring Christ to be his Son (a) in whom he
is well pleased, was, as Christ was the bearer of the curse, as man, and
fulfiller of (b) perfect righteousness, as God, as has been said: (c) and is
therefore well pleased with those alone, who are so partakers of both natures,
that whole Christ is imputed theirs. Whence it is also evident, that
unregenerate man, living and dying so, has no union with the divine nature,
nor is imputatively righteous; but the wrath of God abides on him, bearing his
own actual iniquity.

XXI.
(a) As creation, attributed to the Father, is distinct from (b) redemption,
peculiar to the Son; and that of redemption, distinct from the work of (c)
inspiration, application, and regeneration, proper to the holy Spirit: so is it
distinctly apprehended, that (d) man having lost the beauty of creation, and so
without power of recovery, (e) has the benefit of redemption, and (f) abuses
what (g) strength, light, and opportunity he has (h) given, to improve the
same: (i) captivateth himself, through actual pollution. (k) But only those,
whom God has predestined to be conformable to the image of Christ, are made
so to be, by the power of the spirit of regeneration; and by its operation, are
united to divine love, (l) the manifestation of which, themselves also abused.

XXII.
Though Christ came in the flesh only (a) in the fullness of time, and that
after his ascension (b) the Spirit was eminently poured forth, for the
manifestation and confirmation of the truth: yet in all precedent (c) ages,
salvation came by that one sacrifice, which is Christ applied by the Spirit of
God, through faith. Whence it is manifest, that (d) where the Spirit
regenerateth not, or (e) where the sin against that holy Spirit is, there never
was, nor is, any other way for salvation of man, since Adam's fall, but that of
the declaration of God's love; which all do abuse.

XXIII.
Though often in the Scripture Christ be said to suffer for all, as has been
proved; yet (a) the regenerating spirit of God is nowhere promised to all; but
compared to the (b) wind blowing where it lists. Whence it follows, (c) that
the spirit of man, having captivated it self, (d) does not by the power of its
own will, accept the offer of grace, nor is united to the divine nature, and
cease to abuse the goodness of God, without that farther work of the Spirit.

XXIV.
(a) Though perfection of grace be not attainable in this life, yet none, who
are really become Christ's by regeneration, (b) shall ever be otherwise, to
their final destruction. Perfect union is so (c) complete a good, that the soul
is clothed with Christ's righteousness to eternity. (d) This is no way to excuse
or cause presumption in any.

XXV.
(a) Desperation is of the tempter: for the death of Christ, and his love
therein manifested (in being made a curse for man) extends to all; and, though
abused, yet may be applied, whenever God shall please to open the hearts and
eyes, which no (b) way excuses procrastination of repentance whilst it is yet
to day, harden not your hearts, (c) Knowing therefore the terrors of the Lord,
we beseech you to be reconciled to God, and to press toward the work of
perfection in Christ.

XXVI.
Neither the (a) old Testament nor the (b) New, does declare eternal misery to
appertain to those, who live not, to think, speak or do any thing, contrary to
the will of God: such it seems are those that dye in infancy to be accounted.

XXVII.
(a) The heathen, living without the written law and Gospel of God, do in some
sort sin against both. Against the law written in their hearts, (b) and against
the Gospel written on the whole creation: manifested by Gods patience and
forbearance, in the protraction of their outward being, and continuance of the
good things they enjoy, being the effects of Christ's death; (c) against which
love they transgress, by not answering in their actions the conviction of their
consciences.

XXVIII.
(a) Christ shall be the resurrection of all, (b) and the Judge of all,
according to what they have done in the flesh, calling those that are his (c)
members to himself, in just Judgment, clearing the ^^ne value of his
righteousness, imputed to them. (d) Of the unregenerate, their condemning
Judge, because he was humbled to the death for them in their nature, thereby
evidencing the Love of God, and they not so affected therewith, as to be united
thereunto, and live therein.

XXIX.
From the foregoing discourse, the two natures of Christ are cleared, by Gods
twofold choice of a people; under two Testaments, distinct in (a) form of
administration, and order of time, in two succeeding ages, in force only after
the death of the respective testators. (b) The first, called the administration
of condemnation, (c) the other, the administration of righteousness, that is,
to convince of both. And is further distinguished by two buildings or houses of
God, (d) the first the material Temple of the Jews; (e) the other, the
spiritual, which is the believers (f) in whom Christ dwells by the his spirit.

XXX
(a) The old testament, and the new, discover two Jerusalems, or cities of God.
(b) First, the temporal, that being the city of the Church of Israel, chosen by
Generation, (viz.) (c) the seed of Abraham after the flesh, in (d) the promised
Land of Canaan, (e) Ruled sometime by judges, other times by Kings, as the
people round about them. And as their nation and Government were outward, such
was their Jerusalem, such their peace, riches and Glory, such also was their
warfare, weapons and armies.

1. (a) As a Church, they were typical, and to pass away, (b) and so their
temple was holy, as well the stones and materials of which it was built: as (c)
the altar, instruments o sacrifice, flesh, bread, vestures, etc. Such was the
(d) Priesthood and tribe of Levi, having no inheritance, as had the other
tribes.

2. (a) As whole Israel was the chosen of God, the holy nation: so were they
(b) circumcised the eighth day, (c) offered for in sacrifice, purified (d) with
outward washings, (e) must keep pure their bodies from touching any dead
carcass; (f) their clothes, (g) also their houses, yea the very face (h) of
their Land, from the filthiness of their own dung. And as members of that
temporal church, (i) must all keep Sabbaths, to rest together, in which their
very (k) beasts had rest: Their (l) Land also rested every seventh year, and so
called Gods rest, or the land of rest. (m) They did worship at one place, at one
time every year. (n) And because they were brethren, they might not in civil
things, deny free use to each other; being commanded to lend, And lend money
without taking a garment to pawn: and having lent, might take no (o) usury.
Having bought a servant or land, must in the year (p) of Jubilee set free and
restore it: The Judges, kings, Priests and Prophets were (q) empowered to
punish transgressors against that law of God, in that land. (r) And the people
were a holy nation, Gods chosen, and a (s) worldly sanctuary. All for these
peculiar ends. (viz.)

1. To show Christ to come of that nation; and that Christ and his doctrine
should be manifested in that nation.

2. To publish the righteous law of God, thereby to convince man of sin in the
breach thereof.

3. To declare that Christ was to do what was required of man; and to suffer in
that nature, what Justice required for sin.

4. (a) That Christ might be clearly typified, as King Priest, and Prophet, in
the hearts of his people; And also, as King of the Kings of the world, for man's
outward peace, and mutual good; inasmuch as he was of the humane nature. Most
especially, in the fifth kingdom signified by the stone cut out without hands,
spoken of in Dan. 2.

XXXI.
(a) The second Jerusalem is wholly spiritual, the (b) regenerate Church of
Christ, and his seed after the spirit, to (c) whom are promised all spiritual
blessings, and (d) outward things, as their heavenly Father sees best. (e) They
are ruled also, by Christ their King, Priest and Prophet. And as their new
birth, and (f) obedience is spiritual, such is their (g) Jerusalem, such their
(h) peace, (i) Riches and glory: preserved (k) by weapons of the same kind,
which no (l) carnal weapons can either preserve or destroy: and (m) guided by
that wisdom, which is from above, which worldly wisdom (n) cannot resist.

1. This Gospel Church, is the antitype of that of the (a) Jews, and cannot be
shaken, but remains the new and living Temple, (b) having Christ for its
foundation: his members being built upon him, do make up a holy habitation of
God. Which shall have the perfection of grace, and peace in Gods time, Christ
being their altar, sacrifice, food and covering, the eternal Priest after (c)
the order of Melchizedeck: the members of this Church being a (d) nation of
Priests, have all an (e) inheritance in the riches of Christ, (f) who is their
Land of rest.

2. (a) The true Israelites are so only by faith, manifested members by
profession and Baptism; may have no communion with (b) dead works, their body
being the Temple of the (c) holy spirit, must be kept pure, and also their (d)
clothes of profession: nor may they (e) defile the form, and ordinances of
Christ, our Land of Canaan, by the corrupt invention of men. (f) The spiritual
church, has a permanent rest in, and with Christ: (which is their peculiar
Sabbath) typified by the Jews Sabbaths. (g) Not confined in their worship, to
any outward place, or country, or time of the year. (g) And being brethren in
the spirit of the (i) anointed, (k) are freely to communicate their spiritual
Talents, (which is their Church-treasure) without private ends of worldly
advantages. And every (l) member (as need requires, and as God enables) is (m)
freely to communicate outward things; and if they lend to each-other, they
ought not to make a gain thereby; (n) For the Jews might not take usury of
their brethren: so that if any nation were a Church, usury must there
necessarily cease.

XXXII.
By all which it is evident, that the first Testament given unto the Jews, was
the (a) manifestation of what Christ was to do, and to suffer, in the humane
nature. Which in all respects is (b) distinct from the latter, declaring (c)
what those are, and ought to be, in whom (by faith) is wrought the divine
nature, and so are righteous in Christ. For amongst other ends of the
Gospel Church, are these that follow.

First, to show that the members of this Church are made so, by regeneration
only.

Secondly, that Christ has fulfilled all righteousness, in the power of the
divine nature, which is imputed to them alone, who are united to it, by
believing the love of God manifested in Christ's sufferings.

3. (a) To put a clear distinction between the Government of Christ in his
Church (in matters of his worship (b) which is not of this world) (c) and his
Dominion over men, in civil and outward interest, managed by outward and
Humane power, for (d) the impartial good of all men, preserving to each his
proper right. (e) And so in obedience thereunto, is given unto Caesar the
things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are Gods.

XXXIII.
(a) As the mystery of the Gospel is the (b) right dividing of the word of
truth; (c) clearly distinguishing the two natures of Christ, (signified by the
water and blood (d) understood the two witnesses) (e) which in the latter days
shall destroy Antichrist: So the (f) mystery of iniquity confounds (and
thereby denies the effectual truth of) both natures, and is therefore
Antichrist.

XXXIV.
(a) The not distinguishing, but confounding of these two natures, (b) appears
to be Antichristian two ways: First, in principles or doctrins of faith.
Secondly, in discipline, (id est) in doctrine and manners.

First, in Principles, (Fundamentals) or Doctrine of Faith: so,

1. It places all for whom Christ died in eternal happiness, denying Christ's
righteousness to be the alone complete and perfect happiness of those who by
faith are united to the divine nature; Contrary to the Scripture.

2. It denies the truth of Gods love, in sending Christ to die for those who
live and die in the abuse of it; Contrary to the Scripture.

3. It denies the Justice of God, in condemning those for the abuse of his
love, who never had (it says) any love or mercy wrought for them in Christ's
death; contrary to the Scripture.

4. By denying Christ's death to extend to all, is laid a Foundation for
desperation: and Christ (a) denied to be the real object of every sinner, to
look at for mercy. Causing some to conclude that they see (b) no ground to
believe Christ died for them; because, he died not for some, and themselves
(they Judge) worse then others. (c) And that if they could believe, the
believing would not make that to be which is not, (d) and therefore is a deceit
(of the Devil, who seeks whom he may devour) as further appears by the
Scripture.

5. It induces the more judicious, who observe (a) the harmonicus consent of
Scripture, that Christ died for all: compared with the said (b) erroneous
principle, that all for whom Christ died should be eternally saved. It seduceth
them, I say, to Bless themselves in their evil, practices, saying they shall
have peace etc. Contrary to the Scripture.

6. The denying that Christ died for all, does infer that he did (a) not bear
the nature of all, and that those whose nature he bare not, shall (b) have no
resurrection by him, though in words it be acknowledged.

7. It denies the sin of some men to be against the love of God, in giving
Christ to die for them, (b) and that Christ shall be their Judge to condemn them,
for not believing it; contrary to the Scriptures.

XXXV.
The precedent discourse clears, that the Doctrine of Antichrist [a] (having
confounded the two natures of the Mediator) [b] brings in the question [Did
Christ die for me?] in the Room of faith, to keep the heart at a distance [c]
from being reconciled to God in Christ: Which is the design of the devil, who
was a murderer from the beginning. Contrariwise, [d] the right understanding
of the real love of God, in Christ's death for every man, begets a principle
of love, engaging the heart to the perfect [e] law of Liberty, or the
constraining power of love. Which is the first mover, and ultimate end of their
drawing near unto God, and of their actions amongst men, [f] when the soul is
so affected therewith, as to be knit and united thereunto, [g] without which
all is vain.

XXXVI.
The confounding the two natures, appears antichristian in discipline, two
ways, which spring from one root; confounding both the signs, and interest of
Gods choice, under the Gospel-Testament, with that of the law [viz.]

1. First, it confounds the [a] sign Baptism, by administering it to
children (the seed by generation) with circumcision, the sign of Gods choice
of Abraham, and his seed after the flesh: [b] which denies the fleshly choice
to be ended, and so Christ the fullness of it, to be come, making void the sign
of Gods choice by regeneration, which is [c] to be administered (only on the
profession of faith) to the [d] seed after the spirit.

2. It mixeth the interest of the Church (so called) chosen by generation, with
that of the world (i. e.) worldly power, (a) by multitudes of corrupt members,
also worldly riches, and worldly pomp and glory: which was the extremity, and
utmost of the interest of the Jewish Church, under the first Testament. (b)
Contrariwise, the new Testament, and kingdom of Christ therein manifested, is
not of this world; but keeps the execution of her laws, conformity of her
members, and all her other privileges, distinct from that of the world.

XXXVII.
The effects, (or production) of the two former are many, and wonderful, a
mystery of iniquity, deceivableness of unrighteousness, called mystery Babylon.
The growth of which, more particularly appears to be a chaos or confusion, by
what summarily follows.

1. First, (a) a carnal Church armed with worldly (b) power, introduces a
necessity of persecution. (c) It lays the foundation with blood, and is not
preserved without blood and (d) oppression to enforce obedience to it is carnal
principles, (e) by which she rules over the Kings of the earth.

2. Worldly riches, produce formality, and conformity (a) to such, as can and
will confer the same; laying also a snare of gain (in matters of Religion, in
stead of godlyness) which the (b) worldly-wise do approve and applaud, though
(c) it be foolishness with God: It makes indeed a resemblance of the worship
of God; but as Jannes and Jambres, withstood Moses; so does it the true
worshippers, and truth it self: but their folly being known, they can proceed
no further.

Thirdly, worldly pomp (fleshly glory) the production of the two former, upon a
Church-account, under the new Testament, is earthly, sensual and devilish; and
the bringing in of the fullness of Babylon; Spiritually she is called the whore
which sits as (and boasts her self to be) a Queen: But it is to the power
of he world, that she is prostituted. She s also called (spiritually) Jezabel;
for she, by pretense of blasphemy, does frequently accomplish her intended
cruelty, upon life and civil rights, as did that Jezabel, (Ahabs wife) by
vaunting and abusing her husbands power (which she had part of) on the same
pretense, obtain Naboths life and Vineyard.

XXXVIII.
(a) As the spirit, the water and the blood, are the three witnesses, of the
Gospel-Testament and Church of Christ: (b) So worldly power, riches and Pomp,
(in the time of this Testament) are the marks of the Antichrist; the great
city is called spiritual Babylon, because it is the confounding of distinct
essential truths, by which the understanding is so darkened, that one thing is
taken for another, as was in the confusion of tongues, at the Building of
Babel. (c) It is also called Sodom, because of the spiritual Whoredoms and
fornications committed by her, with the powers of the world, under pretense of
Religion: (d) And is lastly called Ae^^pt; e) partly because of the s iritual
darkness, and also Bondage on all, who by the light in Goshen are sensible of
it: And on them in doctrine, thus (f) bringing in the question [Did Christ die
for me?] in the Room of faith, and yet say, they must believe; (g) causing them
to labor in the very fire (of desperation) like as Israel in Egyptian
bondage, were compelled to make brick, and gather their own straw; whilst a
gain is made of them, by their Task masters. As also in discipline, it holds
them under servitude, in their forms of Will Worship, for advantage sake; even
(h) as the Egyptians would have permitted Israel to worship God, if they would
have performed it in Egypt, (i) which was unlawful; but not elsewhere, for
fear of (k) losing them, their service and (l) substance.

XXXIX.
When the great City is rightly understood, in it is three parts; and the great
River Euphrates, and infant baptism, the inlet of it, dried up; and the three
unclean spirits (like Frogs) seen to proceed out of the mouth of the Dragon,
the beast and false Prophet; then shall the way of the Kings of the East be
prepared, the fall of the City be at hand, and God shall give her the Cup of
the wine of the fierceness of his wrath: Wherefore the Holy ghost calls all
the upright out of her; that they partake not of her sins, nor receive of her
plagues.

XL.
Let us, this once, look back (before we close, and consider, that there is no
confession with the (a) tongue, that Jesus is the Christ, can excuse of (b)
Antichristianism (as corrupt interests do readily suggest, and blind people as
easily receiv) if the principles and practices speak vanity, and confound (c)
essential truths; for the verbal confession of Christ, is infinitely weighed
down by error in doctrine and practice; and is the most effectual denying of
Christ, (d) and setting up confusion, and a mere (c) resemblance, (f) in the
Room of Christ, and (g) the true worship: (h) Whereby man's Invention (carried
on by humane force) is set up (i) in the Temple of God, showing himself that he
is God.

FINIS.
