HIS MAJESTY'S GRACIOUS MESSAGE To both His Houses of PARLJAMENT, FEBRUARY the
20th.
WHereas His Majesty has (together with a Treaty) proposed a Cessation of Arms
to both His Houses of Parliament now 16. days since, to which as yet He has
received no Answer: To the end that His Majesty may so clearly understand the
Houses, that no such Imputations (as have been formerly) may after be laid upon
Him upon occasion of any thing that may intervene: His Majesty desires, if a
Cessation shall be approved of by them, That the day upon which the Cessation
is thought fit to begin, and such particular Limits and Conditions of that
Cessation as are necessary to be understood and agreed on before the Cessation
it self can actually begin, be proposed by them at the same time with their
Approbation of it, Since as His Majesty supposes by the present great
Preparation of several Forces of the Earl of Essex to march several ways,
that till such time as this be done, they do not conceive themselves obliged
to an actual Cessation; So neither till then does His Majesty conceive
Himself obliged to it.
