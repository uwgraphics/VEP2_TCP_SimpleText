The Amorous Shepherd, and coy Shepherdess, Or, An answer to Amyntas and
Claudia.
Fair Calia kept her lover long in awe,
And what he said, she dashed with a ha, ha,
But after when the Shepherd bolder grew,
He made her change her old note for a new.
Tune of, Calm was the Evening, etc.


Clear was the morning, and azure the Sky
and May flowers adorned the Spring,
When all alone walked Caelia and I
to hear the birds merrily sing,
She sat and I laid me down by her
and close to her side I did draw,
But she bid me forbear,
Yet still I drew near,
Then she laughed with a ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
I used my best art, for to cheer up her heart
and cause her to stoop to my lure,
But still she was mute, when I moved my suite
being guarded with innocence pure,
I played with her locks, like a lover
until she took notice and saw,
And then she said fie,
I presumed too nigh,
(...) out with a h^ etc.
I bid her behold how Phoebus did lie
enclosed in Aurora's arms,
How amorous birds to make it did fly
yet still she resisted my charms,
I showed her how Trees there embraced
by inticement of natures law,
Which made her to smile,
To her self for a while,
At last she laughed out ha, ha, etc:
I told her the earth which our bodies now cover
did willingly the seed embrace,
Else to those flowers she never had been Mother,
which now does bespangle her face,
I showed her how ewes, with their lambs played
thus thought I by Emblems to draw,
Her to my desire,
And kindle loves fire,
But I was dashed with a ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,




HEr eyes they did sparkle like Stars in the Skies
inviting me for to be bold,
(...)ut how to presume I could not devise
she seemed in affection so cold,
(...) thought then to pluck up my spirits
and try if her heart it would thaw,
But she being nice,
I was dashed in a trice,
When she laughed with a ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
I laid my head down, and I fetched a deep sigh
thinking by that means for to move
Her pity to me, but it would not be,
she seemed to know nothing of love
With amorous looks I did woe her,
to yield and submit to loves law,
But when with a frown,
She perceived me cast down,
(...)hen she laughed with a ha, ha, etc.
My heart it did pant in my breast all the while
and the blood in my veins it did swell,
(...)y countenance changed, and my looks are estranged
then she asked me if I were not well,
(...)ut when she perceived my passion
she said I might pleas to with draw,
But it was, but a while,
E're I see she did smile,
And laughed out with ha, ha, etc.
When this would not do, something bolder I grew
and straight to her lips did presume,
Where by a kiss, I enjoyed more bliss
then Jove in his altars perfume,
Such nectar from her lips I then drew
as Jove, nor Apollo never saw,
Yet still she was coy,
When I called her my joy
And laughed out with a ha, ha, etc.
I played with her neck, that Ivory pillar
then with her parnasion breast,
And so by degrees, I enjoyd what did please
but scarce shall I tell you the rest,
But what I did do, she then smiled at
and laid to my actions no law,
But for all her retreat,
She liked to the feat,
That she laughed with a ha, ha, etc.
She said the time spent, and she needs must be gone
which grieved my heart for to hear,
Because I was loath, to tell you the truth
to part with my joy and my dear,
I kissed her a while, then we parted
and passing along there I saw
A Shepherdess walk,
Which had heard all our talk,
And she laughed with a ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
