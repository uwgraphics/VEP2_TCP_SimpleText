An excellent new Medley.
To the tune of the Spanish Pauin:
WHen Philomel begins to sing,
the grass grows green and flowers spring,
Me thinks it is a pleasant thing,
to walk on Primrose hill,
Maids have you any Conny-skins
To sell for Laces or great Pinnes?
The Pope will pardon venial sins:
Saint Peter.
Fresh fish and news grow quickly stale:
Some say good Wine can nere want sale,
But God send poor folks Beer and Ale enough until they die.
Most people now are full of pride;
The Boy said no but yet he lyde:
His Aunt did to the Cuck-stoole ride
for scolding.
Within our Town fair Susan dwells:
Sure Meg is poisoned, for she swells,
My friend, pull off your buzzards bells,
and let the haggard fly.
Take heed you play not at Tray-trip.
Short heels forsooth will quickly slip.
The beadle makes folk with his whip,
dance naked.
Come Tapster tell us what is to pay,
Jane frownd and cryde good Sir away,
She took his kindness, yet said nay,
as Maidens use to do.
The man shall have his Mare again,
When all false knaves prove honest men,
Our Cisly shall be Sainted then,
true Roger.
The Butcher with his masty Dog,
At Rumford you may buy a Hog,
I says Raph Goose has got a clog,
his wench is great with child:
In Pillory put the Bakers head,
For making of such little bread,
Good conscience now a days is dead,
Pierce plowman.
The Cutpurse and his Company
Thieves find receivers presently:
Shun Brokers, Bawdes, and Usury,
for fear of after-claps.
Lord, what a wicked world is this?
The stone lets Kate she cannot piss?
Come hither sweet and take a kiss
in kindness.
In Bath a wanton wife did dwell,
She had two buckets to a well,
Would not a dog for anger swell,
to see a Pudding creep?
The Horse-leach is become a Smith,
When halters fail, then take a With:
Then say an old man has no pith,
Round Robin.
Simon does suck up all the Eggs,
Frank never drinks without Nutmegs,
And pretty Parnell shows her legs,
as slender as my waste.
When fair Jerusalem did stand,
The match is made give me thy hand.
Maulkin must have a Cambricke band
blew starched.
The Cuckoo sung hard by the door,
Gyll brawled like a butter whore,
Cause her bucke-headed Husband swore
the Miller was a knave.
Good Poets leave off making plays
Let players seek for Soldiers pays
I do not like these drunken frayes,
in Smithfield.
Now Roysters spurs do gingle brave,
John Sexton played the arrand knave,
To dig a Coarse out of the Grave,
and steal the sheet away.
The wandering Prince of stately Troy,
Green sleeves were wont to be my joy,
He is a blind and paultry boy
god Cupid.
Come hither friends and give good care,
A leg of mutton stuffed is rare.
Take heed you do not steal my Mare,
it is so hot it burns.
Behold the trial of true love,
He took a scrich-Owle for a Dove:
This man is like ere long to prove
a Monster.
It Is merry when kind Maltmen meet:
No Cowards fight but in the street,
Me thinks this wench smells very sweet,
of Musk, or somewhat else.
There was a man did play at Maw,
The whilst his wife made him a Daw,
Your Case is altered in the Law,
quoth Ployden.
The Weauer will no shuttle shoot,
Go did the Cobbler mend my boot
He is a fool will go a foot
and let his Horse stand still.
Did John a Nokes and John a Styles,
Many an honest man beguiles.
But all the world is full of wiles
and knavery.
Of treason and of Traitors spite
The house is haunted with a sprit,
Now Nan will rise about midnight,
and walk to Richards house.
You Courtly states and Gallants all,
Climb not too high, for fear you fall:
If one please not, another shall,
King Pippin.
Diana and her Darlings dear,
The Dutchmen ply the double Beer:
Boys ring the bells and make good cheer,
when Kempe returns from Rome.
Oh man what means thy heavy look?
Is Will not in his Mistress Book,
Sir Rouland for a refuge took
Horne-Castle.
Rich people have the world at will
Trades fade, but Lawyers flourish still,
Jack would be married unto Gyll:
but care will kill a Cat.
Are you there Sirrah with your Bears?
A Barbers shop with nitty hairs.
Doll, Phillis has lost both her ears,
for coozning.
Who list to lead a Soldiers life?
Tom would eat meat, but wants a knife,
The Tinker swore that Tib his wife,
would play at Vptayles all
Believe my word without an Oath
The Tailor stole some of her cloth:
When George lay sick, Ioane made him broth
with Hemlocke.
The Patron gelt the parsonage,
And Esau sold his heritage,
Now Leonard lacke-wit is fool age
to be his Fathers heir.
There Is many scratch before it itch,
Saul did ask counsel of a Witch,
Friend, ye may have a Bacon flitch
at Dunmow.
King David played on a Welsh Harp,
This thread will never make good warpe
At wise men's words each fool will carpe
and shoot their witless bolts.
Jove like a Ram wore horns and wool,
Knew you my Hostis of the Bull,
Spruce Curio once was made a gull
in Shoreditch.
The blackamores are blabber lipt,
At Yarmouth are the Herrings shipped,
And at Bride-well the beggars whipped,
a man may live and learn,
Grief in my heart does stop my tongue,
The poor man still must put up wrong,
Your way lies there, then walk along
to Witham.
There lies a Less that I love well
The Broker has gay clothes to sell,
Which from the Hangmans but get fell,
are you no further yet?

But for to finish up my Song,
The Ale-wife did the Brewer wrong
One day of sorrow seems as long
as ten days do in mirth,
My Medly now is at an end,
Have you no Bowls or Trayes to (...)
It Is hard to find so true a friend
as Damon.
