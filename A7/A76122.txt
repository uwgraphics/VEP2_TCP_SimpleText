NEW OBSERVATIONS Dedicated to the KINGS most Exellent MAJESTY.
SIR,
BEsides my sorrows (which pressed me very sore, and remains still upon me)
the troubles and grief that fell upon me for the lamentable breaches in the
Church and State, and for your sacred Majesty and hopeful offspring filled
up my sorrows: and in my thoughts I was grieved that those fears and
desolations fell out in your days; I confess, charity suspects not, and the
best minds thinks the least hurt, and the freer a man is from vice in himself,
the more charitable he is of others; and this is that which has proved
(formerly) prejudicial to your Majesty. But had your Majesty been the first,
or the best, that had been misled, misinformed, or ill rewarded; it would be an
hard thing to command patience, but grief is assuaged either by precedents, or
examples. It is true of late days, your Majesty being misinformed against
some of your best Subjects, your Majesty thought to have dealt with them, as
Joseph thought to have dealt with Marie, and so put them away far from you,
but with Marie, they traveling as it were with child, and that that which
they traveled withal might not appear an illegitimate, but remain innocent,
the only wise God, sent as it were an Angel unto you, (I mean your late
Petitioners at York) to let you see, that like Marie, they being contracted
unto you in love, they have not as yet defiled their marriage bed, but remain
like Marie faithful to their head and Sovereign. And your Majesty having
been formerly seduced by false opinions from others against them, I hope you
will now be reduced unto them (and by them) by true persuasions, and that you
may be so, the only wise God, that gave your Majesty your being, and so knew
you better than your self, has dealt wit your Majesty as he did with Adam in
parodice, and so has provided you a meet helper, when with Adam you thought no
need of it, nor desired it, and your Majesty yielding as Adam did (in sparing
a superfluous rib, for to make him a meet helper) will become a great gainer,
for your Majesty shall not only lose those who may be well spared, but you
will gain to your self, and your posterity, a meet helper, that will endeavor
by all lawful means to ease you of many burdens that otherwise might have
lain heavy upon you and this helper is many member of that body whereof your
Majesty is become the head, and considering their pains and labor in love,
you should do them injustice if you hold suffer any to accuse them. I hope
their is none (or will be none) near you (if near you yet dares not) to
ingrosse your favors any more to their own advantage whereby your good Subjects
may be bereaved of those benefits that ought to be common to all; as for your
Commons, they go not about to steal your savours, but to purchase them legally;
and are become unto you as Abraham's servant was to his Master, who would nor
either eat or drink, until he had done his Masters business; and I dare say, if
your Commons (as your late Monopolists and others) had, or did seek themselves,
or their own advantages (more then the good of King and Kingdom) they would
have been wearied (after so much labor.) Before now but me thinks, I see your
Commons following the counsel of God, Genesis 3.23, 24. and God having brought
your Majesty and them together, they now say as Adam said, Let us be but one,
and that it may be so they are willing (not only for a time to be separated
from their lawful and domestic employments but even) to forsake all and run
many hazards, to cleave only to your Majesty in a solemn contract, wherefore
to make up the contract, me thinks, I see you to them as Rebecca was to the
servant of Abraham, who asking water, made haste and drew water for his Camels
also: It may be to make up this march, you must with Isaac part with something
that was formerly near unto you, and who will not be contented to spare a part
to save the rest: being done, it will prove to your Majesty as comfortable and
welcome as Rebecca was into Isaacs tent, and the Text says, And Isaac brought
her into his Mother Sarahs tent, and took Rebecca and she became his wife, and
he loved her, and Isaac was comforted after his Mothers death. This happy match
being made, it would not only refresh your people, but make glad your heart in
time of fears and dangers. It is true, there are many that have brought your
Majesty into troubles and feared dangers, (and the more too blame they, for
leaving your Majesty, having brought you into them.) It is true there are many
with Orpha seeing your troubles have left you; but your Commons like Ruth are
resolved to stick close unto you, and will endeavor to help you out of them,
if with David you will be advised by them (who blessed God for the seasonable
counsel of a woman when he was upon a design) Judge then of their loves and
affections to your Majesty, by yours to them, and then tell me whether they do
not truly love you; doubtless, yes, accounting their lives not dear unto them,
so that they may but finish their work with joy, and so accomplish their good
ends concerning you, and I doubt not, but that I speak it in the name of many,
and in truth by your late yielding and free expression, you have stolen me
from my self, yea and am now wounded within me and like Moses, who was wounded
in himself and could hardly endure to look upon God when he descended in mercy.
It is true there is nothing engages a soul to God, or a subject to a King, as
the appearance of love; this made Moses to say, H^w dreadful is thy place O
God! and this is that which has stolen me from my self, so that now I am no
more my own but yours; yea, by this return of yours to your people you will
win them to obedience with kindness; and by doing so, you will make good
that which you were sent for, whose care ought to be employed for the good of
your Subjects, knowing that their love is your greatest safety and their
prosperity your greatest honor and felicity: and this is that which will make
your bed easy when you shall possess the just title to the Crown with the
love of your people, and the continuance of it with the willing applause of the
Subject, is the highest way to a blessing; and the hopes of this is that which
has brought me to renew and confirm the covenant that your Majesty made with
me from your first entrance to the Crown, and because you could not swear by
no greater, swore by the Eternal God that you would defend me, and at the
first of one contract we made but one, your power and all that you had was mine
to defend me, and to do me good but there have been some of late, that have set
your Majesty against me (I speak it in the name of many) and have persuaded
you to beat me, and to force to obedience, though of my self willing to obey,
being of a nature sooner won than compelled, and this is that which has sore
troubled me, yet this is not all, but when an oath with an etc. was put upon
me, it wounded me; for, by the oath that I had taken already, I was bound fast
enough but the truth is when these things befell me, I was afraid that some
evil minded men like Potiphers wife seeing mine innocence, and more faithful
to you my husband than themselves, had complained against me without cause: and
this I could hardly bear; for, by this means our great Adversaries, Devil and
Pope, have labored to sow contentions and jealousies between us, and this is
that which will be a means to undo us both, when your Majesty (which is become
my head and husband) speaks kindly unto me, and is ruled by those that love us
both, my heart is inflamed with a love unto you, but when your Ministers abuse
your Majesty's kindness, and become tyrants to their fellow servants; yea,
when they shall go about to justify themselves, and men like themselves and
lay all their villainy upon your Majesty: this I can hardly bear; for, by this
means, I am deprived of my marriage bed, and of my wonted society and am
troubled in my self, when I see your Majesty (which is become my head and
husband) strange unto me, but I hope every former breach, will unite love the
stronger, knowing that a little shaking of the tree will prefer the growth of
it: wherefore being now reconciled to your Commons, feast, live, love and die
together, and be more firm in your near union, than ever divided in your
hearty unkindnesse so shall you meet in the end, and never part: But be like
Rachell and Leah, which two built up the house of Israel. You are now in the
way and it is said, Genesis 24.27. That whilst the servant of Abraham was in the
way, God blessed him; the same God bless you; and for your comfort and
encouragement know, by so much shall you grow to perfection by how much you draw
near to unity, I confess had the Balaacks and Balaams of our times bin so evil
as they would have bin and intended to have bin, the world had bin overrun with
evil, but such is the wisdom of God, that oft-times he hides from evil men
those times and seasons that might prove prejudicial to his people: so when
Saul sought for David. It is true, the good God might have destroyed the
Balaams and wicked Saul's of our times, but many times he will not, for God has
something more for them to do; and it is not so much glory to God to take away
wicked men, as to use their evil to his own holy purposes, and gains many
times more glory by working good by evil instruments, than by destroying of
them presently in their wicked purposes: and this use I make of it, that it
suffices a good man, that he resists the evil actions of the wicked whilst
they love their persons. I confess, our Balaams, and our Saul's, had gone very
far, but in some things God permits in indignation, not for that he gives
leave to the act, but that he gives a man over to the sin in the act; and yet
this sufferance implies not favor but judgment, and God is contented the
devil should win himself credit (sometimes) where he means to judge. I
confess, our Saul's and our Balaams, like Sisera trusted in their strength, but
like Sisera many of them run away, yet in spite of them all the Lord has made
a seasonable and hopeful provision for his people; and to that purpose the
wise God (in spite of our Saul's) have brought your Majesty and Commons
together. It is too true by the means of our Saul's, your Majesty became to
your Commons as the Angel was to Gideon, and so made them afraid, but like the
Angel that made Gideon afraid, your Majesty has returned to their comfort;
and as God, as he uses where he loves, he imployes, and like Christ himself,
you are now willing to enjoy them by a willing contract, and not by a
ravishment; and by this means you appear now to your people like Moses, who had
more glory by his vale than by his face; and I do not doubt but when all things
shall be made manifest, but that one faithful David will be in more account
with your Majesty, than either the Saul's or Balaams whatsoever. It is true, by
the means of our Saul's, the Crown is become full of cares, and your Majesty
having been almost even wearied by them, would feign now take some rest; and
that your Majesty may rest, I will take unto me that large promise, Isa.
45.11. (and with Jacob will give God no rest until he have blessed you.)

Thus says the Lord the holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things
to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye
me, nay; that is not all that I will do for you but I will commend you to the
Honorable House of Commons, and tell them; Right Wise, Right Worthy, you see
with Abraham his Majesty is willing to resign, to win the affectons of his
people by his justice in his government; the thing that I shall desire of you
(for his Majesty) is but this, that your Sovereign which is become your head,
being full of care and troubles that you would make his bed easy for him that
(notwithstanding your care in removing some that are about him) if there should
still remain any about him that should go about to trouble him, again the
thoughts of you when he wakes may make him lie down again, and take another
nap. And the the doing of this for him, will bring him from Marah to Elim and
you will become as sweet and pleasant to the Church, and the three Kingdoms, as
the tree that God showed to Moses (which when he cast into the waters the
waters were made sweet, which formerly were bitter) and then shall the Church
of God sing the song of Moses, Exodus 15. I know that thankfulness and love,
can do more with good men, than merit or necessity; and me thinks, I see you
like our Savior, who thirsted after the salvation of mankind: and I believe
it was not so much out of dryness as out of love; Go you and do so likewise,
knowing, that modest beginnings and hopeful proceedings makes happy endings.
And for your comfort know that God whose battles you fight, will provide a due
reward of your patience: and for my own part, I shall do with you as Jeptha did
with his sword, and whilst he used it trusted to God: and with Job, will be
willing to wait the appointed time, for the accomplishing of those things that
concerns both the good of Church and Commonwealth; and so I commend the
saving of Solomon unto you Eccle. 9.10. Whatsoever thy hand finds to do, do
it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom
in the grave, whither thou go.

FINIS.
