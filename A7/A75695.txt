THE TRUE COPY OF A LETTER FROM Mr Ashburnham, TO A FRIEND, Concerning his
Deportment toward the KING in his late Attendance upon His Majesty's Person at
Hampton Court, and the Isle of VVight.

Printed in the Year 1648.

The Copy of a Letter from Mr. Ashburnham, to a Friend, etc.
SIR,
I Have withheld this return too long; of which I am by so much the more
ashamed, by how much I found yours so full of kindness: I will pretend to no
excuse; but if your good nature will suggest, that the deep sense of my
afflictions does so oppress my spirits, as it renders me altogether indisposed
to the least intercourse, you will be charitable, and take me right.

Would you believe, that to my sorrows for the sufferings of our deer Master
the King, and the danger of the Public, the generality of men in this Kingdom
(and probably in many other parts too) should charge me with the scandal of
having betrayed His Majesty into the Isle of Wight, and that by compact with
the Parliament and Army, before his departure from Hampton Court? And to obtain
belief the better, have digested that their calumny into this form; That I did
conspire with them to affright His Majesty away from thence, that they might
have the better opportunity (being at a greater distance from London) to
destroy him; which to effect, the neernesse of that place made it very
difficult, if not impossible: and that my reward for this service has been a
great sum of money? Thus from several hands.

Which reproach, though I never deserved, and take my self to be very much
above any thing of that kind; yet since there is no person ambitious to
acquire or preserve an honest reputation, but is awake, and always carries
about him a tenderness to the least prejudice or diminution thereof; I cannot
but be touched with some sense of that unhappy report, and give you (in whose
good esteem I am much concerned) the true state of my part in that action, so
far as may enable you to satisfy (if you meet with him) the most malicious
person against me.

That I was commanded by their Majesty's and the Prince his Highness to return
into England, with Instructions to endeavor by the best means imaginable, such
a compliance between His Majesty and the Army, as might have influence, and
beget a right understanding between His Majesty and the Parliament, is a truth
well known. That my infirmities are so great, and so public, as that it had
been better for their-service to have given that employment to some other of
more eminent endowments, I do acknowledge with great humility: But that I did
fulfill that Trust with all industry and fidelity to their Majesty's, I appeal
to God and them, and do not doubt but I have my portion of favor, and stand
still numbered in the Catalogue of those Subjects whom they are yet pleased to
style faithful.

What passed between me and any Member either of the Parliament or Army, as it
will not at all advantage His Majesty's affairs to relate; so will it not any
way conduce to my vindication. This word I shall only let sall, That a wiser
man then I, or whoever is my greatest censurer, would and ought to have given
credit to them, when power and interest accompanied with large expressions of
good will, were the arguments and motives to gain belief of their real
intentions. Nay truly, though His Majesty had known they intended nothing
less then the performance of those duties to their Sovereign and Country, I
cannot find (I know not what a quicker-sighted man might have done) how in
prudence his Majesty could have pursued any other interest, or made any other
application then what he did, considering the power under which he was: Which
shall serve by way of glance at my part of negotiation in general, because
even therein likewise I am not without some prejudice in many men's conceptions.

Some few weeks before his Majesty's remove from Hampton Court, there was
scarce a day in which several alarms were not brought to his Majesty, by, and
from very considerable persons (both well affected to him, and likely to know
much of what was then in agitation) of the resolution which a violent party in
the Army had to take away his life: and that such a design there was, there
were strong inducements to persuade; and I hope charity will be afforded to
those many who were and still are of that belief, since I confess my self to
be of that number. Which practice seemed to his Majesty the more probable, for
that many other particulars which were said in those informations to precede
that action, fell out accordingly; whereupon his Majesty thought it not
wisdom longer to despise the possible means left him for the prevention of
that danger, and therefore resolved to retire himself from thence, but with
this positive intention, not to desert this Kingdom, either by crossing the
Seas, or going into Scotland. The reasons his Majesty gave, you will pardon me
if I deliver not, and suspend your Censure, in case your judgment invite you
to oppose that result, till you hear the weight of them, and I will engage the
little credit the world has left me, you shall be satisfied.

And what man is he, who has the least grain of understanding, bears about
him any affections either to his sacred Person, or to the Common good, has any
regard to his own duty or reputation, would have taken upon him to dissuade his
Majesty from what he had then resolved on, and thereby exposed himself both to
the danger and guilt of that mischief, which so many had forewarned him of, and
was so likely to happen? Sure I am, if I had been that man, I should have
thought my self justly to have merited the Character of unfaithfulness, which
is now so injuriously cast upon me.

It rested then that his Majesty was to make choice of a place, where he might
avoid the present danger, where he might give least offense to the interest of
the Parliament and Army, where he might have frequent intercourse with both,
for settling a Peace (of which he then despaired not;) and lastly, where he
might most securely (and the measure of safety was, where there were no
Soldiers) expect the abatement of the ruinous power of the Levellers and their
faction, to be the fruits of the General Rendezvous, which was immediately to
follow.

Upon these grounds, his Majesty thought the Isle of Wight most proper for his
residence, especially if he could obtain honorable Conditions from the
Governor of that place; to whom (when his Majesty was come within twenty
miles) he commanded Sir John Berkeley and my self to repair, and make trial of
what Reception we could procure for him; who, after some consideration of what
we proposed, proffered this Engagement, [That since it appeared his Majesty
came from Hampton Court to save his life, if he pleased to put himself inte his
hands, whatever he could expect from a person of honor or honesty, his
Majesty should have it made good by him:] which truly to us seemed
sufficient; and I do for my own part acknowledge, my confidence was, that, by
that Engagement, he would not have laid any restraint upon his Majesty, nor
have given access to any Soldiers into that Island: But how honorably and
how faithfully he has performed his promised duty to the King, you are as good
a witness as my self; and therefore, as I take little pleasure in the memory
of it, so there will be little satisfaction to you in the repeating it: it
shall suffice that I have now been taught, that Honor and Honesty have clear
contrary definitions in several men's understandings.

For the election his Majesty made of the Isle of Wight, upon the grounds
before mentioned, as therewith I did then concur, so (with respect to their
judgments who are otherwise persuaded) I do still believe it was (as his
affairs then stood) the best of any place which he could make choice of: And I
will not be afraid to avow my opinion, because success has made it seem less
reasonable; which being taken out of the Scale, and all circumstances worthy
debate before his departure from Hampton Court, considered; perhaps wiser men
then chose, who in that presume to condemn his Majesty's judgment, may yet
approve of that choice. However, his Majesty was resolved to go from
Hampton Court; and, I know not what other men's customs are, I cannot but be
well satisfied with my own, which has been ever ready to submit, when his
Majesty has been willing to command; and I should account it a great
misfortune to me, that his commands should be such, to which I should think fit
rather with humility to oppose my reasons, then with cheerfulness to obey his
pleasure; but that straight has never yet happened, nor (I am confident) ever
will: so careful is his Majesty to impose nothing upon any man, but what he
believes just and lawful.

That any Member of the Parliament or Army had any knowledge by me of his
Majesty's removal from Hampton Court, or that any Compact between me and any of
them was ever made, to the disservice of his Majesty in any particular
whatsoever, I provoke them and all the world to produce the least color of
proof, and desire that no man would spare me more then I should do such whom I
found guilty of so base a crime; and shall not stick to invite them to it, who
have been so liberal in blasting my reputation, when I may live with that
freedom they do, which either their greater wisdom, or their less loyalty then
mine, has purchased. In the mean time, it is some comfort to me to find these
censurers to be men but of such dispositions, as will hazard no more then only
their good wishes for his Majesty; and for such I take them, and for such
leave them.

If I should tell these severe judges of other men's actions, that his Majesty's
present personal condition is the same in the Isle of Wight, with what it was
when he left Hampton Court, they would perhaps wonder at me, but upon
examination find it truth: for before his Majesty's coming from thence (at
least six days) he was forbidden riding abroad, and confined within the limits
of that place.

And if any man can assure me, that if his Majesty had continued at
Hampton Court, the Parliament would not have presented these four Bills to him,
or that they being presented, his Majesty's refusing to make them Laws, should
not have drawn on his late restraint, or the later Votes of Parliament
concerning farther application to his Majesty, I shall then (for indeed I take
that to be the cause of his relapse) with great lowliness of spirit
acknowledge my self to have been an unhappie (though not an unfaithful)
instrument in his Majesty's remove from Hampton Court: But till then, my
sufferings in these scandals may be continued, but my opinion not changed, nor
the quietness of my mind disturbed, for having in that action discharged my
duty to his Majesty.

As for the money I should have received for betraying his Majesty, if none of
my Calumniators have more to subsist on, then I have had either from Parliament
or Army, they would be in worse condition, then (notwithstanding all their
malice to me) I wish them. In earnest, it would better have become those who
first designed me this infamy, to have made choice of some, who had a mark upon
them for doing some action, which may at least be of kin to the accusation,
though but between fellow subjects: but you will pardon my vanity, if I say I
abhor such unworthiness, and defy mankind to bring the least blemish of that
nature in judgment against me.

I have done, when I have told you, that I have heard Divines say, that God
does most punish us in those things we most prize, and think our selves most
concerned: I shall therefore hope to make a religious use of these aspersions
cast upon my integrity: for I fear I did glory too much in my honor of
faithfulness and loyalty to his Majesty, and did not thankfully consider (as
I ought to have done) that it was the blessing of God which enabled me to go
through with the performance of my duty in his service.

If men would but as well think upon the solicitude and care of their minds,
who are honored with near relations to the service of great Princes, as they
look upon the advantages which thereby Fortune may cast upon them, they would
find more cause to pity them for their labor and hazards (which is ordinarily
beyond their capacities to fathom, who are at very remote distance) then to
envy them for their honor or profit. But since of all evils seated in the
heart of man, Malice has the greatest dominion, it were vain for Virtue it
self to hope for freedom from those effects which naturally arise from it; and
much more for me, who though in this particular have as much innocence to
protect me, as can be consistent with mortality, yet in other things which may
be imputed to weakness, and unskilfulness in matters of great concernment, I do
with all ingenuity confess, no man carries a greater weight of guilt then he
whose care it is, to preserve unspotted the reputation of an honest man,
thereby to retain still the favor and affection, wherewith you have constantly
honored,

Sir, Your most faithful, and most humble servant, John Ashburnham.

FINIS.
