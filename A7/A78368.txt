CATHOLIC HYMN ON THE BIRTH OF THE PRINCE OF WALES
WHen enraged Southask
In his Female's Womb cast,
A Clap which cost twenty Guinny's
A project he had
Of Revenge on the Dad,
And to blow up the Race of the Ninnys.
(2)
The Poison soon wrought
Which his Highness had caught,
And Nancy was tainted soon after;
So the Infection prevailed
That the Pox was entailed
Sans distinction on Son and on Daughter.
(3)
The Vaults in the Abbey
Received many a Baby,
Brought forth in a Stinking condition
And if ye have not forgot it
The Duchess too Rotted,
Soon after in spite of Physician.
(4)
Though a Convert she died
If she be not belied,
'Twas resolved in cabal soon after
To raise up a breed
Of true Catholic seed,
To Supplant the two Heretic Daughters.
(5)
Then from Lambardy came
A Duchess of Fame,
Instructed in arts Italian
Who rather than Church
Should be left in the lurch,
Might be'indulg'd the use of a Stallion.
(6)
At first She' had ill success
With his Royal Highness,
For no sooner was She a Mother
But Her Children all Di'd,
Like those of Nan Hyde,
'Twas said of something or other.
(7)
The Poison entailed
So far had prevailed,
'Twas high time to seek out for a wonder
Our case must be sad
If a Boy cannot be had,
To keep the Heretics under.
(8)
Then straight we repair
To the Infallible Chair,
Who advise we must not forget o
To present at the Shrine
Of the Lady Divine,
That Miracles works at Loretto.
(9)
The Present was sent
And Mother Duchess went,
On a Voyage from this World to the other
Where She made a Prayer
For a Catholic Heir,
That the Queen might once more be a Mother.
(10)
The Request was soon granted
And Modenae Sainted,
And straight the glad tidings came down here
Which at Court was full hot
Before the Child was begot,
That we must have an Heir to the Crown here.
(11)
The Fathers kept Reckoning
Some of them were speaking,
OF the other side of the Water
That Trinity Sunday
would bring forth a young Boy,
Should convert the Nation hereafter.
(12)
Much of this may be done
By way of Dragoon,
As France has taught us the fashion
Religion to Plant
By true Church Militant,
Far better than Convocation.
(13)
The Church has still took care
To provide for an Heir,
When Crowns are in dispute Sir
This made the French Queen
To take Mararine
For Cardinal Coadjutar.
(14)
From hence Sprang the Man
^
And who knows but it may be
Given in Commission
TO answer Duches's's Petition,
To his Eminence Nuncio Data.
(15)
Some think 'twas an Omen
Of no good to some Men,
That before the Critical hour
When the Queen was to lie Down
Are the Prince came to Town,
The Bishops were clapped in the Towner.
(16)
And now he is come out
A Blessing no doubt,
And an Hero as sure as may be
As big and as Bold
As a Boy a Month Old,
More like than a new Born Baby.
(17)
Let no Woman despair
Of having an Heir,
Although She be never so Barren
So long as there are Fathers
There'l not fail to be Mothers,
Without any fear of Miscarrying.
(18)
May all Catholics Pray
All Night and all Day,
(Or else our Projects come short all)
That the Goddess which sent him
Would Graciously grant them,
That the Boy may be Immortal.
(19)
Then we will not forget ho
To sing Praise to Lorreto,
And set up great Winnifreds Fame
And let all Men be willing
That new Paul's which is Building,
Henceforth be called Nostre Dame.
White Hall, St. Barnabas 's Festival: June the 11th. 1688.
