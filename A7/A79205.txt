HIS MAJESTY'S DECLARATION To all His SUBJECTS OF The KINGDOM of ENGLAND.
CHARLES R.
CHARLES The Second of that Name, by the Grace of God, King of England,
Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defendor of the Faith etc. To all Persons within
Our Kingdom of England, and Dominion of Wales, to whom these presents shall
come, Greeting.
We cannot without unspeakeable grief and sorrow call to mind, nor without
horror express, That Our dear and Royal Father King CHARLES of ever blessed
memory, has been most barbarously and most cruelly Murdered, by the hands of
bloody Traitors and Rebels within Our Kingdom of England, with proceedings
and circumstances so prodigious, that the particulars induce rather amazement
than expression. And although We have hitherto seemed silent in a matter so
highly concerning Us, as not publicly to express to the People of England Our
grief of heart and high detestation of that heinous fact: Yet being now safely
arrived in a small part of Our own Dominions, at the Island of Jersey, We have
thought fit rather from hence, where Our Kingly Authority takes place, than
from any foreign Country, where We have been hitherto necessitated to
reside, publicly to Declare, That out of a bitter sense and indignation of
those horrid proceedings against Our dear Father, We are according to the
Laws of Nature and Justice, firmly resolved, by the assistance of Almighty God
though We perish alone in the enterprise, to be a severe Avenger of His
Innocent blood, which was so barbarously spilt, and which calls so loud to
Heaven for Vengeance. And We shall therein by all ways and means possible,
endeavor to pursue and bring to their due punishment those bloody Traitors
who were either Actors or Contrivers of that unparalleled and inhumane Murder.
And since it has pleased God so to dispose, as by such an untimely Martyrdom,
to deprive Us of so good a Father, and England of so gracious a King; We do
further Declare, That by His Death the Crown of England, with all Privileges,
Rights, and Preheminences, belonging thereunto, is by a clear and undoubted
Right of Succession justly and lineally descended upon Us, as next and
immediate Heir and Successor thereunto, without any Condition or Limitation,
without any Intermission or Claim, without any Ceremony or Solemnity
whatsoever; And that by virtue thereof We are now in Right lawfully seized of
the said Crown; and ought by the Laws of God and of that Nation to enjoy a
Royal power there, as well in Church as Commonwealth, to Govern the People
of that Kingdom, according to the ancient and known Laws, to maintain them
in Peace and Justice, and to protect and defend them from the oppression of any
usurped Power whatsoever. And the People of that Nation by the like Laws owe
unto Us, and ought reciprocally to pay duty and obedience unto Us, as unto
their Liege Lord and Sovereign. This Royal Right of Ours is grounded upon so
clear a Title, is settled by such fundamental Laws, confirmed by so many
Oaths of Allegiance in all Ages, is supported by such a long continued
Succession in Our Royal Progenitors, and by such a Constant submission of all
the People, that the same can admit of no Dispute, no act of Our Predecessors
can debar Us of it, no Power on Earth can justly take it from Us; and by the
undoubted Laws of that Nation, to oppose Us either in the Claim or Exercise
thereof, is a Treason of the highest degree. And although the bloody Contrivers
of our Fathers Murder (out of a pernicious hatred to all Monarchies) have by
force, as much as in them lies, Dis-inherited Us of Our Princely Right
thereunto, Banished and proscribed Us, seized all Our Revenues, prohibited all
intercourse and supplies to be sent to Us, and have by violence imposed upon
the People of England a new Yoke of popular Tyranny, to the utter s;ubversion,
not only of Our Just Rights, but of their Laws and Liberties. Yet We do
profess that We cannot persuade Our self, that the Body of the English Nation
has so far degenerated from their ancient Loyalty and Virtue, as to consent
to these horrid proceedings against Us, or to approve the casting off that
Kingly Government, under which they and their Forefathers have happily
flourished so many Ages past, to the envy of all their Neighbor Nations. How
can that once-happy Nation of England despair of blessed days under a Royal
Scepter, and vainly hope for them under the Iron Rod of an insolent Multitude?
No, We cannot look upon these sad and dismal Changes, as the Desires or
Intentions of the better part of Our Subjects of that Kingdom, but rather as
the Designs and Contrivances of those Wicked Murderers of Our Father, whose
Ambitions are endless, whose Avarice is unsatiable, and whose Guilt has made
them desperate. And therefore out of a Confidence We have of the Loyalty and
good Affections of many of Our Subjects of that Nation; And as well for their
encouragement who still persist in their Natural Allegiance and Obedience to
Us, as for the security of such as shall yet return to their Duties and
Loyalties; We have thought fit hereby further to Declare, That We are
graciously pleased to receive all Persons of Our Kingdom of England and
Dominion of Wales (other then such who Voted or Acted in that bloody Murder of
Our dear Father) into Our Royal Grace, Mercy and Protection, owning and
esteeming them all as our good and loving Subjects, whom upon Access to Our
Kingly Authority, We shall hold Our self bound according to the Law of God, the
known Laws of that Nation, and the Duty of Our Kingly Office, to protect,
maintain, and preserve in wealth, peace and happiness. And for a clear
evidence of Our good intentions toward them, We shall be contented freely to
Pardon or otherwise by Act to Declare, or hold indemnifyed, all Persons within
Our said Kingdom of England and Dominion of Wales (except before excepted) for
any matter whatsoever relating to the late unhappy Wars and Distractions. And
We shall (according to the example of Our dear Father) be ready upon the
establishment of Our Royal Throne, to make such further Concessions, for the
satisfaction and security of Our good Subjects in general, and of all
interests in particular, as shall be adjudged most to conduce to the Peace and
Happiness of that Kingdom. And We do further Declare, that We shall give Our
utmost assistance to restore Parliaments to their ancient Dignity and Honor,
and shall preserve their just Privileges, and join to repair all those
Injuries and Affronts, which have been done to the Members of that High Court.
And because all ways of gaining a mutual confidence, betwixt Us and Our good
Subjects, are at present obstructed, by the usurped Force and Power now
prevalent in that Kingdom, We are therefore resolved to make use of such
expedients as shall be necessary for the suppression of that Tyrannical and
unjust Power now exercised over them; And for bringing to their due punishment,
those bloody Murderers of Our dear Father; For shaking off the heavy Burdens
and Taxes they now groan under; And for restoring Our just Rights, and the
ancient Liberties and Freedom of the English Nation; Not doubting but We shall
find all Our good Subjects ready to concur, and to assist Us in Our just and
pious Undertakings for those ends. And in the mean time, We require and
command all Our said Subjects, according to their duty to God their Allegiance
to Us, their several Oaths and Protestations, and the love and affection they
bear to the Peace of their Native Country, that they do not betray their
Lawful King, nor the glorious Liberties and Laws of England, into a
perpetual slavery, by Acknowledgement or voluntary submission to any new
forms or models of Government, under the name or mask of a Free State, nor
under any other title or pretense whatsoever.

Given at Our Court at Castle-Elizabeth in our Isle of Jersey the Twenty third
Day of October, 1649. In the First Year of Our Reign. KING.
