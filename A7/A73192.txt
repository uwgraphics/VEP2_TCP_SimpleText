A pleasant Country Maying Song.
To the tune of the Popes Machina.
IN this merry Maying time,
Now comes in the Summer prime.
Country Damsels fresh and gay,
Walk abroad to gather May:
In an evening make a match,
In in a morning bows to fatch.
Well is she that first of all,
Can her lover soonest call,
Meeting him without the town,
Where he gives his Love a gown.
Tib was in a gown of gray,
Tom he had her at a bay.
Hand in hand they take their way,
Catching many a rundelay,
Greeting her with a smile,
Kissing her at every style.
Then he leads her to the Spring,
Where the Primrose reigns king.
Upon a bed of Violets blew,
Down he throws his Lover true.
She puts finger in the eye,
And checkes him for his quality.
She bids him to her mothers house,
To Cakes and Cream and Country souce.
He must tell her all his mind,
But she will sigh and stay behind.
Such a country play as this,
The maids of our town cannot mis.
They will in a morning gay,
Deck themselves and gather May.
Then they will go crop the flowers,
Among the leaves and Country bowers.
When our maidens meet together,
There is praying for fair weather.
Glad are they to see the Sun,
That they may play when work is don.
Some at Dancings make a show,
If they can get leave to go.
Young men will for maidens sakes,
Give them Sugar, Cream and Cakes
With a cup of dainty Wine,
And it must be neat and fine.
Some of them for their good cheer,
Plays three quarters of a years.
Thou at the first I liked well,
Cakes and Cream do make me swell.
This pretty maiden waxes big*
See what it is to play the Rig.
Up she deckes her white and cleene,
To trace the meadows fresh and green*
Or to the good town ^he w^ll w^n^
Where she points to meet her friend.
Her gown was tuckt above the knee,
Her mi^kwhite smock that you may see.
Thus her amorus Love and she,
Sports from eight o clock till three:
All the while the Cuckoo sings,
Toward the evening home she flings,
And brings with her an Oaken bow,
With a Country Cake or two.
Straight she tells a solemn tale,
How she heard the Nightingale,
And how each meadow greenly springs:
But yet not how the Cuckoo sings.
In the merry Maying time,
Love is in her chiefest prime.
What for Gentlemen and Clownes,
Our country maids can want no gowns.
Sillibubs and dainty cheer,
Young men lack not all the year.
All the maidens in the street.
With the bonny Yonkers meet.
All the while the grass is green,
And the Dasies grow between,
Dicke and Tom do walk the fields,
Still to trip up maidens heels.
Thus the Robin and the Thrush,
Music make in every bush.
While they charm their pretty notes,
Young men hurl up maidens cates.
But 'cause I will do them no wrong,
Here I end my Maying song,
And wish my friends take heed in time.
How they spend their Summers prime.
FINIS.
