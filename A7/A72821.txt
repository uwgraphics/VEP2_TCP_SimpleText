Whereas Roger Ward and Thomas Simcocke, for the benefit of Marine Boisloret (a
Frenchman) have of late obtained from the Kings most excellent Majesty under
the great Seal of England, a Privilege to imprint, utter, and sell, all and
all manner of Briefes of Letters Pattents for losses by fire or water, all
Jndentures for Apprentices, all indentures for Waterworkes, all bonds and
Recognizances, all licenses to gather by, licenses to marry, licenses for
Victualers, all acquittances, all articles for visitacions of Bishops and
Officials, all bills for teaching scholars, bills for Physicians, and all
play-billes, all pasports, Charts, Epitaphs, portractures and pictures
whatsoever, and all other things printed, and hereafter to be printed vp^n
oneside only of a sheet or sheets of paper, or a skin or skins of
parchment, as mort at large by the said grant may appear.

Now may it please this Honorable Assembly to be informed, That the Petitioners
respectively have ever had the free use of printing these things, from the
first times the same were imprinted, until the seventeenth year of his
Majesty's happy Reign. And if the benefit thereof be taken from the
petitioners, it will not only be a great hinderance unto them who have been
brought up in this Art, and maintained themselves and their several families
thereby, But also to all other his Majesty's loving subjects that have occasion
to use any of the things mentioned in the said Letters Patents.

The humble suit of the Petitioners is, that this Honorable Assembly will take
such order, that the Petitioners may have free liberty to imprint the premises,
as formerly they have done, before the said Letters Patents were granted,

And they shall ever pray, etc.
