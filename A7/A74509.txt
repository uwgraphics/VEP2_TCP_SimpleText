AN ORDINANCE Prohibiting Cock-Matches.
WHereas the Public meetings and Assemblies of People together in diverse
parts of this Nation, under pretense of Matches for Cock-fighting, are by
experience found to tend many times to the disturbance of the public Peace,
and are commonly accompanied with Gaming, Drinking, Swearing, Quarrelling, and
other dissolute practices, to the dishonor of God, and do often produce the
ruin of Persons and their Families. For prevention thereof, Be it Ordained by
his Highness the Lord Protector, by and with the advice and consent of his
Council, That from henceforth there shall be no public or set meetings or
Assemblies of any persons within England or Wales, upon Matches made for
Cock-fighting; And that every such meeting, and assembly of people for the end
and purposes aforesaid, is hereby declared to be an unlawful Assembly, and
shall be so adjudged, deemed, and taken to be, and punished; And all Sheriffs,
Justices of the Peace, Majors, Bailiffs, Constables, and Head-boroughs, within
their several Counties, Cities, Limits, and Jurisdictions, are hereby required
to suppress, hinder, and disperse all such meetings and assemblies.

Friday, March 31. 1654.
ORdered by his Highness the Lord Protector, and his Council, That this
Ordinance be forthwith printed and published.

Henry Scobell Clerk of the Council.
