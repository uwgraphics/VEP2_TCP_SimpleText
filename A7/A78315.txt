COurteous Reader, take notice that more were slain at other places, but in
regard I could not have certain intelligence of them, I thought fit rather to
break off then to proceed superfluously, here being all that were slain in the
chief Battles and Skirmishes at the most remarkable Towns and Castles that were
besieged and taken by storm from the Enemy.
