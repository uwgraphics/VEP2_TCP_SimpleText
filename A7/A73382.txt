TO THE RIGHTVVORTHY, Sr. DAVID FOWLS Knight and Baronet, one of his
majesty's Council established in the North.
THere were two pillars before Salomons Temple, 1 King. 7.21. 2 Chronicles. 3.17.
(right worthy Sir) Jachin, that is, God will establish; and Bohaz, that is,
strength. These two pillars were set up, to uphold the porch of the Temple. So
there are two pillars, which uphold the Church, and this world, Religion and
Justice: true Religion upholds the Church, and Justice the Commonwealth.

Of these two, religion stands upon the right hand to uphold, (as Jachin did,)
and Justice upon the left hand (as Bohaz did.) Religion has the first place,
and therefore the Jews say well, that it is for Jerusalems cause the world
stands; that is, the Church. All the tents were pitched about the Tabernacle;
to teach us, Numb. 2.
that the world is but an Inn for the Church to lodge in for a while; and if
the Saints were once gathered out of the world, the four corners of the earth
would so one clap together, 2 Pet. 3.10.
and the Heavens should go away with a noise.

The pillar which upholds the world upon the left hand is Justice; Prove. 16.12.
it upholds the earth, and the Kings throne. It is said, Habak. 1.4. Iam
defluit Lex; the Law fails: This is a speech borrowed from the pulse of a man;
for as we discern the estate of a man by his pulse; if it stir not at all,
then we know he is dead, if it stir violently, then we take him to be in a
Fever; if it keep an equal stroke, then we know he is sound and hole. The
pulse of the Commonwealth is Justice. If Justice be violent and turned into
wormwood, then the Commonwealth is in a bad estate; if it stir not at all,
then the Commonwealth is dead, and if it have an equal stroke, then it is
sound and hole.

Now Sir, these two pillars, Religion and Justice, have been your maine study
how to uphold them in your place, and that these two, might kiss one another,
as the Psalmist speaks; Psalm. 85.10.
For piety, your care has been still, Cant. 2.15.
that these Foxes which spoil the Vines, should be caught, (that is, these
Locusts and Seminaries, which come out of the bottomless pit, 2 Timothy 3.6.
and go about secretly to devour Widows houses, and subvert these tender
young Vines, and weak ones, under the color of long prayers,) your whole
labor is to discover them; and that these parts where ye live may be
receptacles for the earth. Secondly Sir, what your care is for Justice, that
she may flourish, all the Country about you can witness, from the highest to
the lowest. Exodus 18.14.
Iethro said to Moses, Why sit ye all the day long, from morning till night,
judging the people? Your care (I may say truly Sir) from morning to night, is
to judge the people, and to give upright justice to his Majesty's subjects.

There are four Judges most remarkable in the Scripture, Moses for his
mildness; Numb. 12.3. 1 King. 4 29. Job. 29. 1 Samuel 12.3.
Solomon for his wisdom, Job for his pity, and Samuel for his equity: with
the mildness of Moses ye can moderate in discretion your censures; and with
Solomon, wisely Judge what belongs to every one; ye are, as Job speaks, The
blessing of him that is ready to perish; ye are an eye to the blind, and a
foot to the lame; ye see none perish for want of clothing, nor the poor
without a covering: so that the loins of those that are warmed by you, bless
you; and yet in all this you may say with Samuel, Whose Ox have J taken? or
whose Ass have J taken? or whom have J defrauded? whom have J oppressed? or of
whom have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? so that the
people where you dwell, may bless God who has seated you amongst them for
their good. These my travels therefore Sir I offer to your Patrocinie, as to
one most Worthy, and who has greatest interest in them, if there were any
thing in them answerable to your goodness; for still (Sir) ye have been my
greatest incourager, to set me forward in my studies. Ye have Judgment to
discern, what is said to the purpose here, and what seems to be said amiss,
to construe it to the best sense; and to defend it against the critic
censures of some not so well affected. Now for all your care both for Religion
and Justice, the God of Mercy mete you again. Jonadab, for his obedience to
his Father Rechab, had a promise made to him, that he should not want a man to
stand before the Lord for ever. So Sir, for your obedience and care, that ye
have to do service to your King and Country, I pray God that ye want not a man
to stand before the Lord, to succeed you, and to continue your family to all
posterity. Thus craving Gods blessing to be always upon you, and your most
Religious and Noble Lady and children, I bid you all farewell.

JOHN WEEMES, Preacher of the Gospel.

An Advertisement to the Reader for the right using of School-divinitie.
IT is a question that has been much exagitated in the Schools, how far
Philosophy should have place in the Church of God and in Divinity. Some have
gone so far upon the one extremity, that they have advanced her in the
Church, above Divinity it self, and they have framed the whole platform of
their religion as Philosophy has taugth them; others again bending the sprig
other way, would altogether have Philosophy banished out of the Church. But we
are here to follow a middle course, neither to seclude her out of the Church,
neither to suffer her to advance her self above Divinity; she is but the hand
maid to her mistress Divinity: therefore she must not take upon her to rule
in the house, and to overruled her mistress, as Hagar would have usurped above
Sara: if she have any charge, it must be over those who are under her; she must
then submit herself as a dutiful hand maid to her mistress.

There is in a man sense, imagination, reason and faith: sense corrects
imagination; as when the Disciples saw Christ they thought he had been a
spirit: But Christ corrects this wrong imagination by sense, saying, Touch me,
for a spirit has not flesh and bones. When sense is deceived, reason corrects
it; When one puts a staff in the water, to his sight the staff seems to be
broken: but yet reason corrects his sight, and teaches him that the water
cannot break the staff; so when a man is in a fever, sweet things seem
bitter to his taste, yet this reason teaches him that the fault is in his
taste, and that the things are sweet in themselves.

When reason erres, she cannot cure her self, but her mistress Divinity must
come in and teach her. Sara, when she was old the Lord promised that she
should have a child, she did laugh at it, her reason thought it impossible,
that a woman stricken in years should have a child: but her mistress faith
corrected it, and she believed by faith, that which her reason could not take
up. Philosophy is but a hand-maide to Divinity, therefore she must be (...)
and not (...), that is, she must hold herself within her own bounds and not
transcend them. Nicodemus reasoning against regeneration failed in this point
when he reasoned thus: He that is borne again must enter into his mothers
womb again. But no man can enter into his mothers womb again: This
principle is wrong applied by him in Divinity, for we are borne again as
Christ teaches, John 3, by the water and the Spirit; and not by entering into
our mothers womb again. This vain excess of reason and fleshly wisdom, is
that which the Apostle condemns, 2 Cor. 10. so 1 Cor. 3.19.

Again, when by natural reason and Philosophy, we take up a thing; and by
faith we believe the self same thing, if reason claim the first place here,
then she is not a dutiful handmaid.

There are some things in Divinity which are mixtly divine: there are other
things merely divine: these things which are mixtly divine, in such reason may
serve but only in the second place; primo creduntur, and postea intelliguntur:
as a man believes the immortality of the soul: then he begins to take up the
same by reason; must reason here advance her self as far as faith? or must
reason come here before faith? God forbid: for that which I believe, I believe
it, ex authoritate dicentis, relying upon the truth of him that says it, and
all the evidence which I get by reason is nothing to this certitude: if reason
should go before like an usher to make way to faith, we should never believe.
The Schoolmen say well, Rations praecedentes minuunt fidem; sed rations
subsequentes augent fidem Reasons going before faith weaken faith, but reasons
coming after faith strengthen it: reason makes not the matter more sure, ex
part veritatis dictantis, sed ex part intellectus assentientis: in respect of
God the speaker, but in respect of the weakness of our understanding, for by
this access of further knowledge it is more canfirmed. A gardener when he is
about to plant a tree, first he digs the earth and makes an empty room in the
bosom thereof for the planting of the tree: then after he takes the same earth
(which if it had not been dug up, had stayed the planting of the tree) and
casts it about the root of the tree again, for the fastening of it: he takes
also the stones which he had dug up with the earth, and kills the mole which
would have been hurtful to the tree: so, first the Lord empties our soul of
all natural reason; and this heavenly gardener makes a room, wherein he
plants this supernatural grace of faith by his own hand; but when he has
planted this heavenly plant faith in the soul, reason will serve for two uses;
first, for the confirmation and establishing of our faith new planted: another
for killing of all contrary heresies besides which might hurt our faith: But in
things which are merely divine, and quae cadunt direct sub fide, and fall
directly under faith, as the mystery of the Trinity and the incarnation; what
can reason or Philosophy do here; but admire these hid mysteries which she can
never reach unto? if reason the handmaid have always her eyes toward her
mistress, then we may make good use of her in the Church.

The Vine-tree of it self brings forth the most comfortable grape for our
nourishment, and chearing of our hearts; but yet if we set a Mandrake by it,
and then drink of that wine, that wine will make us sleep the better. The
knowledge of Divinity is the only comfortable knowledge, but yet Philosophy as
the Mandrak being set by it, may have the profitable use also. School divinity
has most incroched upon the truth and obscured it; framing all religion
according to the platform of Philosophy. There was one Demonides a
Schoolmaster in Athens having crooked feet, he had his shoes made according
to his feere: one stole his shoes from him; but he wish: that the feet of
those who had stole^ his shoes, might become like unto the shoes. This was a
foolish wish to desire the straight foot, to be made conform to the crooked
shoe, whereas the shoe should be made conform to the straight foot. What is
School divinity, but a crooked shoe? therefore to conform divinity to it,
where to conform the straight foot to the crooked shoe. Divinity must be the
square to correct that which is not straight.

Although this school divinity has been mightily abused, yet the abuse takes
not away the use. For the right using of the schoolmen we must remember, that
there is a threefold judgment, 1. the judgment of verity, the second is the
judgment of prudency, the third is the judgment of charity.

The judgment of verity is only to be found in the Scriptures, and all other
writings should be tried by them, as the canon and touchstone: but the church
of Rome would have the Scriptures to be tried by the Fathers and Schoolmen.

Secondly, the judgment of prudencie is requisite in reading of them; men
should not dote upon them: for this is generally the fault of most of them,
that ye shall find little piety or matter of holiness in all their
writings. Bucer said well, that there is more holiness to be found in Seneca
than in most of them: if men converse too much with them, they shall find but
little sanctification by them, but having their minds enlightened by the holy
Scrptures, and their affections sanctified, they may make use of them Some of
them we may read distinctly and judiciously; some of them we are to read
cursorily; and some of them we are but to look upon here and there: some
meats we cut first, then we chew them, then we digest them; other meats we
swallow them; and other meats we taste only of them. So we should use these
Schoolmen: some of them we should read distinctly: others of them we should
swallow as it were, and run over lightly and others of them we should taste and
look but upon them here and there.

Again, prudency should teach us, what we should observe as impertinent in
them, and what to reject; their questions for the most part are idle and
curious, as the most of their hypotheticall propositions, and the manner of
their disputations; for other times they dispute ex alienis principijs, out of
the grounds of other sciences: they confound Divinity and Philosophy: and the
Me^^s which they use oftentimes are impertinent. They bring innumerable
arguments and disputations oftentimes probable on both sides, and they trust
too much to the testimony of men; they go very rashly many of them, and
speak not soberly enough of the great mystery of the Trinity, and Incarnation;
bringing in philosophical reasons: whereas these mysteries should rather be
adored than searched after: and herein Athanasius said well, Eti^^ verade Deo
loqui est periculosum.

And last of al, they distinguish where the law distinguishes not.

The third judgment is the judgment of charity; when we read them and find
many gross errors in them; we are not for that to reject them, for we shall
find sometimes points notably well cleared in them. The Jews have a proverb,
Comede dactylos, and projice for as duritiem; Eat the Date, and cast away the
stone; so should we in reading of them, take that which is good, and cast away
their errors. The Toade, although it be a loathsome creature, yet we will
take a stone out of the head of it, and use it: the Muske-kat is an il-favoured
creature and yet we will take the musk of it to perfume things with: The Raven
was an unclean creature under the Law, yet Elias was fed by it: so we may get
many profitable helps by these Schoolmen, although they have great errors:
but we must take heed, that we fawningly flatter them not.

The flatterers of Dionysius were so gross, that they would lick up the
spittle of Dionysius, protesting that it was sweeter than nectar; we must not
so doat upon them, as to lick up their excrements, but only follow them in
so far as they follow Christ. We must not give to them glorious titles, for
then as Job says, We must give titles to men, as Jacobus de Voragine, as
though he had eaten up the whole Book of God in reading it; and to Thomas
Aquinas, they gave the name doctor Seraphicus and angelicus: to Scotus, doctor
subtilis; to Durandus, doctor irrefragabilis; to another, venerabilis
incoeptor; to another, doctor fundatissimus; to another illuminatus; to
another, doctor resolutus: and a thousand such.

Among the Jews, when the holy Ghost was not revealed unto them, then they
took glorious titles upon them, as one was called (...) lux mundi, R. Jude,
his title was, Rabbonu (...) doctor noster sanctus; Saddaas was called, (...)
illustris; Abenezra was called, lapis auxilij; they were also called (...)
aperti, the men that saw; for they reckoned the people but blind, Romans 1. and
the leaders of the blind; then they disdained the people, Joh. 7.49. this
people who know not the Law: they called also the people populus terrae. So
when these glorious titles were given to the Schoolmen, then the holy Ghost
withdrew his presence mightily from his Church.

We should in charity judge their errors, for they lived in the hour of
darkness, and few these were then to oppose against them, and what marvel
if they did oftentimes stumble; so that this was but infirmity in them, and not
malice.

But if they could now behold from heaven the Church of Rome (who brags that
she succeeds to them) with her new plots, as her equivocations, mental
reservations, allowing the killing of Princes, absolving subjects from loyalty
toward their Prince; wives from their husbands, children from their parents;
and giving to images not only cultum respectivum, which the schoolmen granted
to them, but also cultum conjunctum, or coadoration; would they not be ashamed
of these their children, and blush if they could behold them?

A Cardinal upon a time caused a Painter to paint the twelve Apostles; the
Painter painted them looking somewhat reddish; the Cardinal asked the Painter
whether the Apostles looked so when they were here alive? no said the Painter:
why do thou then so paint them said the Cardinal? the Painter replied, They
blush so now when they behold the corruptions of you who take upon you to be
leaders of the Church. If the Schoolmen could behold the gross and
innumerable corruptions which are maintained now in the Church of Rome, which
were not then, would they not blush and be ashamed, and disclaim them for
their children?

When Moses was upon the mount, he brought a pattern of the whole frame of
the tabernacle from the Lord, and erected it according to the pattern
received, but the Church of Rome has erected another pattern, framing
religion by the mould of humane reason.

If ye will take a view of several points professed in Popery, ye may easily
perceive whence they have taken the pattern of them, not from Moses on the
mount, but from scholasticke speculations.

First, because the Mathematickes consider lines, figures, circles, points,
abstracted from bodies, therefore they gather, that accidents may be in the
Sacrament without the subject.

Secondly, because moral Philosophy establishes neither punishment nor
reward, unless the free will of man go before; hence they infer, that there
is free will in man: again, because moral Philosophy knows no virtues, but
inherent habites and virtues; therefore it is that they set themselves so
against the inputed righteousness of Christ: the moral Philosopher calls vice
a voluntary evil, therefore they infer, that concupiscence is not sin,
because it is not altogether voluntary.

Thirdly, from the Politickes, in policy, the best sort of government is
monarchical, therefore the Popes government must be monarchical. Again, in
Princes Courts, men use mediators to go to their Prince, therefore they
conclude, that we must use the intercession of the Saints to God. In policy,
no laws are given, but which the subjects may fulfill, therefore man is able
to fulfill the law of God.

Fourthly, from the Physickes; Physic teaches us that the body turns to
corruption, and dissolves; upon this they infer, that man before his fall his
body should have dyed naturally, as it does, if supernatural righteousness
had not kept back corruption; so that they make God as well the author of
death; as well as of nature, considering man here only after the principles of
nature, and not according to his first creation. Again, Physic teaches us,
that the blood always follows the body, therefore they have taken away the
cup from the people in the Sacrament, because (say they) if they get his flesh,
they get his blood, per concomitantiam.

Fifthly, the Metaphysickes teach us, that every positive thing is good,
therefore they define original sin to be a mere privation.

Sixthly, the Platonickes were mightily deluded by the apparition of spirits,
hence they have borrowed their apparition of spirits.

Seventhly, from the Poets fables they have taken their Purgatory.

Last, from the incantations of the Gentiles, they have borrowed their
exorcismes. Thus we see that they have not taken their platform from above in
the mount with Moses, but from below, from humane reason and Philosophy: and
here they ought to have remembered that of the Apostle, Take heed that no man
spoil you with Philosophy. Courteous Reader, if there be any thing here that
may serve for the good of the Church and your edification, give the glory to
God, and reap you the fruits: if there be any thing that seems not
correspondent to reason or the word of God, reprove me for it, and it shall be
like a precious balm unto my head. So recommending you to the grace of God, I
rest,

Your ever loving brother in Jesus Christ, JOHN WEEMSE.

A Delineation of this whole Book.
IT is a Position in the Metaphysickes, that Omne bonum est sui communicativum;
Goodness cannot be contained within it self, but it manifests it self to
others. So the Moralists say, Amor uon est unius; Love must always be betwixt
two or more. So the love and goodness of Gods are manifested to the world
diverse ways: but the first sight that we get in them, is in Creation, whereby
God gave all things through them a being and substance, which no creature on
earth can understand, except man because he bears the Image of God (or at
least some sparkles thereof) ingrafted in his heart. That we may conceive what
this Image is, we must branch it out according as it has the situation in the
soul and body of man: These are lively described to us in this book, which is
divided into two parts. In the first is contained

The Creation in general of all creatures, cha. 1 particular, of man, chapter 2.
where is considered, the Creation of man. 1 in general, in body, wherein is
considered of the members, which are either external, as the Head. Chap. 3.
Eyes. Chap. 3. Ears. Chap. 3. Mouth. Chap. 3. Tongue. Chap. 3. Woman's dugge.
Chap. 3. Hands. Chap. 3.
internal, as the Heart. Chap. 3. Liver. Chap. 3. Lungs. Chap. 3. Ribs.
Chap. 3. Intrales. Chap. 3. Iejunum intestinum. Chap. 3. Kidneyes. Chap. 3.
Five senses. Chap. 3.
Immortality, chap. 4 Perfection, chap. 5
Soul, chapter 6. wherein is considered of the Immortality, chap. 7. Conjunction
of soul and body, chap. 8.

inward in his Understanding, where is described Adams knowledge chap. 11. which
was either inbred, and that natural, 12. acquired, 13
reveiled, and that Of God, 14. Of his creatures 15.

The second part contains
The affections or passions, are considered either in general, Chap. 1.
Wherein is considered their division which is in the part of the soul either
concupiscible, which contains love. under which two, all the passions may be
reduced chap 2. irascible, which contains desire. under which two, all the
passions may be reduced chap 2.

9. Sadness, 10. Hope. 11 Boldness, 11 Despair, 12. Fear, 13. Anger, 14.

The outward image of God in Adam, was in his superiority over the creatures,
16. whereupon do arise three questions, 1 Wherefore God placed his image in
man, 15. 2 Whether this image was natural or supernatural, 17. 3 What society
he had with the Angels, 18.
The Adjuncts of this image, were the two royal prerogatives which Adam had in
innocence. 1 In his contemplative and active life, 19. 2 In his conjunct life
or marriage, 20.

THE PORTRAITVRE of the Image of GOD in MAN, in his Creation, Restoration, and
glorification.
GOD, who dwells in a Light inaccessible, 1. Tim. 6.16. communicates his
goodness to his creatures freely.

Every good thing communicates it self to another: Duplex Bonitas imperfecta
and perfecta.
but yet the Heat is hurtful to some. So justice amongst virtues is the most
excellent virtue, and communicates it self to all Societies, and no Society
could subsist without it, not robbers and I heeves, unless some kind of
justice were amongst them: for if one should take all, Prove. 29.28.
the Society would soon dissolve. Justice communicates not her self
perfectly to this Society, for in this sort of Society there is great
injustice: but God communicates his goodness to all his Creatures in a perfect
measure, fit for their condition, and is hurtful to none.

God communicates his goodness to his Creatures fundry ways;

To some he gives Being only; Cor. 15.39. All flesh is not the same flesh,
but there is one kind of flesh of men, another of beasts, Duplex Bonitas, unita
and dispersa.
and another of fishes, and another of birds: there are celestial bodies, and
terrestrial bodies. A man when he conceives a thing in his mind, he has a
simple conception of it, yet to make his hearers take it up the better, he
utters it by sundry words. So that which is one in God is communicated diversely
unto the creatures, as not being all capeable of a like goodness; although he
communicate not his goodness to all his creatures in a like degree, yet all
are partakers of his goodness.

God in communicating his goodness with the creatures,

Other creatures, Eccles. 6.7. All the travile of a man, is for his mouth. But
God made all things not for his profit, but to show his goodness to the
creatures: therefore his goodness is specially and first seen in the
creation, which is Gods first manifestation of himself.

CHAP. I. Of the Creation in General.
GOd by his goodness is the sole and only cause of creation.

In all other of Gods works he uses means as in generation, he is the
only cause, and uses no means. Duplex Causa, simpliciter and essendi in hoc.
Deus est causa simpliciter in creatione, at essendi in hoc in alijs: God is
the only simple cause in creation; but in his other works, he is only the
cause of being this or that.

God is the first cause, and being is the first effect; Non ens, that which is
nothing: but an instrument cannot be Non ens; therefore no instrument can
intervene between the first cause and the first effect.

God is the only cause of creation, Inter priman Causam and primum Effectum
nihil intervenit Thom. contra Gentiles.
therefore the Angels can be no instrument in creation, far less can they
create a thing, Augustine says, Daemones non possunt quicquam creare, sed
creata specie tenus mutare; Secondly, the Angels may hasten the production of
things, but not in an instant, as God made Adam a perfect man in an instant,
and Aarons Rod to budde and to bring forth almonds in an instant, Number. 17.
because it was a Creation and a Miracle. Thirdly, as they can hasten nature, so
they can bring accidents into nature: for if Jacob by laying peeled rods before
the sheep, made them to conceive speckled Lambs, Genesis 30.37. much more can an
Angel work such things in nature. Augustine in his book called the City of
God, gives an example of this; the Ox which they worshipped in Egypt was
marked with many diverse spots; when he dyed, how could they find another
marked after the same manner? Augustine answers, that the devil represented to
the Cow ingendring, a Bull with the like marks, and so the Cow brought forth
the like. And thus the Devil continued Idolatry in Egypt. Here we see how they
can bring accidents into nature, but the Devils could not create the Ox of
Egypt.

God only creates: this distinguishes him from the heathen God, and the
vanities of the Gentile. Ier. 10.11. So shall thou say to them, Cursed be the
gods that made not heaven and earth. This verse is set down in the Chaldee
tongue, whereas all the rest of the prophecy is set down in the Hebrew
tongue: why did the Lord this? to this effect, that when the Jews should go
into Babylon, and there should be solicited to worship their Idols, they
should have this verse ready in their own language; Cursed be your gods, for
they made neither heaven nor earth.

God created the world of nothing.

Nothing is taken sundry ways in the Scriptures: privatively, as 1 Cor. 8.4.
an Idol is nothing, that is, it has no divinity in it; it is nothing
privatively, here, but not negatively, for it is of wood or stone. So 1. Cor.
7.9. Circumcision is nothing, Nihil est negativum, comparativum, and privativum.
that is, it has no efficacy in it after the abolishing of it, yet it is not
simply nothing, for it is the cutting of the foreskin. Secondly, a thing is
nothing in comparison, one thing being compared with another of greater
excellency. Esai. 48. All the world is nothing before him; that is, all the
world is nothing, being compared with God. Thirdly, a thing is nothing
negatively or simply, Mark 11.13. There was no fruit upon the fig tree. When
we say that God made the world of nothing, it is not meant of nothing
privatively or in comparison, but of nothing negatively and simply. Romans 4. He
calls upon things that are not, as though they were.

He proceeded in the Creation from the negation to the habit, Deus in
creatione process it a negatione ad habitum, a totali privatione ad habitum,
and a partiali privatione ad habitum.
when he made the world of nothing simply; secondly, from a total privation
to the habit, when he made light to shine out of darkness. 2. Cor. 4.6.
thirdly, from a partial privation to the habit; when he made the day to
succeed to the night.

God has sundry royal prerogatives which only belong to himsefe.

First God can create a thing of nothing; Egypt, who in show had many things,
yet could not truly make the basest creeping things, Exodus 8.18. Secondly, it
is Gods prerogative to turn a thing to nothing; Tanta est distantia ab ente ad
non ens, ut a non ente ad ens.
for there is as great a vastness of motion from that which is, to that which
is not, as is from that which is not, to that which is. A man may dissolve a
body into dust by burning it, but he cannot simply turn it to nothing, for
only God by his power must do this; Annihilatio est substractio Divini
influxus, a thing is turned to nothing, Solius Dei est creare de nihilo,
convertere in nihilum, transformare, addere formas rebus, vivisicare, and
conservare.
when God withdrawes his influence from it. Thirdly, it is God that can in a
moment without natural preparation turn one substance into another, as water
into wine, John 2. and Lots wife into a pillar of salt, Genesis 19. therefore the
Devil when he would take a proof of Christ whether he was God or not, bids
him change stones into bread, Mat. 4. Fourthly, it is Gods prerogative, only
to add forms to things, man cannot simply invent a form, but compose, add,
or diminish from that which he has seen already; a man can make a mountain
of gold, because he has seen both a mountain and gold; so he can make Dagon
half man, and half fish, because he has seen both fish and a man before,
but he cannot simply invent a form. Fifthly, it is God that only can put life
into the creatures. Sixthly, to preserve and guide them continually.

He who needs most helps to his work, Art, Nature, Ars, Natura, Deus,
operimur. Est agens independens.
and God. Art needs many helps, Nature needs few, but God none, for his
working depends upon nothing, and he presupposes nothing to work upon. The
perfection of art is to imitate nature, the perfection of nature, is to imitate
God in his first creation, when Art degenerates from nature; then she is
ashamed, and when nature degenerates from the first creation, she brings
forth but monsters.

The tradesman when he works,

God when he made the world of nothing. First, he made it of nothing simply.
Secondly, of a subject that had no hability to produce, Ex inhabili subiccto.
as when he made the plants out of the earth, there was no more power in the
earth at the first to produce these plants, then there was in the rock to give
water, Exodus 27. Thirdly, he created man out of a subject that had no hability
to produce the matter, and of nothing simply, touching the form, as he made
his body out of the earth, Creatio in materia, sed non ex materia.
which had no disposition in it for making of the body; so he created the soul
of nothing, which is the form of the body, he produced the soul of beasts,
both in the body, and of the body.

He made the world of nothing, E X, hic non not at m^teriam sed ordinem. OF.
signifies not here any matter, but onder only.

Quest. How were the creatures with God before the creation.

Answ. Esse in sua causa ideale, reale.
The creatures are said to be three manner of ways. First in the cause, as
the Rose in winter is in the root, although it be not spread. Secondly, when
they are in the mind by representation. Thirdly, when they have a real
existence. The creatures were with God before their creation, as in the cause,
so they were with God in his understanding before the creation: and of this
sort of being, David speaks, Psalm. 139.16. saying, Thine eyes did see my
substance yet being imperfect, and in thy book all my members were written,
which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there were none of them: but
the creatures had not a real existence with God, as after when they were
created. The creatures, eminenter sunt in Deo, they are by way of excellency in
God, but in themselves they have a finite being.

God is the exemplar of all things.

The creatures are but as the shadow to the body, or as the reflex of the
glass presently vanishes when the face is turned away; So when God turns
away his face from the creatures, they perish and turn to nothing Psalm.
104.29. They die and return to their dust. God in the creation created some
things actually, other things potentially, in their first principles; as Honey,
Wine, The order of the Creation.
Oil, Balm, and such.

God in the creation kept this order; in the universe, he proceeds from the
imperfect, to the perfect, Progressus ab imperfectis ad perfecta in universi
creatione, at in particulartum creatione a perfectis ad minus perfecta.
as the Elements were first created, and then the things made of the Elements;
the things without life; before things with life; and of things with life, he
made man last, as most perfect; but in particular things, he proceeded from
the more perfect, to the more imperfect; as first he made the trees, and then
he made the seed; so he made the Woman after the Man, as more imperfect and
passive.

Quest. Whether could God have made the world better than he made it?

Answ. Duplex perfectio, graduum, and partium.
The world is confidered either in respect of the whole, or in respect of the
parts. In respect of the whole, the world is perfect, both in respect of
degrees and parts: but respecting the parts severally, the world was not
perfect in respect of degrees, for God by his power might have made particular
things better than they were. This the Scripture shows us, Genesis 1. when it
says, That every days work was good, but when it speaks of all together, it
says, They were very good; Propter ordinum universi, and hac est ultima and
nobilissima perfectio in rebus; This is the last and most excellent perfection
of the creatures, and this could not be made better. In a Camp, there are
Captains, Soldiers, and a General, a Soldier considered by himself, might
be in a better place than he is in; for it were better for him that he were a
Captain, But consider him with the whole Camp, which consists as well of
inferior members as superior, it is better for him to be a Soldier. So
consider the several works of God by themselves, they might have been made
better; but consider them with the whole, Thom. part. prim quest. 15. art. 6.
Essentia cuiusque, rei consistit in indivisibile, Ergo nihil potest add^ vel
detrahi. Up. natura est intensa aut poten ia in hibita non est creatio.
they could not have been made better. Consider Christ's humane by it nature
self, it had been better if it had not been passible; but consider it in
order to our redemption, it was better that his body was made passible, and so
could not have been made better, because it was better for the curing of our
misery, that his body should be mortal and passible. Secondly, it may be
answered, God could have made these things which he made better accidentally,
but not essentially, because he could have made Man or Angel with more
excellent gifts than he made them with: but he could not make them in essent
better than they were. Thirdly, it is answered, by others: that God could not
make the world with more wisdom, or after a better manner than he made it;
but respecting the things which were made, he could have made them better, Ad
optimum non pertinet ut optima faciat, sed ut optime and summa potentia and
sapientia; It belongs not to the chief good, to make things good in the
highest measure of goodness, but by his poewre and wisdom only to make them
good.

Quest. Whether are Miracles a Creation or not.

Answ. Where Nature is only enlarged or hindered; they are not called a
Creation, but a Miracle: but where the things are suddenly brought forth, or
the Essential forms multiplied, there is a Creation as well as a Miracle.
Example of the first, when Nature is only extended, it is not a Creation but a
Miracle; as when the eye of Stephen saw to the third heaven, Christ standing at
the right hand of God, Act. 7. or when Sara that was barren conceived, Genesis 21.
or when the Sun went back ten degrees, Esaias 38. or when it stands still,
Josh. 10. these are Miracles, but not a Creation. But when the Virgin Mary
conceives, and bears a Son, here is both a Miracle, and a Creation. It was
a miracle because a Virgin brought forth a Son, and yet remained still a
Virgin. It was a Creation, because she conceived a child without a natural
means, Respectu causae efficient is non materiae, In respect of the efficient,
and not of the material cause: She knew no man, for the holy Ghost
over-shadowed her, Luke 1. Manna made for the sustentation of the Israelites,
is both a Miracle and a Creation, Ex. 16.22. In respect of the place from
whence it comes (from Heaven) it is a Miracle; in respect of the quantity
that there fell so much to feed so many hundredth thousand people, it was a
Creation; In the taste it was sweet like honey, a Miracle; in the color
transparent, a Miracle; in a quality that the heat of the Sun melted it, and
the heat of the fire baked it, a Miracle; but that their fell double of it on
the evening before the Sabbath, both a Creation and a Miracle: that it fell not
upon the Sabbath day, a Miracle; that it corrupted when it was gathered
contrary to the command of God, a Miracle; that it fell only about the camp
of Israel, and in no place else, a Miracle; that it lasted till they came to
Canaan a Miracle; that it was preserved for so many hundred years in the
golden pot, a Miracle.

Quest. Whether shall the Resurrection of the Body be a Creation or not.

Basil answers, In epist. ad caesarienses. Creatio ex nihilo, regenerationis et
resurrectionis.
that it is a creation, and he shows that there are three sorts of Creation,
the first, when a thing is made of nothing, as in the first Creation. The
second, when a thing of evil is made good; as in regeneration, Psalm. 51.
Create in me a new heart. The third, when the bodies shall be raised out of the
dust, at the resurrection: the first is called (...), and the resurrection is
called (...), or a new creation, Matthew. 19.3.28

CHAP. I. Of the Creation of Man.
MOses in the first of Genesis brings in God making man. Divinity and all
other sciences: for although all other sciences be busied about man; as
Physic, for the health of his body; Ethickes, for his civil conversation,
etc. Yet none of them leads him to the conversation of his Maker, Differt
theologia ab omnibus alijs scientijs.
but Divinity, till Moses come in and show this. The Anatomist will describe
every member of his body, but never speak of his Maker. Here we see the
profaneness of man, for he makes less account of this science than of any
other; he accounts more of the painter that paints him, or of the tailor that
makes his clothes, than of him that shows him who made him. Laertius writes
of one Crates who bestowed his goods very foolishly, for he gave to his
flatterer ten talents, to his whore a talent, to his cook ten Mna's, to his
Physician a Drachme, to his Philosopher three half penny's, to his Counselor,
Fumum, Smoke; in effect, men now eount baseliest of the most worthiest
sciences: but let men paint thee, dress thee, cure thee as they please; if
Moses come not in and tell thee, that God made thee, they shall have all but
shame of their handiworke. The Philosopher being asked, what was the cause that
Philosophers attended at the gates of rich men, and rich men attended not at
the gates of Philosophers? he answered, because the Philosophers knew what they
stood in need of, but the rich men knew not what need they had of Philosophy.
So if men knew how much they stood in need of Divinity, to lead them to their
Creator, Causa materiatis, formatis, officiens, finalis.
they would make more of them that lead them to this knowledge.

Divinity passes for the most part from the material and formal cause, and
thinks upon the Efficient and final, the first and the last cause, and so
while other sciences are either plunged in the baseness of the matter, or
curiously searching into the forms of things (which can hardly be known) the
Divine is carried back to the contemplation of the first cause, to eternity,
and to the last cause in eternity, which are the only comfortable meditations.

CHAP. III. Of Man's Body.
THe body of man was created of the earth.

The Philosophers say,

God made all things in weight, number, Wis. 11.17. In weight, that the earth
and water should be heaviest in substance, Omnia operatus est Dominus in
pondere, numer^^ et mensura.
and that the air and fire should be lightest. In number that a little fire
should have a great efficacy and power, as a great quantity of earth. In
measure that they might keep a proportion amongst themselves, if this harmony
be broken, it brings destruction of the body, as if the heat prevail then
it brings fevers, if the cold prevail then it brings lethargies: if the
moist prevail then it brings Hydropsies: so that the extreme qualities
(according to the situation of the Elements) heat and cold, must be temperate
by the middle qualities of the middle Elements, moist and dry.

It is to be marked, how God has showen his wisdom in creation: First in
placing man here below upon earth who had an earthly body. Secondly his power,
when he shall place the same body, (when it shall be made a spiritual Body,
1. Cor. 14.
in the heavens to dwell there. Thirdly, his justice in thrusting the bad
angels, who are spirits, down to the lower hells, who were created to enjoy
the Heavens if they had stood in innocence.

God created the Body of man of the dust of the earth, that it might be matter
to humble him.

When Herod gave not glory to God, Act. 12.23. The Text says, that he was
eaten with vermin; in the Syriack it is, He was made a stable for worms.
Since the fall, the body is nothing but a stable for worms, and food for them:
Abenezra. R. Solomon.
and the Hebrews mark, that the flesh of man is called, Lecham, Bread, Ioh.
20.23, Because now it is indeed bread and food for the worms.

Out of a base matter God made an excellent shape of man.

Psalm. Rukkamte, metaphera ab acupictoribus.
139.15. How wonderfully have thou made me below in my mothers womb: a speech
borrowed from those who work, Opus Phrygionicum, Phrygian or Arras work. The
body of man is a piece of curious Tapestry or Arras work, consisting of skin,
bones, muscles, and sinews.

The excellency of the body of man when he was first created, Hercules foot,
gathered by it, the proportion of his whole body; So may we by the relics
found in sinful man, gather what a goodly thing the body of man had been
before the fall. As the complexion of David, 1. Sam. 16.12. The swiftness of
Hazael who was swift as a roe, 2. Sam. 2. The beauty of Absalon, in whom there
was not a blemish from top to toe, 2. Sam. 14. All which being joined together
would make a most rare man: and if the miraculous wine changed by Christ, Ioh.
2. at the marriage in Cana of Galile exceeded far the natural Wine; how much
more did the body of man in the first creation exceed our bodies now.

The members of the body of man, the Head of spices, Can. 4. Renes tritici, the
Kidneys of the wheat, Devt. 32. the Heart of the earth, Matthew. 12.40. the
Lip of the sea, Heb. 11.12. the mouth of the sword, 11.34. and such like; all
which show the excellency of man's body.

The measures of every thing are taken from the body of man; as the Inch, the
Foot, the Palm and the Cubit.

There are sundry members in the body of man which God ascribes to himself: as
the Head, the Heart, Ears, the Feet, to express his attributes to us.

God has made the body of man a Temple for himself to dwell in,

God has placed wisely the members in the body.

There are some members that are called Radical members, as the liver, the
heart, and the brain; and in these, Membra radicalia.
the Lord has placed the Natural, vital, and animal spirits; these spirits
are carried by the Veins, Arteries, and Nerves: the Veins carry the vital
spirits from the Liver; the Arteries carry the natural spirits from the Heart:
Officialia.
and the Nerves carry the animal spirits from the Brain. There are other
members, which are serving members; as the hands, feet, and such.

The members of the body help one another, feet, the legs, and thighs
support the whole body.

The middle members of the body defend the body, hands and arms.

The Sympathy amongst the members; sympathy amongst the members.

The variety of the members of the body shows also this wisdom of God: If
all were an eye, where were the seeing, 1 Cor. 12.15.

Of the several outward members of the Body.
Of the Head.
THe Head is the most excellent part of the body. First, we uncover the Head
when we do homage to a man; to signify, that our most excellent part,
(wherein our reason and understanding dwells) reverenceth and acknowledges
him. Secondly, because the Head is the most excellent thing; therefore the
chiefest part of any thing is called the head, Deuteronomy. 28.24. Thou shall be the
head and not the tail. So Christ is called the Head of the Church, Ephesians.
5.23. and the husband is called, the head of the wife, 1 Cor. 11.23. So the
excellentest spices are called, the head of spices, Exodus 30.25.

All the senses are placed in the Head, except the touch, which is spread
through the whole body. Secondly, the Head is supereminent above the rest of the
body. Thirdly, the Head gives influence to the rest of body. Fourthly, there
is a conformity betwixt the Head and the rest of the body. Christ, the Head of
his Church, he has graces above the rest of his members; he gives influence
and grace to them, and he is like to them. So the man is the woman's Head, he
has more gifts than the woman, he should instruct and teach her, she is of the
same nature that he is, Bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, Genesis 2.23.

Of the Eye.
FIrst, the Eye is speculum artis, Visu and eculo videmus, sed visu effective
and formaliter, oculo instrumentaliter.
for men have learned by the Eye to make Looking glasses: if the Christaline
humor were not backed with a black humor, the Eye would give no reflex: so if
glasses were not backed with steel, the glass would give no reflex. Secondly,
although a man have two eyes in his head, yet he receives but one sight at
once, because his optic nerves meet in one. So although he have two ears,
yet he hears but one sound at once; because his acousticke nerves both meet
in one. So although there be many members in the mystical body; yet all
should be of one mind, because there is but one spirit, 1 Cor. 12.4. Thirdly,
the eye in it self has no color; for if it had any proper color in it
self, then the object should ever appear in that color which the Eye has;
as it is evident in Icteriacis, in those whose eyes are so vitiate, that all
colors seem alike to them, and in those who have the yellow Iaundise, because
the eye is vitiate with yellowness, all things appear yellow unto them. So
when the mind of man is preoccupied with dangerous error. When Christ told his
Disciples that he must be whipped, crucified, and rise the third day; the Text
says, They understood none of these things, being hid from them, Luke 18.33,
34. Because they had drunk in a false principle before; that Christ behoved to
be a worldly King, Act. 1.6. and this is the reason why the Jews interpreted
the places concerning Christ's Kingdom, literally, and not spiritually; of an
earthly Kingdom, and not of a spiritual. Fourthly, there are five tunicles in
the Eye to keep it from any hurt; the first is called araneae tunica, like a
spiders web; the second, retiformis, woven like a net: the third, uvea, like
a berry: the fourth, Cornea, like horn: the fifth, adnata tunica, the cover of
the eye, or the eyelids. David to express the special care that God has over
his Saints, says, Thou keep me as the apple of thine eye, Psalm. 17.8. That
is, thou have a special care over me, thou guardest me many ways, as the
apple of the Eye is guarded with these five tunicles. A Collation betwixt the
Innocent and old Adam.


The Eye before the fall, was the window to let in good instructions to the
soul; but since the fall, it is proxenets peccati, the broaker that goes
betwixt the heart and the object, to make up a sinful bargain, it is now
pronubus ejus, cujus tactus est minister, the spokesman of the wedding with
sin, and touch is his servant, and because it is now the most sinful sense,
God has placed tears in it, which are the tokens of repentance.

The eye now is an adulterous eye, 2. Pet. 2.14. the eye now is oculus nequam,
an evil eye, Matthew. 20.15. it is now a covetous eye, Eccles. 37.7. Give the
Lord his honor with a good eye, and diminish not his first fruits. Here
heealludes to the custom of the Jews: for he who had a good eye, paid one of
forty, when he paid his first fruits; he who was of a mydle sort of eye paid
one of fifty; but he who had a coveteous eye, paid one of sixty; and they
used to say, There goes the man with a good eye, meaning the liberal; and,
There goes the man with the evil eye, meaning the covetous.

There was a contention upon a time, betwixt the heart and the eye, which of
these two were the cause of sin; which was decided by reason after this sort:
Cordi causam imputans,
occasionem Oculo:


The cause of sin is in the heart, but the eye is the occasion.

Of the Ear.
The Ear is first and honorable part of the body; Genesis 24. so when men were
discharged, their Ear was bored in token of infamy. Exodus 22.

Secondly, Ear is an honorable part for instruction: the Philosophers call it
sensum disciplinae, the sense for instruction.

Thirdly for delight, the Ear, Solomon calls the Ears, the daughters of
Music, Eccles. 12.

Fourthly, Ear is the most excellent member for grace; for faith comes by
hearing, Romans 10.17. The Apostle when he cited that verse of the 40. Psalm in
the 9. of the Hebrews he cites it thus, Thou have fitted a body for me; but
David has it thus, Thou have bored mine ear; why? because his ear was one of
the principal members whereby he gave obedience to God his Father.

Fifthly, revelat aurem, he uncovers the ear, or takes a veil off it. 2 Samuel
20. Secondly, perforat, aurem, he bores the ear, Psalm. 40. as masters of old
bored their servants ear, that they might dwell with them for ever, Exo. 22.
The first was ad intelligentiam, for understanding; the second was ad
obedientiam, for obedience. Thirdly, he circumcises the^ ear, Romans 2.29. which
includes both the former.

Sixthly, ear, because it is Ianua vita, the gate of life, as we see in the man
possessed with a deaf Devil, Mark 9.25. he possessed that sense as the most
excellent, to hinder him from hearing.

Before the fall, A collation betwixt the innocent and old Adam.
the ear was the gate of life; but since the fall, in the corrupt man, it is
the gate of destruction, Evil speeches corrupt good manners. 2 Cor. 15. and
now he is like unto the deaf adder, he stoppes his ear and will not be
enchanted, Psalm. 58.

Of the Mouth.
Eccl. A collation betwixt the innocent and old Adam.
6.7. All that a man labors, is for his mouth; the mouth, a little and a
strait hole, is soon filled.

Man before his fall was content with little, but fince he labors not to
fill a mouth, but a gulf, as it were the mouth of the Leviathan.

Of the Tongue.
The Tongue of man is a most honorable member, wherefore it is called man's
honor and his glory, Genesis 49.6. Psalm. 16.9. My glory rejoices, because it is
the instrument for to glorify God.

Secondly, a man has two eare^s, and but one Tongue, Iam. 1.19.

Thirdly, there is but one Tongue in man, bilinguis, of a double Tongue. God
will not have a heart and a heart in a man, Psalm. 12. so he will not have a
Tongue and a Tongue in him, Pro. 8.13, that is, a double Tongue.

Before the fall, A collation betwixt the innocent and old Adam
the Tongue of man was like the pen of a swift writer, Psalm. 45.1. and uttered
those things which his heart indicted: but since the fall, it is a world of
iniquity, and defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of
nature, and is set on fire of hell. Iam. 3.6. now it is an unruly evil, and
filled with deadly poison, Iam. 3.8.

Before the fall, he spoke but with one Tongue; but since the fall, he is
bilinguis, he speaks with a double tongue, Prove. 8.13. and sometimes
trilinguis, Eccles. 33. Lingua tertia commovit multos, a third tongue has
troubled many. The Chalde paraphrase calls a backbiter, a man with a three
fold Tongue, or a Tongue which has three stings. The Jews give an example of
it in Doeg, who killed three at once with his evil report; Saul, to whom he
made the evil report; the Priests, of whom he made the evil report: and
Himself, who made the evil report.

The Heathen in the dedication of the several parts of man's body, gave the
ears to Minerva, the tongue to Mercury, the arms to Neptune, and the eye to
Cupid, etc.

Of the Woman's Dugges.
God has placed the Woman's Dugge in her breast, Duplex est causa physica and
moralis.
and not in her belly, as in beasts; and that for two causes: the first is a
Physical cause, the second is a Moral cause. The Physical cause, God has
placed them so near the liver, that the milk might be the better concocted,
and the more wholesome for the child: The Moral cause, that the woman might
impart her affection and love more to her child, by giving it suck with her
Dugge, which is so near the heart. The giving of Suck was one of the greatest
bonds of obligation of old, betwixt the mother and the children: when they
entreated any thing of their children, they would say, By these Dugges which
gave thee suck, I request thee do this. Virgil.

Of the Hand.
By the Hand we promise, and threaten: it is the right hand of fellowship, Gal.
2.9. We reckon by it, Wisdom comes with length of days upon her right
hand, Prove. 3.16. The ancients reckoned upon their left hand, until they came
to an hundred years, and then they began to reckon upon their right hand. So
the meaning of Solomon is, that wisdom should make them to live a long age,
even to a hundred years. As we reckon with the hand, so we worship with the
hand: Job protests, that he blessed not his hand when he saw the new Moon,
Job 31.27. The Idolaters they used to kiss their Idols, Ose 13.2. But because
they could not reach to the Moon to kiss her, they kissed their hand in
homage before the Moon: and Job purged himself of this kind of Idolatry. And
the special providence of God is to be marked in the hand of man, that he
has made him to take his meat with his hand, and has not left him to gather
his meat with his lips, as the beasts do, for if man did so, his lips,
should become so thick, that he should not speak distinctly; we see by
experience, that those who have thick lips, speak not distinctly.

Of the internal members of Man's Body.
Of the Heart.
All the passions are seated in the heart, we see in Fear, heart, as to the
place where fear exercises her tyranny, therewith to defend themselves; and
therefore it is that those creatures, that have the greatest and largest
hearts, are most fearful, because the heat is more largely dispersed within
their Heart: and consequently, they are less able to resist the assaults of
fear.

Object. But it might seem, that our anger is seated in the Gall, love in the
Liver, and melancholy in the Spleen, and so the rest; therefore the affections
have not their seat in the Heart.

Answ. These four humors, seated in the Gall, Liver, and Spleen, are not the
seat of the passions; but they are the occasion, whereby the passions are
stirred up; as the abundance of blood in the Liver, stirs up the passion of
our love which is seated in the heart.

The heart is the first mover of all the actions of man; heart of man carry all
the members of the body with it. In natural generation, the heart is first
framed; and in spiritual regeneration, it is first reformed.

The heart lives first, and dies last. heart first, and is last left there:
hence it is, that Michael the Archangell and the Devil, Iud. 9. strove no
faster about the body of Moses, than they do about the heart of man: therefore
the Lord says, Son give me thy heart, Prove. 23.

The Jews compared the heart of Man for the excellency of it, to three things.
First, to the holiest of all, where the Lord gave his answers. So the Lord
gives his answers, First out of the heart: Secondly, they compare it to
Salomons throne, as the stateliest place where the King sits; So the Lord dwells
in the heart of man, as in the throne. Thirdly, to Moses Tables, in which he
wrote his Law. Prove. 3.3. Write Wisdom upon the Tables of the heart.

God dwelt in the heart of Man before the fall; A collation betwixt the
innocent and old Adam
but since the fall there is a great change in the heart; for out of the heart,
proceed Murder, Adultery, evil speakings, and such, Math. 15. It was a great
curse which the Prophet denounced against the house of Ahab, 2. King. 10.27.
That it should be turned into a Iakes; but a far greater change now unto the
heart of a man, being now a receptacle of all uncleanness.

The heart of man before the fall was a wise heart, Eccles. 10.2. But the heart
of a fool is now in the left side, Eccles. 10.2. The Anatomists mark when the
heart inclines more to the right side; the spirits of these men are more
lively, and are more apt for contemplation; the right hand is the stronger
hand, because more heat proceeds from the heart to the right hand, then to the
left: But when the heat equally disperseth it self to both the hands, then a
man is Ambidexter, he has the use of both the hands equally alike. By the
right hand we do things more easily, because motion proceeds first from the
heart to it The meaning then of Solomon is, that the heart of the wise man, is
a strong heart, a courageous heart, apt to do good, and a most honorable part,
wherein the Lord has set his residence; but the heart of man since the fall,
is a weak heart, a faint heart, slow to do any good, as a base and ignorant
heart.

Of the Liver.
The Liver in enclosed by a net called Reticulum, the seventy translate it
(...) as ye would say an husk; for even as the husk incloseth the Corn, so
does this net compass the Liver; and it is to be marked, that God has fenced
his noblest parts, as the brain, with Piamater, and Duramater; the Heart with
Pericardia, and the Liver with Reticulum.

Of the Lungs.
The Lungs, the bellows of the voice, Veritas est in re ut in causa, in
enunciations ut symbolo: in mente ut in subiecto; haec dicitur complexa veritat.
are seated so near the heart, to teach us that speech is but the interpreter
of the heart, against those who think one thing and speak another. To make a
man speak truth, three things are necessary; first, there must be verity in
the matter; secondly, in the conception of him who speaks: thirdly in his
speech. The first must be in signato, the second in conceptu, the third in
signo. If the matter be not true, then the conception is false; if the
conception be false, then the speech is false. If a man should set the kings
arms aright; first, there must be such a thing as a Lion: secondly, the Lion
must be set right upon the seal: thirdly, the seal must be set right in the
wax: if any of these three be wanting, the Kings arms are not rightly set. So
the matter which we speak of, Veritas, theologica, logica.
must first be true in it self: secondly, we must conceive it rightly, and
thirdly, we must utter it rightly. But in Logical verity it is otherways: for
if there be an agreement betwixt the matter only and the Tongue, it suffices,
although it be not rightly taken up by the mind. As when I say there are
Antipodes; whether I believe this to be true, or not, it makes not much; it is
a Logical truth, because there is an agreement betwixt the matter it self and
the Tongue. But a theological truth will have an agreement in all the three.

Augustines notation then of a lie is not persit: mentiri est contra mentem
ire; to lie, is to speak contrary to the mind; for it expresses not fully
the nature of a lie; for a man may lie, speaking an untruth, taking it to be
truth; therefore John makes an untruth a lie, 1 John 2.4. He that says I know
him, and keeps not his Commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;
For if the matter be not true in it self, although he take it to be truth,
and do utter it; yet it is a lie: it is a material lie, and an untruth,
Mendacium materiale, formale.
although it be not a formal lie. So Heretics broaching their errors, which
they take to be truth, teach lies.

Before the fall, A collation betwixt the Innocent and old Adam.
man spoke as he thought; but since the fall, he has found out equivocations,
and mental reservations, and speaks oftentimes contrary to that which he
means.

Of the Ribs.
There are two sorts of Ribs in the body of man: the first, called by the
Anatomists, Costae legitimae; whereof there are seven, these defend the vital
parts: the second Costae spuriae, whereof there are five lying to the belly.

Quest. When Abner stroke Hazael at the fifth Ribbe, and Ioab, Amaza; which of
the Ribs is it meant of here?

Answ. It is meant of the inferior Ribs, which we call the short Ribs;
and any of these five Ribs is called the fifth Ribbe. When Abner struck
Hazael at the fifth Rib, he struck him on the right side, because he was
behind him; but when Ioab struck Amaza, he struck him on the left side,
because he was embracing him. The stroke of Abner was deadly, because he
struck him through the liver; and the stroke of Ioab was deadly, because he
struck him in at the Pericardia, that compasses the heart round with water to
refrigerate it; for the nether part of the heart reaches down to the fifth
Ribbe. When the Soldier pierced Christ's side, John 19.34. it is said, He
pierced his side, and there came forth water and blood: the Syriacke Paraphrast
says, He pierced his Ribbe: that is, the fifth Ribbe, where the Pericardia lay.

Of the Intrailes.
The Intrailes are called by the Hebrews, Rechamim, and by the Greeks (...),
the bowels of compassion, Luke 1.78. When a woman sees her child in any
danger, her bowels earne within her; which is attributed to Christ himself,
when he saw the people scattered in the Wilderness, Mark 6.34. (...). He had
compassion upon them: in the Greek it is, His bowels did earne within him; he
is a pitiful high Priest, who is touched with our infirmities, Heb. 4.15.

Of the Intrailes called Iejunum intestinum.
When the meat is out of the stomach, and the Hungry gut, called Iejunum
intestinum, emprie; then man begins to be hungry; this gut by the Greeks is
called (...), and from it comes the Greek word (...), to fast.

Of the Kidneyes.
The Kidneyes lie in a hid and secret part of the body; therefore David when
he would declare how God knows hid and secret things, he says, Thou triest
my Reins, Psalm. 139. that is, my secretest cogitations; for although the
affections be seated in the heart, as the cause; yet they are ascribed to the
Reins, as the occasion: the cause of sin is in the heart, the occasion in
the Eye, Ier. 12.2. Thou art near in their mouth, and far from their Reins.

Before the fall, A collation betwixt the innocent and old Adam
all the members of man's body, were the weapons of righteousness; but since
the fall, they are the weapons of sin, Romans 6.13. His throat is an open
sepulcher, Psalm. 5.9. His feet swift to shed blood, Esaias 59.7. His right hand,
a hand of falsehood, Psalm. 26.10. In a Sheep every thing is good; his wool
and his skin to cloth us, his flesh to feed us, his dung to dung the land,
his small guts to be Lute strings; but in a man since the fall, every member is
hurtful. In the sacrifices under the Law, the caul and the fat about it, was
commanded to be taken from the heart, the liver, and the kidneyes, Exodus
29.13. Levit. 3.3, 4. Esaias 6.10. It was to be taken from the heart, to signify
that the seat of our understanding (which is the heart) is corrupted; from the
Liver, to signify that our anger is corrupted; from the Kidneyes, to signify
that the seat of our concupiscence is corrupted.

Man before the fall had a beautiful body answerable to the holiness of his
soul, Beauty in a woman without grace, is like a ring in a swines snowt, Prove.
11.22. The Philosopher gave this counsel to his scholars, every morning to
look in a glass, and finding their faces beautiful, they should labor to
beautify their mind accordingly. The ancients said, that beauty was the
flower of goodness: that is, bodily beauty was the image of the souls
goodness. But the Proverb now go'th, The properest man at the Gallows and
the farest woman in the Stews; those who belie their own Physiognomy, are
rather to be punished than others; because they belie that good promise which
God has placed in the face. Antiochus Epiphanes by Daniel is called Antiochus
Hardface, Dan. 8.23. The impudent countenance of him, showed his perverse
mind. Socrates confessed, that the deformity of his body, did justly accause
the natural deformity of his soul; but that by industry and learning he had
corrected that perversitie of his mind. One looking upon his deformed body:
said unto him, O excellens anima, quam deforme hospitium nacta es; O excellent
soul, how basely art thou lodged in such a body. The Scholars of Hippocrates
carried upon a time, the picture of their master to one Philomenes, who was
exquisite in Physiognomie, desiring his judgment what he thought of their
master? who said, that he was one much given to lechery. But the Scholars
found fault with Philomenes, that he should so have judged of their master
Hippocrates, and this they told their master; who confessed, that Philomenes
had judged aright: but he said, the love of Philosophy, and honesty, had
overcome the corruption of his heart, and he had gotten that by study which
nature had denied him.

Of the five senses.
The spring and original of the five senses, is in the common sense seated in
the forepart of the head: this sense differs from the rest of the senses, as
the root from the branches, and as a line drawn from the point; the objects
of the senses are laid up here as in a storehouse, it judges of all the
objects, but the particular sense considers only of the object, as it is
present; this sense considers the object, as absent. As all the senses have
their beginning from this sense; so all the Senses, Terminantur in hoc sensu;
they end in this sense.

All the senses agree in this; first, that their power is passive, by receiving
in, and not by giving out; Recipient sensilia per immissionem, sed discernunt
sensilia per emissionem; They receive the objects by immission, but they
discern them by emission, and looking on them; As the sight which we have is
not by emission, but by immission, receiving in the light. Secondly, all the
senses agree in this; that all receive singular things, and not universal.
Thirdly, unto every sense there is required a double nerve; the first to take
up the object without; the second works according as the mind works, and
directs the intention of the mind to the outward organ: as in seeing there are
two Nerves, one whereof makes the eye look from without, to the object: the
second Nerve is ruled according to the mind, and directs the intention of the
mind to the organ. Fourthly, in every sense there must be a proportion betwixt
the object and the sense, Quia in medijt delectantur, and in extremis
corrumpuntur, They are delighted in objects proportionable, but extremities
corrupt them; as if the object be too little, we cannot behold it, or if the
sound be too vehement, it spoils us of hearing. Fifthly, to perceive a thing
by sense, these things are requisite, the object must be present, but neither
too far, nor too near. Secondly, there must be a middle to carry the object
to the sense. Thirdly, the organ must be sound and whole. Fourthly, the mind
must be actually intended to the object.

As the senses agree in many things, Differuntsensus, object is and medijs.
so they differ in many things. First, in their objects, for every one has a
several object. Secondly, in their Media, middles, because the taste and the
touch have no inward mids; but seeing and hearing have an outward mids; as the
light, and the air. Thirdly, in their utilitie, for the taste is most
profitable, Ad conservationem individui, Vtilitate.
for the preservation of our persons; the touch again discerns heat and
cold, and other elementarie qualities: that the creature may eschew things
hurtful; and so it serves also, Ad conservationem speciei, For the
continuance of our kind; but seeing and hearing serve for our instructions.
Fourthly, they differ in generality, Generalitate.
because the touch is not determinate to one organ, Retentione.
(but is seated in all the members of the body) as the rest of the senses are.
Fifthly, they differ in retaining of their impressions, for the grossest senses
retain most strongly.

If we consider simply our Being, the touch is the most excellent sense, it
includes all the rest in it, and the privation of it, must be most hurtful
to us; but if we consider our Well-being, and comfortable life, then other
senses are more dear to us, as our seeing and hearing.

The touch in the beast, is the most excellent sense; for when a Dog senteth
after a Heart, it is only for the Touch, he delights not in the smell for it
self, as we do; to a natural man, Seeing is a more excellent sense than the
Hearing, it serves more to invention than Hearing, it takes up the object
farther off, than the rest of the senses do; it takes up the object presently,
which hearing does not so soon. The Midales whereby the eye sees, are far
purer than the mids, by which we hear; the eye more resembles the
understanding than the hearing does, Math. 6.23. If the eye be dark, how great
is the darkness of the body? Here is meant the blindness of the mind, as
well as the darkness of the body: the eye mooves the imagination more than
the hearing does, therefore to the natural man it must be the most excellent
sense; but to the child of God, hearing is the most excellent sense; For Faith
comes by hearing, Rome. 10.17.

The senses of man before the fall were servants to reason, A collation betwixt
the innocent and old Adam
and to the affections. But since the fall they labor to pervert the
affections, and to draw them from God: there is a fit allegory, wherein reason
is compared to a prudent mother; the affections to a young daughter, fit for
marriage; and the five senses to five Suitors, the sight is compared to a
Painter; the hearing to a Musician; the smell to an Apothecary; the taste to a
Cook; and the touch to a Bawd: and every one of those five Suitors come by
course to this young maid (the affections,) who gave her consent, and so did
her wiser mother reason also: till a King (who was God the Father) sent
Ambassadors (his Ministers) to speak for his Son Christ, with whom at last
the marriage is perfitted.

CHAP. IIII. Of the immortality of the Body.
Man's body before the fall was immortal.

A thing is said to be immortal. Essentially, thus God is only immortal, 1 Timothy 6.16. Secondly, Ex dono creationis, by creation, as the Angels and the
soul of man. Immortale multiplex, (...), ex dono creationis, ex hypothesi, ex
dono novaecreationis.
Thirdly, Ex hypothesi, by condition, as Adams body had been immortal, if he
had stood in Innocence. Fourthly, Ex dono novae creationis, by the
resurrection, as our bodies and the new Heavens shall last perpetually after
the resurrection.

The Physicians observed three estates in man. Cum plus accedit quam decedit,
when more nourishment remains with the body, than goes from the body; this
should have been in Adams posterity, if he had not fallen. The second estate
is (...), Cum quantum decedit per pugnam, nutritio tantum apponit; When as much
nourishment remains as decays. The third estate is (...), Declinans aetas,
Cibos assumimus, ut corruption quae posset accedere ex consumptione naturalis
humidi evitetur.
ubi accedit minus quam deficit, this is the decaying estate of man, when less
nourishment remains than decays; and this was not in Adam before his fall.

When we put water into wine, at the first the wine converts the water into
it; but put often water to it, then all turns to water. The body of man before
the fall should not have turned to corruption, but still should have turned the
nourishment to wholesome food. It is true, there was some contrariety here; for
otherways he could not have been nourished, but this was without the hurt of
the whole, which remained whole and perfect; so that his body should have been
aequivalenter incorruptibile, licet non videretur eadem numero materia. It
should still have remained that selfsame body, although in it there was some
alteration: for even as Theseus Ship, (after that he had scoured the Sea from
Pirates by her) they hung her up as a memorial to the posterity; and the
Athenians, Plutarchi Moral.
when any planke or board decayed in her, they put a new planke or board in
place of it; so that she was still eadem numero navis, that selfsame Ship
she was before. So should the body of man have been still the same body, by
supplying new and equal strength for that which failed.

The Church of Rome holds, The tenet of the Church of Rome, concerning the
immortality of the body.
that the body of man before the fall was mortal of it self, and that the
immortality of it, came only from without, from that supernatural
righteousness which God clothed Adam with, and that death is only but by
accident from sin, because it removes the bridle, original righteousness,
which held back death: and (they say) that the soul required a fit body to
exercise her functions; Bellarm. de grait. primi hominis, cap. 9.
but it could not have such a body, except made of contrary humors: hence it
received a body joined to it, by accident mortal; which defect (they say) is
supplied by that supernatural righteousness.

Again, they hold, that this necessity of death which was in nature before the
fall, is now turned since the fall into a punishment of sin. It was natural
before the fall (say they) for a woman to bear children, but after the fall it
was painful, and a punishment of sin. It was natural before the fall for
the Serpent to glide upon her belly, but after the fall, she was to glide with
pain upon her belly, this was the punishment of sin. So (say they) death was
natural to man before the fall in his Pure naturals, but now it is turned to
him unto punishment of sin; and as the beasts which sin not, yet die; so
should man in his Pure naturals, have died, although he had not sinned, if
supernatural righteousness had not restrained his death. In sensu coniuncto non
poterat mori, sed in sensu diviso poterat mori.


But we hold, that Adams body in his innocent estate, was naturally
incorruptible ex hypothesi; that is, so long as he stood in holiness, there
was such a harmony amongst the qualities of his body, that they could breed no
distemperature, or bring death to him; his body before the fall might have
died, but this power should never have been reduced into act, so long as he
obeyed his maker: but it is otherwise mortal now, for now of necessity he
must die; then it was in potentia remotissima, in a most remote power to death,
now it is in potentia propinqua, in a most near power: Angeli non poterant
mori, neque necesse erat eis mori: Ad^^^ poterat mori, sed non necesse erat ei
mori, sed Ada^^ corrupt, necesse est ei mori; The Angels could not die neither
was it necessary that they should die: Adam might die, but it was not necessary
that he should die: but Adam being corrupted it is necessary that he should
die.

Our reasons to prove the immortality of Adams body before the fall, are
these. Our reasons to prove that the body was naturally immortal, and not
supernaturally.


First, the soul desires naturally always to be in the body, therefore
naturally it might attain to this end; Aliquid est contra, aliquid praeter
naturam animae.
when the soul exists out of the body, est praeter naturam ejus, it is beside
the nature of the soul, although it be not contrary to it, therefore it must
naturally long to be in the body again. Esth. lib. 2. did. 19.
They answer, that the understanding creature desires naturally some things
which it cannot attain to but by supernatural means; as the souls of the
blessed naturally desire to be joined to their bodies again, yet they cannot
attain to this, but by a supernatural power, to wit, by the resurrection. So
(say they) the soul naturally desires the eternity of the body, although by
nature it cannot attain to it; but there must be some supernatural
righteousness, to cause it attain to this. Answer, The case is not alike,
after he has sinned, and before; for after he had sinned, and the soul
separate from the body, naturally it cannot be joined to it again, but by the
supernatural power of God; but before the fall, the soul should naturally
have attained to that desire, to have enjoyed an immortal body, for it had no
desire in it before the fall, which it should shun and flee, as repugnant to
the nature of it, to remain a little while in the body, and afterward to
remain still without the body. De summo bono, lib. 1. sect. 68.

Secundum vegetativam and sensitivam facultatem habuit actum naturalem, sed
secundum superiorem facultatem, habuit actum super naturalem.




Secondly, Lessius the Jesuit answers after this manner, that there are three
faculties in the soul; the vegetative, sensitive, and understanding faculty;
he says, that the soul should have had an inclination and desire to the body
naturally, according to the vegetative and sensitive faculties, but not
according to the understanding or supreme which required a supernatural power
to work this desire. The soul (says he) being satisfied in her natural
desires, in her vegetative and sensitive faculties, cannot long for those
again, by a supernatural desire; for it longs now, to be like the Angels of
God; neither marrying, nor giving in marriage, Matthew. 22.30. But supernaturally
in the estate of blessedness she desires such a body, which shall not hinder
the body to attain to her supreme and last end. Answer. It is true, that after
the fall, the vegetative and sensitive faculties hinder the intellectual
faculty to attain to the supreme end, God; but before the fall, and in the
conjunction of the soul with the body again, these inferior faculties were
subordinate, and shall be subordinate to the superior faculty, and did no
ways, hinder or shall hinder the superior faculty; therefore the soul
naturally before the fall desired, according to all those faculties, the
conjunction with the body, and so it shall in the resurrection. These be
Lessius words, Non abhorret a corpore nisi tale sit, quod libertati and
functioni intelligentiae officict; It abhorres not a body, but such a body
which hinders the liberty and function of the understanding. But so it was,
that the body of man was such before the fall; therefore the soul desires
naturally the conjunction with the body, in the estate, and likewise shall do
in the life to come.

Hence we may gather, shall enjoy a greater measure of blessedness, and joy,
then it did before, and that the body shall not be a hinderence to it, as it is
now; for now when it begins to think of God and spiritual things, it must be
abstract from the senses, as the Prophets had their heavenly visions
intellectual, and not by sense; but after the resurrection, the senses shall
not be a hinderance, but a furtherance to the soul.

Adam after his fall lived 930. years, Genesis 960. years, wanting this
supernatural, 1 righteousness, what made this? nothing but the relics of
that natural immortality, which was in man before the fall; Therefore it was
not supernatural righteousness that made him immortal.

God made the Israelits clothes last forty years in the Wilderness, Deuteronomy.
29.5. And Manna in the golden pot, Heb. 9.4. corruptible in it self, yet to
last so many hundred years. And if Joseph's bones lasted 215. years, Josh.
24.31. And if the Egyptians could embalme bodies artificially, that they could
continue without corruption, for so many hundred years; how much more could
God make Adams body to have continued without corruption naturally, if he had
stood in innocence?

The fourth reason is taken from the cause of death, Dominium peccati, the
dominion of sin. Secondly, Sensus peccati, the sense of sin. Thirdly,
Vltinum consequens peccati, the last consequent of sin upon his body, when it
is turned to dust. The dominion of sin, is taken away by regeneration; the
sense of sin is taken away by death; the last consequent of sin, when the
body is turned to ashes (the body all this time being neither Purum nor
impurum, but non purum) this is taken away by the resurrection. Corpus
consideratur ut est purum, impurum, non purum.
There was no dominion of sin in Adam before the fall, therefore he had no
need of regeneration; there was no sense of sin in him, therefore he could
not naturally die; the last consequent of sin was not in him, therefore his
body stood not in need of the resurrection.

Man before the fall, A collation betwixt the innocent and old Adam.
his body was immortal naturally; Christ the second Adam his body was mortal
willingly, but not necessarily, for he took our infirmities upon him, Esu. 53.
Ioh. 10. therefore Augustine says well, Traxit quidem mortalitatem sed non
contraxit, and non fuit necessitas in Christo respectu peccati, sed respectu
paenae He took our mortality upon him, but he contracted it not by sin:
there was no necessity whereby Christ should die in respect of sin, Triplex
necessitas, illata, innata, assumpta.
but in respect of the punishment. But man now necessarily dies, It is
appointed for all men to die, Est illata necessitas Adamo, est innata
necessitas nobis, and est assumpta necessitas in Christo: Necessity of death
was laid upon Adam for his sin; necessity of death is inbred in us; but
death was willingly assumed by Christ. But yet when he had once willingly taken
upon him our nature and infirmities; he must die; for it is appointed for all
who have taken our natural infirmities, to die. A man gives his word willingly
for such a sum for his friend, but when he has willingly given it, a
necessity is laid upon him to pay it. So Christ willingly took this debt upon
him, and now must of necessity pay it.

The first Adam before his fall, his body was immortal, A collation betwixt
the innocent, old, and glorified Adam.
Ex hypothesi, that is, if he had stood in obedience to God, there should have
been no contrariety betwixt the humors of his body to have bred corruption,
there should have been no deformity or defect in his body. But since the
fall, the body is a mortal body, a deformed body, and corruptible. 1
Immortalitatis sive impassibilitas. Duplex malum, actuale, and poientiale.
and all evil shall be removed from it, both actual and potentiall; there
shall be no actual evil, because grace being consummate in them, it excludes
all sin; there shall be no potentiall evil in them, because they being
confirmed in goodness, they cannot sin. Now the body in the life to come,
shall be fully subject to the soul, not only in respect of the being of it,
but also in respect of the actions and passions, the motions, and corporal
qualities of it; and then it shall be free from corruption both actual and
potentiall: it shall be free from actual corruption, because there shall be no
deformity or defect in it, and from potentiall corruption, because then they
can suffer nothing, that can be hurtful to them; therefore they shall be
impassible; When we say the bodies shall be impassible, we mean of the
hurtful passions that may hurt the body, but other ways the senses shall have
their comfortable passions from the objects; Passio sensus est perfectiva,
passio naturae est afflictiva vel corruptiva; The passion of the sense, perfits
the sense, (as Music does our hearing) but the passions of the nature
corrupts and afflicts nature, as sicknesses. We shall have small use of the
sense of touch in the life to come, which only serves for the continuation of
our kind and persons; this sense is common with the beasts; but the seeing and
hearing being more excellent senses, are more spiritual, receiving more
immaterially their objects: these senses shall remain, in the life to come,
and suffer by their objects, 1 Cor. Chap. 15. verse 42. The body is sown in
corruption, and is raised in incorruption.

Adams body before the fall was a glorious body, 2 Claritatis sive gloria.
but the body of man since the fall has lost that glorious beauty, and has
many blemishes in it. But the body in glory shall be most beautiful, having
the glory of the soul transparent in it: as we see the color of the Wine in
a glass; so the glory of the soul shall be seen in the body; this glory in
the body shall be a corporal glory, for this maxim holds, Omne receptum in
recipiente, est secundum modum recipentis and non recepti; Every thing
received, is in the thing receiving, according to the nature of the thing
receiving, and not of the thing received. So the body being a corporal thing,
receives the glory from the soul after a corporal manner. Triplex
pulchritudo, ex terna forma, procedens ab extrinseco, procedens ab intrinseco.
A body may be said to be beautiful three manner of ways. First, because of
the comely proportionable color of it; as Absolon was beautiful, this is a
natural beauty. Secondly, when the light from without does shine upon a clear
object, as the Sun upon a Looking glass, does cast a reflex. The third
arises from an internal light, as the light which is in the Sun or Stars;
The beauty which was in Adam before the fall, was that natural beauty arising
from the comeliness and proportion of his body, wherein he exceeded all the
sons of men; The beauty in Moses and Stephens face, was like the beauty of
the beams of the Sun reflex't back upon the glass. But the beauty of the
glorified bodies shall be like the beauty of the Sun and the Stars, not
from without, as the light of the glass, but from the own inward light: this
is the light that is spoken of Matthew. 13. The just shall shine as the Sun in
the Kingdom of my Father. Christ's glorious transfiguration, was a forerunner
of that glory that we shall have in heaven: We shall be made conformable to
his glorious body, 1 Ioh. 3.2. This glory in Christ's transfiguration, in
respect of the Essence, was all one with the glory in the life to come, but it
differs in measure from that measure which he has in heaven, because it was
not permanent, but only for a time, as the Sun inlightens the Air. Again,
in the transfiguration it was only in his face, but in glory it is through his
whole body, therefore the Apostle calls it His glorious body. 1 Cor. 15.
Thirdly, in the transfiguration his clothes were made white; but in glory his
body is not clothed, 1 Cor. Chap. 15. ver. 43. It is sown in dishonor, and
rises in glory.

Adams body before the fall, 3. Agilitatis.
for if Asahel was swift as a Roe, 2 Samuel 2. much more was Adams body. Man
since the fall, has a heavy and a lumpish body, unapt to execute the functions
of the soul; neither can it perform those actions which the soul requires of
it. But in glory, the soul having attained to the fullness of the desires of
it; the desires of the soul moving the body, the body must be most nimble to
obey. In the first Adam there was no resistance in the body to the soul, but
in the glorified Adam the soul shall communicate to the body such power, that
it shall be most ready to obey it. Besides the glory that shall redound from
the soul to the body, the soul and body both shall be replenished with the
Spirit of God, which shall make the bodies nimble and agile, and not heavy and
dull as they are now. One Egg before it is hatched, is heavy and sinketh down;
but when it is hatched, and full of spirits, then it flees: So these bodies
which are heavy and dull now, being then replenished with the Spirit of God,
shall be agile and nimble; therefore the Apostle says, We shall be taken up to
meet Christ, 1 Cor. 11. Our bodies then being agile, we shall shall meet
Christ in the Air, 1 Cor. 13.43. It is sown in weakness, and raised in power.

The first Adams body was a natural body, 4 Subtilitatis, sive spiritualitatis.
and was to be entertained by food as our bodies to preserve it from
corruption. The old Adams body, although it be entertained by food, yet cannot
be preserved from corruption. But the soul of the glorified Adam enjoying God,
adheres to him perfectly; therefore the body enjoying the soul, shall be
perfectly subject to the soul, and shall be participant of the souls
properties, so far as possible it can, having the vegetative and sensitive
faculty fully subject to the reasonable soul, Then the meat and drink of
the soul shall be, to do the will of the Father. Ioh. 4.34. And to live upon
that hid Manna, Rev. 2. The nature of every thing is more perfect, the more it
is subject to the form; but then the body shall be most perfect, and therefore
then most subject to the soul, 1 Cor. 15.44. It is sown a natural body, and
rises a spiritual body; It is called a spiritual body, not that it is turned
into a Spirit, but because it shall be altogether ruled by the Spirit.

CHAP. V. Of the perfection of Man's Body.
MAn was created a middle, betwixt the superior and inferior creatures.

There is life in Angel and Man, The Angels are ministering spirits for his
good, Psalm. 104 4. And no marvel that he is beloved of all these, seeing all
of these, in some sort, and every one of them, both earthly and heavenly things
do like him, because he is a middle in which both agree; and as the Jews
said, 2 Samuel 19.43. Have we not all a part in David the King? So all the
creatures say, Have we not all a part in Man?

There are three worlds, and man is the fourth. First, Quadruplex mundus,
elementaris, caelestis supermundanus, and microcos^^us.
the elementary world. Secondly, the celestial world. Thirdly, the angelical
or supercelestiall. Fourthly, the little world, Man. And those things which are
found in the inferior worlds, are likewise found in the superior; we have here
below the elementary fire, here it is, ignis urens, burning fire: This same
fire is in the heavens, and there it is ignis fovens and vivificans, it
quickens and nourishes all things. There is fire above in the celestial
spirits, and there it is, ignis ardens and amor Seraphicus, burning in love;
Man the fourth world has all these three sorts of fire in him. First, the
elementary fire, in the composition of his body of the four elements.
Secondly, the celestial fire, the influence of the Planets in him. Thirdly,
the supercelestiall fire, the love of God heating and burning within him, Luk
24. Did not our hearts burn within us.

God has joined all things in the world, per media, earth and the water by
slime; so the air and the water by vapors; the exhalations are a middle
betwixt the air and the fire; argilla, or marle, a middle betwixt slime and
stones; So the crystal betwixt water and the diamond; Mercury or Quicksilver,
betwixt water and metals; Pyrrhites the firestone or marcasie, betwixt stones
and metals; the coral betwixt roots and stones, which has both a root and
branches; Zoophita, or plants resembling living creatures (as the Mandrake
resembling a man, the herb called the scythyan lamb^; resembling a lamb) or
a middle betwixt animals and plants; So amphibia; as the Seal and such)
betwixt the beasts living on earth, and in the Sea; so Struthiocamelus, the
Ostrich betwixt fowls and beasts; So the fleeing fishes are a middle, betwixt
the fowls and the fishes; the batt betwixt creeping things and the fowls; the
hermaphrodite betwixt man and woman; the Ape betwixt a man and a beast, and man
betwixt the beast and Angels.

and when he lives here after he is borne, and when he lived under the
ceremonial Law.

In the mothers belly, embryo, this an imperfect child in the mothers belly;
after the seventh day till the fortieth day, then there is danger that she is
abhort; if she part not with this before the fortieth day, then it is faetus
vivens a living child, till the birth.

When the child is borne,

Answerable to these under the ceremonial law, Levit. 12.6.

CHAP. VI. Of the soul of Man.
THe soul of man is an immortal substance.

The opposition betwixt the life of the beast and the soul of man, That the
lives of beasts are mortal.
shows that the soul of man is immortal. First, the life of the beast is
mortal, and perishes with the body, operation in the sensitive faculty
without the organs of the body, but in the beast there is no operation found
above the sensitive faculty, for they neither understand nor reason, Psalm 32.9.
Be not like the horse or mule, in whom there is neither understanding nor
reason. That the beasts neither can understand nor reason, it is manifest thus,
because all beasts and fowls of the same kind work always alike, (being
moved only by nature, and not by art) as all the Swallows make their nests
alike, and all the Spiders weave their webs alike; therefore the beast can
work nothing without the organs of the body: whereupon it follows, that when
the body of the beast perishes, the life perishes also.

In every thing which may attain to any perfection, hic and nunc at this time,
and in this place; but their desire reaches not to perpetuity, for the beast
is not capable of perpetuity, therefore the life of the beast is mortal.

Delights perfect the operation, Levit. 17.11. The life of the beast is said to
be in the blood, which is not to be found so in the soul of man.

If the sense received things without a bodily organ,

The sense is corrupted by a vehement object, as the sight is dazzled,

Object. But it may be objected against this out of Act. 26.24. Too much
learning has made thee mad; then it may seem that the understanding is
dulled by learning, and not perfected.

Answ. when a man becomes mad through learning, it is not the understanding
simply that is mad, but the distraction is in the sensitive part arising from
the ill constitution of the body.

The souls of beasts are mortal, Plato and Pythagoras erred, who held that
they were immortal.

CHAP. VII. Of the Immortality of the Soul.
THat the Soul of man is immortal,

First, the Soul when it understands any thing, it abstracts from the things
which it understands, all quantity, quality, place and time, changing it into
a more immateriall and intelligible nature; which is universalitie, and loses
the particular and individual nature: as our stomachs when they receive
meat; change and alter the outward accidents of the nourishment to the own
nature, whereby it becomes flesh and blood. So the Soul when it conceives of
a thing, it separateth all these dregs of particular circumstances from the
body, and conceives it universally in the mind. When a man looks upon a
horse, he sees him of such quantity, of such a color, and in such a place;
but when he is conceived in the mind, then it is an universal notion
agreeing to all horses. As the thing conceived in the mind is not visible,
because it has no colors, it is not audible, because it has no sound, it
has no quantity, as big or little: So the soul it self must be of this
nature, without all these; quantity, quality, time, and place; and therefore
cannot be corruptible.

If the Soul were mortal, then it should follow, Naturanihil facit frustra,
Nature does nothing in vain; it should be in vain, if there were not
something to content it, which being not found upon earth, must be sought for
in heaven; therefore the soul is immortal. A sinful desire cannot be
fulfilled: as if one should desire to be an Angel; but natural desires, (as
the desire to be happy and to be free of misery) cannot be fulfilled in this
life; therefore it must be fulfilled in the life to come: naturally every man
desires to have a being after his body is dissolved; hence is that desire which
men have to leave a good name behind them, and so the desire that they have
that their posterity be well, and that their friends agree, and such: and from
this natural desire, come these ambitious desires in men who are desirous to
erect monuments and sepulchers after their death, and, to call their lands
after their name, Psalm. 49.12. So Absolon for a memorial of himself, set up a
pillar in the Kings dale, 2 Samuel 18.18. And the poorest tradesman has his
desire when he can reach no higher, he will have a stone laid upon him, whith
his mark and name upon it; this very ambitious desire in man is a testimony in
his mind that he acknowledges the immortality of the Soul.

Quest. Did. 44.9 2.
Scotus moves the question here, how shall we know that these natural desires
are agreeable to reason, and that they must be fulfilled because they are
natural.

Answ. He answers, that this desire of the immortality of the Soul is
natural, because it longs to have man a perfect man; for man is not a
perfect man, while he has a Soul and a Body joined together after they are
separate, so that this desire cannot be a sinful desire, because it is from
the God of nature. Things without life seek their preservation, secundum
numerum, in their own particular being, and resist those things which labor
to dissolve them; beasts again desire the continuance of their kind ut nunc,
only for the present, they desire not the continuance of their kind
perpetually; but man naturally desires esse absolutum suum, his perpetual
being, included within no bounds.

The Soul is no bodily thing, standing cannot be a Body, and consequently
mortal.

Object. But it may seem, that the Sun and fire which are bodies, may
multiply things to an infinite number; and therefore bodily things may have
power in infinite things, as well as intellectual.

Answ. The fire may consume singular things, by adding continual fuel to it;
it cannot consumere species rerum, the kinds of things. But this is the
perfection of the understanding, that it conceives not only singular things,
but also all kinds of things, and universal things, (that in a manner are
infinite) and so where the understanding receives these things, it is not
corrupted by them, neither corrupts them, but is perfected by them.

Every corruptible thing is subject to time and motion; Elisha when he was to
receive the illumination of prophecy, he called for a Minstrell, 2 King. 3.14.
to play sad music to settle his affections.

These things that are true, he finds the recompense of his losses. This
persuasion of immortality, made the heathen undergo death for the safety of
their country; and if our last end were only in this life, then all that we
do should be for this last end, to aim at it, to procure it, and never to
cross it: it were great madness in men, to undergo so many hard things as
they do, if they had not a persuasion in their hearts of this immortality, if
we hope only in this life, Then of all men we are most miserable, 1 Cor. 15.
and if the Soul were not immortal, Christ would never have commended him, who
hated his own Soul in this world, that he may gain it in the life to come.
Mark 8.35.

The Soul is immortal because God is just; Genesis 18.23. it behooveth him to
punish the wicked, and to reward the just; but if God did not this in another
life, he should never do it; for in this life, the wicked flourish, aad the
just are afflicted, Psalm. 37. therefore as God is just, there remains another
life; wherein the souls of the godly are rewarded for well-doing: the Prophet
says, Ier. 12. concerning every man's reward, O Lord thou art just when I plead
with thee, yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments, why does the way of
the wicked prosper, and why goes it well with them that do wickedly. To the
which objection he answers; (that he may defend the justice of God) Gather
them together as a flock to the sacrifice; whereby he signifies that after
this life, they shall smarte in the life to come, howsoever they have escaped
in this life. So Christ in the parable, Luk 16. brings in Abraham defending
the justice of God against the rich glutton, Matthew. 22. Verse. 32.33. God is the
God of the living and not the God of the dead. As Christ's proves out of this
place, the resurrection of the body; so hence is clearly proved the
immortality of the Soul: for when God makes a covenant with his own, it is a
perpetual covenant, therefore it is called a covenant of salt, to note the
perpetuity of it, Number. 18.19. If these with whom God makes his covenant existe
not, then the covenant must of necessity cease; but the covenant of God indures
for ever; therefore these with whom he makes the covenant must live for ever.
God calling himself the God of the Patriarchs after their death, Exodus 3.6.
then the souls must be immortal after the separation from the body.

It is said of Josias, although he was slain in the battle, He was gathered
in peace to his fathers, then he must be gathered to the spirits of his
fathers who enjoy peace, for he was not gathered in peace in his body; For he
was slain, 2 Chronicles. 35. it is said of Abraham only that he was gathered to
the body of Sarah, Genesis 25.10. but of the rest simply it is said, they were
gathered to their fathers; that is, their Souls were bound up in the bundle of
life, 2 Samuel 25.29. Which being well marked, is a good argument for the souls
immortality, and that it was known under the old Testament; by the fathers
here, are meant, the spirits of the just men made perfect, Heb. 12.23.

The heathen most of them were persuaded of the immortality of the Soul.
Cicero cited out of Socrates, Quest. 1. Tusc.
that the Swanne was dedicated to Apollo, because she sang sweetly before her
death, like the children of God, who sing sweetly before they dye; being
persuaded of this immortality, die pleasantly, singing their last most joyful
song. And the Romans when their great men died, and when their bodies were
burnt to ashes, they caused an Eagle flee and mount on high, to signify that
the soul was immortal, and perished not with the body.

Object. If the soul be immortal, how is it said to die:

Answ. The soul of man has a twofold life, one absolute, another relative.
The absolute or essential life of the soul is never loosed, Duplex vita,
absoluta and (...) seu relativa.
for the essence of the soul is Metaphysicall, having a beginning but no end,
having no corruption within it; the second sort of life which the soul has is
relative, having relation to God, and getting grace from him, this life may be
lost, for it is not of the essence of the soul; this last sort of life in the
soul, which to us is relative, to Christ is personal and cannot be lost.
Some perhaps may think that this distinction may be more shortly expressed,
and more plainly by the life of nature, and the life of grace: but they are
mistaken, for both these sorts of lives, as well essential as relative, were
natural to Adam before his fall.

Our souls are immortal substances, Chaldeans say, in eodem cretere
temperatas esse animas nostras cum coelestibus, our souls are tempered in the
same mortar with the heavenly spirits; therefore we should be their servants,
neither should we measure our condition by our weak bodies; but remember that
we have spirits only subject to him, who is the Lord of our Spirits, Revel.
22.6.

The soul is immortal; A collation betwixt the first Adam, and old Adam.
the Sadduces held, that the Soul was mortal, Act. 23.8. and they said, Let
us eat, let us drink, to morrow we shall die; and the Apostle, 1 Cor. 18, 23.
has it in the present tense, morimur, we die, to note the beastliness of
these wretches, who thought they should be quite extinguished, both in soul
and body presently, like beasts knocked on the head, and if any man ask them,
why then study you to keep the Commandments of God, seeing ye believe not
the immortality of the Soul? they answered, that it might go well with them
in this life; but men now, who profess the immortality of the soul, yet study
not to keep Gods Commandments, that it may go well with them in the life to
come. Augustine professed, if he were persuaded, that the soul were mortal,
then of all sects he would make choice to be an Epicurean.

CHAP. VIII. Of the conjunction of the Soul with the Body.
THe Soul is joined to the Body immediately.

The form is joined to the matter without any middle, but the Soul is the
form to the Body:

The Soul is joined to the body; Duplex inseparabilitas, logica and physica.
therefore there must be spirits without bodies. Secondly, those things that
are inseparable, the one cannot be found without the other, Inseparabile
logicum quod cogitatione potest separari tantum ut rifibil it as in homine.
Inseparabi^e physicum cum unum non dependeat ab alio necessario ut ^ gredo in
corvo.
but those things that are accidentally joined together, the one may be found
without the other, as whiteness and sweetness are but accidentally found in
Sugar, for whiteness may be found, where there is no sweetness; as in Snow; so
sweetness may be found where there is no whiteness, as in a Fig: therefore
sweetness and whiteness are but accidentally joined together in the Sugar; so
the body and the Spirit are but accidentally joined together; therefore there
are spirits that subsist by themselves without bodies.

Object. But how is the Soul joined accidentally to the body, seeing the soul
is the essential form to the body which animates it?

Answ. The soul, as the soul, is the essential form to the body, and so it
is inseparable, but the Soul as it is an intellectual Spirit is accidentally
joined to the boby, and may be separate from it.

Object. But it might seem that the Apostle puts the Spirit betwixt the soul
and body, as a middle to join them together, therefore the soul and body are
not joined immediately. 1 Thessalonians. 5.23. He prays, that God would sanctify them
in their Spirits, Soul, and Bodies.

Answ. By the Spirit is not meant here a third thing, which joins the soul
and body together; but by the Spirit he means the gift of sanctification,
which is through the whole man both in Soul and body opposite to the Old man,
Romans 7.

The soul is joined immediately to the body, Averrois erred, who held that the
fantasies or imaginations were a middle to join the soul and the body
together. So these who held that the soul was joined to the Body, by corporal
Spirits: and so these who held that they were joined together by light.

The soul being one, yet has three distinct Faculties, the Vegetative, and
Reasonable faculties.

In the conception the Vegetative and Sensitive faculties are vertually in the
seed, Anima vegetativa and sensitiva, est virtussemi nis, praeparans materiam
ad recipiendem formam intellectualem.
they give place, and it animates the body. Exodus 21.22. If two strive
together, if one of them strike a woman with child, that she part with her
child, and there be no hurt, neither to the mother nor to the child, then the
striker shall not die; but if there follow death of either of them, then the
striker shall die. If she part with the child before it be quick in her
belly, then she shall not die; but if it be a quick child, and she part
with it, then he shall die. Physicians and Canonists hold, that before the
forty days it is not a living child; it is then called Golem, Psalm. 139. verse.
16. Massa rudis, corpus imperfectum before the members be fashioned in it; The
seventie read these words, Exodus 21. verse. 22. (...), Non signatum; which
they refer to the imperfect child when the woman abhorts, and the Rabins call
it Asiman, which word they borrowed from the Greeks, as money not sealed or
stamped; therefore the Law says, Si exierint jeladebha, nati ejus, her sons
the Law then means of a perfect and a formed infant, when a reasonable soul
quickens it; Why should one give life for life, when as yet the life is not
perfect? Adams body perfectly fashioned, says Augustine, received life and not
before. So infants bodies perfectly fashioned receive the reasonable soul.

The soul is joined to the body to make up one person.

The soul is not in the body, Chalcidius held, determinate to one part of the
body, and from thence giving virtue and influence to the whole body; as the
spider dwelling in the middle of her Cob-web, feels the least touch in the
web, either within or without. Neither dwells the soul in the body as water
into a vessel; or as one liquor into another: or as the heat in the fire; but
as the morning light imparts the beams here and there, and in an instant does
unite her self to the transparent air, in all and every part thereof, still
resting whole when the air is divided, abiding pure when the air is
corrupted. So the soul fills the body, being all in all, and all in every
part; and as the Sun brings light from above, although we behold it in the
air; so the soul springs from eternal light, although she show her powers
in the body; and as the Sun in diverse places works diverse effects, here
Harvest, there Spring; here Evening, there Morning: so does the soul in our
little world work diversely, upon diverse objects, here she attracts, there
she decocts, here she quickens, there she makes to grow; the light shines by
it self, without the air, but not the air without the light: so the soul
lives by it self, but the body cannot live without the soul. But as in all
comparisons there is some dissimilitude, so it is here; for the light is but a
quality, but the Soul is a substance, the light comes from the substance of
the Sun, but the Soul is not of the Essence of God. This conjunction betwixt
the soul and the body is so near, that it makes up one Person, and this is
the reason, why the souls long for the bodies. Revel. 6.10. to be joined
again to them in the resurrection.

The soul was joined to the body to make up one Person, and absent from the
Lord, Cor. 6.

The Soul is appointed only to animate one Body.

The body of a flee must only have the life of a flee in it, Anima non est
unibilis omni corporised organino, and natural ad susceptionem corporis apto.
the Soul of a man cannot animate the body of an other Man, or an Elephant,
Materiae individuales ejusdem speciei sunt ita determinatae; ut nullam aliam
formam ejusdem speciei recipere possunt, that is, Every body of that same kind
is so determinate, that it cannot receive any other form of the same kind, but
the own.

The soul can animate no body but the own body of it: Pythagareans and the
Jews err, who held that the souls went from one body to another. Mark 6.16.

The soul was placed in the body,

There are two things required in a form. First,

Object. But seeing the soul is a spiritual thing, and the body corporal of
two different natures, how can they make up one person?

Answ. The more excellent that the form is, the more nearely it is joined to
the matter; and makes the nearer conjunction with it. So the soul of man
joined with his body makes a more stricter conjunction then the life of the
beast joined with his body. But if the body were of the same nature with the
soul, it should not make up one person, as the life of the beast joined with
the body makes not up one Person, because of the baseness of the form which
is only drawn out of the matter.

We believe that Christ took upon him the nature of Man, and therefore a
soul: Apollinaris was condemned for taking away of Christ's Soul, and putting
only his Divinity in place of a soul to rule the body.

There are some forms which rule only the body, but do not animate them, as
the Angels, when they took bodies upon them; Angelorum operationes in
corporibus non fuerunt vitales, Those things which the Angels did in the Bodies
were not vital; They ruled the bodies, but they informed them not; and they
only moved the bodies. Secondly, there are some forms that inform things,
but do not rule them, as the forms of things without life. Thirdly, there are
forms which inform and rule, as the Soul of man in the body.

Object. It is said that the Angels did eat and drink, Genesis 18. Therefore
they have exercised these vital functions in the body.

Answ. Theodoret answers, Metaphorice non proprie dicuntur edere: Atistot. 2.
de anim.
They are said to eat by way of metaphor, but not properly, because of the
manner of the true eating: and the Philosopher says, that, Vox est actus
animati corporis, The voice is the act of the living creature: but when a Lute
gives a sound, it is but metaphorically a voice (says he:) So the eating of
the Angels was but metaphorically a eating, for they eat not to digest, or to
nourish their bodies.

In this that the Soul is joined to the body as the form, David wondered at
the mervailous fashioning of the body in his mothers womb, Psalm. 139. much
more may we admire the mervailous conjunction of the Soul with the body, for
we may observe that the highest of the lowest kind, is joined always to the
lowest of the highest kind, as the lowest of living creatures (which have life)
is the shellfish; as the Oyster differs little from the life of the plant,
is comes nearer in order to the beast then the plant does, because it feels;
therefore it is well said by one, Tho. Aquin. contragent.
Sapientia Dei conjungit fines superiorum principijs inferiorum; the wisdom of
God has conjoined the ends of the superior with the beginning of the
inferior; as the shel-fish to be the basest amongst the sensitive, and more
noble then the vegetative. So the body of man is the most excellent and highest
in degree of the inferior creatures; the soul (again) of man is the lowest
of intellectual Spirits; mark the^ how these two are joined together. Therefore
fitly the soul of man has been compared by some to the horizon for as the
horizon separates the upper parts of the world from the nether, to our sight,
and yet the sphere is one; so does the soul separate the intellectual
substances from the earthly bodies: and yet is one with them both And as
Hercules was said to be Partim apud superos, partim apud inferos; so is the
Soul, partly with the Spirits above, and partly with the bodies below.

The body joined to the soul,

The Angels without bodies are spiritus completi; Non quibus juventur, sed
quibus invent: Not that they were helped by these bodies, but that they might
help us. They have a double action, one of contemplation, another of
ministry; for contemplation, to behold the face of God continually, Matthew.
18.10. They took not bodies upon them; but only for the ministry to us; but
the soul of man is an incompleate Spirit, without the body.

The soul was joined to the body,

When water and oil are put together,

The Soul has sundry operations in the body.

When it grows; anima; when it contemplates, Anima est simplex in essentis
and multiplex in potentia.
it is called a spirit; when it sees and hears, it is called sense; when it
is wise, it is called animus; when it discernes, it is called reason; when it
remembers, it is called memory; when it assents lightly, it is called opinion:
when she defines a truth by certain principles, then it is called judgment.

God has wisely placed the faculties of the Soul and the Body.

He has placed the intellectual faculty in the Brain, affections in the
Heart, the natural part in the Liver and Stomach: he has placed the
understanding in the Head, as in the throane; in the Heart as in the chamber:
but the rest of the inferior faculties he has placed below, as it were in the
Kitchen: and as it were an unseemely thing for a Prince to be sitting in the
Kitchen, and never to mind matters of estate: so it is a base thing for the
soul to have mind of nothing but of eating and drinking, and to choose Martha
her part, but never Mary's, Luke 10.42.

Man before his fall lived the life of God, A collation betwixt the innocent
and old Adam
but since the fall he lives only the natural life, and few live the life of
grace. There is so little life in the shellfish, that we cannot tell whether
they live the life of the plant or the sensitive life. So the life of God is so
weak in many men, that we cannot tell whether it be the natural life or the
spiritual life which they live. Zeuzes the Painter painted grapes so lively,
that he deceived the birds, and made them come fleeing to them. Dedalus made
(...), images mooving by themselves, he made men believe that they were
living; but Pygmaleon made an image so lively, that he fell in love with it
himself. So hypocrites which live only the life of Nature, they will so
counterfeit the actions of the faithful, that they make men believe indeed
that they live the life of God; and some times they deceive themselves,
thinking that they are living when they indeed are dead: the quickening power
of the soul desires only being, and so it rests: the sense would not only
be, but also be well: but the understanding aspires above all these to
eternal bliss: these three powers make three sorts of men, for some like
plants do fill their veins only, some again do take their senses pleasure
like beasts only, and some do contemplate like Angels: therefore the Poets in
their fables do feign, that some were turned into flowers, others into beasts,
and others, into gods.

CHAP. IIII. Of the end of Man's Creation.
MAn was created to serve God.

A circle is more perfect than a line, Duplex est motus, rectus and circularis.
never returning to the place from whence it began. Man and Angels return
back to God who made them, like a circle, but the beasts are like a line going
strait forward, never looking back to God again, who made them. It is true,
some make the circle of a small circumference, and return to God soon after
they came forth from him; others again make it as large as the world, and run
through all things, seeking blessedness, but finding none, after a large and
wearisome compass, they return to their maker at last, as Solomon did when he
had proved all vanities. But the most part are like the beasts, coming from
God as a straight line, but never return back to him again, and therefore
are miserable eternally. The beasts content themselves with their own proper
objects, never looking to God.

Therefore when beasts in the Scriptures are brought in praising God, Psalm 148.
It is only to stir up man that he may praise God.

All the creatures in some sort return to God,

Man before his fall was directly carried to the right end; A collation betwixt
the innocent and old Adam
but since the fall other visible creatures are carried to their proper ends:
but man now neglects his proper end, wherefore he was created, and is led
forward by the inventions of his own heart.

So much of the Soul and body of man, and their threefold estate, in Creation,
Fall, and Restoration: we come to the Image of God, by which he comes to be
participant of the nature of God.

CHAP. X. Of the Image of God in Man.
MAn in his Creation was made in holiness, Image of God, and to bear rule
over the rest of the visible creatures.

God has an essential Image, personal Image; his essential Image is
holiness and righteousness, common to all the three persons; his personal
Image, is Jesus Christ: When Man is said to be made to the Image of God, Duplex
imago, essentialis, and persenalis.
he is to be understood to be made according to the essential Image, and not
to his Personal Image: for if it were meant of his Personal Image, then as
Augustine marks well, he would have said, Let us make Man to my Image and not
to our Image; But Man being restored to the Image of God again, is restored
both to the essential Image, and is confirmed to the Image of his Son Christ
Jesus, Romans 8. Those whom he foreknew, he predestined to be made like to the
Image of his Son.

The similitude of one thing is found in another two manner of ways. First,
Duplex est similitudo, secundum naturam and in cognitione.
when one thing is like to another in nature; as when the fire burns the wood,
the heat in the wood is like in essence with the heat in the fire. Secondly,
one thing is like to another in knowledge and understanding, as when we feel
or see the fire burning. Now the goodness of God is communicated to his
creatures, not only by the giving them being, but also in giving them holy
knowledge in some measure like unto himself, and in this principally consists
the image of God.

There is a twofold similitude; the first is natural, representation; Duplex
est similitudo, naturalis, and repraesen ativ^.

Duplex est similitudo naturalis perfecta aut imperfecta seu analogica.


the natural similitude is when one thing is like to another by nature, as one
egg is like another: and this is twofold; either perfect or imperfect; perfect
as betwixt these things that are of the same kind, as the Son is the perfect
Image of the Father, 2 Cor. 4.4. Imperfect is that which is somewhat like in
nature, and by way of Analogy to that which is perfect, as created wisdom in
Man has some Analogy with the increated wisdom in God, Coloss. Duplex
similitudo, repraesentativa, objectiva, and formalis.
3.10. A similitude by representation, is when things are represented to the
mind, and this representation is either objective or formal. Objective when
one makes a similitude, according to the pattern which he has before his
eyes; and this is seen in artificial things, as when Ahaz, 2 King. 16. made
an Altar, according to the pattern of the Altar which he saw at Damascus. A
formal representation of a similitude is, when the mind forms the similitude
of a thing; and this kind of similitude in the mind, is more abstractive and
perfect then the former; and the objective depends upon this, for every
external representation, proceeds from a formal and inward representation in
the mind, as when they made the golden Calfe, Exodus 32. First, they carried
the formal representation of this Calfe with them out of Egypt; and they made
the objective similitude of it in the wilderness. So when Moses received the
pattern of the Tabernacle from God on the mount he kept the formal
representation of it in his mind: but when he erected it and set it up
according to the pattern, Exodus 39.42. this was the objective representation.
Now when it is said, that man was made according to the Image of God, Genesis 2.
It is not to be understood that he was made according to the perfect Image of
God, for Christ is only the perfect natural Image of the Father, Heb. 1. but
he was made to his Image by way of Analogy, not expressing his Image fully and
naturally. Man was not made to the Image of God objective, because God had no
pattern without himself to make him by; he was made to the Image of God
formally, when he was made to the exemplar that was in the mind of God.

A similitude differs much from an Image.

An egg is like to another egg, Vt aliquid fit imago rei tria requiruntur, 1.
ut sit simile, 1. ut procedat inde aut naturaliter aut artificialiter.
for that which is the Image of a thing; first, it must be like it; secondly,
it must be from it, either naturally, as the reflex of the countenance in the
glass; or artificially, as the seal in the wax from the seal it self. When
it is the image of a thing made by Art, 3. ut illud ipsum ad vivum representet.
In imagine sunt exemplar and exemplatum, 2. naturaliter repres^ntat, 3.
particulariter.
it represents not the thing artificially, but naturally; for the image of
Caesar is not ex instituto, the image of Caesar, at the appointment or pleasure
of the Painter; for then any sign which the Painter should make; should be
the image of Caesar; but Art must imitate nature as near as she can: so that
the image is the image in so far, as it naturally represents. Thirdly, it
must represent in particular the thing it self.

There are four ways to take up the Image of God in man. First, we know a man
in vestigio, Quatuor modis, deum cognoscimus, 1 In vestigio 2. in umbra, 3. in
speculo, 4. in filio.
by the print of his foot; Secondly, we know him, in umbra, by his shadow;
Thirdly, we know, in speculo, in a glass; Fourthly, we know him, in filio,
in his Son. We know a man in vestigio, by the print of his foot, Speciem
hic cognoscimus sed non individuum. We know that a man has been there and
not a beast, but we know not this or that man by the print of the foot. We
know a man, in umbra, by his shadow; here we take up somewhat more of man then
he did by the print of his foot, as we know it is the shadow of a man, and
besides this, his quality how tall he is, but we know not in particular by
the shadow this or that man. The creatures they are but the shadow of God, they
demonstrate to us that there is a God, and they show to us his greatness and
power but no more. We know a man in speculo, in a glass, when we see the
image of his face in a glass, here we discern and know him more
particularly. Man in his first Creation was like to this image: When we see a
man's son that is begotten of his Father, that is the most lively
representation of a man, when he presents his person, manners and all, and so
Christ is the personal and natural image of the Father: and man renewed, is
the image of Christ.

Man was made in holiness to the Image of God; Anthropomorphitae (who thought
man was made to the Image of God according to his Body, Epith. haeres. 70.
thinking that God had had also a Body) were in a gross error; for when as in
the Scripture there are feet, hands, and eyes, attributed to God, it is but by
way of metaphore or borrowed speech; otherwise as Theodoret marketh well, we
should be forced to ascribe a monstrous body to God because he is said to
have wings, to have pens, Psalm. 18. and to have seven eyes, Zach. 4.

The Image of God is not properly in the body but by reflex, Hieron. Oleaster.
in Genesis 1.
therefore these also are mistaken who think that God in the Creation took
upon him the visible shape of a Man, and according to that shape made Man, for
man was made according to the image of God in the Soul, and not according to
the shape of his Body.

These who think that man was made to the image of God (that is, Virgin Mary)
err also, for God says not, Let us make man to thy Image, but, to our Image.
Secondly the Son of God according to his humane nature, is said rather to be
made according to the likeness of other men, Phil. 2.7. It is true that by
grace these whom he foreknew he predistinate to be like the Image of his Son,
Romans 8.

Adam when he was made to the Image of God in his first Creation, A collation
betwixt the innocent, old, and renewed Adam.
was like to the Moon in the full; Man fallen, before regeneration is like the
Moon in the conjunction, altogether obscured by the Sun, the Image of God
then is defaced and blotted out in man by sin: the image of God in Man
restored, is like the Moon waxing and growing by degrees till she come to her
perfection. But as in every similitude there is some dissimilitude, so it is
here, for when the Moon is in the conjunction she is nearest to the Sun,
her light and life, and is more illuminate by his beams, than in the
opposition, although it seem not so to us; and therefore the Church is well
compared in her perfection, to the Moon in her conjunction. Again, the
dissimilitude would be marked, because the Moon in her fullness is in
opposition, furthest from the Sun; but the Church in her Plenilunio of grace,
she is nearest the Sun of righteousness. The Moon in her conjunction is
nearest to the Sun; but the Church in her conjunction being darkened by
sin, is farthest from her Spouse the Son of righteousness.

The first Adam was made a living Soul, A collation betwixt the Innocent and
second Adam.
but the second Adam was made a quickening spirit, 1 Cor. 15. that is, the first
Adam in his Creation could have begotten children to his own image, in
holiness and righteousness; but could not have given them perseverance, and
continuance in grace; but the second Adam, that quickening spirit; as he begets
children to his own image, so he gives them perseverance in grace, that they
fall not away again.

Of this we may gather, if Adam had not sinned, Adam had not this gift of
confirmation to continue; therefore he could not propagate this to his
children, Effectus non potest esse perfectior causa, For the effect cannot be
more perfect than the cause.

The Image of God consisted in perfect holiness and knowledge.

Man was not to grow in holiness, as he was to grow in knowledge; for he was
fully holy, A collation betwixt the innocent, second, and renewed Adam.


The first, Adam was holy, (...), fully; but not (...), he had not the gift of
confirmation in holiness, to make him continue to the end. Jesus Christ the
second Adam was holy (...), he was full of grace and holiness, and could not
fall from his holiness: but the renewed Adam is holy, (...), he is but
renewed in holiness in part, and through Christ he cannot fall from his
holiness.

CHAP. XI. Of the knowledge of Adam in his first creation.
THis Image of God made Adam to have perfect knowledge both of God and his
creatures.

There is a perfection in parts,

His knowledge was obscure,

The Image of God in Adam was either inward or outward, his inward Image was
either in his understanding, will, and affections or passions. His outward
Image was in his dominion over the creatures (spoken of in the second part.) In
his understanding consisted his knowledge.

Adam had knowledge both of God, and of his creatures; his knowledge of God was
either his inbred knowledge which was natural, or his acquired knowledge, by
the creature; or his revealed knowledge, either of God or of his creatures: of
every one of these in order, and first of Adams inbred knowledge.

CHAP. XII. Of Adams inbred knowledge of God.
MAn before his fall,

As light is the first object of the eye, and not the light of the Sun or
Candle.

The principles of things, Principia de deo velsunt per se nota vel secundum
nos.
are either manifest in themselves only, or, they are manifest to us; that
there is a God, is a principle manifest in it self, because there is no need
of a middle to prove it. But it is not a principle known in it self to us,
because we must use middles, that this principles may be stirred up in us.

The first principles which we have of God, are naturally inbred within us;
Principia de Deo, and principia scientiarum ex opposito differunt; cognoscimus
deum per extromissionem, cognoscimus scientias per intromissionem. The
knowledge of God we have it by extromission; but the knowledge of the first
principles we have by intermission. The understanding at the first is void of
all forms, yet it is capable of all forms; as the eye being void of all
colors, yet is capable of all colors; Duplex est intellectus, agens, and
possbilis.
the way how the understanding receives these forms into it is thus, the sense
lets in the particular objects to the imagination where they are more refined,
than they were in the sense; and by the light of the intellectual agent, the
possible faculty now actually understands. As the woman in the Gospel who lost
her groat, could not have found it again until the candle was lighted: so
this possble power in the understanding, could receive no objects from the
imagination, unless this light intervened, and thus the first principles of
sciences are bred in the mind; For if I had never seen with my eyes, totum,
the whole, I could never lay up this first principle in my mind, that, the
whole is more than the parts. So that all this knowledge comes from the sense
first, and that maxim holds true, Quicquidest in intellectu, prius fuerat in
sensu.

Object. (...).
If all our knowledge comes from the senses, how are these principles said to
be naturally in man.

Answ. They are said to be naturally in him, because they are framed in the
mind, without any reasoning or discourse; but the conclusions drawn from
these, are made up by discourse, and are not alike amongst all men, as the
first principles are.

Ob. If all our knowledge of things come by the sense, how is it then that the
man in the Gospel, who was borne blind, when he began to see, said that, he saw
men walking a far off like trees, Matthew. 8.24. If he had not had some notion
of trees in his mind without help of the senses, how could he compare men to
trees?

Answ. This notion which he had of trees was by other senses, as by feeling and
hearing; but if he had been both deaf and blind, etc. He could have had no
notion of trees, as no blind man can judge of colors.

The principles of sciences, Plato, Origin, and Averrois, erred who held that
the souls were from eternal, and the principles of all sciences, were from
all eternity, inbred with them; and to learn was only to remember, and an
actual knowledge of those imprinted notions. This comparison then, cleares not
the purpose well, if a master were to seek his fugitive servant in a
multitude, it were in vain for him to seek him, unless he had some
pre-notions of him, in his shape and favor; or carried some picture drawn by
others. So unless something were drawn within us, we could never take up
those things without; but there is no such principles drawn in our mind at
the first, until they be formed out of the imagination, and laid up in the
mind; and by these we may enquire, after that which we understand not.

We understand nothing by intromission through the senses to the
understanding; then Adams knowledge which he had of all the creatures when he
awaked out of his sleep, was an extraordinary infused knowledge, and was not
natural to him: But the first knowledge of God, is inbred with us, and is
enlightened with that first light, which enlightens all men coming in to the
world, Ioh. 1.9.

This inbred knowledge, A collation betwixt the innocent and old Adam.
which man had of God before the fall, is most obscure now since the fall; as
he who writes with the juice of an onyon, the letters can not be read at the
first, unless the paper be holden to the fire to dry the letters, and then
they appear legible. So this is written with the point of a diamont (as it
were) in the hearts of all men, Romans 1.20. deum negarunt, non ex habitu
naturae, sed ex affectu malitiae.
that (there is God) although they cannot read it at the first, until they
begin to consider the creatures more nearely, and to waken that which is
lurking within them; The Poets say, that Oedipus knew that he had a father,
but he knew not, that Laius was his father; So man by nature knows that
there is a God, but he knows not the true God.

Quest. Whether is this imbred knowledge which we have of God; or the knowledge
which he have of him by the creatures more clear?

Answ. Duplex est universale, confusum and abstractum
This inbred knowledge is more obscure, than the knowledge which we get by
creatures. The first sort of knowledge which we have of God now, is universale
confusum. Example, when we behold a man a far off: first, we take him up to
be a creature, then we take him up to be a living creature, and then to be a
man, and at last to be Peter or John: here we proceed, from the universal to
the particular, from that which is confused, to that which is more clear and
distinct. So the first sight, which our mind does get of God now, is but an
obscure and confused fight, as that which the Athenians had of God, Act. 17.
When they worshipped the unknown God; so that of the Samaritans, Ioh.
Coguoscimus particularia per sensum, ut universalia per intellectum.
4. They worshipped they knew not what. Then we are led by the creatures some
what more clearly to take them up, which is called universale abstractum. So
first we learn particular things by sense, and then universal things by our
understanding; The Philosophers found out a sort of reasoning by induction,
ascending from the particulars to the general, as Socrates is a living
creature; therefore all men are living creatures; Plato is a living creature,
therefore all men are living creatures. Here we go from the particular to the
general, Duplex ordo, inventionis, and auscultattonis.
and so we proceed thus from the creatures to take up what God is. There is a
twofold order in discipline; first, the order of invention, as those who find
out Arts, begin at those things that are most known to our sense, and most
familiar to them; the second is the order of hearing, Fonseca. lib. 2 q 2 S. 8.
as when a master proceeds in teaching his scholars from the cause to the
effect. In the first, Ordo compositionis and resolutionis, seu ab universali,
ad particulare, and contra.
we proceed from the compounds to the simple, from the particulars to the
general; but in the last, we proceed from the simple to the compound, and
from the universal to the particular; in the first we compound, in the second
we divide. When we learn by the creatures to take up God, it is ordo
inventionis; but when God teaches us in his school, and instructs us by the
ear, this is a more perfect kind of learning, this is called ordo
auscultationis.

Man by nature, Romans 1.18.

First, they found out Physic, necessity bred this; then they found out
moral Philosophy, Necessitas peperit Physicam, civilitas, moralem
philosophiam; delectatio, mythologiam. Triplex mythologia, physica, moralis,
and theologica.
civilitie bred this; then they found out Mythologie or fabulous theology, and
delight bred this. This Mythologie again, they divided three manner of ways,
first, Physically, as Homer brings in the gods fighting, thereby he meant the
fighting of the Elements, winds and rain. Secondly, morally when they placed,
Virgo Iustitia the daughter of Jupiter betwixt Leo and libra; they signified
that Justice had a hand both in fortitude and equity. Thirdly, Theologically,
as Jupiter begat Venus upon the froth of the Sea; whereby they signified, when
the gods begat any good motions in the hearts of men, there is nothing but
vacuitie and froth in them, no preparation nor disposition to goodness; but
the knowledge of God is more and more obscured in Man since the fall.

CHAP. XIII Of Adams acquired knowledge of God by the creatures.
Man before his fall, Per viam negationis, Tribus modis pervenitur ad
cognitionem Dei. 1. per viam negationis.
the Scriptures proceed thus in discribing God, as, God cannot deny himself,
2 Timothy 2.13. God dwells not in houses made with hands, Act. 17. God neither
sleeps nor slumbers, Psa. 121.4. Here we proceed as the carver of an image
does, he cuts off this and this, to make it thus: and for this purpose they
apply that of Seneca, Deus est id quod vides, and quod uon vides; God is that
which thou see, and which thou see not; by affirmation we know what a thing
is, and how it is distinguished from other things; but when we proceed by way
of denial, we distinguish a thing from other things, but know not what it is.
Anselmus shows this way of negation very excellently; Circumspicit anima mea,
and non videt pulchritudinem tuam; auscultat and non audit harmoniam tuam;
olfacit and non percipit ordorem tuum, palpat and non sentit levitatem tuam,
habes enim haec in te domine Deus, modo ineffabili: that is, My soul looks
round about and sees not thy beauty, it hearkneth, and hears not thy harmony,
it smells but smells not thy savor, it seeles but feels not thy lightness, for
thou have these things in thee O Lord after an inspeakeable manner.

But here we must mark that we must not still proceed in denial, for then
our minds would evanish to nothing; but at last we must rest in some positive
thing, which carries some resemblance of God; he is not a body, because a body
is composed, he is not like to other Spirits mutable: but a Spirit immutable,
most simple, and of himself. 2. perviam eminentiae.


Secondly, we proceed, per viam eminentiae, good and evil are said to be
comparatively with that which is best; amongst the creatures a Body is good, a
Spirit is better, which notwithstanding has not his goodness of himself;
therefore he must have it of him, who is absolutely good; The Scriptures teach
us how to take up God thus, the excellent things, it calls them Gods things or
belonging to God; as high mountains it calls them Gods mountains, Number. 10.33.
tall Cedars it calls them, Gods Cedars, Psalm. 80.11. great wrestlings it calls
them Gods wrestlings, Genesis 30.8. So it is said, Ninive was great to God, that
is, very great. Jonas 3.3. So, Moses was fair to God; that is, very fair,
Act. 7.20. So when the Scripture will express great things, it compounds them
with the name of God, Iah, so with the name of God, El, 2 Samuel 23.20. Arriel,
that is, as ye would say, A very strong Lion, to teach us that when we see any
excellent thing in the creatures, we should elevate our minds to the infinite
beauty and greatness which is in God, Genesis 33.10. therefore Jacob when he saw
Esaus loving countenance, it was as though he had seen the face of God. Cant.
8.6. Flamma Iah.


When the beams of the Sun strike upon a watery cloud, the beams are
reflected back again to the Sun, and leave behind them in appearance to our
sight imaginary colors, which is the Rainebow. All the creatures should be
reflexed back again to God; the beauty in the creatures is but a shadow,
until we come back to the beauty in God; and as we count little children
foolish, who come to catch the Rainbow by the two ends, so are they foolish who
are bewitched with the beauty in the creatures, and ascend not to the beauty in
God.

Thirdly, 3. Per viam causationis.
we proceed to take up God, Per viam causationis, from the effects to take up
the cause; as first, to that first matter, which the Philosophers call Materia
prima, or that Tohu vabohu, void of all form, Genesis 1. Secondly to the
Elements; thirdly, to that which is composed of two of the Elements, as the
vapors of Water and Air, the exhalations of Air and Fire. Fourthly, to those
that are made of three Elements, as the meteors. Fifthly, to those that are made
of all the Elements, as the inferior creatures. Sixthly, to those that have
vegetative life only, as Plants and Herbs. Seventhly, to those that have
sense, as the Beasts. Eighthly, to those who have reason, as men. Ninthly, to
those that are intellectual Spirits, as the Angels. Lastly, to God himself.
Thus we proceed from the lower step of Jacobs ladder, Genesis 28.12. and ascend
up to God himself.

There are three sorts of causes, Triplex causa, particularis, universalis, and
supereminens.
and the supereminent cause. Adam could not be led by the effect, to take up
the particular cause; as here is an Image; therefore Polycletus made it; here
is a Picture; therefore Apelles painted it. Secondly, from the effect, he could
not be led, to take up the universal cause alone; as, here is a man, therefore
the Sun has begotten him; but this, here is a man, therefore the Sun has
furthered his generation; Nam sol and homo generant hominem; the Sun and a
Man beget a Man; But from the effect he was led to take up the supereminent
cause, as here is a world, therefore God has made it.

Man before the fall, A collation betwixt the Innocent and old Adam.
could clearly make up this conclusion; here is a world, therefore God has
made it, but since the fall he makes not this conclusion clearly, for the
greatest Philosophers thought the world to be eternal with God, and here they
stuck as mice in pitch.

There is a twofold disposition of the causes of all things in their
operations; Series causarum, Duplex processus causarum, inserie, and in circulo.
an order of causes, and circulus causarum, a circle of causes, Hos. 2.21. I
will hear the Heavens, and the heavens shall hear the earth, and the earth
shall hear the corn and the wine, and they shall hear Israel, this is series
causarum. Secondly, this is the circle of causes, as dew breeds clouds,
clouds breeds rain, rain breeds deaw, and so about again, 2 Pet. 4.4. This
year as the last year, all things continue alike since the beginning: from
the effects here we may be led to take up the first cause, and so ascend to God.

Man before the fall went by the order of causes, A collation betwixt the
innocent and old Adam.
either from the cause to the effect, or from the effect to the cause. From the
cause to the effect; God must hear the Heavens, that the Heavens may hear the
Faith, and the Earth must hear the Corn and Wine, that they may hear Israel.
Duplex ordo in cognitione rerum; (...) and (...).
From the effects to the cause, as the Wine and the Corn hear Israel,
therefore the Earth has heard the Corn and Wine, and the Heavens have heard
the Earth, and God has heard the Heavens. But Man after his fall goes like a
blind horse in the milne, round about in the circle of second causes, Psalm.
12.9. Impij ambulant in circuitu, and never elevate their mind to the first
cause God.

Adam before his fall,

We see three ways. First, (...),

Man before the fall saw straight out, A collation betwixt the innocent and old
Adam.
beholding God; but now he looks downward only; now he is (...), 2 Pet.
Chap. 1. Verse. 9. A pur-blind Man sees nothing but that which is hard before
him.

Object. The effects cannot demonstrate the cause, unless they be proportioned
to the cause, but there is no proportion betwixt the creatures and God;
therefore no creature can show that there is a God.

Answ. We may demonstrate that there is a God by his creatures, although we
cannot have a perfect knowledge of him by them.

We ascend by degrees to the knowledge of God.

First, Gradus perveniendi ad visionem Dei sunt hi. 1. in creaturis 2. vifibili
signo 3. in umbris 4. in carne 5. per fidem 6. in gloria.
we see him in his creatures: Secondly, by some vifible sign; as Esaias saw
him, Esa. 6. In creata gloria? Thirdly, in umbris, as the Jews saw him:
Fourthly, in carne, as the Apostle saw him: Fifthly, per fidem, as the
believers see him: Sixthly, in gloria, as the glorified see him. A dam had a
more clear sight of God than that which he had by the creatures; he had a
more clear sight than that which Esaias had; he had a more clear sight than
that which the Jews had, he had a more clear sight than that which is by
Faith: but he had not so clear a sight, as the glorified have in heaven of God.

The knowledge which man has by the creatures shall evanish in the life to
come.

1 Cor. 13.10. Prophecy and knowledge shall be abolished in the life to come;
because of their imperfection; this imperfection the Apostle noted in these
words, 1 Cor. 12.9. We know in part, and we prophecy in part, we know in part
by the creatures, and so we apprehend. So we know imperfectly by prophecy, 1
Cor. 13. by (...) here the Apostle understands that knowledge which we have of
God by the creatures, Romans hap. 1. Verse 19. (...), that is, which we
naturally know of God by the creatures: and by prophecy here, he means, not
only the foretelling of things to come, but also the interpretation of the
Scriptures, 1 Cor. 14. but when that which is perfect shall come, both these
sorts of imperfect knowledge shall be abolished; this the Apostle declares by
the example of little children, 1 Cor. 13.11. whose knowledge grows daily by
experience, then their former weak knowledge is abolished. So he declares this
by the similitude of a glass, Duplex speculum, scripturarum, and naturae.
and of a dark speech, Verse. 12. There is a twofold glass by the which we
know God; the first, is the Scriptures; the second, is the book of nature; but
by both these we get but an obscure sort of knowledge of God; and as in an
enigmaticall or dark speech we apprehend certain signs, but we come not to
the full meaning of the things signified, as Sampson proposed to the Philistims
this Riddle, Out of the eater came meat, and out of the bitter came sweet,
Judge. 14.15. The Philistims could understand, what was bitter, and what was
sweet; but they could not understand the meaning of the Riddle. So it is but an
obscure sight we get here and enigmaticall, comparing it with the sight which
we shall have of God, in the life to come.

A greater light obscures always the lesser, Moon gives no shadow when the
Sun shines; but she casts a shadow when the Sun shines not; So the
Planet Venus casts no shadow when the Moon shines, but she casts a
shadow when the Moon shines not; Here the greater light, obscureth always
the lesser. So in the life to come, the glory that shall be there, shall
obscure all the light that we get by the creatures now; for if it shall
abolish the preaching of the Law and the Gospel, and the knowledge that we get
thereby, 1 Corin. Then he shall give up the Kingdom to the Father; What
Kingdom? his personal Kingdom (preaching of the Word, administering of the
Sacraments such;) if that knowledge shall cease in the life to come, why shall
not the knowledge which we get by the creatures cease.

In a dim light we can perceive a thing which a greater light does obscure,
Adam had by the voice of God, and that (...), the sight of God which he saw,
obscured not the knowledge which he had by the creatures. But in the life to
come, the bright light in glory shall obscure both.

The sight which we have now of God, Adam had in his estate of innocence.

When we look upon a thing by two media middles, Duo sunt media, propinquius,
and remotius eaque vel obscura vet clara.
and the furthest or remotest middle, be thicker or more obscure, then things
appear more clear and evident unto us; but if the nearest middle be obscure
and gross, and the remotest clearer, then things appear less to us. A man
when he beholds a Fish in the water, he sees her by two middles. First, by
the Air the clearer middle, therefore the Fish seems greater to him and
nearer: but the Fish being in the water, and beholding a man upon the bank:
(first through the water the grosser middle, and then through the air the
clearer middle) the man standing upon the bank seems but little, and a far
off to the Fish. So we see the Stars by two middles; first, by the Air which
is the grossest middle, then by the heaven, which is the purer and remoter;
therefore the Stars seem but little to us and a far off.

Man before his fall did look upon the clearer and more perspicuous middle, A
collation bet wixt the innocent and old Adam.
hearing Gods voice, and saw that (...), the sight of God: then he looked upon
the more obscure middle, which is the creatures; therefore he got a more
clear sight of God and nearer. But after his fall he looks first upon the
creatures, and then he hears his word; therefore the sight which he gets of
God here, is more obscure and remote.

The diversity of the sight arising three manner of ways. First, from the
object. Secondly, Tria requiruntur ad videndum, objectum, organum, and medium.
if the object be clearer or obscurer, then the sight differs. Secondly, if
the middle be clearer or obscurer, then the light differs; as if a Crystal
glass be interposed, the sight is clearer; but if a green glass be
interposed, the sight is obscured. Thirdly, if the organ be hurt, or when the
spirits of the Eye are disturbed, as we see in drunken and mad men, to whom one
thing appears two, and in these who run till their heads be giddy.

The diversity which we have of the sight of God in the life to come, and in
this life, A collation betwixt the innocent, old, renewed and glorified Adam.
arising not in respect of the object God, for he remains One still to all;
the diversity then arises, partly from the diversity of the means, for God
does not manifest himself, by the like means to all, and partly from the
diversity of our apprehension, for all apprehend him not in a like manner, but
in the life to come the diversity shall not arise from the diversity of the
means, being to some clearer, and to some obscurer; but only according to the
diversity of our capacity, as a pint cannot contain a pottle, and this shall
make the degrees in glory, 1 Cor. 15.

A collation betwixt the first Adams knowledge and the second Adam Jesus
Christ. A collation betwixt the innocent and second Adam.


First, the fullness of knowledge is of two sorts. First, in respect of
knowledge it self. Duplex est plenitudo scientiae. 1. respectu scientiae. 2.
respectu ejus in quo est.
Secondly, in respect of him that has the fulfulnesse of knowledge, The
fullness, of knowledge, in respect of knowledge it self, is then, when one
attained to the highest and uttermost of knowledge, both Quoad essentiam, and
virtutem intensive, and extensive, that is, when he has it so far forth, as
it may be had, and to all the effects and purposes, whereunto knowledge does or
can extend it self; this kind of fullness of knowledge was proper to the
second Adam Christ, of whose fullness we receive, Ioh. 1.16. The first Adam had
fullness of knowledge, Duplex plenitudo scientiae respectu obiecti, intensive,
and extensive.
in respect of the subject or him that had it, according to his estate or
condition, both intensively to the utter-most bounds that God had prefixed, and
extensively in the virtue of it, in that it extended to the performing of these
things, that he was to perform in that place and condition that God had set
him in.

Secondly, The second collation betwixt the first Adams knowledge, and Christ's.
Thom part. 3. q. 5. art. 10. Christus consideratur, ut viator, and ut
comprehensor.
Christ the second Adam was both viator and comprehensor, (the Apostle touches
both these estates, Phil. 3. So run that ye may comprehend:) Christ when he
was viator tasted of all our three estates; for first, he was free from sin,
that was our estate in innocence; secondly, he felt the punishment of our
sins, which is the condition of man fallen; thirdly, he saw God face to face,
when he was here viator upon the earth, which shall be our estate in glory. So
Christ being both viator and comprehensor, his knowledge differed far from
the first Adams; for as he was comprehensor, Quadruplex cognitio fuit in
Christo, divina, faciatis, infusa, and experimentatis. Duplex consider atio
Christi, ut Deus, vel ut homo.
he had befide his divine knowledge, his blessed knowledge, which they call
facialem cognitionem; and besides that he had inditam or infusam cognitionem;
and thirdly, acquired or experimental knowledge. Christ's knowledge then was
either as he was God, or as he was Man: as he was Man he was either
comprehensor or viator; as he was comprehensor he had that blessed knowledge,
called facialis; as he was viator, his knowledge was either infused, or
experimental; his infused knowledge, was either knowledge of natural things,
in which he excelled Adam in his fist estate; or his knowledge in spiritual
things, and herein he excelled the Apostles and Angels themselves, in the
knowledge of the mysteries of our salvation. His experimental knowledge, was
that whereby he learned things by experience as we do. In his infused
knowledge he grew in the habites. In his experimental knowledge he grew from
the privation to the habit, as he was comprehensor he grew not in the habit,
as he was viator, he grew in the habites of things which were infused into
him; as he was viator he grew from the privation to the habit, in these
things which he learned by experience.

Christ's infused knowledge differed from his blessed knowledge; Differentia
inter Christi infusam, and beatam cognitionem.
for by his blessed knowledge he saw things in verbo in the word, but by his
infused knowledge he knew things in genere proprio, and per species rerum; by
the forms of things as they are here below. Secondly, Duplex cognitio,
babitualis, and actualis.
his blessed knowledge, semper est in actu, it is ever in act; but by his
infused knowledge, he goes from the habit to the act, turning himself to
the view of things here below actually: as when Christ asked of Peter, Matt.
17.25. Whether or no do the Kings Children pay tribute; Christ had the habit
here, and knew well enough that the Kings sons pay no tribute; now he turns
this habit to the act, when he propounds this question to Peter. Again,
Cognitio duplex, abstractiva and intuitiva.
there is a twofold knowledge, abstractive, and intuitive: I have the
abstractive knowledge of a rose in winter in my mind; I have the intuitive
knowledge in my mind when I see the rose grow in June. Christ's abstractive
knowledge is the habit; and his intuitive knowledge is the act. Christ he
excelled the Angels, in this infused knowledge, for although they have species
connatas rerum, naturally bred with them, yet this infused knowledge far
surpassed theirs; so it far surpassed the knowledge of all the Prophets, for
his Body and Soul being hypostatically united to the Godhead, he must have a
more perfect knowledge than any other man could have infused in him. Thirdly,
he had experimental knowledge, and herein he grew from the privation to the
habit; as in his infused knowledge he grew but from the habit to the act.
When a Doctor goes to the Schools to teach, he proceeds from the habit to
the act, and he grows in the habit: Christ grew thus in his infused
knowledge, but he grew not so in his blessed knowledge. When a boy goes to
the Schools to learn, he goes from the privation to the habit, and so did
our Savior Christ, in this third sort of knowledge experimental; and he knew
more when he was thirty years old, than when he was twelve; he could not
tell what woman touched him in the multitude (when they crowded about him,)
until the woman with the bloody-flix, fell down before him and acknowledged
it was she, Luke 8.45. So he could not tell whether there were figs upon the
fig tree by this sort of knowledge, Mark 11.13. and in this sense he was
ignorant of the day of judgment, Math. 24.36. this ignorance in Christ was not
sinful ignorance, it was ignorantia purae negationis, but not pravae
dispositionis, for he was ignorant of nothing of that which he was bound to
know; when he was here upon the earth he was ignorant of this day of
judgment as Man, Matthew. 24.36. (...).
both in his infased and experimental knowledge; first, in his infused
knowledge, for all infused knowledge proceeds from the habit to the act, for
by exercising the habit we come to the act, but Christ by his infused
knowledge could not come to the act, to know of this day in particular. He
knew that God should judge the world, and that he should judge it on a certain
day, here he proceeded from the habit to the act; but from the habit he
could not proceed to this particular day, for this is, superioris scientiae;
far less could he know this particular day, by his experimental knowledge.
But now being in glory and having received all power, and being appointed judge
of the Church, it is most probable that now as man he knows this day. Origin
in tract. 3. in Matthew.


In his experimental knowledge he far excelled Adam; for Adam non
pernoctavit in honor (as the Jews say) Psalm. 49.3. He lodged not one night
in honor; they gather hence that Adam fell in the day of his Creation; and
consequently could not have such experimental knowledge of things as Christ
had. This his experimental knowledge, he learned it not of any teacher as we
do, neither from any Angel: he was taught by no man, for when he was twelve
years of age he could reason with the Doctors, Luke. 2. So John 7. they
marvailed whence he had such learning, seeing he was not taught. Secondly, he
had it not from an Angel; an Angel in his agony came and comforted him, Luke
22. that it might evidently appear that he was Man, and stood in need of
comfort; but they never came to instruct him.

We and the Church of Rome differ about this ignorance of Christ, A collation
betwix the church of Rome and us, concerning Christ's knowledge and ignorance.
for they hold that Christ is said to be ignorant of the day of judgment,
because he would not reveile it to others; the Scriptures say he grew in
knowledge as he grew in stature, Luke 2. but he truly grew in stature:
therefore he truly grew in knowledge. Secondly, the Scriptures say, Luke 2.
that he grew in grace with God and Man; but he cannot be said to seem to
grow in grace with God; therefore he cannot be said to seem to grow in grace
with Men, but verily and truly to grow. There is in an Infant, the first act
of reason, when he begins to speak; and the second act, when he begins
to learn; and the first act of knowledge, Duplex actus rationis primus, and
secundus: ita and duplex actus scientiae, primus and secundus.
is the second act of reason; an Infant has the first act of Reason, but not
the second. A learned Man when he is sleeping has the first act of knowledge,
but not the second.

The Jesuits will have Christ, when he was an Infant, to have the first act
of knowledge, as the learned man when he is sleeping: and they make him only
to proceed from the habit to the act in knowledge. But we hold that in his
experimental knowledge, he was like other children, who have only the act of
reason, and proceeded from the privation to the habit.

A collation betwixt the knowledge of the first Adam, A collation betwixt the
knowledge of Adam and the Angels.
and the knowledge of the Angels.

First, the Angels take up things by one act, they neither discover nor reason;
they learn not hoc ex hoc: sed hoc post hoc; this of this, but, this after
this; they proceed not by way of Syllogism, enthymeme, or induction as we
do; they are intelligentes creaturae, but not ratiocinantes, understanding
creatures, but not reasoning; so shall the knowledge of Man, which he shall
have of God in the life to come, be intellectual and not by discourse; the
Apostle Ephesians. 3.10. says The Angels learn by the Church, they take up in an
instant the cause with the effect; but Man before the fall took up the cause
by the effect in time: in thunder there is lightning and the crack, these two
go in an instant together: and thus the Angels take up the knowledge of
things; but Man cannot in an instant take them up together because of the
organs of the body.

Object. But it may seem that they go from the sign to the thing signified,
Exo. 12. the blood was sprinkled upon the lintels of the doors, that the Angel
might not destroy their houses.

Answ. The Angel reasoned not thus as we do; here is the sign, therefore here
is the house; but this blood was sprinkled upon the lintels of the doors, to
confirm and assure the doubting Israelites, that the Angel should not destroy
them.

The Sacraments are not instituted for Angels,

Adams experimental knowledge, The second collation betwixt the first Adams
knowledge and the Ang^Is.
was gotten from forms drawn from their singular objects, as the face in the
glass, differs from the face it self, and the print in the wax from the
seal; so that which Adam abstracted from the creature, Scientia est absoluta
and essentialis in Deo, in mente humana est abstractiva species, in phantasia
humana est concreta, sed angeli intuentur ipsas essentias.
differed from the creatures themselves; but the knowledge of the Angels is not
abstractive, they behold the essence of things, and take them up. The Angels
have three sorts of knowledge. First, their morning knowledge, which is the
knowledge they have of the mystery of the incarnation, 1. Pet. 2. They desire
to look into this mystery. Triplex angelorum cognitio, matutina, meridiana,
Vespertina.
Secondly, their midday knowledge, which is the knowledge they have in
beholding the Godhead. Thirdly, their evening knowledge, which is the
knowledge they have in beholding the creatures below here. Adam before his
fall, had not this their morning knowledge, nor their midday knowledge, but he
had their evening knowledge.

Quest. How should Adams children have come to his knowledge if he had stood in
innocence?

Answ. Some think they should have had the use of reason, and perfect
knowledge at the very first; and that they should afterward have grown to more
experimental knowledge. Secondly, others hold that so soon as they had been
borne, they should have had the use of reason, so far forth as to discern
outward things good or evil; as the little Lambs by natures instinct, do
know the Wolf, and flee from him, and seek the dugge of their dammes,) but
not to discern things concerning morrall virtue and the worship of God*
Thirdly, others hold that they should have had no use of reason at the first,
and this seems to be the soundest; Duplicia dona, 1. respectu naturae, 2.
respectu personae.
for the gifts bestowed upon Adam were of two sorts. First, the gifts that were
bestowed upon him, secundum naturam specificam, as he was the root, out of
which all mankind proceeded, and these gifts all his children should have been
partakers of. Secondly, the gifts which were bestowed upon him personally; such
were these, presently to know after his Creation, and to be immediately created
of God, and to be created a perfect Man in full stature; these he was not to
communicate to his posterity: they should not so easily have come to this
knowledge as Adam did, to whom he could not propagate his actual knowledge,
Duplex cognitio actuatis and potentialis.
but his potentiall; for they were to be borne, as in weakness of body, so
without actual knowledge; so not having universal notions in their minds,
but being appointed by God to seek for knowledge, by inward light and outward
means: yet they should have far more easily attained to the means than we
do now and more certainly. For the Soul of man is like a Prince that uses
spies: if they bring no news he knows nothing; if they advertise lies, then
the counsel goes awry. So if a man be blind and deaf, then has he no
understanding. So if phrensies possess the brain, it blots the forms of
things, and the fantasy prooves vain and brings no true relation to the
Soul: But Adams senses arising of the exact temperature of the Body, gave full
information to the fantasy, and so it should have been in his posterity, as
they grew in time, they should have received without any error, the impression
of any object. Thus should they have attained to the knowledge of humane things
and so much the more easily should they have come to the knowledge of God, than
man does know.

Man before his fall took up God by way of Analogy, or proportion, and not
fully as he is.

There is a full taking up of God whereby only he takes up himself, Triplex
conceptus dei, adaequatus, analogicus, and falsus.
neither Man nor Angel can thus conceive him. Secondly, there is a conception,
and taking up of God by way of Analogy, as Adam seeing such goodness and
beauty in the Creatures, gathered by way of Analogy, what goodness and
beauty must be in God. The creatures are not like God vnivoce, Analogia realis,
est primam in deo, sed secundum rationem nominis est prius in nobis.
that is, simply like unto God, neither aequivoce, having only a resemblance
in name to him: but they are like to him by way of Analogy. Thirdly, there is
a false conception of God when we take him up falsely.

There is an Analogy of similitude, and an Analogy of proportion. Analogy of
similitude, as when it is said, Be ye holy as I am holy, Levit. 19.2. Analogy
of proportion betwixt God and man, Esaias. 40.18. Duplex anologia, similitudinis
and proportionis.
Adam took up God by Analogy of similitude, but not by way of proportion.

Man took up God by way of Analogy, A collation betwixt the innocent and old
Adam
but since the fall he has a false conception of God: as when the Jews
resembled him to a Calfe eating hay; and the Papists paint him like an old Man:
So they conceive not God by Analogy of similitude, when they resemble him by
an Idol.

Object. Seeing Gods attributes and essence are one in themselves, how can we
take them up as distinguished without error? Makes not this a false conception
in our understanding?

Answ. Attributa vniuntur in Deo, disperguntur in creaturis, ut radij solis.
Although these attributes be one in God, yet in operation toward us, they
are distinguished when our understanding conceives them, Est inadaequatus
conceptus sed non falsus, it is an unequal conception but not false. The
matter may be cleared by these examples.

First, the powers of the Soul which are dispersed in the organs of the Body,
(in the Eye it is seeing, in the Ear it is hearing,) yet in the Soul it self
they are united, pure and eminenter, simply and eminently. So although justice
and mercy be diverse in operation toward us, (for he punishes not by his
mercy, nor shows mercy by his justice) yet in God they are one, pure and
eminenter.

Secondly, the thunder when it breaks upon a tree, it bores the hard, it
burns the dry, it scatters the leaves, and peeles the bark, yet the thunder
is one in it self. So the attributes of God, although they have diverse
operations upon the creatures, yet they are one in themselves; when I conceive
these operations distinctly in my understanding, this is not error in my
conception of God.

Thirdly, the light is one in it self, yet as this light is reflext upon the
creatures, we take it up diversely. So the attributes of God being one in him,
yet when they are dispersed amongst the creatures, we take them up distinctly.

Man before his fall could not take up that fully, A collation betwixt the
innocent and old Adam.
which was in God; this was no sin in him, for it was but a negative
conception: Duplex conceptio, negativa and privativa.
it was more than his nature could reach unto. But Man after his fall conceives
of God privatively, that is, he takes up less of him than he is bound to
take up. Tria impedimenta in conceptu, summa formositas summa deformitas, and
summa informitas.


There are three things that hinder us to take up a thing. First, summa for
mositas, the great beauty in it. Secondly, summa informitas, the great
informitie in it. Thirdly, summa deformitas, the great deformity in it. We
cannot take up God for the great beauty that is in him; hence is that saying,
We have seen God, therefore we shall die, Judge. 13.22. We cannot take up
the first days work, for the great informity in it, being without all fashion
or shape. We cannot take up sin for the great deformity that is in it.

Quest. What should a man do, seeing he cannot behold the glory of God, or
take him up?

Answ. We must look upon the Man Christ, for, be who sees the Son, sees
the Father, Ioh. 14.9. A Man cannot behold the Sun in the Eclipse, it so
dazeleth his eyes; what does he then? he sets down a basen full of water;
and sees the Image of the Sun Eclipsed in the water. So, seeing we cannot
behold the infinite God, nor comprehend him; we must then cast the eyes of our
Faith upon his Image Christ; when we look into a clear glass it casts no
shadow to us, but put steel upon the back, then it casts a reflex: So when
we cannot see God himself, we must put the Manhood of our Lord Jesus Christ,
(as it were a back to his Godhead,) and then he will cast a comfortable
reflex to us.

Quest. Shall we comprehend God in the life to come?

Answer. We shall not simply be comprehensores, but, rather apprehensores;
that is, our understanding cannot comprehend him, but it shall take hold of him.

Object. But the Apostle says; 1. Cor. 9.24. So run that ye may comprehend;
so, Philip. 3.12. then it may seem that we shall be comprehenders of God in
the life to come. Duplex comprehensio, visu, and manu.


Answ. There is a double sort of comprehending the first is visu, in the
vision; the second, manu: in the life to come we shall comprehend him and lay
hold on him: but we shall not see him totally and fully: and so we shall
apprehend rather than comprehend in the life to come.

Object. If we comprehend him not infinitely in the life to come, it may
seem that we cannot be blessed then; for no finite thing can make a man
blessed.

Answ. Apprehendimus infinitum sub ratione infiniti, sed non infinite; We
apprehend an infinite thing, as being infinite, but not by an infinite
apprehension, for we apprehend him who is infinite, but finitely: and it is a
true axiom, Omne receptum est in recipiente, non per modum recepti, sed per
modum recipientis; that is, every thing is received by the receiver, not
according to the thing received, but according to the measure of the receiver.

Quest. Is not our apprehension infinite then?

Answ. It follows not; the thing is infinite extrinsece, in it self; but not
intrinsece and formaliter, in the intellect. So we say, sin is infinite
objective, because it is committed against the infinite God, and not
intrinsece, respecting the form of it. But that which we apprehend of God is
extrinsece finitum, but intrinsece and formaliter infinitum.

CHAP. XIIII. Of Adams revealed knowledge of God.
MAn in his estate of innocence knew the true God in his attributes,

Quest. Whether believed Adam before his fall the incarnation, as he believed
the trinity of persons?

Answ. He could not believe the incarnation, for then he should have
understood of his own fall, and consequently, he would have been in a
perpetual fear before the fall.

Object. But it may be said, that Adam might have known the end not knowing
the means, as Joseph knew that he should be ruler over his brethren, but he
knew not the means how that should be effected, as that he should be sold
to the Madianites, and be a slave in Egypt; So Adam before his fall might have
known of Christ's incarnation, and yet not know his own fall.

Answ. Joseph knew by revelation that he should be Lord over his brethren;
but Adam before his fall (for ought we find,) had no such revelation, and
therefore could not know Christ's incarnation, for it was not known till God
revealed it to him after his fall: That the seed of the Woman should tread
down the head of the Serpent, Genesis 3.

CHAP. XV. Of the knowledge which Adam had of the Creatures.
MAn in his first estate had the first principles,

As he was Pater viventium, the Father of all living, so he was Pater
scientium; A collation betwix the innocent, old, and renewed Adam.
for as he was able to beget children, so he was able to teach his posterity.

Adams knowledge, the Angels and ours, differ four manner of ways. First, he
had his knowledge per species infusas, and not per species connatas as the
Angels have; Scientia velest infusa, connata, acquisita, vel experimentalis.
we have our knowledge now, per species acquisitas, he had not his knowledge by
experience as we have, yet he should have had his experimental knowledge of
sciences and arts if he had stood.

Quest. Whether was his knowledge one sort of knowledge with ours, or different?

Answ. It was not a different sort of knowledge from ours, although his was
infused, and ours acquired. The sight which we have naturally, and that which
was miraculously restored by Christ to the blind, was one sort of sight,
though the one was supernatural, and the other natural: so although Adams
knowledge was infused and ours acquired, yet it is one sort of knowledge,
because they are both set upon the same objects.

Secondly, Adams knowledge and ours differed in extent of knowledge, In
amplitudine scientiae.
for he had the knowledge of all things which might be known; that befalls
to no man now, for he knows not that which he should know.

Thirdly, his knowledge and ours differed, for he knew the cause of every
thing, we for the most part take up only the effects of nothing, He knew
(...), we know (...).
but know not the causes. The lodestone draws the iron to it, yet being
rubbed with garlike it cannot draw the iron to it; here he could understand the
cause, but we perceive only the effect, that the iron is drawn up, but know
not the cause; Tripolium, tripoli or turbet, changes the color of it three
times in a day; for in the morning it is white, at the middle of the day it is
of a purple color; and in the evening it is light, Peucer. de divin.
red, of a scarlet color; he knew the reason of it, Cognitio triplex,
supereminens, adaequata, and deficiens.
we know only the effects. God knows the cause and the effects of things
more excellently then they are in themselves; Adam knew as much as was in the
creatures, but we know less than is in them. There are some colors quae
exaequant visum, as the green color is equal with our sight; there are some
colors quae superant visum, that exceed our sight, as the snow scatters our
sight; there are some colors that are deficient and less than our sight, as
the tawnie color: these colors which scatter the sight, the Greeks call
(...), these which gather the sight, they call (...), the creatures they are
less than Gods knowledge, they are equal with Adams knowledge, but they
exceed our knowledge now. The knowledge that man had before the fall of the
creaturs and since is illustrate by this Apologe, the Wolf desired the Crane
upon a time to suppe with her, and powered thin pottage upon a table which the
Crane could not pick up because they were so thin; the next night the Crane
desired the Wolf to supper, and brought a long narrow glass with pottage in
it, which she could easily put her beak into and eat of it, but the Wolf
could not put his head into it, but lickt only the glass without. Man before
his fall was like the Crane, who could dive easily into the glass, he could
easily take up the nature of the creatures; but since the fall he is like to
the Wolf, licking without the glass, never putting his head within, to
attain to the secrets of nature; therefore it was that antiquity fained
verity to be hid in a deep well.

Fourthly, Differnut retentione.
his knowledge and ours differed in the sure retaining, for man in his whole
estate could not forget things taught him; but man now does forget the things
that are taught him: we are now like to the hour glass, for that which we
receive in at the one ear goes out at the other; or like to a sieve, which
keeps the branne and lets the flower go: so now we forget the good, and
retain the bad. A collation betwixt Salomons knowledge and Adam in innocence


A collation betwixt that knowledge which Solomon had of natural things, and
that which Adam had before his fall. Man in his innocent estate excelled all
that ever were in the knowledge of natural things.

But it may be said, 1. King. 3.12. that, there was never none like Solomon, in
knowledge, before him, or shall be after him, therefore Solomon excelled Adam
in knowledge. Some answer, that the comparison is here only of Kings; there
was never such a King in Israel, that had such wisdom as Solomon; but in
divine things Adam excelled him. But we must not grant this, for in the
knowledge of natural things Adam excelled all; then the comparison must only
be between Solomon and other sinful men since the fall, he excelled all
sinful men in knowledge, but not Adam in his innocent estate.

Quest. How did Adam understand all sorts of trades and sciences before the
fall, seeing his posterity is said to find out many after the fall, Genesis 4. As
some of Cains posterity found out the Art to work in brass, some to make
tents; so Noah after he came out of the Arc planted the first vineyard, Genesis
9.20.

Answ. He had the knowledge of all the liberal sciences before the fall, but
the mechanicke and servile trades that serve for man's use after the fall he
knew them not, for he was not to eat bread by the sweat of his face: his work
should have only been a recreation to him.

The first Adam had knowledge of the liberal sciences, A collation betwixt the
innocent and old Adam
but since the fall he poreth only in the earth; and delights only his
senses, as the finding out of music; and for his profit, as folding of
cattle, Genesis 4. But before the fall he had his mind elevated higher to God,
and to the knowledge of the liberal sciences; and as the sciences followed
Adam (the Divine;) so when the Gospel was restored, all liberal sciences
follow it, as the shadow does the body, and was restored with it.

Adam knew all Arts and sciences before his fall, Adam to the Patriarchs, and
so has continued still; the ancientest of the Philosophers are but of late,
Daplex Philosophia exemplaris and exemplata.
and they did learn the most of it out of Egypt; the exemplar of Philosophy
was from God; that which was framed to the exemplar was from man.

Quest. Whence comes it that some men excel others so far now in Arts and
liberal sciences?

Answ. It comes from a new gift of God; it is a new gift of God to excel even
in these mechanike things and liberal sciences: as the Lord gave to Bezaliel
and Ahohab a special gift to work in gold and silver, curious work for the
Tabernacle Exodus 34.1. Esa. 28.26. For his God does instruct him to discretion,
and does teach him. God gives a new gift to the husbandman to excel in
husbandry. It is true that after the fall Man lost not altogether this natural
knowledge; Vulneratus est in naturalibus, and spoliatus est in spiritualibus;
that is, he was wounded in his natural knowledge, and spoiled of his
supernatural, for if he had altogether lost this natural knowledge, the life
of man could not have been entertained; but to excel in this knowledge, this
must be a supernatural gift.

So much of Adams understanding wherein his knowledge consisted, both inbred
and acquired. We come now to his Will, wherein chiefly consists the consent
to these things which his understanding has discerned, and here stands the
power that the Will has over all the actions of men.

CHAP. XVI. Of the Will of Man.
THere are two principal faculties in the soul; the understanding and the
will, which continually accompany it, both in the body, and out of the body.

The understanding, is an essential faculty in the Soul, whereby it knows,
judges, and discerns naturally truth from falsehood.

The will, is an essential faculty in the Soul working freely, having
liberty to choose, refuse, or suspend, not determinate to one thing.

It is called a faculty, and not a habit; because a habit is determinate to
one thing; but a faculty may make choice of more. Secondly it is said; to work
freely, to put a difference betwixt it and natural agents, which still work
after the same manner, and are always carried to the same object: as the Sun
naturally cannot but heat, and it is but by accident if it breed cold:
again, it is said, to work freely, to put a difference between it and the
actions of the beasts, which are but semiliberae actiones, for the beasts
cannot but choose still the self same thing, being alike affected; as being
hungry they cannot choose but eat, as the stone being heavy cannot but go to
the center. Creatures without life, have neither liberum motum, a free motion,
(because they are moved by another) neither have they liberum judicium, free
judgment, because they are not moved by reason: Agens natural movetur ad
finem, agens per intellectum movetur in finem.
the beasts have a free motion, because they move themselves, according to the
natural instinct which God has endued them with; but they have not a free
judgment, for they are not directed by reason. Man has both free motion, and
free judgment; whereby he works freely. Natural agents determinate no end
to themselves; but reasonable creatures propound and determinate an end to
themselves: therefore no natural agent has freedom, but instinct.

There are three properties of the Will. First, Tres Proprietates voluntatis,
conformitas, libertas and potestas.
the conformity of the will with the understanding. Secondly, the liberty of
the will; for when it follows the last judgment of the understanding, it
follows it freely. Thirdly, the power of the will, whereby the will after the
election, (which now it has gotten by the direction of the understanding)
applies it self to the attaining of the object.

The first property of the will is, The first property of the will.
that in the operation it depends upon the understanding, and follows the
direction of the mind.

The will follows the direction of the understanding, choosing, suspending, or
refusing; this is called, sequacitas voluntatis; the will of it self is but
caeca potentia, and has nothing but a desire; which yet has not desire to any
particular object, except it be led by the light of the mind: hence come these
sayings, nihil in voluntate quod non prius fuerat in intellectu; error in
notitia parit errorem in voluntate, quod intellectus male judicat, voluntas
male appetit; and tantum diligimus quantum cognoscimus; that is, there is
nothing in the will which was not first in the understanding: So, error, in
knowledge breeds error in the will: so a false judging of a thing, breeds a
false desire of a thing: so, the more we love, the more we know.

There is in the understanding, intellection, Duplex inteilectus, speculativus,
and practicus in intellectu practico duplex ratio, precedens and subsequens.
Voluntas sequitur ultimum iudicium practici intellectus.
or ratio speculativa, which is of things to be known by Man; and intellectus,
or ratio practica; of things used to be done by Man, and fall under his
election. Again in Man's practical reason, there is reason going before,
saying, this may be done; and another following the practical understanding,
saying, this shall be done; and this last judgment, of practical
understanding, the Will follows, and says, this will I do, she is in
suspense before she hear this last conclusion.

Quest. What is the reason that the will does not always follow the last
judgment of the understanding? for oftentimes it goes a plain contrary
course in that which the understanding has discerned, as Medea said, Video
meliora proboque, deteriora sequor; I see the good, but I follow the bad.

Answ. The ground of this proceeds from the understanding: for the
understanding having discerned a thing to be good, the affections draw the
mind to a new resolution, as we see in that complaint of the Apostle, Romans 7.
The good that I would do, that I do not; and the evil that I would not do,
that I do; but still the Will follows the last resolution of the
understanding; otherwise of it self it is but caecapotentia.

The understanding has a mutual dependence from the Will,

The Will, appetitu innato; and before any deliberation, there goes an act of
the Will still, whereby we will deliberate upon such a purpose, and it says
volo diliberere, before the mind enter in deliberation: when the will is set
earnestly upon a thing, it stirs up the mind to think upon it, and upon
the means whereby it may attain unto it, that it may have the appetite
satisfied; therefore the understanding cannot discern a thing to be true or
false, before the will appoint the end, and so set the mind on work.

There is a reciprocal dependence then betwixt these two, the Will depends
upon the deliberation of the mind; both particularly setting down the object,
and how it should exercise it self about the object; Duplex actus intellectus
specificationis and exercitij.

Voluntas sequitur intellectum quoad specificationem and exercitium actus;
intellectus sequitur voluntatem quoad exercitium actus tantum.


but the mind depends upon the will, quoad exercitium, but not, quoad
specificationem, for when the mind has given out her last determination
concerning any particular object, the will must choose that particular and not
another, and neither refuse it nor suspend it; and it must choose it in that
measure of earnestness, as it is known to be good; tantum quisque vult
quantum intelligit se velle debere, every man desires so much as he
understands. But upon the other side the will sets only the mind on work,
and conveneth the council to deliberate, but tells them not what to
conclude, and attends their deliberation, and promises to follow their
conclusion. Example, when a controversy arises in the Church the supreme
magistrate conveneth a Synod, and commands them to give out their
determination and Canon; but commands them not to incline more to one side
than to the other; here he commands exercitium, and leaves specificationem
free: but when he has heard their determination, according the Word of God,
he takes him to that side which they conclude to be best, without either
suspending or refusing; and so follows them both, quoad exercitium and
specificationem: Yet in this similitude there is some dissimilitude; for the
magistrate, yea every private man has judicium discretionis; but the will has
no judgment in it self, for it merely depends upon the judgment of the
mind, which makes the necessity of the dependence of the will upon the
mind, to be greater than the dependence of the King upon his Council, or of
any private man, upon a Synods determination.

This natural reciprocation of the mind and the Will, is sensibly perceived,
by the instruments of the understanding and the will in the body, whereby they
exercise their functions, to wit, the heart and the brain: the spirits are
carried from the heart to the brain, and when the heart waxes hoate with an
earnest desire of the will, then the brain is more busied, and intended to
find out the way how the heart may be satisfied; and again when there is a
clear and a full knowledge in the brain, then the spirits run from the
brain to the heart, and stir up the heart to pursue for the obtaining of the
known good) which reciprocation brings forth a happy work when the unruly
affections, and sinful appetites, mix not themselves with the business to
mar all.

Quest. Whether will we a thing first, or understand we it first, and then will
it?

Answ. We will a thing before we understand it, by an inbred desire and blind
appetite, but we cannot will a thing in respect of the means, until the
understanding give light first. Quatuor sunt activa principia, res apprehense,
apprehensiva vis, voluntas, and vis executiva.
In all our actions there concur four things. First, the Object which is the
thing we apprehend. Secondly, the apprehending power or the understanding,
judging this to be good or evil. Thirdly, the will which is moved by the
understanding. Fourthly, the members moved by the will; here the understanding
considering the object gives light to the will.

Quest. Where begins sin first, whether in the will, or in the understanding?

Answ. The habit of sin is first in the understanding, because all sin
comes from error which is in the understanding. Again, when the understanding
is considered by it self without any operation, In actu absoluto pectatune est
prius in intellectu, in actu compesito and prius in voluntate.
then sin is first, in it; but when the understanding and the will work
together, then sin is first in the will.

Here we may gather that the sin in the will is greater than the sin in
the understanding, Pec catum est in obiecto occa sionaliter, in intellectu er
iginaliter, in voluntate formaliter, in membris qua odusum.
because in the understanding there is only a habit of sin, but in the will
there is both the habit and the Act of sin, and therefore we see that the
Will is punished with greater rebellion than the understanding is with
darkness; Pharaohs heart was hardened, he knew the judgments of God, but yet
his Will continually rebelled.

Quest. Whether is there a sin in the will without error in the
understanding or no?

Answ. Sin is in the understanding two ways. First, Duplex ignor antia,
originalis, and interpretativa.
originally when the understanding is so blinded, that it can give no direction
to the Will. Secondly, interpretatively, when the understanding has shown the
truth to the will, and the sin is committed first by the Will; yet for lack
of consideration, the understanding approves the act of the Will, and so
follows it in the same sin, which is by reason of the dependence of the
understanding from the will: as a man going to murder, the Will sets down the
wicked end that the understanding may devise the cruel means: yet the
understanding had showen the truth to the will before, that it was good not to
murder.

Quest. Whether does ignorance in the understanding make the will, willing or
not willing in the actions?

Answ. There is a threefold ignorance. Triplex ignorantia, antecedens,
cancomitant, consequens.
The first is called ignorantia antecedens, when a man is ignorant of that
which he is not bound to know, nor could not know, which if he had known he
would not have done it; here, ignorance is the cause of the fact; as a man
cutting wood his axe head flees off and killes a man ignorantly, he does the
thing ignorantly; which if he had known he would not have done; here the
ignorance in the understanding, makes not the will, willing, because he sins
ex ignorantia.

The second is called ignorantia concomitans when a man does that thing
ignorantly, which if he had known he would not have done, but would have
done another thing as bad, and is sorry that he has not done it. A man
conceives a hatred against such a man, he mistaking the man, kill les another in
place of him ignorantly; when this is told him, he is sorry that he has not
killed his enemy; when he killes the other man, his ignorance is not willing
ignorance, neither is it unwilling ignorance: Triplex ignorantia, volens,
nolens, non volens.
It is not willing ignorance; because he would not have killed the man whom he
killed; it is not unwilling ignorance, because he would have killed his enemy,
and was sorry that he killed him not, so that his ignorance was partly willing,
and partly not willing; Al quis pecoat dupliciter, ex ignorantia, and ignorater.
here he sins ignoranter, but not ex ignorantia: Ignorantly he killed the
man, although ignorance was not the cause, for he did it of set purpose.

The third is called ignorantia consequens, when a man is wilfully ignorant,
and draws on the ignorance upon himself, and then excuses his sin; a man
in his drunkenness, killes a child ignorantly, this ignorance, is a willing
ignorance, because the man willingly was drunk, and contracted this ignorance;
and therefore he should be punished both for his drunkenness, and for his
murder; this is called an affectate ignorance and willing.

The second property of the will, will, whereby it chooses freely.

Some of the Schoolmen hold that freedom is originally in the understanding,
The second property of the will.
and formally in the will, as Aquinas: others hold that this freedom is
formally both in the understanding, Duplex libertas, originalis and formalis.
and the will; but first in the understanding, and then in the will, as
Durandus; but we hold that freedom is only in the will. That freedom is not
originally in the understanding.


We will show that this freedom cannot be originally in the understanding, by
these two reasons.

First, the understanding is neither free from coaction, understanding is
forced to know a thing which it would not know, contra inclinationem totius
suppositi, contrary to the inclination of the whole person, Voluntas sequitur
rationem, ut indicativum, non ut impulfivum.
as the Devils are forced to believe that there is a God; so, a man that is
sick unto death is forced to believe that he shall die, contrary to the
inclination of the whole man who would live; but the will can no ways be thus
enforced to will. Again, the understanding is not free from natural
necessity; for if arguments which necessarily conclude be proposed to it, it
cannot choose but believe them: if probable arguments be proposed to it, then it
has but a conceit or opinion, with a fear to the contrary: but if arguments
of like probability on both sides be proposed to it, here it is necessitate to
doubt, unless the inclination of the will, come in, to incline it rather the
one way than the other? we may imagine any thing that we please, but we cannot
give our lightest assent unto a thing, unless there be some color of reason
at least to induce.

All the powers of the Soul, will in their actions, and that necessarily,
without any freedom in them; as the seeing eye, cannot but necessarily see
colors, if they be laid before it, so the understanding is forced to
understand, when truth is laid before it; but the will although it be
determinate by the understanding, yet this determination takes not away the
liberty of the will and places it in the understanding originally; again, the
dnderstanding is determiate by the object, necessarily and naturally: but the
will is determinate by the understanding, necessarily yet freely.

Freedom is radically and originally in the will; Bellarmine halts here, both
contrary to himself and to others of his own coat; he is plainly contrary
to himself, as Benius the Jesuit marks well; for first (says Benius) he
places liberty radically in the understanding, whereby the will is
determinate by the last judgment of reason; and yet in the third Book and
eight Chapter, of freewill and grace, Bellarmine says, Volunt as in eligendo
libera est, non quod non determinetur necessario a judicio ultimo and practico
rationis; sed quod istud ipsum ultimum and practicum judicium rationis in
potestate voluntatis est, that is, The will is free in choosing, not that it is
determinate necessarily by the last judgment of reason, but because this same
last judgment of reason, is in the power of the will. Benius says, that he
cannot see how these two can stand together, that the understanding in the last
Judgment should determinate the will, and that the same last Judgment of
reason shoud be in the power of the will: so that the patrons of free will in
Man, do not agree among themselves concerning the original of freedom,
sometimes placing it in the understanding, and sometimes in the will. Here we
conclude, that freedom is originally in the will, for when the understanding,
has demonstrate the truth unto the will: although the understanding
necessitate the will to choose; yet it does not enforce it; but it chooses that
which it chooses freely.

Secondly, That free dome is not formally both in the understanding and the
will.
we will show that this liberty is not both in the understanding and the will,
formally; for if it were formally in both, then it should follow that there
were two free wills in man, one in the understanding, and another in the will;
and consequently a double election, and a double cause of sin; but the
formal cause of sin is in the will; therefore Bernard says Cesset voluntas
propria, and infernus non crit, that is, Let the will cease from sinning, and
there shall not be a hell, therefore there cannot be a formal cause of
freedom in the understanding.

It rests then that freedom is both originally and formally in the will. We
must not think this an idle school distinction, and so let it pass; for
covertly under this, (that they make the understanding to be radically and
originally free,) they cover their poison of free will, and so vent it to the
world: for freedom being originally in the understanding since the fall (unto
good;) it directs the will in every action; and the will being determinate by
the understanding, then there must be yet free will in Man since the fall,
naturally to embrace good, as well as evil.

Quest. What is the understanding to the will then, when the will chooses,
seeing it is not the original of the liberty thereof? Intellectus est causa
determination is, non libertatis.


Answ. It is the cause of the determination of the will, but not of the liberty
thereof: It cannot be the efficient cause of the liberty of the will although
it might seem so to be; as for example: remission of sins is promised and
given, if we forgive men their trespasses: yet our forgiving of men their
trespasses, is not the cause why God remits our sins, but a condition; so,
the fire heateth not, unless there be a mutual touch betwixt the agent and
the patient, but yet this mutual touch of the agent and the patient, is not
the cause why the fire burns but a condition; So, although the will choose not
without the light of the understanding, yet the understanding is not the cause,
why the will chooses freely, Aliud est conditio, aliud causa.
but a condition without which it could not choose; the cause is one thing, but
the condition is another.

Object. A condition never precedeth an effect; Bellarm. de great. and lib.
arbit.
as ye cannot see unless the window be opened, and yet it will not follow,
that if the window be opened (which is the condition) that ye will straight
see, unless the light come in; (which is the cause why we see:) but when the
understanding shows the light to the will, it is not as condition, but a
cause, why the will chooses this thing, and not that; as the light makes the
colors actually visible, which were but potentially visible, before the light
did shine.

Answ. Conditio duplex, causalis, and conditionalis.
There is a twofold condition. First, when the condition includes a cause: as
if a man breath, he has lungs; here the condition of breathing is his lungs;
which is also the cause of his breathing. Secondly, there is condition, which
is only a condition, and includes no cause in it; as the opening of the
window is the condition without which we cannot see: if the window be not
opened, the light cannot come in; and yet the opening of the window is not the
cause of the light, for the cause is in the light it seife, why the object is
visible. Again, the light shining upon the object is not the cause of our
seeing the object, for the cause is the eye, and the light is the condition
without which we cannot see the object. So, the understanding is only but a
condition to the will, and not a cause, why it chooses freely, because the
freedom of the will, is only in it self, embracing the object freely,
without any external cause mooving it.

The will of God neither turns nor returns; A collation between the will of
the Angels, God and man.
it is like the pole which stands immoveably in the firmament: the will of the
Angel turns, but returns not; it is like the wind, which being settled in
one ayrth stands still there: but the will of man both turns and returns;

In the Angels there was primum instans, Betwixt the will of the Angels, in
nocent, second, old, and renewed Adam.
and secundum instans; the Angels, in primo instanti, were incomplete liberi,
they were then but viatores; for although they did at the first only actually
choose good, in the first moment of their creation, yet they were not confirmed
in good, Job 4.18. Duplex instans angelorum, primus, and secundus.
he found not constancy in his Angels: but in the second instant, the good
Angels, were complete liberi and confirmed in good; as the bad Angels were
settled in evil, the good Angels confirmed in good, were comprehensores, but
not viatores; and the bad were confirmed only in evil, and are continually
viatores. So the first Adam was incomplete liber and viator, and therefore
might choose either good or evil; so the renewed Adam is incomplete liber and
viator, because naturally he chooses evil, and by grace he may choose good;
but, the second Adam Jesus Christ, being both comprehensor and viator is
complete liber and cannot choose evil; the old Adam is viator only, and
chooses only evil.

When the Devils and wicked men are said to be determinate to evil, it is not
so to be understood that they are determinate to one sort of evil only, for
they may go from one sort of evil to another; as the Devil enticed the Jews
to kill Christ, and yet he enticed Peter to dissuade Christ from going to
Jerusalem, that he might be saved; and yet they are still determinate to evil.

An Angel differs from the Soul of Man four ways. First, naturally,
Betwixt the Angels and Man. Quatuor modis differt angelus ab homine, 1.
naturaliter, 2. logice, 3. metaphysice, 4. theologice.
for the Soul does animate the Body, but an Angel animates not a Body
Secondly, they differ in their definition, for the Soul is a reasonable
creature, but an Angel is an intellectual creature. Thirdly, the Soul may be
moved by the inferior faculties, but the Angel is only moved by God.
Fourthly, the Soul makes choice either of good or evil, but an Angel of good
only, or of evil only.

Willingness is the most absolute perfection of the will, and therefore when
the Saints aim at this, is noted as one of the highest degrees of perfection
in this life to be willing to do good, Psalm. 110. My people are a willing
people.

The liberty of the will is twofold, Duplex libertas volunta. ^is,
contrarietatis and contradictionis.
the liberty of contrariety and the liberty of contradiction: Man had liberty
of contrariety before his fall to choose good or evil, and liberty of
contradiction, to do, or not to do: these two sorts of liberties are not the
perfectest estate of the will, for when it has power to choose or not to choose,
it imports a weakness in it, but when it is determinate to the good, then it
is fully satisfied, this is reserved for Man in glory. The Apostle, Romans 6.18.
used this word liberty, more improperly, when he says, free from Justice, and
servant to sin; when he calls this freedom, it is most improperly
freedom; for, if the Son make us free, then we are free, Ioh. 8.36. so we
say to serve God, this service is not properly service, but freedom.

The essential property of the will, The second property of the will.
is freedom, that it cannot be compelled by no external agent in the free
choosing; although in the external action thereof it may be forced.

God works diversely upon the will; sometimes he changes the will, and
converts it; as when he changed and converted the will of Saul, and made him
an Apostle. Secondly, sometimes he changes the will, but converts it not; as
when Esau came against his brother Jacob, he changed his will, and made him
fall upon his neck and weep, Genesis 33.4. But yet converted him not; so when
Alexander the great, came against Jerusalem, minding to destroy it, the Lord
changed his mind, and made him courteous to the Jews, by granting them sundry
privileges, and bestowing gifts upon them; here his mind was changed, but not
converted. Thirdly, sometimes God neither changes nor converts the will, but
restrains it; as the will of Laban when he came against Jacob, Genesis 31.24.
and Attila when he came against Rome. Fourthly, sometimes God neither changes,
nor converteth, nor restraines the will, but he overrules it, as he did the
will of the Jews who crucified Christ: all these ways God works upon the
will, but he never compels it.

Although the will cannot be compelled in actu elicito, in the own free
choice; yet in actu imperato, Duplex actus, e icitus and imperatus.
in the commanding act, it may be compelled; as when they drew the Martyrs
against their will before their idols, putting frankincence in their hands to
burn it before them: So Ioh. 21. Christ says to Peter, they shall draw thee
whether thou would not.

As the will, in the commanding act may be compelled; will in the free choosing
act may be necessitate.

There is a threefold necessity. Triplex necessitas, ab intrinseco, ab
extrinseco, and ratione finis.
First when the necessity arises from within; this is called, necessitas ab
intrinseco, as the blessed in heaven are moved, by the proper inclination of
their will to love God necessarily, Secondly, when the necessity arises from
without; as when the will is indifferent in it self, to do or not to do, to
go this way or that way. When Nebuchadnezzar stood in the parting of two
ways, Ezech. 21. doubtful whither to go, toward Jerusalem or Rabbath; the
Lord determinates his will to go toward Jerusalem. Thirdly, in respect, of
the end; as a man is to pass over a water, but he cannot go to the other side
without a boat. These three sorts of necessities take not away the liberty of
the will, although they necessitate it; the first sort of necessity takes not
away the liberty of the will, although it necessitate it; for this will is
internum principium sui motus, and this liberty cannot be taken from it,
unless it be destrayed: the second sort of necessity takes not away the
freedom from it; for the will cannot be both enforced, and yet free; as heat
cannot be made cold: but yet the will may be necessitate; for as the water
which is cold may be made hoate, so the will which is free may be necessitate:
and the third sort of necessity establishes the freedom of the will.

Man in his first estate had free choice of good or evil, The first collation
betwixt the innocent, renewed, old, and glorified Adam.
but was necessitate to neither of them: in his second estate, he is a servant
to sin and necessitate to it; in his third estate, he is free from the
servitude of sin, but not from the necessity of it: in his fourth estate he
is voluntarily good, and necessarily good, but he is not free liberate
indifferentiae; as man was before the fall, for that includes a weakness in
it.

In Adam's first estate his will was free from sin, internum, nor externum
principium, to move him to sin; so he was free from misery but not from
mutability. In his second estate he is subject to the necessity of sinning to
misery, and to the servitude of sin; but free from coaction. In his third
estate, he is free from the dominion of sin, from the servitude of sin,
and from compulsion, but not from the necessity of sinning. In his fourth he
shall be free from misery, servitude mutability, and necessity of sinning; but
not from necessity and willingness to love God. In his first estate he was
liber, free; in his second estate he was servus, a servant to sin; In his
third estate he is liberatus, free from sin; but in his fourth estate he
shall be liberrimus, most freed from finne.

The will working freely, understanding, in civil and moral actions, and in
indifferent things; but in actions spiritual it is only determinate by God.

The will has power by the light of the understanding to determinate it self,
in civil, and moral actions; Prove. 21.1. The Kings heart is in the hands of
the Lord, and he turns it as the rivers of water; when the King determinates
his own heart, the Lord also determinates it; for every particular agent,
determinates his own instrument to his work; Sola increata voluntas est
independens.
but the will is the instrument of God, (for only the uncreated will has an
independent power) therefore the will being but a second cause, is determinate
by God. When God determinates the will in civil things, he does it by
changing, restraining, or overruling it, but when he determinates the will
(which cannot determinate it self) in spiritual things, then he converts the
will and inclines it, and here he is the sole and only cause.

Object. That which is moved from a cause without it self, is said to be
compelled; but the will cannot be compelled, therefore it may seem that it
cannot be determinate by God.

Answ. That which is moved by an external cause, is said to be compelled, if
the external cause take away the proper inclination of the second cause; but
if it leave the second cause to the own proper inclination, then it is not
said to be compelled, but to work freely.

Object. But the motion is rather ascribed to him who mooves, than to that
which is moved, as we say not that the stone killed the man, but the man who
threw the stone; if God then moove the will, it might seem that the will were
free and not to be blamed in the action.

Answ. If the will were so moved by God that it moved not it self, then the
will were neither to be praised nor to be blamed: but seeing it is both moved
and moves it self, and is not like a stone in a man's hand, which is moved and
moves not it self; therefore it is to be blamed in the sinful action.

The Will, in moral and civil actions, is not determinate, in the means,
which lead to the end: (for that the understanding does only) but respecting
the end, it, both determinates it self naturally, and is determinate by God;
but in spiritual things, it is only determinate by God, both in the means and
in the end, Philip. 2.13. It is God who works both the will and the deed in
us.

The grace of God determinates the will only to good: conversion of Man does
power in a supernatural grace in his heart; but yet this grace does not
determinate the heart of man, Corvinus c. 43. page 642. so Fonseca.
for that the will does naturally and freely; and to draw out the act of Faith
(say they) there needs no concurrance of the grace of God, but only moral
persuasions. So Fonseca, who holds that God only sets the will on work, but
leaves the will to work by it self, he determinates (says he) only in
specificatione, but not in exercitio; in inclining the will to embrace such an
object, but the operation about that object is left free unto the will it
self, this it may perform freely without Gods grace.

Object. But it may seem that God determinates the sinful actions of men as
well as their moral, both in the means and in the end, and is the cause of
the one as well as of the other, as God knows certainly that the Antichrist
will sin, therefore the will of the Antichrist is determinate to sin, by
the decree of God.

Answ. Eternum decretum^ Dei ponit infallibilitatem consequentis, sed non
consequentiae.
This follows not, because putting the decree of God, the Antichrist will
sin; these two go not together as the cause and the effect, for Gods decree
is not the cause why the Antichrist sins; but it only follows Gods
foreknowledge and is not an effect of it, for there is a twofold connection of
things; first, of the cause with the effect, and so the effect necessarily
follows the cause. Secondly, Duplex connexiorcrum, 1. causa cum effectu, 2.
ante cedentis cum conse quente.
of the antecedent with the consequent: the finne of the Antichrist is the
consequent of Gods decree infallibly, but not productively, because the decree
is not the cause of it.

Object. But it may seem that Gods decree is the cause of sin, Ioh. 12.39.
They could not believe, for Esaias said, he blinded their eyes, and hardened
their hearts. Here it night seem that the Prophets prediction was the cause of
the hardening of their hearts, and not the antecedent of it only.

Answ. These evil things God foreseeth to fall out, because they are to fall
out; and they fall not out because he foreseeth them to fall out: when I see a
man writing, he writes not because I see him writing, but because he is writing
therefore I see him write; so, the Antichrist sins not because God foresaw
him to sin, but because the Antichrist was to sin therefore God foresaw him
to sin. God foreseeth other ways good actions, for he decrees them, and
they fall out as effects of his decree: but it is far otherways in man's
sinful actions, for they are not the effects of Gods decree, but a necessary
consequent of it.

The essential property of the Will (which is liberty) cannot be changed, but
the equality of the Will (which is good or evil) may be changed.

There are two things to be considered in the will. First, (...) or the essence
of it. Secondly, (...) or the operation of the Will: the essence of the Will
cannot be changed but the operation may be changed: it may lose holiness and
sanctification in the choice, but not the essence of it: a clock when it is
out of frame shows the time but not the true time of the day, and as the
sailors compass stricken with thunder, the point of the needle stands always
at some ayrth, but not at the right ayrth; and so when Wine is turned into
Vinegar it keeps still the color and quantity, but it has lost the right
relish: so the Will of man after the fall, freely chooses that which it
chooses, Non corrumpitur quoad agendi radicem sed terminum. A collation betwixt
the innocent and old Adam.


Man in his first estate^, willed only good, both in the end, and in the
means: but man in his corrupt estate wills the end, either as good or apparent
good; but he makes choice of the means often as evil: the will respects the
end, and election the means; no man wills the end as it is evil; but the
means leading to this end are oftentimes chosen as evil. The adulterer and
the thief, (...); sed media eleguntur plerunque ut mala, ut finem assequamur.
they will the proper ends of their adultery and theft (which are pleasure and
gain) as good or at the least good in show; but the means they know are
oftentimes evil, and choose them as evil that they may attain to their ends.
Again, the unregenerate man sometimes wills the end but not the means, Prove.
13.4. The sluggard wills, and he wills not; he wills the end because it is good;
but he wills not the means because they are painful and laborious; so Hos.
10.11. Ephraim as an ox delighted in threshing but not in plowing; he
delighted in threshing, because the ox might not be muzled when he did
thresh; Deuteronomy. 25.4. but he delighted not in plowing; that is, to take the
pains to plow up his heart, and mortify his sins; Balaam wished, that he
might die the death of the righteous, Numb. 23.14. but he endeavored not to
live the life of the righteous.

Man after his fall had liberty in civil and moral actions.

This liberty which man has now in his corrupt estate, Impedimenta libertatis
humana sunt, vel extra se, vel in^se.
and although our election be free yet the execution thereof is not in our
hands. There be three external impediments in our liberty; first, Gods
overuling of the will of Man, who although he take not away the liberty of
the will from us, Impedimenta externa sunt deus, diabolus, and externa obiecta.
yet he oftentimes furthers us in good, and hinders us in evil; and bridles so
the fury of the wicked that they cannot come to the ends which they aim at; as
we see in Jeroboam, 1 King. 13.5. and Sennacherib, Esa. 37.29. For the ways
of man are not in his own power, Pro. 16.9. The second inpediment of our
liberty is Satan's seducing, who oftentimes seduceth the will when it is
inclyned to good and persuades it to evil, Ephe. 2.2. which persuasion is
effectual in the sons of infidelity: sometimes Satan hinders the children
of God, as he hindered the Apostle that he should not come to the
Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians. 4.17.18. The third outward impe^diment is, the
multitude of objects laid before us, which partly allure the mind if they be
pleasant, and terrify the mind in they be fearful. Impedimenta interna
sunt, destitutio imaginis Dei, caecitas intellectus, infirmitas, violuntatis,
naturalis violentia, pronitas ad malu^ and vehementia affectionum.


The inward impediments which hinder the wills liberty, are. First, the want
of Gods image. Secondly, the blindness of the understanding. Thirdly, the
infirmity of the will. Fourthly, a natural violence; Fifthly, a pronenesse to
evil. Sixthly, the vehemency of the affections, which draw the will after
them, and trouble the Judgment.

CHAP. XVII. Of Man's Will in his conversion.
IN the first point of Man's Conversion,

The conversion of Man is not wrought, The third property of the Will.
first by stirring up of his Will, Socrates said that he was but to his
scholars like a midwife; for a midwife does nothing but helps forth the
birth already conceived: so he said, that he only but drew forth the wit,
which was naturally within the scholars. But it is not so in the first point
of a man conversion, for the Preacher does not help forth the graces in a man;
but he is like a father, begetting him a new a gain through the Gospel, 1.
Cor. 4.15.

Man before his conversion to grace is passive.

There is in some patient a near power, Potentia, vel est propinqua, vel
remoto, passiva, vel mere passiva.
as when powder is laid to the fire it has a near power to be kindled by the
fire. Secondly, there is in some patient a remote power as when green wood is
laid to the fire, it may be kindled although it be long ere it burn. Thirdly,
there is in a patient a passive or obedientiall power, or that which they call
potentia (...), or susceptiva, as when the potter makes a vessel of clay.
Fourthly, there is a mere passive power; as a stone has no aptnes to be made
a living creature. Man before his conversion, is not like powder, which had a
near power to take fire; he is not like green wood which. has a remote power
to take fire; he is not like the stone that is mere passive; but he is like
the clay in the potters hand that is passive and capable to be formed
according to the will of the potter; and in this fense is that of Augustine to
be understood, Velle credere est gratiae, sed posse credere est naturae, to be
willing to believe is of grace, but to be able to believe is of nature; which
Cajetan expounds well, posse credere is meant of the potential or obediential
power. God has three sorts of works which he works in our justification.
First, Tria genera operam Deus operatur in nostra justificatione.
such works as are only proper to God, as to stand at the door and knock,
Revel. 3.^0. to open the heart, and to inspire, etc. In which our will, gives
neither concourse nor cooperation; therefore in these we are only passive;
and the will is actived, not being as yet active it self; Non habet activum
concur sum hic, sed solum modo recipit, the will has no active concourse unto
grace here, it has only an aptness to receive, faith being wrought in it.
Secondly, the begetting of new qualities in the habit: as Faith, Hope, and
Charity, for to the bringing forth of such excellent qualities, nature can do
nothing; Man here also is passive, as the air when it is illuminate by the
light. Thirdly, such works in the act, as to believe, repent, etc. which God
works not in us without us; unto which purpose is applied that of Paul, 1 Cor.
15. The grace of God with me; and that of Augustine, cooperando perficit, quod
operando incepit; so the will of man, by this concurring grace is made,
pedissequa, and a subordinate agent unto grace, grace being comes and dux;
August. Epist. 406.
and the will being pedissequa, sed non praevia, attending grace, but no ways
going before.

In the point of Man's conversion the will being moved, afterward moves it
self.

This action of the will is, first from grace; and secondly from the will it
self; in both these acts God concurres as the first agent, and the will as the
secondary In the state of corruption, the Will is the true efficient cause of
sin, in the estate of justification, the will is truly endued with grace;
but in both these estates the Will is a true efficient, but differently: for in
the sinful estate the will is the principal efficient; but in the estate of
grace it is subordinate to the grace of God, and not collateral; the holy
Ghost quickening it and reviving it to work, and so by the grace of God we are
that we are, 1 Cor. 15.10.

Quest. Whether is the conversion of man, with his Will, or against his Will?

Answ. Voluntas confideratur ut est natura quaedam, and ut est principium
suarum actionum.
The Will is considered two ways. First, Vt est natura quaedam, as it is a
creature ready to obey God, who rules the universe. Secondly, Vtest principium
suarum actionum, whereby it freely wills, or nils; in the first sense it is not
against the will that it is converted; in the second sense, as it is corrupted,
willing sin freely, (before sin be expelled) it is against the Will. The
water has the proper inclination to go downward to the center, yet when it
ascends upward and keeps another course, ne detur vacuum, lest there should be
any emptiness in nature, it runs a course contrary to the own proper
inclination: so when the will obeys God (in the first act of man's
conversion,) it is not against the Will, if ye respect the will as it follows
the direction of God; but if ye respect the will, as it is corrupt and
sinful, it is against the will to obey God.

Quest. Thom. cont. gentil. de miraculis.
Whether is the conversion of man, a miracle, or not?

Answ. Dua conditiones requiruntur ut aliquid fit miraculum, 1 ^e causa fit
occulta, 2. ut sit in re, unde aliter videatur debere evenire.
We cannot call it a miracle; for there are two conditions required in a
miracle. First, that the cause which produces the effect, be altogether
unknown to any creature; for if it be known to some, and not to others, it is
not a miracle; the eclipse of the Sun, seems to the country man a miracle,
yet a Mathematician knows the reason of it, therefore it is not a miracle.
The second condition required in a maracle is, that it be wrought in a thing
which had an inclination to the contrary effect: as when God raises the dead
by his power, this is a miracle, because it is not according to the nature of
the dead that ever they should rise again: So when Christ cured the blind,
this was a miracle, for nature would never make a blind man to see; so when
Christ cured Peter's mother in law of a fever on a sudden, this was a miracle,
for nature could not do this in an instant. If any of these two former
conditions be lackeing it is not a Miracle. Therefore in the defect of the
second condition, the creation of the world is not a miracle, because such a
great effect is proper to the nature of so glorious a cause: but if Man or
Angel could create, it were a miracle, for it is contrary to their finite
nature to produce such an infinite effect. So, the creation of the Soul is not
a miracle, because God works ordinarily here, nature preparing the body, then
God infuseth the Soul. But if God should create a Soul without this
preparation of nature, this should be a miracle in respect of the second
condition: as when he created Eve without the help of Adam, and Christ's
manhood in the womb of the Virgin, Creatio est opus magnum, sed non miraculum.
without the Virgin. So the conversion of Man is not a miracle, because the
reasonable Soul was once created to the Image of God, and is again capable of
the grace of God. When we heat cold water by fire, although it be contrary to
the inclination of the form of the water to be hot, yet it may receive
heat, and when it receives heat it is not a miracle. But improperly the
conversion of Man may be said to be a miracle, in respect of the first
condition required in a miracle, because it is done by God who is an unknown
cause to us, and although it be not properly a miracle, because the second
condition is deficient, yet it is a greater work than a miracle, Nam aliquid
est majus opus, sed minus miraculum, ut creatio.

In Man's conversion we must not take from grace,

It was a maxim received amongst the Jews, Satius est addere de profano ad
sacrum, quam demere de sacro and addere ad profanum; they had rather take from
the profane day, and add to the Sabbath, than to take from the holy Sabbath,
and add to the profane day: but men now had rather take from grace and give
to nature, than take from nature and give to grace.

When the Fathers labored to overthrow one error, they fell in another: as a
gardner when he goes to make straight a crooked sprigge, he bends it some
times too far the other way: so they, that they might absolutely defend the
grace of God against the maintainers of freewill, they rooted out freewill, and
gave man freedom in no actions, but concluded all under the necessity of Gods
predestination as did the Stoickes among the heathen. But we must not so stand
in the defense of grace that we overthrow free will, neither must we ascribe
that to free will, which is due to grace only.

The Jesuits that they may plead for free will in man, have found out a new
platform of man's salvation; for first, they establish a middle sort of
knowledge in God; by which he knows things that are to come, Iesuitae
triplicem scientiam statuunt in Deo, 1 simplicis intelligentiae, 2. visionis,
3. media.
(not absolutely but conditionally) what man or Angel may be able to do by
the freedom of their wills, no decree of God going before,) considering them
in such or such a condition, with such or such circumstances. But there is no
such middle sort of knowledge in God, for God knows all his works from the
beginning, Acts 15.18. God knows all these things that are conditional,
although they never take effect, absolutely and perfectly: as for example, he
foresaw that Abimelech the King of Gerer would have defiled Abraham's wife,
nevertheless he hindered him that he finned not with her by his restraining
grace, Genesis 20.6. I know that thou did this in the simplicity of thine heart,
therefore I have kept thee that thou should not sin against me, neither
touch her. So, Exodus, 13.17. God would not bring the Israelites directly to the
land of Canaan, but be led them about by a large circuit, lest perhaps (says
God) it forethinke them, when they see the enemy come against them, and they
return back to Egypt; this word perhaps is not a doubting in God, or a middle
sort of knowledge, but certainly he foresaw it would have come to pass,
therefore he prevented it by a sure remedy. Duplex scientiae in Deo simplicis
intelligentiae visionis.
There is no sort of knowledge in God, but either, simplicis intelligentiae, or
vistonis; simplicis intelligentiae, is of things possible, scientia visionis is
of things that certainly come to pass.

Object. But they allege that place, 1 Samuel 23.11.12. when David consults with
God, what would become of him if he stayed at Keilah, whether the Keilites
would deliver him into the hands of Saul or not: it was answered conditionally
in this sense, if ye stay, Saul will come, and if he come, the Keilites will
deliver you up into his hands: hence they reason thus: God foretold this future
condition: therefore he foreknew it. But he foreknew it. not by the first sort
of knowledge, because that is of things possible, which may come to pass, or
not come to pass; neither does God foreknow this by the second sort of
knowledge, because that is of things that will certainly come to pass; but it
is a third sort of knowledge of things that may come to pass conditionally.
Therefore say they, there is a middle sort of knowledge in God.

Answ. This sort of Knowledge, Hypothetica propositio, potest esse vera in
connexione, and falsa in partibus.
that is proposed conditionally, is absolute in God, and depends not upon the
uncertainetie of the condition, for an hipotheticall or conditional
proposition may be true in the connection, and yet in the parts it may be
false; and so God knows it to be false. The Apostle says, If an Angel come
from heaven and teach another Gospel than that which we have taught, let him be
accursed, Gal. 1.8. But an Angel cannot come from heaven to teach another
Gospel, So, 1 Kings 22.28. If thou return again in peace, the Lord has not
spoken by me. But the Lord spoke by the Prophet Micajah, and the King was never
to return in peace. Although these speeches be conditionally set down, yet
God knows them absolutely that they shall either come to pass, or not come to
pass: and so there is not a middle sort of knowledge in God.

Quest. How did God force David's betraying by the Keilits unto Saul, whether
contingently or necessarily?

Ans. When God looks ad opposita, he produces his effects freely, and
contingently, because it must either be or not be; as the Keilites might have
delivered or not delivered, David into the hands of Saul; but when God
determinates himself to one of the opposites, then he absolutely and
necessarily foreknowes it; as he knew absolutely that David should flee and
not be betrayed: That which is contingent conditionally in the cause, may be
infallibly necessary in the effect, as, if Peter run, he mooves; here he
mooves necessarily because he runs, and yet he runs not necessarily; for
he may either run or not run: so this betraying of David was necessary in
the effect if he had stayed at Keilah, but it was contingent in the cause, for
he might either have stayed there or not stayed. Conditionale in causa, potest
esse necessarium in effectu.
Act. 28. Paul says If any of you go out of the ship ye shall all perish;
but if ye stay in the ship ye shall all be saved: they might have stayed
in the ship or gone out of her, but respecting the event, they behooved to
stay in the ship and be saved: So that, contingent things fall under the
providence of God, and Gods providence takes not away their contingency, no
more then it did alter the nature of the bones of Christ, when he foresaw that
a bone of him should not be broken, Ioh. 19.36. but necessarily the events of
them follow and are foreseen of God. When God wills a thing it comes not
necessarily to pass; but when God wills a thing necessarily, then it must come
to pass: God wills the eclipse of the Sun, he wills but this contingently,
because it may either be or not be; but when he wills the eclipse necessarily,
then it must come to pass; in sensu conjuncto, that which he wills it must
come to pass; but in sensu diviso, that which he will, may not come to pass;
for he needed not to have willed it: for as Thomas in his Book, contra
gentiles says, Quaedam eveniunt ex necessitate suppositionis and
immutabilitatis, eo modo quo provisa sunt, sciz contingenter and libere; ea
quae Deus determinavit libere and contingenter eventura, ea contingenter
evenient; and necessario quae determinavit necessano. That is, some things fall
out by necessity of supposition and immutabilitie, that same way whereby they
are foreseen: to wit, contingently and freely; but those things which God has
determinated to fall out contingently and freely, they shall fall out
contingently; and those things that he has determinate necessarily to come to
pass, shall of necessetie be.

Quest. Seeing the purposes of God are but absolute, why are his promises and
threatenings set down conditionally?

Answ. He sets them down conditionally to move sinners more earnestly to
repent, Ion. 3.5. Yet forty days and Ninive shall be destroyed. But he
keeps up the condition here, to move the Ninivites the more earnestly to
repentance; and the event shows, that this was Gods purpose not to destroy
the Ninivites, because they repented here by degrees he manifests his counsel
unto them.

Example, when a town is beleaguered, the Counsel of war ordaines that
whosoever goes upon the walls shall die the death, this is to terrify
soldiers, that they go not upon the walls; the enemy make a sudden assault in
the night, a soldier runs up upon the walls, and repells the enemy; whether
shall this man die for it or not? the Counsel of war explaines themselves,
and that which they set out absolutely before, they interpret it now this way;
our meaning was that no soldier should go up upon the walls that he might
not give intelligence to the enemy: but this soldier has repelled the enemy;
therefore he has not violated our Law, neither is he culpable of death. See
the example of Jonathan, 1 Samuel 13. So when God says forty days, and Ninive
shall be destroyed, keeping up the condition, if they repented not; when they
repent, he explaines his former sentence, and shows that it was not absolutely
his meaning they should die, but only to terrify them, and to moove them to
repentance.

The Jesuits, when they subordinate the Will of man, to the conditional
knowledge of God; they leave man's will indifferent here, to choose or not to
choose; and upon this freedom of man's will, they ground the decree of God, to
predestinate this man, and to reject that man. But if this platform hold, then
it will follow, that when the will of this man imbraceth grace, Voluntas neque
est causa neque conditio predestinationis ut Iesuitae statuunt.
and the will of that refuses it, it must either be the cause of
predestination or the condition; but no Christian ever said that the will of
man was the cause of predestination, except the Pelagians and their followers;
if they make this act of the will the condition of man's election, then they
jumpe with the Arminians, who measure the efficacy of grace from the event of
the will, which notwithstanding some of the Jesuits strongly deny?

Quest. If the will be neither the cause nor condition of our predestination,
which is it then?

Ans. It is but a mean, for the fulfilling of man's predestination; for a man's
name is not written in the Book of life because he assents willingly, to the
promises of the Gospel, and believes them: but because his name is written in
the book of life, therefore he believes, Act. 13.48. As many as were ordained
unto eternal life believed. If a King should discern that none should be
courtiers with him, unless they were trained first up in the wars; this
trianing up in the wars is neither the cause not yet the condition, which
mooves the King to make choice of them; it is a mean whereby they are received
into the Court, but no motive which moved the King. So, Faith whereby a man is
adopted to be the Son of God, is neither the cause nor yet the condition
which mooves God to elect Man, but whom he electeth freely, them he gives to
believe.

If it be asked of Bellermine, wherefore this man is saved and not that man? he
will answer that there is no other cause but the good pleasure and will of God.

Secondly, if it be asked of him; why he gives this man gratiam congruam, or
fitting grace, and not that man? he will answer: because his will is to save
this man, and not that man.

Thirdly, if it be asked of him, wherefore this man receives grace and not that
man? he will answer: because grace is fitting for this man and not for that
man: he calls this fitting grace, not when the will is determinate by grace
(as we hold,) Physica determinatione, Triplex determinatio, physica, eventu,
and moralis.
or Hyperphysica rather; neither will he make it to depend ab eventu, as the
Arminians do from the Will of man; but he finds out a middle betwixt these
two, placing it only in moral persuasions, and the efficacy of the wills
determination to depend upon Gods grace: for God (says he) foreseeth, Duplex
sensus, divisus and compositus.
that the will cannot refuse, because he has fitted it so to the will, at
this time and in this place; so that he cannot now absolutely reject the grace
of God, but conditionally: and he says in sensu diviso he may reject the
grace of God; but not in sensu composito. Example, when I see a man writing, he
cannot but write; and yet considering this act of writing by it self, he
writes freely; so joining Man's Will with Gods Decree, a man cannot but Will;
and yet respecting the Will in it self, he may Will grace or not Will it when
it is offered to him, because grace does determinate his Will (says he) here
he wills infallibiliter, sed non necessario. Dupliciter aliquis vult,
infallibiliter, and necessario.


But the Arminians hold that the conversion of man altogether depends from his
Will, and that there is no other cause why this man chooses and that man
refuses grace, but only the will.

Fourthly, if it be asked, whether or no this man may resist the grace of God
or not? he will answer; by the absolute freedom of his will, he may resist
it; by this it follows that they will establish a real act in the will,
which is neither subject to Gods providence, nor predestination; but if they
acknowledged the consent of the will, to be a mean for the fulfilling of
predestination, in this we would agree with them.

Secondly, Triplex gratia, sufficiens abundans, and efficax.
the Jesuits that they may plead for free will make three sorts of grace,
sufficient, abundant, and effectual grace, and they make abundant grace a
higher degree than sufficient grace; as that grace which was offered to Corazin
and Bethsaida, Matthew. 11. because they had a more effectual calling than Tire
and Sidon: they make that effectual grace, when one actually receives the
grace offered, and applies it to himself.

But this distinction of grace cannot hold, for how can that be sufficient
grace, which never takes effect, seeing none was ever saved, or ever shall be
saved, by this sufficient grace, which is not effectual; sufficient grace has
ever the own effect, for whom God will have converted, they cannot but be
converted, Romans 9.19. Who can resist the will of God? Again those that are
not converted, they of themselves cannot be converted, God gives them neither
willingness nor sufficient grace (to whom is he debtor?) for if God gave them
this willingness, then it should be both sufficient and effectual grace to
them.

But we hold that both sufficient and effectual grace are the free gifts of
God, because, without me (says Christ) ye can do nothing, Ioh. 15.5. Neither
in sufficient, nor in effectual grace. Again, we hold that abundant and
effectual grace, are only offered to the Elect; and that which was offered to
Cherazin and Bethsaida was only sufficient to leave them inexcusable and not
to convert them.

Thirdly, the Jesuits plead for nature, holding that God concurres generally
only with the second causes, in giving them a natural power to work; but not
by mooving and applying them to their operations, as the Carpenter applies his
axe to cut. Neither (say they) has he any influence in the action it self;
ascribing nothing to God, but the conservation of the second causes; and if he
work with the second causes, Becan. tract. de deo.
they make not man subordinate to God, but as two causes working together, as a
weak and a strong man carrying a load.

But we hold, that God not only concurres generally with the second causes,
but applies and mooves the second cause to work; not as the second causes are
coordinate with God, but as subordinate; so that when God works upon his Will,
he gives not only a general influence, whereby he sustaines the Will; but
also he has a particular influence into it: neither is the will his fellow
helper in the action, but subordinate to him, for in producing of the effect
God likewise concurs particularly.

To conclude this point, that the will of man separates not it self, 1 Cor.
4.7. it is manifest thus; if equal grace he offered to two, and an inequall
effect follow, the one of them embracing grace, and the other of them refusing;
one of these two absurdities must necessarily follow, either that the grace of
God was not an equal remedy for both, because it cured them not both, which is
blasphemy; or else that there was not a like corruption in both, which is flat
Pelagianisme; If man's will make the separation, then the Apostles question, 1.
Cor. 4.7. (who has separated thee) is easily answered; and man then should
have wherein to boast, Romans 11.18.

God is only the effectual cause of man's conversion.

There are three sorts of causes. Physical cause Secondly, Triplex causa,
Physica, moralis, and miraculosa.
a moral cause. Thirdly, a miraculous cause. A Physical cause, is that which
really and truly produces the effect, and is called an effectual cause in the
Schools. A moral cause, is improperly and metaphorically a cause, because it
produces not properly an effect, only it proposes arguments to induce or to
persuade. A miraculous cause is that which works above the course of nature.

God in man's conversion, is not only the moral cause; because moral
persuasions suffice not to produce a supernatural effect, it only proposes
arguments, counsels, and commands, but cannot incline the heart directly. When
a Father holds up an apple to his child; or when the master of the game, sets
up (...), a reward to the runners; he does nothing but allure or persuade
them, he makes them not able to run.

Secondly, God is not only the moral cause of man's conversion; for then he
should have no greater stroke in man's conversion, than the Devil has, in
perverting the children of disobedience, to their destruction: for the Devil
in man's destruction, only inticeth, allureth, and seduceth, but he changes
not his Will; and works only per illicium, enticing him only to sin; but
the man himself changes not his will: God does not only work upon our wills
by moral persuasions, proposing rewards to us, exhorting and commanding us;
but changes and directly works upon the will, therefore the Apostle says,
Philip. 2.13. Both the will and the deed are from him.

God is the Physical cause of man's conversion, Deus non tantum est causa
moralis aut miraculosa conversionis humanae; physica, aut quasi physica.
or rather like a Physical cause, by drawing, inclining, and mooving the
heart. A man is put in the fetters, one gets him out of the fetters by one of
two means. First, he uses moral persuasions to him to come forth, then he
comes as a Physical cause by breaking his bolts and taking him forth: if God
did nothing in man's conversion, but by moral persuasions, then he should
never come out of the fetters; for by nature he is like the deaf Adder that
stops his ear at the voice of the enchanter, Psa. 58. God is not the
miraculous cause of man's conversion; because the conversion of man is not a
miracle, as we have showen before.

When God converts a man to grace; first,

In order of causes, God first he opens the heart, Jesuits make God when he
enters, the efficient cause of man's conversion; Greg. de Valen. dis. 8. g. 3.
p. 4.
and they make the heart when it opens, the material, or dispositive cause of
man's conversion; and one of them goes about to clear the matter by this
comparison out of Dominicus a Soto, thus. Duplex causa; efficicus, and
dispositiva.
When the wind beats upon a window, by entering in, it opens the window, and
by opening the window it enters in; in respect of the efficient cause it enters
in by motion, but in respect of the dispositive cause, it first opens, and then
enters.

But his comparison is false, for God must first open the heart, and enter;
before ever the heart open and we receive grace; so that the second act of God,
and our opening, are simul tempore; for when we receive, he opens; and when he
has entered, and opened, we receive; although Gods opening go before in order
of causes, yet in time it goes with our receiving, as the fish takes the
hook, and the hook the fish, at the same time; but in order of causes, the
hook is presented first to the fish.

Bellarmine, in his sixth Book, of Free Will and Grace, Chap. 15. sums up the
co-working of the Grace of God with Free Will in man, in these conclusions
following.

Man has a remote power before he get grace,

Man has not a remote power to do good as the green wood has a remote power
to take fire, a passive or obedientiall power, whereby grace makes him able, to
the works of holiness.

Man before his conversion, a near and a perfect power, (before grace be
offered,) to the works of holiness: and therefore in the works of piety he
can do nothing of himself.

This proposition we willingly grant, for man's will is not like powder ready
presently to take fire.

Stirring up grace, helping grace sufficient to man's conversion.

This proposition might be granted, Pelagians, who denied all grace, and
against the sem-Pelagians, who acknowledged preventing grace, but not stirring
up grace; and we would grant to it, if by stirring up grace, he meant infused
grace, which after that it is infused into the heart of man it stirs him up to
do good.

This stirring up grace,

We agree to this proposition, if by stirring up grace, infused grace.

Stirring up grace is not granted to man, without his working, although it be
given to him without the cooperation of free will: this proposition he goes
about to clear thus; stirring up grace (says he) comprehends two things in
it. First, initium bonae cogitationis. Secondly, initium boni desiderij; but,
to think, and desire, are the actions of the mind and will; wherefore a man
cannot desire and think any thing, without his own action. Yet because there
are some sudden motions, which antevert all deliberation of reason; therefore
they cannot be the acts of free will, such are these impure thoughts, that are
cast into the heart by the Devil, against our will these are the free motions
of the will; therefore the Apostle, Romans 7. says, I do not these things, but
sin that dwells in me; so it may be said of these first good thoughts because
they proceed not from the will, I do not these,

These primoprimi motus, which antevert the use of reason, are partly with the
will; and partly against the will; they are not with the will, because they
arise before the consent of the will; neither are they against the will, for
then the heart should not delight it self in them when then arise. So the
first motions of the spirit in the heart, are not altogether with the will,
because it is sinful; neither altogether against the will, because the will is
subordinate to God, and begins to take some delight in them. (...).
We must distinguish these three motions of the will, involuntarium,
voluntarium, non voluntarium: involuntarium, when the will no ways wills a
thing; voluntarium when the will wills it altogether; non voluntarium, when it
partly wills it, and partly wills it not: in this last sense it is, that our will
consents to the working of Gods Spirit in our conversion.

That we may assent to stirring up grace, helping grace is necessary.

We agree to this proposition, infused grace.

Neither stirring up grace, helping grace, impose any necessity to man, but
that he may either choose or refuse Gods calling.

We hold that after grace is infused in the heart, will to do good, yet it
necessitates it.

It may be that two having the same internal motion,

We hold, will of the man called inwardly, is so determinate by grace, that he
cannot but choose his conversion; but the will of the other not being
determinate by grace cannot choose it.

The conversion of man to God, a work, it proceeds from free will only, and
Gods general help assisting; as it is good, it is only from grace; as it is
a good work, it is partly from the will and partly from grace; and he goes
about to prove this; because (says he) the efficient cause of humane actions
(as they are actions) is the will of man; and as they are free-actions, they
proceed from the freedom of the will; and as they are godly actions, they
proceed of grace; therefore grace makes the action good and supernatural.

We hold that the action, good, but considering it, as it is an action
proceeding from the will, is necessitate by God.

These actions which a man does after his conversion,

Man after his conversion has need of a continual influence of grace, of one
to blow them, otherwise they will make no sound; they would make the grace of
God in man (being once infused,) to be like a clock, if the peses be drawn up
in the morning, it will go right all the day.

The habit of grace is infused into the heart,

We hold that before grace be infused in the heart, there is no preparation in
man. And thus far Bellarmine goes about to prove that there is free will in
man naturally yet unto good, and would extenuate the grace of God.

The efficatious grace of God, being offered to man,

We are to mark, will of man can do before his conversion to God; secondly,
Triplex consideratio voluntatis, ante conversionem; in primo puncto
conversionis; and post conversionem.
what it can do in the first point of his conversion: thirdly, what he does
after his conversion. And there is a threefold grace answerable to these three
estates: first, there is vocans, an external calling: secondly, Triplex
consideratio gratiae, in vocaendo, in operando, and in co-operando.
working grace internally, answering to the third estate. The first grace is
oftentimes resisted; Ier. 7.13. When J call upon you early in the morning, ye
answer me not, Psalm. 81.14. Oh that my people had hearkened unto me. So Matthew.
23.37. How often would I have gathered thee under my wings, but thou would
not. The working grace answering to our third estate, may be said to be
resisted, not simply, Duplex resistentia, simplex, and secundum quid.
but secundum quid; for this resistance is not betwixt the will and the grace
of God, but betwixt the flesh and the spirit, Romans 7. The working grace
answering to our second estate, cannot be resisted in the first point of man's
conversion: when God gives a man a will to convert, he must first take away the
resistance that hindered his conversion, before that ever he give him the will
to convert; if he first take not away the impediments he cannot convert: God
gives not grace to a man that resist in the compound sense (as they speak in
the schools, Duplex sensus gratiae and resistentiae, divisus, and compos^tus.
) that is, so long as he remains unwilling he gives him not grace, but in a
divided sense, when he gets grace, resistance is taken from him.

Resistance is, when two strive together: if they be of equal strength, then
the one of them prevails not against the other, incompleta resistentia, an
imperfect resistance, but if the patient be of such strength, that is
frustrates the agent of his purpose, then it is called completa resistentia,
Triplex resistenti; aequalis, completa, and incompleta.
a perfect resistance. When Michael the archangell, and the devil, strove
about the body of Moses, Jude 9. if the devil had gotten the body of Moses,
and had set it up and made an Idol of it, then it had been a perfect
resistance; but Michael prevailing against the devil it was an imperfect
resistance. So when the will of man striveth against the grace of God; if these
two were of equal force, then the one of them should not prevail against the
other; but because they are not of equal force, although the will resist for a
time, yet he yeeldes to the stronger, the grace of God: and so it is but an
imperfect resistance, for at last it yelds to the grace of God.

Man in his conversion cannot resist the grace of God; Bellarmines is false.
Lib. 6. degrat. and l. arb. Quidam dei gratiam reijciunt; quidam neque
recipient neque reijciunt; quidam neque reijciunt, neque recipient sed
delectanturan ea: quidam apperiunt corda ut gratiam recipiant.
First, he says, that some who are called inwardly by the spirit, may reject
the calling together. Secondly, some neither receive the grace of God nor
reject it, but suffer God to knock at the heart, and is no ways moved by it
to open. Thirdly, some neither receive nor reject grace, but they begin to be
delighted with it. Fourthly, some open their hearts, and suffer themselves to
be drawn by the grace of God: this is false, for it is the Lord only, that
has the key of the heart to open or shut.

Man in his first estate, A collation betwixt the innocent, and renewed Adam.
had not need of preventing grace, yet he had need of stirring up, or
preparing grace, to stir him up not from sin or sluggishnesse, but from the
intermission of his action: but man regenerate has need of preventing grace,
preparing grace, working grace, and perfecting grace; and as the Lord promised,
Deuteronomy. 11.12. Mine eye shall be upon this land from the beginning of the year
to the end: so unless God look upon man, from the beginning to the end of his
conversion, all is in vain. We see, Numb. 17. when Aarons rod was laid before
the Lord. First, he made it to bud, although it had no root. Secondly, to
blossom. Thirdly, to bring forth ripe almonds: So although there be no grace
in us, yet the Lord stirs up good motions in our hearts; then he seconds
these with new desires, then at last he make us to bring forth good fruit: so
that the beginning, progress and end of all good works come of God; when we
acknowledge this from our heart, then we offer a burnt offering to the Lord.

But it is said in Mark. 4.26. that the Kingdom of God is like a husbandman,
who when he had sown his seed, he lies down and sleeps; and in the mean
time it grows and shoots forth into the blade, and then to the ear; therefore
it may seem; that when God has once sown the seed of grace, he adds not a
new influence of grace to it.

Answ. That parable is only meant of the Preacher, who after he has sown
the seed, can do no more, but commits the event to God; but the parable can
no ways be applied to God; for after that the seed is sown by God, he must
give both the first and the latter rain, or else it will not fructify: The
Schoolmen say well, ad singulos actus desideratur gratia, unto every action
that a man does grace is required.

Man in his restitution receiving the grace of God,

The certainety of the perseverance of the Saints in grace, Gratia saemel
recepta non potest amitti, respectu patris, filii and spiritus sancti.
is proved. First, in respect of God the Father. Secondly, in respect of God
the Son. Thirdly, in respect of God the holy Ghost. First, in respect of God
the Father, with whom there is no shadow of change; and none can pull his
sheep out of his hands, Ioh. 10.29. Secondly, in respect of God the Son, the
Apostle says, 1 Cor. 6. that, his members agglutinantur Christo; they are
glewed to him. Thirdly, in respect of the holy Ghost, he is called the earnest
penny of our salvation, 2 Cor. 5. he is not called the pledge of our salvation;
for a pledge may be laid in pane, and may be taken up again; but an earnest
penny is a part of the bargain and cannot be taken up again.

There is a mutual obligation betwixt God and man, Tim. 1.12. I know whom I
have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have
committed unto him, so, God gives the earnest penny of his Spirit to us;
Ephesians. 1.13. In whom also after that ye were sealed with the holy Spirit of
promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance; although we have the
possession of both, yet the keeping of both is committed to God who is a
faithful keeper, so that now the child of God, cannot fall away again, not
only in respect of the event, but also for the continuance of their Faith.

Quest. When a man falls into any notorious sin, as murder, or adultery;
whether is his faith lost or not?

Answ. Not, for he falls not from his universal and first justification,
whereby all his former sins were remitted to him, he falls only from the
particular justification of that fact; this guilt of that fact which is
particular, takes not away the first justification: here, Duplex iustificatio,
universalis and particularis.
amittit jus ad rem, sed non jus in re; he loses not the right of his former
justification, but only the use of it for the time; and when he repents of
that particular fact, he gets not a new right to his first justification, but
is restored again to the use of it. When Nebuchadnezzar became mad, he was
cast out of his Kingdom and lived amongst the beasts; when he became sober
again and understanding, he got not a new right again to his Kingdom, but
only was restord to his possession: so when a man falls by sin from God, when
he repents he gets not a new right to his justification, but only he gets the
right use of his former justification.

Quest. Whether is the child of God, quite cut off from Christ, when he commits
any great sin?

Answ. If we respect Gods part, he is not cut off: for justification upon Gods
part, implies not any quality in man, but his free favor in pardoning; so
that the question is not, what man deserved? but, what God does injustifying
man? It is he who justifies the ungodly, Romans 4.5. But if we respect man's part
in sinning, and according to his feeling before he repent, he is cut off; but
not respecting Gods first justification. A woman commits adultery, she
deserves to be repudiate from her husband, yet the marriage is never dissolved
upon her husbands part, until he give her the bill of divorce. So the sinner
when he falls into any great sin, upon his part he deserves fully to be cast
off; and yet he is not cast off by God, because he has not given him the bill
of divorce; demeritorie incurrit iram Dei, licet non effective, he deserves the
wrath of God, although the Lord power not out his wrath upon him.

Quest. What loses he then by his fall? Be ccatorneque amittit habitu m^neque
actum fidei, sed act us pro tom po^re suspenditur.


Answ. He loses not the habit of his faith, neither the act of his faith,
but only this act of his faith is suspended for the time, Act. 20.9. When
Eutyches fell down out of an upper loft, all that beheld him thought he had
been dead; yet when Paul embraced him in his arms, he said, he is not dead;
the act of life was not extinguished here, but suspended. So when the child of
God falls into any notorious sin, grace is not quite gone out of him. The
incestuous Corinthian who had lain with his fathers wife, 1 Cor. 5.1. was to
be excommunicated and cut off from the Church, That his spirit might be saved,
and the flesh destroyed; he had the spirit all this time in him when he had
fallen into this great sin, and had not quite lost the grace of God: so that
the child of God seems to be cut off for the time, and the holy spirit
seems to be quenched in him, yet grace comes in and blows up the
sparkles, that were lurking all this time under the ashes of sin: example of
this we may see in David, lying so long both in murder and adultery.

Therefore these who hold that a man may lose his justifying faith, fountain
of living water springing up unto eternal life in man, Ioh. 4. Neither can it
be totally taken from a man, and restored again, for Jude ver. 3. says, that
faith is but once given to the Saints. Peter after his fall, went out and wept
bitterly, Math. 26. Deus hic non infudit novum habitum, sed suscitavit, God
infused not a new habit in Peter, but wakened up the habit that was sleeping
in him; for his seed remained still in him, 1 Ioh. 3.

FINIS.
THE SECOND PART OF THE IMAGE of GOD in Man, in his Creation, Restoration, and
Glorification.
CHAP. I. Of the Passions of man in general.
A Passion,

They are called passions, faculties of the Soul, Tria insunt animae potentia,
habitus, and passiones.
which are naturally inbred in it; and betwixt the habits which are infused and
acquired; but the Passions, although they be naturally inbred in the soul, yet
they must be stirred up by outward objects. They are not like habits, which are
always alike and permanent, neither are they like bare imaginations and
fantasies drawn from the objects, and reserved in the memory: but they arise
from a known object laid up in the imagination, appearing to us either
pleasant or hurtful. They are wrought by an apprehension in the imagination,
because the imagination stirs up immediately the senses, then the
understanding faculty judges them to be true or false, and the will
considers them as good or evil. As the understanding judges them to be true
or false, it stirs not up the appetite, but as the will judges them to be
good or evil; yet not absolutely, but as good or evil to us, or ours: and
these faculties are rightly joined together, for the sensitive faculty of it
self is blind, neither could it follow or decline any thing unless the
understanding faculty directed it: so the understanding faculty were
needelesse, unless it had these passions joined with it, to prosecute the
truth, and to shun the falsehood.

Quest. Whether are these passions placed in the sensitive part, or in the
reasonable?

Answ. They are placed in the sensitive part, and not in the reasonable,
because the reasonable does not employ any corporal organs in her actions, for
when we reason, there is no alteration in the body. But the passions appear
in the blood, by changing and altering of our countenance, and they are a
middle betwixt the body and the mind, and have correspondency with both; Hence
it was that God commanded his people, to abstain from blood, Genesis 9.4. and
that they should offer blood in their sacrifices, Heb. 9.22. that so the soul
might answer for the soul which sinned, Levit. 17.11.12.

Although these passions be in the sensitive part, as in the subject, yet the
understanding is the principal cause which moves them. If there were a
commotion amongst the common people, moved by some crafty Achitophel, the
commotion is properly in the people as in the subject, but it is in the crafty
Achitophels head as in the cause, who moves the sedition. So these passions
are in the will and understanding, as commanding and ruling them; but in the
sensitive part, as in the proper subject. In beasts the fantasy sets the
sensitive appetite on work, but in man the fantasy apprehending the object,
presents it to the understanding, which considers it either as true or false,
and the understanding presents it to the will, and thence arises the
prosecution of the good; or shunning of the evil in the sensitive appetite,
with an alteration of the spirits in the body.

The passions of man ruled by reason.

We see by experience that these passions that draw nerest to reason, are
soonest subdued; passions that are furthest from reason, are more hardly
subdued. A man will sooner subdue his passions than a woman or a child,
because he has more reason, and a man will sooner quite his anger, than his
fleshly lusts; because they are all further from reason; and the Philosophers
show this by the example of a Horse or a Bull, they are sooner tamed, because
they draw nearer to reason, but the fishes cannot be tamed, because they have
no resemblance of reason.

Whether are the passions that antevert the will ruled by reason or not? Ans.
passions which antevert the will are not from the will and reason, neither are
they altogether against the will and reason, but partly with the will and
partly against the will. These passions which antevert the will, do not excuse
but extenuate the fact, in tanto, sed non in toto, they excuse the fact in a
part, but not fully.

These passions excuse sin, in tanto, sed non in toto; Rome makes of the
passions of the soul. Triplices motus in anima, primo primi motus, secundi
primo-motus, secundi motus.
They say there are first primo-primi motus in the soul, which arise suddenly
before reason think of them; these thoughts the will cannot repress, because
they proceed from our natural inclination; and are neither mortal nor
venial. Secondly, they say that there are secundo primi motus, which arise
suddenly after the first motions, these the will may repress (they say) if
she take diligent heed to them: these they make venial sins. Thirdly, (say
they) there are in the soul secundi motus, when the will gives the full
consent: they make these mortal sins. But the first motions of all without
consent are sin, and damned in the last Commandment; and the motions which
arise with consent, are damned in the seventh commandment by Christ, Mat.
5.28. He that lusts after a woman has committed adultery with her already
in his heart; then the motions which arise without consent, are damned in the
last commandment.

These perturbations do not extenuate sin so far as ignorance does.

The perturbations are ruled by prudencie, The servant that knows his Masters
will and does it not, shall be beaten with many stripes, Luke 12.47.

CHAP. II. Of the division of the Passions.
ALl the passions may be reduced first, (...). Of the passions in the
concupiscible appetite.
to the concupiscible and irascible faculties of the Soul. Secondly, there are
as many passions in the soul as there are diverse considerations of good and
evil. First, good and evil are considered absolutely; then love and hatred
have respect to these. Secondly, Passio amoris abono, and passio odij a malo.
good and evil are considered, in the good which may be obtained; and in the
will which is imminent; the good which is looked for and may be obtained, that
we desire, Passio desiderii and abeminationis.
and it is called desiderium. The evil if it be imminent has no proper name,
but is called abusively abomination, seu fugamali. Thirdly, when either the
good is obtained or the evil present; if the good be obtained, Passio gaudij
and tristitiae.
then it is called gaudi^m, joy: if the evil be present, then it is called
tristitia, sadness: so that there are six passions in the conpiscible.

In the irascible appetite there are five If the good be to come, and not
obtained; Of the passions in the irascible appetite.
either it is possible to obtain it, or impossible; if it be possible to
obtain it, it stirs up two affections in the irascible: first, hope, Passio
spei and audatiae.
which expects bonum difficile, that is, when goodness can hardly be
obtained. It has an eye to good; which distinguishes it from fear; it has
an eye to future good, which distinguishes it from joy, that enjoys the
present good. Hope looks to good hardly to be obtained, which distinguished it
from desire, that is, of things easily to be obtained. If the good may be
easily obtained, it stirs up audaciam boldness, this respects evil; but yet
such evil which it thinks it may overcome and it prosecuteth the means which
tend to the attaining of the good; it respects evil by accident, hoping to
shun it. Secondly, if the good be thought impossible to be attained, then it
works desperation: Passio desperationis and timoris.
this passion has not an eye to evil as evil but by accident, because it
sees the good impossible to be attained. If the evil be imminent and not
present, then it works fear: If the evil be present and impossible to be
eschewed, then it works anger, which has no contratie. Some of the Moralists
reduce all these passions to two, love and desire; Passioirae.
for whatsoever thing that is good is either in our present possession, and
this we love; or is absent and wished for, and this we desire; so that every
good thing, we either possess it, or desire to possess it. Again, these
passions may be reduced to four principal; for every passion is a motion to
good; and in this kind hope is the last; or a motion and turning from evil,
and in this kind fear is the last; or it is a rest and enjoying the good, and
in this kind delight is the last; or a rest lesnesse in the object, and in
this kind sadness is the last.

Those who write of the winds, Tristitia dividiturin misericordiam invidiam
angustiam poenitentiam, and zelum.
some make four of them, some eight, some sixteen, some thirty two; so these
who write of the passions, some make more and some make less. Every one of
these passions may be branched out again into several branches; as sadness
has under it; first pity, which is a grief of the evil which befalls
others, as if it befell our selves. Secondly, envy which is a sadness that we
conceive, for the good that be falls others, wishing that it were our own.
Thirdly, heaviness, which grieves the mind when it sees no way to escape.
Timor est erubescentie verecundie, stuporis aut agoniae.
Fourthly, repentance, which is a sadness for bypast sins. Fifthly, zeal,
which is a sadness arising from the dishonor of that which we love most. So
the daughters of fear are; first blushing which is a fear arising from the
loss of our good name, for some filthy thing presently done. Secondly,
shamefastness, which is a fear arising for some evil to be committed.
Thirdly, astonishment, which is the fear of some evil that suddenly befalls us
not looked for. Fourthly, agony, when we fear that which we no ways can
eschew; and so may the rest of the passions be branched forth.

The passions which are dispersed in the inferior faculties, superior.

As seeing, hearing and smelling, eminen ter. So the paissons in the sensitive
part, are distinguished into the irascible and concupiscibile faculties, and
upon diverse considerations arise diverse passions, six in the one and five in
the other, but in the will they are united eminenter, and have only but two
considerations either of good or evil.

The first Adam had these passions as they are eminenter in voluntate, for he
had prosecutionem boni, A collation betwixt the innocent Adam and second Adam
and the Angels.
and aversionem amalo, pursuit of good, and a turning from evil: but he had
not as yet distinct objects for them to work upon. Christ the second Adam had
distinct objects to exercise his passions upon, by taking the punishment of
our sins upon him: but Adam had not sadness, anger, and such actually, but
potentially. The Angels have joy, love and that filial reverence, whereby they
offend not God but they have not grief, sorrow, fear of punishment, and such
passions. Adam had his passions without perturbation or turbation. Christ had
his passions with turbation, but not with perturbation Ioh 11.33. he was
mightily troubled in the spirit and was troubled in himself* But we have our
passions with perturbation.

Christ took our passions upon him as he took our nature.

As he was Ben adam; the son of a man for us; Ben-enosh the son of a frail
man, Psalm. 8.5. subject to passions and miseries, he took our miserabiles
passiones, but not detestabiles; he took not our sinful passions upon him, as
despair or boldness; but he took all the rest; as in the concupiscible
appetite; he took our love upon him, our desire, our hatred of evil, our
abomination or abhorring of sin, our joy, our sadness. Again in the
irascible faculty, he took our anger and fear upon him: but he took not
despair upon him, because he thought not the evil of punishment laid before
him impossible to be overcome: he took not audaciam upon him, because it
looks to evil possibly to be eschewed: it looks directly to good, yet
because it looks accidentally to evil, he could not take it upon him.

Christ when he became man, without all affections, he was not (...),
impatiens affectionis, he was not (...), for his affections were not proper to
himself, but he was (...), having his affections well ordered; he was (...),
having his affections like ours; he was (...), for he had a fellow-feeling of
our infirmities; he was (...), Heb. 4.15. for he had such a fellow-feeling,
that he can measure out to every one of his members, that which is fit for
them to suffer.

Quest. How could Christ take our passions upon him, as our fear and sadness,
seeing he was comprehensor, and beheld the glory of God in the highest measure
of happiness?

Answ. By the fingular dispensation and wisdom of God; for this happiness
and glory was kept up, within the closet of the mind of Christ, that it came
neither to his body nor sensual part, and so he might be fully happy and
glorified in the superior faculty of the Soul, and yet this glory not to show
it self in his body, and inferior faculties, as it does now in glory.

Christ's passions when he lived here, A collation betwixt the second and old
Adam.
did not arise in him before reason directed them, they rose not contra
rationem, aut praeter rationem; contrary or besides reason; wherefore, Ioh.
11.33. it is said that Jesus (...), troubled or moved himself, at the death of
Lazarus; for his reason commanded his sadness, Math. 26. coepit tristari, he
began to be sad. Hierome says well, Passiones Christi respectu principij
semper sequuntur rationem, they always follow reason when they arise, and as
the Centurion, if he had said to one of his soldiers; Go, and he goes and
to another come and he comes; and to the third do this, and he does it,
Math. 8.9. So Christ's affections were directed by his reason, to go and come
at the commandment thereof. In his agony they never disturbed his reason, for
in his agony they were like a glass; which has pure and clean water in it,
stir the glass and there arises no mudde in it; but our passions antevert
reason, they trouble and blind reason, they are like the foul glass, when we
stir it, presently it grows dim and the mudde arises. The flowers of
Egypt, that are continually watered by the waters of Nilus, (which are gross)
yield not such pleasant smelles as other flowers do: So our sinful passions
are not so pure and clear, for the vapors and exhalations that arise out of
them from original sin. Our passions are like the beardlesse Counselors of
Rehoboam, who drew away the King to his destruction, 1 King. 12.8 Secondly, the
passions in Christ differed from ours, quoad gradus, for when once his reason
commanded them to retreat and stay, they did proceed no further; therefore in
Christ they might have rather been called propassiones than passiones, because
they were the forerunners and beginners of passions, and might be stayed at
pleasure, and had no power to transport his reason.

Some things are neither to be praised, in ortu nec progressu, in their rising
nor proceeding, as hunger and thirst, which are not subject to reason. Some
again are to be praised in ortu, but not in progressu, as just anger in man
since the fall: hence the Apostle, Ephesians. 4.25. says, be angry but sin not,
that is, take heed that your anger continue not, for if it do, it will turn to
sin; it is like good Wine which is soon turned into Vinegar. Some passions
are to be praised, both in ortu et progressu, and these were proper unto Christ.

There was no contrariety and contradiction amongst Christ's passions. Inter
Christi passiones nulla fuit contrarietas, instabilitas, aut importunitas.
Secondly, there was no instability in them. Thirdly, there was no importunity
in them. But since the fall, there is a great contrariety and contradiction
amongst our passions, and great instabilitie, and great importunity. In
Christo fuerunt poenales sed non culpabiles, in nobis sunt poenales sed et
culpabiles: In Christ the passions were a punishment, but not a sin; but in
us they are both a punishment and sin. First, in their contrariety or
contradiction; it is written in the life of An selme, when he walked in the
field he saw a shepherds boy, who had taken a bird and had tied a stone to
her leg, and as the bird mounted up, the stone drew her down again; which
moved Anselme to weep, lamenting how men endeavored to flee up to heaven, and
yet are still borne down to the earth by sin. Men's passions now are like
contrary winds or tides; covetous man that is given to adultery, is drawn by
two wild horses contrary-wayes; for his covetousness bids him hold in, but
his adultery bids him spend. Secondly, now our affections are instable, like
the winds changing from this coast to that, like Amnon who now hated Thamar
more than ever he loved her before. Thirdly, now the affections importunate
us, for sometimes they lie sick as Ahab did, if they get not Naboths Vineyard,
1 King. 21. or like Rachel who cried to Jacob, Give me children or else I die,
Genesis 30. or like the horseleech which has two daughters, that cry continually,
Give, give, Prove. 30.15.

The regenerate man, A collation betwixt the old and renewed Adam.
is renewed in all his passions, as we may see in David's love, Psalm. 119 97.
How do I love thy law: In his hatred, I hate thy enemies with a perfect
hatred, Psalm. 130.22 In his desire, mine eyes are dim for waiting how do I
long for thy salvation, Psalm. 35.9. In his fear, his judgments are terrible I
tremble and quake. Psalm. 119.120. In his delight, thy testimonies are my
delight, Psalm 119.16. I rejoice more in them, then in a rich spoil, Psalm.
119.192 In his sorrow, mine eyes gush out with rivers of water, Psalm. 119.136,
But the unregenerate, are renewed in none of these passions.

The affections of man since the fall are fearful tormenters of him.

It is a greater judgment to be given over to them, King. 17.25. and it may
seem a greater judgment to be given over to these passions, than to be
excommunicate and given over to Satan, for sundry that have been excommunicate
have been reclaimed and called back again, 1. Cor. 5. but very few of these
who are given over to these passions are reclaimed.

It is a mercy of God when a man falls, Corinthian, 1. Cor. 5. when he had
committed that beastly sin in lying with his fathers wife, yet the Spirit
that was lurking within him, stirred him up to repentance, and made him to long
to be at his first estate of grace again.

There is a notable apologue serving for this purpose, when Ulysses in his
travailes had left his men with Circe that Witch, she changed them all into
diverse sorts of beasts: as into dogs, swine, Lions, Tigers, Elephants.
Ulysses when he returned, complained that Circe had done him wrong in turning
his men into beasts, Circe replied that the benefit of speech was left unto
them all, and so he might demand of them, whether they would be changed into
men again. He began first with the Hog, and demanded of him whether he
would be a Man again or not, he answered, that he was more contented with that
sort of life then he was before; for when he was a man he was troubled with a
thousand cares, and one grief came continually after another; but now he had
care for to fill the belly, and to lie down in the dunghill and sleep: and so
he demanded of all the rest about: but all of them refused to turn men
again, until he came to the Elephant, who in his first estate had been a
Philosopher; he demanded of him, whether or not he would be a man again; he
answered that he would with all his heart, because he knew what was the
difference betwixt a brutish and a reasonable life. The application of the
apologue is this. These beastly creatures given over to their sensual
appetites, transformed and changed by Satan into beasts, in their hearts they
desire never to return to a better estate, but to live still in their swinish
pleasures, and to follow their sensual appetites.

But these who have the Spirit of Grace in them, and are fallen into some
heinous sin, having tasted of both the estates, like the Elephant they desire
to be back at their first estate again.

Divinity and moral Philosophy differ far in showing Man his sinful
passions; Theologia, and moralis Philosophia differunt.
the moralists show nothing but the outside of these sinful passions: they
leave them without, like painted Sepulchers, but within full of rottenness and
dead men's bones, Math. 23.27. They hold up (...), a counterfeit glass, which
makes her finfull passions look a great deal better than they are.

This counterfeit cure of the moralists curing the passions is not unfitly
compared to a Barber; for a Barber does nothing to a Man but trimmes him,
washes him, and shaves him; he goes not like a skillful Physician to find out
the cause of his disease, but only outwardly lays a plaster to the sore, and
the passions, mendaciter subijciunt se tantum rationi; they neither show the
beginning, progress nor remnant of their sin. But Divinity shows this
first as in a clear glass, the ground of all our sinful passions. First,
it lets us see in the bottom original sin the fountain of all the rest,
which the moralist knows not. Secondly, it lets us see the first motions of
the heart (which are without consent) to be sin: and as in a clear sunshine
we see atomos, the little motes which are the least thing, that the eye of man
can perceive: So the Law of God lets us see the first motions, arysing from
original sin, to be finne before God. Thirdly, Divinity lets us see, that
unadvised anger is a sin before God. Fourthly, it lets us see, that, He who
calls his brother raca, is to be punished by the Council, Mat. 5.22. Fifthly, it
lets us see what a sin the fact it self is. Sixthly, it lets us see that when
the revenge is pardoned, yet remain some dregs behind, that we remember not;
therefore the Law says, Levit. 19.18. Ye shall neither revenge nor remember.
This the moralist cannot do.

CHAP. III. How the passions are cured by the moral virtues.
THe moral Philosophers cure the Passions by moral virtues only.

There are eleven moral virtues, that cure these passions; which virtues
attend them, as Paedagogues wait upon their pupilles, and they fing unto them
as nurses do to their babes, (...) have not, burst not forth; These passions
have their beginning in the appetite, and end in reason, but the virtues have
their beginning in reason, and end in the sensitive appetite; therefore they
may fitly rule the passions.

The eleven virtues, are Liberality, Temperance, Magnificence, Magnanimity,
modesty, Fortitude, Justice, meeknes, affability, urbanity or Courtesy; and
Verity: and as the eleven passions are reduced to four, so are the eleven
virtues reduced to four, which are called the four cardinal virtues:
Prudency, Temperance, Fortitude, and Justice.

These virtues cure the perturbations or passions, heroicke virtues.

The moralist makes a double middle. virtue is opposite to vice, and then the
vice is to be corrected by the virtue; here the one extreme is the mean,
Virtus media, in extremo aut in medio.
which must rectify the other extreme. Secondly, when the virtue is
interposed betwixt two vices, then the virtue must mediate betwixt them.

Here we may observe, virtue and vice, than betwixt two vices; for there cannot
be a middle betwixt virtue and vice, but there is middle betwixt two vices;
this the Scripture shows us, Revel. 3.15. I would ye were either hot or
cold, but because ye are lukewarm, therefore I will spew you out of my
mouth; God will have no middle here betwixt truth and falsehood, therefore he
abhorres more luke-warmenesse than coldness: coldness is not to be corrected
by luke-warmenesse as the middle, but it must be reduced to hotnesse.

But there is a middle betwixt vice and vice, and these two are corrected by
the virtue in the middle.

Example in the concupiscible appetite, there are the vices of Prodigality in
excess, and the vice in defect is avarice; these two are to be reduced to the
middle liberality the virtue. So again in the concupiscible appetite there is
Morologia, scurrility; Hos. 7.3. They make the Kings heart merry with their
lies; such was the jesting of the boys at Elisha, 2 King. 2 24. The other
extremity is rusticitie or sullenness, such was that clown Nabal, and these
can abide no mirth. These two extremities are to be corrected, by (...) Est
nomen, (...).
which is when a man shows himself pleasant without just offense to his
neighbor; as when Elias jeasted at the Idol Baal, 1 Kin. 18.27. So for a man
to have too great a desire of honor, this is called pride. The other
extremity is, to be altogether averse from honor, this is called
pusillanimitie or baseness of mind; these must be moderated by the virtue
(...), a moderate love of honor.

Example, 1 Timothy 3.1. He who desires a Bishopric desires a good work,
this is the middle; but when Amonius the Monk cut off his right ear, that
they should not make choice of him to the ministry, this was the extremity in
defect. The other extremity is, when presumptuously, men seek this calling,
as when the high Priests sought the Priesthood by bribes.

Quest. What sort of middle is this, when virtue moderates betwixt two vices?

Answ. Duplex medium, arithmeticum seu medium rei, et geometricum scu medium
personae.
There is a twofold middle; the first is called an Arith meticall middle, the
second is called a Geometrical middle; the first is called, medium rei, the
second is called medium personae seu rationis.

Medium arithmeticum, or medium rei, keeps always an equal proportion
betwixt the two extremes; as when the Israelites gathered their Manna, they put
it all in one heap, then every man got his Gomer measured out unto him, for
they got all alike Exodus 16.19. 2 Cor. 8.15. But medium geometricum, seu
personae, vel rationis, draws nearer the one extreme than the other, and
gives to the persons according to their conditions and estate, as it gives
strong meat to those that are strong, and milk to babes, Heb. 5.13. So the
virtue that is placed betwixt two vices, it keeps Geometrical middle, and
stands not equally betwixt the two extremes, for prodigality comes nearer to
liberality than avarice does.

Mark a difference betwixt moral virtues and theoligical; Differunt virtutes
morales et theologicae.
the moral virtues are the middle betwixt the two extremes; but in Divinity if
ye shall consider the theological virtues as they have a respect to God, (and
that infinite good) they cannot be a middle, for these which have a middle,
fail either when they come short or exceed the middle: but we cannot
exceed, when we look to God who is infinite, for we may come short there.

Object. But hope seems to be a middle betwixt presumption and despair,
then in the theological virtues there may be a middle.

Answ. There is a double middle; the first is called medium formale, Duplex
medium, 1 formale vel quantitatis absolutae. 2. materiale vel proportionis.
a form all middle; or, the middle of quantity: and this respects the inward
essence of the virtue, here no middle is found: the second is called a material
middle, or a middle of proportion, and in this we may either exceed or come
short, because of the eight circumstances that accompany every action; which
are comprehended under this technicall Verse.

Quis? quid? vbi? quibus? and cur? quomodo? quando? quibuscum;
That is, every action is tried by these circumstances:
Who? what? and why? by what means? and by whose?
How? when? and where? do many things disclose.
As, who does it; what he does; where he does it; and by what instrument, etc.
If we respect these circumstances, then a man may exceed or come short of
religion.

Example, (...), true worship is the middle; (...), and (...) atheism and
superstition are the two extremities; if we respect religion in it self
secundum formale, as it is me dium quantitatis absolutae, here we cannot exceed
and be too religious, for religion it self is opposite to all defects of
religion So hope, in respect of the inward form of it, looking directly
toward God, we cannot exceed here, although we come short; but respecting
the matter of it, and weighing all circumstances in hope, a man may presume or
despair; as who hops; what he hops for? when he hops? and such.

The matter may be cleared by another example when we consider Justice as
Justice, we cannot exceed in Justice, or be too just; but considering Justice
in respect of circumstances, a Judge may be either too just, Eccles, 7.16. noli
esse nimium justus; be not too just; and so exceed the middle: or he may be
deficient in Justice, having no respect of the poor in judgment, these two
are equally abomination before the Lord, Prove. 17.15. to let the wicked go,
and condemn the innocent; the one in excess; and the other in defect. So,
Exodus 23.4. Ye shall not have pity upon the poor for his poverty.

As these passions are cured by drawing them to the virtues, the mediocritie:
so they are cured when all these virtues are joined together, and ruled by the
Heroicke virtues; and then the moralists hold that a man may attain, ad
ultimum finem, to true happiness it self without any help of Gods grace,
only through the remnants of the Image of God remaining still in them yet
after the fall.

When all these passions are cured by the virtues, the moralists make up a
perfect Lady whom they paint forth to us after this sort, they say her
forerunners are, obedience, continency and patience; her attendants which
attend her are many, as security, hope, tranquillity, joy, reverence,
clemency, modesty, and mercy: they describe her self this way; her head is
wisdom, her eyes prudencie, her heart love, her spirits charity, her hand
liberality, her breast religion, her thighs justice, her health temperance,
and fortitude her strength.

But this Lady trimmed thus, is but a farded Helena, until grace come in and
sanctify her. We see this betwixt Diogenes and Plato, and betwixt Aristippus
and Diogenes, how every one of them discovered, that their virtues were but
shows of virtues. When Diogenes saw Plato delight in neatness and cleanness,
and to have his beds well dressed, he went and trod upon his beds, and he said
calco Platonis Fastum, I tread upon Plato's pride Plato replied, sed majori
Fastu, with a greater pride. Again, when Plato saw Diogenes go with an old
cloak full of holes, he said he saw his pride through the holes of his cloak
When Diogenes was dressing roots for his dinner, Aristippus came in; Diogenes
said unto him if Aristippus mere content with such a dinner, he needed not to
fawn upon Kings and flatter them. Aristippus replied, If Diogenes could use
Kings, he needed not to eat of such roots; thus we see how Diogenes taxed
Aristippus pride and Aristippus again Diogenes his counterfeit humility.

So we see likewise their virtues to be counterfeit virtues; for they counted
this an Heroicke virtue to kill themselves, either for fear of shame as
Luerecia did, and Cleopatra; or for vainglory, as when M. Curtius leapt into
the gulf at Rome, in the time of a great pestilence, thinking there was no
other remedy to take it away.

Quest. What are we to think of these passions ruled by the moral virtues in
the heathen, whether were they sin or not?

Answ. God likes the works of men two ways. Complace^tia Dei duplex (...).
First, by a general liking of them, because they proceed from the relics of
entire nature yet left in man, Romans 2.14. for by nature they did the things of
the Law, 1 Cor. 11.14. does not nature it self teach you?

Secondly, he likes them according to his good pleasure, when he loved them as
renewed in Christ. The works of the Heathen which proceeded from the remnant
light of nature were not done by them as renewed men; neither did they proceed
from the corruption of nature, as when a man sins; but from the sparkle of
natural light, which he left in them. So if we respect the work it self,
the good works of the Gentiles are not sins, and in this sense it is said, 2
King. 10.30. Iehu did that which was good in the sight of the Lord. So, Genesis
20.26 thou did this in the integrity of thy heart.

But if we consider these virtues according to the Gospel, then we must call
them sins, Opera gentilium sine fide, pecca sunt,
because they proceeded not from faith; For without faith it is impissible to
please God, Heb. 11.

Secondly, if we respect the end of their works, Opera gentilium respectu
finis sunt peccata.
they are sins, because they did them not for the glory of God, but for their
own praise.

Thirdly, in respect of the subject of their good works, because the persons
were not renewed who did them. If the person be not renewed, his works cannot be
accepted before God. Aurichalcum, latten or copper, is called a false metal,
not because it is a false substance, but because it is false gold. So these
works of the heathen, are false virtues, because they proceed not from faith;
but they are not simply false.

CHAP. IIII. How the Stoickes cure the Passions.
THe Stoickes take another course to cure these passions; for they would root
them out of the nature of man, as altogether sinful. A man having the gout,
one lays a plaster to his feet, which so benumbed them that he can walk no
more, here the physic is worse than the disease. So the Stoics when they
feel perturbations in the passions, they would pull them out; here the remedy
is worse than the disease. As at the first, in Athens the thirty tyrants
caused to be put to death some wicked man; but afterward they began to kill
good citizens; so the Stoickes at the first set themselves against the sinful
passions, and at last against the good Citizens, the best passions: for they
would root out of man the chief helps, which God has placed in the soul,
for the prosecuting of good, and declyning of evil: if there were not passions
in the soul, then there should be no virtues to moderate them; for take away
fear and hardness from fortitude, then fortitude were no more a virtue.

The passions are ascribed both to Christ and God, and therefore are not to be
rooted out.

Christ himself took these passions upon him, therefore they cannot be
sin, Luke 10.21. He was angry, Mark 3.5. He was sad, Math. 26.38. and
rejoiced, Luke 10.21. They are sanctified by regeneration. The Apostle, Romans
1.30. condemns the want of natural affection, he calls them (...), without
natural affection.

They are ascribed to God (...), therefore they cannot be sin. If the Stoics
should read that there are Islands and Countries, as Delos and Egypt, which had
never felt the violence of earthquakes, and which had continued immovable,
when all other parts of the world had been shaken, would they believe it? Why
should they then believe that there are men to be found void of all passions?
They grant us this power, to tame Elephants, Tigers and Lions; (and yet not to
destroy them) why will they not allow us this power then, to suppress these
passions, when they rise against reason? They must not then be rooted out but
moderated: we must not take away diversity of tunes in Music, but reduce
them to good order, and so make up a harmony.

CHAP. V. How Christ cures the Passions.
CHrist taking our nature and passions upon him,

Christ rectifieth the passions, four manner of ways. passions that they
arise not inordinately; Christus quatuor modis moderatur passiones, 1.
subjugando.
Esaias. 11.5. it is said, Justice shall be the girdle of his loins, to signify
that by justice all his sensual affections are suppressed. Duplex cingendi
modus: 1. sursum versus ad mammillas, 2. deorsum versus ad lumbos and renes.
Again, Revel. 1.13. Christ is brought in, with his girdle about his paps; to
signify that Jesus Christ subdued, not only his sensitive faculties but also
the intellectual, in his will, and understanding; and it was for this that the
High Priest under the law was forbidden to we are his girdle, about his
sweating places, Ezekiel. 44.18. that is, about his middle, as the Chal. de
Paraphrase interprets it, not beneath, but about his pappes; to signify the
moderation of all his passions; It is a true axiom; quod operatur Christus pro
nobis, oper atur in nobis; that which Christ does for us, he does in us: He
subdueth his own passions, Reconciliando.
that He may subdue our passions.

Secondly, Christ reconciles the passions, which strive so one against another:
Judge. 17.6. when there was no King in Israel, every man might do what he
pleased; so these passions do what they please, contradicting one another,
till Christ come in to reconcile them. Moses when he saw two Hebrews striving
together, he said, ye are brethren, why do ye strive? Exodus 2.13. So when
Christ sees the passions striving one with another, He says, Ye are
brethren, why do ye strive? Acts 7.24.

Thirdly, Rectificando.
Christ sets the passions upon their right objects, whereas before they were
set upon the wrong objects, and he turns these inordinate desires the right
way. A man takes a bleeding at the nose, the way to stay the blood is to divert
the course of it, and open a vein in the arm. So the Lord draws the
passions from their wrong objects, and turns them to another. Mary Magdalen
was given to unclean lust, the Lord diverted this sinful passion, and she
became penitent, and thirsted after grace, Luke 8.2. So he turned the passions
of Saul when he was a bloody murderer, to thirst for grace, Act. 9. We know a
woman's appetite to be a false appetite, when she desires to eat raw flesh,
or coals, or such trash: and that she is mending again when her appetite is
set upon wholesome meats. So when the passions are set upon wrong objects, then
a man is in the estate of sin: but when the passions are turned to the right
objects, then a man becomes the child of God.

Fourthly, Immobiliter permanendo.
he settles them that they cannot be moved; for as the needle in the
compass trembles still, till it be directly settled toward the North pole;
then it stands. So the affections are never settled, till they be set upon the
right object, and there he ties them, that they start not away again, Psalm
86.9. David prays, knit my heart to thee, O Lord. The beasts when they were
brought to be made a sacrifice, were tied with cords to the horns of the
Altar, Psalm. 118.27. that they might not start away again: So the Lord must
tie the affections to the right objects that they start not away again.

The passions are either in the concupiscible or irascible part of the Soul.
There be six passions in the concupiscible appetite; Love, hatred, desire,
abomination, pleasure, sadness.

CHAP. VI. Of the Passions in particular, in the concupiscible appetite.
Of Love.
LOve, Amor est voluntarius quidam affectus, quam coniunctissime re quae bona
judicatur, fruendi.
is a passion or affection in the concupiscible appetite, that it may enjoy the
thing which is esteemed to be good as near as it can.

Man before the fall,

God is the first good cause and the last good end: understanding, and O to the
will. He is man's chief good, therefore he is to be preferred to all things,
both to our owneselves, and to those things we count most of, beside our selves
wherefore, Luke 14. he faith; He that loves his life better than me, is not
worthy of me. So Math. 10. He that loves his father or mother better than me,
is not worthy of me; so he that preferres his own love before God; is not
worthy of the love of God.

There are three sorts of love; or natural love; imperatus; or commanded love:
elicitus, or love freely proceeding. Triplex amor, emanans, imperdius, and
elicitus.


Natural love is that love, whereby every thing has an inclination naturally
to the like, as heavy things naturally go down to the center of the earth:
beasts are carried by sense and instinct to their objects, the Pismire in
Summer lays up provision against the Winter, Prove. 6.8. This natural
instinct the Greeks call (...). So man is carried to his object by love: and
because he must love something, what better object could he choose to love than
God?

Commanded love is that, whereby reason shows us some good thing to be loved,
and then our will commands us to love the same. If we had no more but
reason, to show it to us, and the will to command us, these we enough to moove
the affections to love God.

Love, proceeding freely is that, when the affections make choice of God
freely; when as they consider his goodness that breeds admiration in them:
when they do consider his beauty, that breeds love in them, and his sweetness
does satisfy their whole desires; so that nothing is so worthy an object to
be beloved as God, who has all these properties in him.

God loved us first, Ioh. 3.16. therefore we are bound to love him again.

There are three sorts of love.

First, Triplex (...), quaerens vtile, lascivus, and pur^^.
the love that seeks his own profit only; as when a subject loves his
Prince only for his goods: such was the love of Laban to Jacob; here the
Prince is not bound to love his subject again; neither was Jacob bound to love
Laban for this sort of love.

Secondly, the love that looks to filthiness and dishonestie, such was the
love which Putiphars wife carried to Joseph Genesis 39.9. Joseph was not bound to
love Putiphars wife again, in this sort of love.

The third sort of love is most pure and holy love, and in this love we are
bound to love back again. God loved us before we loved him he loved us
freely and for no by-respect, therefore we are bound to love him first and
above all things.

The Part loves the being of the whole, vacuum or a vastness in the universe
(for the elements touch one another) as we see when we pour water out of a
narrow mouthed glass, the water contrary to the nature of it, runs up to
the air, that there may not be a void place: it preferres the good of the
whole, to the own proper center: so in the little world man, the hand casts it
self up to preserve the head. So God being all in all to us, we should hazard
all for him.

Man in innocence loved God only for himself.

Some things we love for themselves only, Amor propter se, and propter aliud.
but for another end. A sick man loves a bitter potion, not for it self, but
for another end, which is his health.

Some things we love both for themselves and for another end; as a man loves
sweet wine for it self, because it is pleasant to his taste, then he
understands also that it is good for his health, here he loves it not only for
it self, but for his healths sake. But Adam in innocence loved God only for
himself.

Quest. Whether are we to love God more for the more benefits he bestows upon
us or not?

Answ. 2.2. q. 24. art. 3.
Thomas answers thus, God is to be beloved although he should give nothing but
correct us; as a good child loves his father although he correct him: but when
it is faid, we are to love God for his benefits: for, Super Job. sermon. 3.
notes not the final cause here, but the motive: therefore Augustine faith
well, Non dilige ad praemium, sedipse Deus sit praemium tuum, love not for the
rewards sake, but let God be thy reward; it is a good thing for a man to
think upon Gods benefits, that he may be stirred up by them to love God, and
love him only for himself and for his benefits. Moses and Paul so loved God
that they cared not to be eternally cursed, rather than his glory should be
blemished, Exodus 32.33. Romans 9.3.

Object. But when God promised, Genesis 15.1, 2. to be Abraham's great reward;
Abraham said, What will thou give me seeing I go childlesse? then the father
of the faithful might seem to love God for his benefits, and not for himself.

Answ. The Text should not be read thus, I am thy exceeding great reward, but,
thy reward shall be exceeding great, as if the Lord should say unto him; thou
wast not enriched by the spoil of the Kings, but I shall give thee a greater
reward. Abraham replies, what reward is this thou can give me seeing I go
childlesse? Abraham had sown righteousness, and therefore should reap a
faithful reward, Prove. 11.18. though he were not enriched by the King of
Sodom, Genesis 14.22. So that, Abraham loved God only for himself in the first
place; and he seeks a reward (succession of children) in the second place, and
by this his Faith is strengthened, for he adheres to the promise of God, Genesis
13.15.16.

The first Adam loved not the creatures for themselves; A collation betwixt the
innocent, and old Adam.
neither loved he God for another end, but for himself; neither loved he God
for himself and for another end, but only for himself: therefore the Church,
Cant. 1.4. is commended, quia amat in rectitudinibus; because she loves God
directly for himself; But now men love the creatures only for themselves, and
herein they are Epicures. Some again love God for the creatures, and these are
mercenaries; but these who love God for himself, these are his true children;
and herein Augustines saying is to be approved, who says, fruimur Deo, and
utimur alijs, we enjoy that which we love for it self, but we use that which
we use to another end. But the natural man would enjoy the creatures, and use
God to another end.

Man in innocence loved God, judicio particulari, above all things; that is,
Duplex amor, 1. judicis particulari, 2 judicio universali.
he knew Iehova to be the true God, and so loved him. But since the fall, he
loves him, above all things judicio universali, for his will oftentimes
follows not his judgment: the^ he loved himself for God, but now he loves
all things for himself; this inordinate love of a man's self breeds contempt
of God; but the ordinate love, inspired by God, teaches us first to love God
and then our selves, 1. Ioh. 4.7. Let us love one another, because love is of
God, where he shows us, that the love of our neigbours must proceed from God;
therefore the love of our selves must begin also at God. It is true, John says,
1 Ioh. 4.20. If we love not our brother whom we see, how can we love God whom
we see not? not that the love of the regenerate begins first at our neighbor,
but this is the most sensible note, Duplex amor, a posteriori, et a priori.
to know whether we love God or not: this love is a posteriori, as the other is
a priori.

Object. But it may seem that a man in corrupt nature, may love God better
than himself, because some heathen have given their lives for their country,
and some for their friends?

Answ. This corrupt love, was but for themselves and for their own vain
glory, and in this they love them selves better than any other thing.

We are bound says Saint Augustine, love somethings supra nos; secondly, to
love some thing, quod nos sumus; Lib. 1, de doct. Christ. cap. 5. Gradus amoris
sunt, 1. amare supra nos 2 quod nos sumus 3. juxta nos. 4. infra nos.
thirdly, to love, some things, juxta nos, fourthly to love some things, infra
nos.

Man in his first estate, loved God above himself; in the second room, his
own Soul; in the third place his neighbors soul; and last his own Body. He
was first bound to love himself, and then his neighbor: his own soul before
his neighbors soul; his own body before his neighbors body; for this is the
rule under the Law, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self, Math. 22.39 The
rule must be before the thing ruled. It is not said, Luke 3.12. he that has a
coat let him give it to him who wants a coat; but he who has two coats, let
him give one to him who wants a coat; but under the Gospel the rule of our
love must be, as Christ loved us, so we must love our neighbors, Ioh. 13.4.
But man since the fall has inverted this order mightily, he loves his own
body, better than his neighbors soul, than his own soul, yea better than
God; and oftentimes his hogs better than his own soul, yea than God
himself, as the Gergesites did, Math. 8.34.

Quest. Alexander Hales moves the question, whether the Angels proceed thus in
their manner of love; if God be he who is above them, whom they are bound to
love above themselves; and in the second room themselves, and juxta se, other
Angels: what place must the soul of man come into, in their consideration?
whether juxta, or infra, and what must be the estimation of the body of man in
their love?

He answers, that the Angels of God do love the souls of men now, infrase,
but when we shall be (...), like unto the Angels of God, Math. 22.33. then we
shall be loved of them in our souls, juxta, sed non infrase. Duplex praemium
angelorum; primum, and secundum.
And as touching our bodies they are beloved of them infrase, because the
Angels (says he) desire primum praemium, and secundum, their first reward in
God, the second reward for the keeping of man: they shall be rewarded for
their ministry toward the bodies and souls of men, for keeping them, when
they shall give up their account and say, behold here are we, and the children
whom thou have given us, Ioh. 17.12.

Man before his fall loved God with all his heart.

He loved nothing supra Deum he loved nothing in equal balance with God,
loved him with all his heart, soul, Nihil amandum supra, juxta, contra, aut
aequale Deo.
and strength, and Christ adds (...), with the efficacy of the mind and the
will, Mat. 22.31. and the learned scribe, Mark. 12.31. adds a fit word (...),
with his whole understanding. By which diverfity of words God lets us see, that
man when he was created, loved God unfainedly, and that all the Fountains or
Springs within his soul praised him, Psalm. 87.7.

The first Adam loved God with all his heart; A collation betwixt the innocent,
and old Adam.
but since the fall he loves God diviso cord, Hos. 10.2. and he loves
something better than God, contrary to God, and equal with God. The Church of
Rome makes a double perfection, perfectio viae, and perfectio patriae, or
perfectio finis, and perfectio ordinis; they say there is not perfectio patriae
found here; but perfectione viae, we may love God with all our heart this way
(say they.) But this is false, for when we have done all things, we must call
our selves unprofitable servants, Luke 17.10.

We are to love God more than the creatures, Duplex amor, intensivus, and
appretiativus.
yet it falls out often, that we love the creatures intensive, more than
God; but the child of God loves not the creatures more appretiative. A man may
more lament the death of his son, than the want of spiritual grace; and yet in
his estimation and deliberation, he will be more sorry for the want of Gods
grace, than for the want of his son.

The first Adam loved God with all his heart, A collation betwixt the innocent,
and renewed Adam.
both in quantity and quality; but the renewed Adam is measured by the
soundness of the heart. Peter being asked of the measure of his love, Ioh.
21.15. Love thou me more than these? he answered only concerning the truth.
For being asked of the quantity, he answered only of the quality, Lord thou
know I love thee; it is the quality thou delight'st in, and not the
quantity. Hence it is, when the Scriptures speak of perfection, it is to be
understood of sincerity: in one place they are said, to be of a perfect heart,
and in another, of an upright heart. 1 Chronicles. 12.33.38.

The love which the renewed man bears to God now, is but a small measure of
love, A collation betwixt the renned and glorified Adam.
in respect of that which we shall have to God in the life to come: in the
life to come, our hope and faith shall cease, 1 Cor. 13. Our faith and hope
ceasing, our love must be doubled: for as when we shut one of our eyes, the
sight must be doubled in the other eye, vis gemina fortior; so when faith and
hope shall be shut up, our love shall be doubled: Cum venerit quod perfectum
est, abolebitur quod imperfectum est, 1 Cor 13. It is true, Gratia perficit
Naturam, Grace perfits Nature; and so does Glory, quoad essentiam, as touching
the essence; sed evacuat quoad imperfectiones, it takes away all imperfections.
Faith and Hope are but imperfections in the soul, comparing them with the
estate in the life to come, they shall be abolished then, and only love shall
remain, 1 Cor. 13.8.

Man by natural discourse, since the Fall, beloved above all things, although
he cannot love him above all things.

That which all men commend in the second room is better than that which many
commend in the first room. Thermopylae against Xerxes King of Persia, if it
had been demanded of the Captains severally who was the chief cause of the
victory, this Captain would have said it was he: and this Captain would
have said it was he: then if ye had asked them all in the second place, who
fought next best to them, all of them, would have answered, Themistocles:
therefore he won the field. So ask men severally in their first cogitations,
why man should love God; some will answer, because he is good to them: others,
because he bestows honors upon them: and so their love is resolved into
worldly respects, and not into God. But show them the instabilitie of riches,
the vanity of Honor, and such like, then all of them in their second
cogitations, will be forced to grant, that God is to be beloved for himself,

The Notes to know the love of God, since the Fall.
The marks to know whether we love God, are,

First, Love makes one soul to live as it were in two bodies, Nam anima magis
est ubi amat, quam ubi animat; The soul is more where it loves, than where it
animates: This made the Apostle to say, Gal. 2.20. I live not but Christ lives
in me.

The second note is; love dearly, rejoice together and are grieved together.
Homer describing Agamemnons affliction, when he was forced to sacrifice his
daughter Iphygenia, he represents all his friends accompanying him unto the
sacrifice, with a mournful countenance: and at Rome, when any man was called
in question, all his friends mourned with him. Therefore it was, that good
Vriah would not take rest upon his bed, when the Ark of the Lord was in the
fields, 2. Sam. 11.9.

The third note is, love, would wish to be changed and transformed one into
another, but because this transformation cannot be without their destruction,
they desire it as near as they can. But our conjunction with God in Christ is
more near, without the destruction of our persons, Ioh. 17.23. I in them, and
they in me; and therefore we should love this conjunction, and most earnestly
wish for it.

The fourth note is, loves another, not only loves himself, but also his
image or picture, Forma realis and imaginaria.
and not only his real form, but also his imaginary: they love them that are
allied, or are in kin to them, or like them in manners. So, he who loves God,
he loves his children also who are like him, and also their spiritual kindred
and affinity.

The fifth note of the love of God is; love converse together, and are as little
absent from other as can be, they have the same delights and distasts. The
presence of the party beloved fills the heart of the lover with contentment. So
the children of God, their whole delight is to walk with God as Enoch did,
Genesis 5. to be still in his presence: and if he withdraw himself but a little
from them, they long wonderfully for his presence again.

The sixth note is, loves transports himself often to the place where he was
accustomed to see his friend, he delights in reading of his letters, and in
handling the gages and monuments he has left behind him. So the child of God
to testify his love to God, transports himself often to the place where he
may find God in his sanctuary, amongst his Saints; he delights in reading of
his letters, (the Scriptures:) he delights in eating and tasting these holy
monuments and pledges (his Sacraments;) which the Lord has left behind him, as
tokens of his love until he come again.

The seventh note is, when there is any thing, love more lively in our souls,
we embrace the invention here; where in Artemisia Queen of Caria, showed an
act of wonderful passion, toward her husband Mausolus; for death having taken
him away, she not knowing how to pull the thorns of sorrow out of her foul,
caused his body to be reduced to ashes, and mingled them in her drink, meaning
to make her body a living tomb, wherein the relickes of her husband might
rest, from whom she could not endure to live separated. The child of God has a
comfortable and true conjunction with Christ, eating his flesh and drinking his
blood, and these two can never be separated again.

Of Adams love to his neighbor.
As Adam loved God with all his heart, loved his neighbor as himself.

He loved his own soul better than his neighbors soul, loved his own body
better then his neighbors body; but he loved his neighbors soul better than
his own body. We are to love our neighbors as our selves, we are to prefer
the safety of the soul to the safety of the body, therefore our soul is
called, our darling, Psalm. 22.15. which is most to be beloved.

We may not follow the Physicians then, who prescribe sometimes physic to
their patients to be drunk, Navarrus holds that it is not a sin in the patient,
Cap. 23. Number. 19.
that he drink till he be drunk for the recovery of his health.

Although we are to prefer the safety of the soul, to the safety of the
body; Origin did: misinterpreting these words, Math. 19. Many are made Eunuchs
for the Kingdom of God, taking them literally, when they are to be
understood metaphorically.

As we are not to dismember the body for the good of the soul, Thom. 2.2.
quaest. 66. art. 3.
so we are not to whip the body for the good of the soul. A man cannot make a
free choice of that which is evil in it self, as the Moralists prove against
the Stocikes: who did choose poverty, although they knew it to be evil in it
self: but for a man to whip himself, it is evil in it self, for in this he
usurps the magistrates authority.

The magistrates authority stands in these four things: to kill the body: to
mutilate the body: Ex. 21.24. Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth; to whip the
body, Deuteronomy. 25.3. and to imprison the body, Levit 24.12. killing of the body
takes away the life it self; cutting a member of the body takes away the
perfection of the body; whipping of the body takes away the delight and rest of
the body: imprisoning of the body takes away the liberty of it. Now as we may
not kill our selves, cut a member from our selves, imprison our selves, (for
all these belong to the Magistrate) so neither are we to whip our selves.

Again, it is not lawful for a man to weaken his body by fasting. 1 Timothy
5.33. it was not lawful for Timothy to drink water for the weakening of his
body, therefore it is far less lawful for a man to whip his body. We read
of Baals Priests who cut their flesh 2 King. 18.28. but never of the Priests of
the Lord, Deuteronomy. 14. We have a warrant moderately to fast sometimes, that the
body may be more subject to the soul, 1 Cor. 9.37. I chastise my body, and
bring it undersubjection. So, Coloss. 3.5. mortify your members; but never to
whip it. We are not to exceed our strength or to disable our selves, for Gods
service: for God does not desire the hurt of his creature who is about his
service: he will rather forbear some part of his service, than an ox or an
ass shall want necessary food: much less will he have a man to endanger
himself, though it be in his service.

We are to prefer our own temporary life to our neighbors.

If our neighbor be equal of degree with us, Sam. 19.43. so for the safety
of the common wealth.

A man may hazard his life for the safety of another man's life; who is in
prison, peril of death, Majus enim bonum preximi praeferendum minori proprio,
sed non aequali; we are to prefer the greater good of our neighbor, to our
own good that is less; but not where there is equal. When my neighbor is in
a certain danger of death, and I but in a hazard; it is a greater good to save
my neighbors life, than not to hazard my own.

We are bound more to save our own lives, Pylades and Orestes, the one giving
his life for the other, was not lawful. So, of that betwixt Damon and Pythias,
when the one would have given his life for the other.

As we are to prefer our own life to our neighbors life,

Temporary things serve either for our necessity, utility, Ad quatuor in
serviunt temporaria, propter necessitatem, propter sufficientiam, propter
utilitatem, and propter superfluitatem.
or for our sufficiency, or for our superfluity. For necessity, things serve
for the maintenance of our life; utility, for our vocation; sufficiency, for
our delectation; superfluity, for wantonness and excess.

In wishing temporary things, we should put our selves in the first degree, and
our neighbor in the second; that which is out of superfluity, I should wish
for his sufficiency; and out of my sufficiency, I desire his utility, to
further him in his calling; and out of my utility, I should further him in his
necessity, to preserve his life: that is, with things necessary to my calling I
ought to relieve his life. But men now will not give of their superfluity, to
entertain their neighbors necessity and life: as Nabal would not give to
David, 1 Samuel 25.10. And the rich glutton to Lazarus, Luke 16. out of their
superfluity, to supply their necessity.

Quest. Are we bound to love all our neighbors alike?

Answ. Some answer that we are bound to love them all alike, affectu, sed non
effectu, we are bound, say they, to love all alike in our internal affection,
but we are not bound to help all alike; for we are more bound to these who
are nearest to us, and to help them most with our goods.

But Aquinas shows this to be false, and sets down this as a true position,
that some of our neighbors are more to be loved than others, tum affectu, tum
effectu. Amor est tum in affectu, tum in effectu.
His reason is, because the hatred of some of our neighbors, is a greater
hatred, than the hatred of other of our neighbors; therefore we are more bound
by the rule of charity, to love some of our neighbors ( quoad affectum
internum, in our internal affection) than other: as well as we are bound more
to help them externo effectu. This is clear by the rule of contraries. The
antecedent is proved, He that curses his father or mother shall die the death,
Levit. 20. But the Law appoints no such death to him who curses another of his
neighbors; therefore it must be a greater sin to curse their Parents than
other of their neighbors, or to wish them evil. Therefore we are more bound
to love them in our affection, as we are more bound to help them than others?

Quest. Whether are we bound to love those more, Amor objectivu^ and
appretiarivus.
in whom we see more grace although they be strangers to us: than those of our
kindred, in whom we see not so great measure of grace.

Answ. We are to love those most, in whom we see most grace objective, that
is; in respect of the blessedness that is desired, because they are nearer
joined to us in God. A center, out of which issues many Lines; the further
they are extended from the Center, they are the further dis-united amongst
themselves; and the nearer that they draw to the Center, they are the nearer
united. So, those who are nearest to God, should be nearest to us, and we
should wish to them the greatest measure of happiness.

But those who are nearest to us in the flesh, and in the Lord, Phil. 2.21.
should be more dear to us appretiative, and in our estimation, although they
have not such measure of grace. And so Christ loved John better than the rest
of his Disciples, Ioh. 13.23. because he was both his cousin german, and had
more grace in him: but he wished not a greater measure of glory to him than to
Paul, Duplex ratio amoris, objecti, and originis.
objective; For he that does most his will, are his brother and sister, Math.
12.50.

So that we come under a threefold consideration of Christ here; for he is
considered as God; as Mediator God and man; and as man: Christ, as God, loved
not John better than the rest; Christ, as Mediator, loved him not better; but
Christ, as man, loved him better than the rest.

We are more bound to love our Parents, than any other of our neighbors, both
in temporal and spiritual things, 1 Timothy 5.4 If a widow have children, let
them learn to requite their Parents: in the Syriacke it is, rependere faenus
parentibus. A man divides his goods into three parts: first, so much he spends
upon himself, his wife, and servants: secondly, so much he gives to the poor:
thirdly, so much he lends to his children, looking for interest back again.
Again, we are more bound to them, than those of whom we have received greatest
benefits; yea, than him that has delivered us from death: Dijs and parentibus
non possunt reddi aequalia. Arist. lib. 8. Ethic.
This is (...), as the young Storkes uphold the old when they are flying. Hence
comes (...) that is, as the fathers have sustained the children, so should the
children the fathers again.

The Hebrews say, What is the honor that the children owe unto their parents?
They owe to them maintenance, and reverence; they should give them meat,
drink, and clothing; they should lead them in, and lead them out. And they
add further, we read, Honor the Lord with thy substance, and, Honor thy
father and mother: thou art to honor God with thy substance, if thou have any
substance; but thou art to honor thy parents, whether thou have any substance,
or not; for if thou have not, thou art bound to beg for thy parents: So says
R. Solomon, in his Gloss upon Levit. 10.3.

We are to love our Parents more than our Children in giving them honor,
Arist. lib. Ethic.
for they are nearer to us than our Children, being the instruments of our
being.

We are to succor our Parents, in case of extreme necessity, rather then our
children: Filium subvenire parenti proprio, honestius est quam sibi ipsi; It is
a more honest thing to help the Parent, than a man's self; and there is a
greater conjunction betwixt the father and the son in esse absoluto, than
betwixt us and our children: and therefore in that case of necessity, he is
more bound to help his father than his child.

Where there is not such a case of extreme necessity, he is more bound to
help his Child than his Parent; The Children lay not up for the Parents, but
the Parents for the Children, 2. Cor. 12.14. And the reason is, because the
father is joined with the son, as the cause with the effect; Sed causa influit
in effectum, The cause works in the effect; so should the Parent communicate
with his child.

Secondly, the father is joined with the son as with a part of himself, and
coming from himself: which cannot be said of the child to the father.

Thirdly, the love of the father toward the child is elder, and continues
longer; for the fathers love their children even from their Cradle: but the
children love not their fathers, till they be come to the years of discretion;
for the more old that love is, the more perfect it is

We are more bound to love our father than our mother: How a man is to
prefer himself to his neighbor in temporal things.
we are more bound to love our wives than our parents, because the man and the
wife are one flesh; and, a man should leave his father and mother, and cleave
to his wife, Math. 19. For reverence and honor, he is more to honor his
parents than his wife, but otherwise he is to supply her wants in temporary
things before his fathers.

As we are to prefer our own temporary life to our neighbors life, so also
we are to prefer our own spiritual life to the life of our superiors or
equals.

Our temporary life, should not be so dear to us as his spiritual life, and
we ought to imitate Christ, who gave his life for the spiritual life of his
children, 1 Ioh. 3.16.

Quest. But what is the spiritual necessity of our neighbor, for the which we
are bound to give our temporary life?

Answ. Triplex necessitas, gravis, non gravis, et extrema.
There is a threefold necessity: first that which is not an urgent necessity:
secondly, that which is an urgent necessity: Thirdly, that which is an extreme
necessity.

First, when the necessity is not great, and when my neighbor can provide for
his spiritual life, without the hazard of my temporary life: in this case I am
not bound to give my temporary life for his spiritual life.

Secondly, if the necessity be such, that he cannot without great difficulty
save his spiritual life, in this case I ought to hazard my temporary life for
his spiritual life

Thirdly, if his spiritual life be in extreme necessity; for then I am to lay
down my temporary life for him.

Here we see that pastors who are the shepherds of the souls of the people,
Ioh. 10.11. The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep, but the hireling
flees.

We are not to give our temporary life for the spiritual life of our
neighbor, Navarrus propounds in his cases of popish conscience, is not to be
allowed. If a Christian should have a child borne to him amongst the Pagans,
and the child were near death; whether or no were a Preacher bound to baptize
that child although he knew certainly that the Pagans would kill him? Navarrus
holds, that this child being in a spiritual imminent danger of eternal death
for want of baptism, the Preacher is bound to baptize him, although he knew it
should cost him his life.

But there is no such necessity of baptism, How we are to prefer our
neighbor to our selves in spiritual things.
but only the contempt of it; therefore this case of necessity is but an
imaginary necessity, and if a man in this case would hazard himself, he were
guilty of his own death.

Although we are to prefer our own salvation to the salvation of others, yet
we may desire the deferring of it for a while for the good of others.

Phil. 1.23.24. It is good for me to be dissolved, but better for you that I
remain in this body: it was for this cause that Ezekias desired to live, that
he might go up to the house of the Lord and see Gods glory set up there, and
the peoples salvation set forward, Esaias, 38. so Martinus said, Si adhuc
Dominesum populo tuo necessarius, non recuso laborem: if I can be steadable yet
Lord to thy people, I refuse not to undergo any travel amongst them.

Although it be lawful for us to desire the deferring of our happiness for a
time, for the good of others: yet it is not lawful for a man to desire the
perpetual delay of his blessedness for the good of others.

Object. But Paul wished, that he might be Anathem^ for the people of God, Romans
9.3. and so Moses wished that he might be rased out of the Book of life for
the Jews, 2 Exodus 32.32.

Answ. It was for Gods glory that they wished this, and not simply for the
Jews, because Gods glory was manifested in them.

In the spiritual things which a man is bound to desire for himself and his
neighbor, he is more bound to desire his own salvation, Aliquid amatur
objective, et appretiative.
appretiative; as if it were necessary either for me or Peter to perish, I
had rather Peter perished: but these who are more holier than I am and have
greater graces, they are more to be beloved objective, in respect of the good
that is desired, and I am more bound to seek a higher degree of glory to him,
than to my self; and herein I follow the will of God, because I should be
content of that measure that he has bestowed upon me.

We are to prefer our own salvation to the salvation of others: therefore it
is not lawful to commit a sin, for the safety of our neighbor, Math 16. What
avails it a man to get the whole world, and he lose his own soul? sin is
the loss of the soul.

Man before his fall loved his neighbor as himself: A collation betwixt the
innocent, first, and old Adam.
but the unregenerate now, they think it is love sufficient if they hate not
their neighbor. Others (as the Pharisees) think that their love is
sufficient, if they think well to their friend, and hate their enemies. There
is a third sort who will have compassion upon their enemies if they submit
themselves to them, but this may be found in generous beasts, as in the Lion.

The regenerate man loves his neighbor as himself; A Collation betwixt the
old and renewed Adam.
not only him who is his next neighbor called vicinus or his door neighbor,
or him who is near in friendship or blood to him: but him who is near in
nature to him, being his own flesh: therefore the Apostle expounding these
words, Luke 10.27, Thou shall love thy neighbor: expounds thy neighbor,
(...), Romans 13.8. any other man.

But the love of the unregenerate, extends not it self so far, for he loves
his friend, and hates his enemy: but Christ extends this love of our neighbor
to our enemies also, Mat. 5.44. and the Law expounds it so likewise: for in
Exo. 23.4. it is said, Thou shall love thine enemy: but Deuteronomy. 22.1. the same
law being repeated calls him, thy brother now neighbor and brother in the
scripture are used in one sense: and it is to be marked that when the two
Hebrews strove together, Moses calls them brethren. Act. 7.25. Ye are
brethren, why do you strive? So that our enemies are our brethren as Christ
shows in the parable of the Samaritane, Luke 10

Quest. How are we to love our enemies?

Answ. Our enemies are considered, First, as our private enemies: or as Gods
enemies, and to his Church Secondly, we must distinguish betwixt our own
private cause, and Gods cause. Thirdly, we must distinguish betwixt the persons
of evil men, and the actions of evil men.

We are to love our enemies, although they have wronged us, and should love
their persons: we are to pray against their sins, but not their persons, 2.
Sam. 15.31. Act. 42.9. We are bound to wish to our private enemies, things
temporary, unless these things be hurtful to them: but if they be enemies to
the Church, we are not to supply their wants, unless we hope by these means to
draw them to the Church.

But if the persons sin unto death, 1 Ioh. 5.19. then we are to pray, not
only against their actions, but also against their persons; and because few
have the spirit to discern these, we should apply these imprecations used in
the Psalms, against the enemies of the Church in general.

Quest. Whether is the love of God and of our neighbor, one sort of love or
not?

Answ. Objectum amoris vel est formale, vel materiale.
It is one sort of love; the formal object of our love in this life is God,
because all things are reduced to God by love; the material object of our love
is our neighbor, Vno habitu charitat is diligimus, deum and proximum licet
actu distinguantur.
here they are not two sorts, but one love: and as there is but vnus spiritus
and varia dona, one Spirit and diversity of gifts, 1 Cor. 12. so there are due
praecepta and unus amor; two praecepts and one love.

The remedies to cure sinful love since the fall. That we may cure our
sinful love, and set it upon the right object:

First, we must turn our senses, that they be not incentivum et somentum
amoris perversi; that is, that our senses be not the provokers and nourishment
of perverse love. It is memorable which Augustine marks, that the two first
corrupt loves began at the eye. First, the love of Eva beholding the forbidden
fruit, which brought destruction to the souls of men. Secondly, when the
Sons of God, saw the daughters of man to be fair, they went in to them, Genesis
6.1. this fin brought on the deluge; it had been a profitable lesson then for
them, If they had made a covenant with their eyes; Job 31.1.

Secondly; it is a profitable help, to draw our affections from things
beloved, to consider seriously, what arguments we may draw from the things
which we love, that we may alienate our minds from them; and we shall find
more hurt by the things we set our love upon, than we can find pleasure in
them. If David when he looked upon Bethsabe with an adulterous eye; had
remembered what fearful consequence would have followed: as the torment of
conscience, the defiling of his daughter Tamar, and of his concubines, and,
that the sword should never depart from his house, 2 Samuel 11.12. and a thousand
such inconveniences, he would have said, this will be a dear bought sin.

Thirdly, consider the hurts which this perverse love breeds, He who loves sin
hates his own soul, Psalm. 10.5.

Fourthly, let thy mind be busied upon lawful objects, and idleness would
be eschued, it was idleness which brought the Sodomites to their sin, Qui
otio vacant in rem negotiosissimam incidunt; these who are given to idleness
fall into many trouble some businesses.

CHAP. VII. Of Hatred.
HAtred is a turning of the concupiscible appetite from that which is evil, or
esteemed evil. Odiumest quo volunt as resilit ab objecto disconvenienti, vel
ut disconvenienti.

A collation betwixt the innocent, and old Adam.




Man in his first estate loved God with all his heart: but since the fall, he
is become, a hater of God, Romans 1.30 and of his neighbor, 1 Ioh. 2.9. and of
himself, Psalm. 10.5. How can God (who is absolutely good) be hated,

Answ. God cannot be directly the object of our hatred: bonum in universali,
cannot be hated; God is both truth and goodness; therefore he cannot be hated.
The understanding looks to truth, and the will to goodness; God is both truth
and goodness; therefore he cannot be hated in himself, but in some
particular respect; as men hate him, because he inflicteth the evil of
punishment upon them, or because he commands them something, which they
think hard to do; as restraining them in their pleasure or profit.

So the wicked they hate not the word as the word, but as it crosses their
lewd appetites, and curbes their desires, Gal. 4.6. Am I become your enemy
because I tell you the truth? The sheep hates not the Wolf, as it is a living
creature; for then it should hate the Ox also; but the Sheep hates the Wolf
as hurtful to it; and in this sense Men are said to be haters of God.

These who behold that infinite good, cannot hate him, but of necessity love
him; therefore the sin of the devils was, the turning away of their sight from
God, and the reflection of their understanding upon themselves, admiring their
own sublimity, remembering their subordination to God; this grieved them,
whereby they were drowned with the conceit of their own pride; whereupon their
delection, adoration, and imitation of God and goodness were interrupted.
Diabolus tria amisit in lapsu, delectationem in pulchritudine Dei: a dorationem
majestat is: and imitatiouem exemplar is bonitatis.
So long as they beheld the Majesty of God, they had delectation in his beauty,
adoration of his majesty, and imitation of his exemplary goodness.

Quest. Whether is the hating of God, or the ignorance of God the greater
sin? it may seem that the hating of God is the greater sin; Namcujus
oppositum est melius; Arist. ethic. 8. c. 6.
ipsum est pejus, for that whose opposite is best, it must be worse it self;
but the love of God is better than the knowledge of God: therefore the hating
of God is a greater sin, than the ignorance of God.

Ans. The hatred of God, and the ignorance of God, are considered two ways;
either as hatred includes ignorance, or as they are severally considered. As
hatred includes ignorance, then hatred is a greater sin than ignorance,
because he that hates God must be ignorant of him.

But if we consider them severally; then ignorance is to be distinguished into
ignorantia purae negationis, and ignorantia pravae dispositionis; and this
latter ignorance, proceeding from a perverse disposition of the Soul which
will not know God, as Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord that I should know him, and
obey his voice? Exodus 5.2. must be a greater sin than hatred, for such
ignorance is the cause of hatred; and in vices the cause must be worfe then
the effect: but perverse ignorance is the cause of the hatred of God. Therefore
this sort of ignorance, is a greater sin than the hating of God.

We must not then understand the axiom according to the first fence here; for
there is no contrariety betwixt hatred and ignorance; because the one includes
the other. But where they are severally confidered, then the rule holds in
these oppositions which are opposite in the same respect; as one contrary to
another, one contradictory to another; if white be the most bright color,
Duplex oppositio, contrarietatis and contradictionis.
then black must be the most dark color: here the axiom holds, because
there is a direct opposition in contrariety of the same kind. So, good is to be
followed, good is not to be followed: this opposition holds in contradiction of
the same thing.

But this rule will not hold betwixt a contrary and a contradictory joined
together, secundum gradus perfectionis: as, love is a greater virtue than
knowledge, therefore not to love is a greater vice than hatred: this does not
follow; for hatred is a greater vice, than not to love.

Now, when the hatred of God, and the ignorance of God are compared together,
with their opposites love and knowledge, secundum oppositionem et comparative,
love and hatred are opposed contrarily; but knowledge and ignorance are opposed
privately and contradictory.

Now there is a greater opposition betwixt two contradictories, Quae opponuntur
privative vel contradictorie magis opponuntur quam quae contrary; scire and
ignorare contradictorie opponuntur amare and odisse contrary.
than betwixt two contraries; therefore the ignorance of God must be a greater
sin, then the hatred of God: and here the Axiom holds. The misery of the
damned (it is thought,) consists not so much in the want of the love of God, as
the want of the sight of God.

The Lord Jesus Christ his hatred was a perfect hatred of sin, A collation
betwixt the second and renewed Adam.
both in parts and degrees: he hated sin to the full, Duplex perfectio,
graduum and partium.
both intensively and extensively; as he loved God with all his heart, strength
and might, so he hated sin intensively to the full with all his strength and
might, Duplexodium, secundum intensionem et extensionem.
and also extensively; that is, he hated all sorts of sin with a perfect
hatred, and cheifely those sins that were most opposite to the glory of God
his father, as was idolatry.

But the regenerate, hate sin with the perfection of parts, but not of
degrees, Psalm. 139.22. Do I not hate them with a perfect hatred who hate thee:
that is only a perfection on parts, but not in degrees.

Again, they hate not sin to the full intensive: for, the good that they
would do, that they do not, Romans 7.15. neither do they hate sin to the
full, extensive. David hated Idolatry, but yet not to the full, when he
brought home the Ark of God from Iearimoth in the house of Abinadab, and set
it up in the house of Obed-Edom, 2 Samuel 2.10. he took away the Philistines
golden Myce, and the Hemorrhoides, 1 Samuel 6.4. but yet he set the Arc upon a
new cart which he made himself (for the men of Bethshemesh had cut the
Philistines cart, 1 Samuel 6.14.) which he ought not to have done: for the Arc
should have been carried upon the Priests shoulders, Numb. 7.9, and not upon a
cart: heerin he followed the example of the Philistines: so Iunius expounds it.

Some of the good Kings of Judah took away the Idolles, but yet the high
places were not removed, 2 King. 12.4. the reason of this is, because,
Idolatry is a work of the flesh, Gal. 5.20. And we hate not the works of the
flesh perfectly. A collation betwixt the renewed and old Adam.


The hatred of the regenerate is a perfect hatred in parts against sin,
although not in degrees. But the hatred of the wicked is but a faint hatred
against idolatry of this or that sort.

The hatred of the wicked is not a perfect hatred against idolatry: Corinth,
who were both partakers of the cup of the Lord, and the cup of Devils, 1
Cor. 10. and these who halted betwixt God and Baal, 1 King. 18.21. So these who
would agree us and the Church of Rome, making no difference in the fundamental
points of our religion; but, what communion can there be bttwixt light and
darkness: 2 Cor. 6.14.

There were some who study to reconcile the Stoics and Peripateticks: but
Cicero said, they cannot be reconciled, quia nonagitur definibus, sed de ipsa
haere ditate: we controvert not with the church of Rome about landmarkes, but
for the inheritance it self. A collation betwixt the second and old Adam.


In Christ there was a twofold hatred. First, the hatred of abomination.
Duplex odium, abomi nationis, and inimicitiae.
Secondly the hatred of enmity the hatred of abomination was when Christ
distasted the evil done against his Father, himself, or his members; hating
this sin as contrary to his goodness, and as hurtful to his members. The
hatred of enmity is when Christ wills the punishment of the person because
of the evil he is defiled with: he will have a man to be punished as a wicked
man, but not as a man. As by the first sort he hated the sin, so by the
second he hated the sinner.

But the unregenerate, sometimes do hate the person, but not the sin; Judah
bad bring forth his daughter in law Thamar and burn her Genesis 38 24. when he
was as guilty of the sin himself; in this he was not regenerate.

Some again connive at the sin, for the person; as Eli, who bore with the
sins of his children because he loved them so well, 1 Samuel 2.23.

Some again hate the person for the good found in them; as, O di Michaiam, I
hate him, 1 King. 22.8. Some care not, if both the sin and the person perish
together. Gobrias willed Darius to kill him and his enemy together; sed non
probamus illud, pereat amicus cum inimico, we approve not that, let a friend
perish with a foe; but we should save the one, and kill the other. Levit.
19.17. Thou shall not hate thy brother in thy heart, but reprove him; We should
hate his sin but love the person.

Hatred, Differunt, odium, ira, and in vidia.
Anger and Envy, differ; first, anger is particular, as we are angry with Peter
or John for some offense they have done us; but hatred is general against the
sin it self. Iraest circa, indiv idua, odium circa speciem.


Secondly, anger may be cured by process of time, but hatred is incureable,
for no time can cure it.

Thirdly, anger has bounds, if one be angry at another, and see any calamity
befall him, which exceeds the limits of a common revenge, he has pity upon
his enemy: but hatred is never satisfied.

Again, hatred differs from envy; for hatred arises upon the conceit of the
wrong done to us or ours, or generally to all mankind; whereas envy has for
the object, the felicities or prosperities of other men.

Secondly, hatred is also in brute beasts; but envy is only found in man.

The remedies to cure sinful hatred.
The remedies to cure this sinful hatred are: first, consider that the man
whom thou hate most, may be helpful to thee again. Joseph once most hated
of his brethren, yet necessity moved them to love him again. So the Elders
of Gilead who did hate Iephteh and expelled him out of his fathers house, Judge.
11.7. but when the time of tribulation came, he became their beloved head and
Captain.

Secondly, if we would make good use of our hatred, we must employ it against
vice, and against these objects, the love and pursuit whereof may pollute the
heart, and blemish the image of God which shines in our souls.

Thirdly, if we should cure hatred, we must represent the miseries which do
commonly accompany the pursuites of envy; we must set before our eyes the
shipwreck of so many famous persons, that have lost themselves upon this
shelfe, and we must represent to our selves the crosses, pains, and torments
which this wretched passion does cause.

CHAP. VIII. Of desire.
Desire, Desiderium est voluntarius affectus, ut res quae bona existimatur and
deest, vel existat, vel possideatur.
is a passion which we have to attain to a good thing which we enjoy not, that
we imagine is fitting for us.

Desire differs from love and pleasure; it differs from love, Differt
desiderium, ab amore and delectatione.
for love is the first passion which we have of any good thing, without
respect whether it be present or absent: but desire is a passion for good that
is absent; and pleasure is the contentment that we have when we have gotten a
thing.

Man in the first estate, desires were rightly set and moderate.

His desires were either of spiritual things, Duplex desiderium; spiritualis.
and naturalis boni.
or natural things. In spirituali things, his desires were speedily carried to
the right object God: for as heavy things the nearer that they draw to the
center, the more speedily they are carried to the same, so Adams desires being
so near God the center, they were speedily carried unto him; and in nature all
things his desires were few and moderate; for even as the Children of God, the
nearer they draw to their end, they have the fewer desires of worldly things:
so, Adam being so near that heavenly glory, few and moderate were his desires
of worldly thigns. A collation betwixt the second and renewed Adam.


The desires of Christ were always subordinate to the will of God his father:
but the desires of the regenerate, they are many times not subordinate to the
will of God.

Object. But it may be said that Christ's desires were not always subordinate
to the will of his father, when as he desired the cup to pass, which his
father willed him to drink, Math. 26.39.

Answ. Triplex est desiderium, natural, rationale, and spirituale.
There is a threefold desire: first, a natural desire: secondly, a reasonable
desire: thirdly, a spiritual desire: every one of those by their order are
subordinate to another, and there is no repugnancy amongst them.

A man has Saint Anthonies fire in his hand, Voluntas rationis duplex est;
rationis ut ratioest, and rationis ut natura est.
a Chirurgian comes to cut it off; the natural desire shrinkes and pulls back
the hand, because nature seeks the preservation of it self: but the
reasonable desire says, rather than the whole body shall be consumed, he will
command the Chirurgian to cut off the hand; here is no repugnancy betwixt the
natural and reasonable desire, but a subordination. In Fevers, we desire to
drink, and yet we will not; and so in Apoplexies to sleep, and yet we will
not.

This will of reason made Scevola to hold his hand in the fire until it burnt.
A Martyr is carried to the stake to be burnt, the natural desire shrinkes,
seeking the preservation of it self; but yet it submits it self, to the
spiritual desire, which comes on, and says: rather than thou dishonor God,
go to the fire and be burnt; this spiritual desire made Cranmer to hold his
hand in the fire till it burnt.

In Christ there are three desires or wills; In Christo tres fuerunt voluntates,
diviina, rationalis, and naturalis. Voluntates non fuerunt contrariae, licet
volita fue runt contraria.
his divine will; his reasonable will, and his natural will. There was no
repugnancy amongst these wills, for his reasonable will, absolutely willed that,
which his divine will willed; and although his natural will was different from
his other two wills, declining the evil of punishment, and seeking the
preservation of it self: yet there was no contrariety here, for these which
are contrary, must be contrary secundum idem, et circaidem, according to the
same object, and in the same respect; but, his natural will, and his divine
will the one willing that the cup should pass, and the other willing it should
not pass, were in diverse respects; for God willed Christ to die for the
purging of the sins of men; but Christ as man willed the cup to pass; seeking
the preservation of nature only.

Christ's humane will was conform to the will of the Godhead, in the thing
willed formally; that is, Duplex est velle, formale, and materiale.
when he beheld this cup, as the middle to purchase man's salvation; but it was
diverse from it, considering the cup materially in it self, as it was a bitter
cup.

Example when a Judge wills a thief to be hanged, and the wife of this thief
wills him not to be hanged, for her own private weal; here is no contrariety
betwixt the two wills. But if the wife of the thief, should will her husband to
live, as an enemy to the commonwealth, then her will should be contrary to the
Judges will.

This natural will in Christ hindered not his divine and reasonable will; and
it willed nothing but that which these wills willed it to will, for they had the
absolute commandment over it: neither was there any strife betwixt them, as
betwixt the flesh and the spirit in the regenerate, Gal. 5. but still a
subordination.

The subordination of the wills in Christ, natural will in Christ seemed to go
a diverse course, from his reasonable and divine will; yet it was moderate by
his superior wills, and did nothing but that which his superior wills willed it
to will, Esaias 53. He offered himself because he would, Ioh. 10. I lay down
my life: so that every will kept that which was proper to it self. Voluntas
divina, justitiam; voluntas rationis, obedientiam; voluntas carnis, naturam
volebat: that is, his divine will, willed justice; his reasonable will, willed
obedience; and the will of his flesh, willed the preservation of his nature.

Answ. How says Luke 22.44. that he being in his agony he prayed a long
space that the cup might pass, then it might seem, that there was a
contrariety betwixt his wills?

Answ. Nulla erat contrariet as inter voluntates Christi, sed inter voluntat es
and mortem.
This strife was not properly betwixt his two wills, but betwixt his natural
will and death, which nature shunned as contrary to it: this fight we see in
children and in brute beasts; in children who have not the act of reason; this
is no other thing then the fear of imminent evil.

Christ desired this cup to pass. Duplex voluntas, absoluta and conditionalis.
There is a double desire or willing in the will: either an absolute will, or a
conditional will: absolute, as when I wish a thing without any condition: as,
happiness. Conditional, when I will it with a condition: as, a man would not
give his purse to the robbers, if he could escape death; he wills this
conditionally only to escape the danger. So our Lord willed not absolutely to
drink this cup, but seeing that God his Father had determinate this way,
that man's salvation should be purchased, Christ would drink this cup.

In Christ's desires there was no reluctation, A collation betwixt the second,
renned and old Adam.
but subordination: but in the regenerate, their desires are with some
reluctation, and they are not fully subordinate. When Christ said to Peter,
They shall carry thee whither thou would not, Ioh. 21.18. meaning what death
he should die; there was some sinful reluctation here, betwixt Peter's
spiritual desire; and his natural desire; although he gave his life in the
end for the truth.

But the wills of the unregenerate, are no ways subordinate to the will of God.
When Christ says, Volunt as indiger, explicatione, and subjections.
Let this cup pass yet not my will be done but thine, Luke 22.42. here is
not a correction of Christ's desire, but only an explication of it. But when
Peter gave his life for the truth there needed a correction of his desire,
because there was some unwillingnes in him.

But the wicked their desires have need of subjection to the will of God.

Christ's natural will sought the preservation of it self, which his divine will
would not: hence it follows that a man may naturally will that without sin,
which his spiritual will wills not.

We should learn by Christ's example to subject our wills to the will of God,

If Christ submitted his natural will, to the will of the Father which was not
sinful, sinful desires to his will.

The desires of the regenerate are moderate; Acollation betwixt the renowed and
old Adam.
the desire of the unregenerate are immoderate. Agur prays, Prove. 30. Da mihi
lechem chukki, panem dimensi mei, as the Israelites, had their Manna measured
out to them in a gomer: Exodus 16. so Agur desires that God would give him the
measure that is fit for him. They are content with that (...), Luke 12.42.
which signifies a man's stint: where he alludeth to the care of governors of
families or stewards, who do allow to every one in the house their portions
see James 2.15. They having meat and cloth they are content, 1 Timothy 6.8.
nature taught some men to be content with little, grace can teach them to be
content with less.

The Prophet Esaias in his fourteenth chapter and fourth verse, noting the
insatiable desire which men have to riches calls Babel gold-thirsty Babel: and
Habaccuk 2.6. says, Woe be to you who load your self with thick clay; meaning
gold and riches, The desires of beasts are finite, but the desires of
unregenerate men areinfinite when they come to the measure what will suffice
them.

The Philosopher says, the cause of this, is to live, but not to live well;
the beasts when they are satisfied for the present content the mselves, neither
seek they any more: the Lion when he has killed the Bull, satisfies his
hunger, but hides not up the rest in the ground: neither do the fowls lay up
any thing, Math. 6.26. only creeping things and most imperfect lay up: as, the
Pismire hordes up in Summer against the Winter, Prove. 6. but man is not satiate
for hoording and treasuring up for the time to come: his desires are so
infinite.

The ancient Philosophers compared the first matter, to an infamous strumpet,
who is never glutted with present pleasure, but still does meditate upon new
imbracings, for it still desires new forms. But we have more reason to
compare our desires which are insatiable to this strumpet.

Quest. Whether are man's desires infinite or not?

Answ. They are not actually infinite, Duplex infinitas, actualis, and
persuccessionem.
because nature tends always to some finite thing, for no man desires
infinite meat; yet his desires are infinite by succession, Leo Hebraeus.
because these bodily things which we desire are not permanent, Nam pereunte
unodesiderio succedit alterum One desire being gone, another comes in place of
it: Christ says, He who drinks of this water shall never thirst again; So he
that has true desire after righteousness shall be satisfied; but he that
thirsts after the things of this life, shall be in a continual thirst, like
the Horse-leach which has two daughters, crying continually, Give, give, Prove.
30.15.

The remedies to cure these sinful desires.
That we may cure these sinful desires. First, we must take heed that these
desires of ours, be not suffered to gather strength, but we must choke them in
the very beginning, and dash the heads of the young ones against the wall, Psalm.
173. crush this Cocatrice egg in the beginning, lest it come to a Serpent,
Esai. 30.6. In confinibus est arcendus hostis, the enemy is to be beaten back
while he is in the borders.

Secondly, we must think often how near we are to death, and this will
restrain our covetous desires, parum viae and multum viatici, To have a short
way and much provision, is a foolish thing.

Thirdly, to remedy our covetous defires we should mark, that there is no
passion so much to be detested as it, because this monstrous passion draws
no contentment from that which it gathers together. We abhor more the
Cantharides, than Lions, Tigers, or Bears; for they kill men and reap no
fruit of their death, whereas the savage beasts when they kill any feed
themselves and satisfy their hunger: So these covetous desires when they have
scraped much together they make no use of that which they have gathered.

Of the passion of abomination contrary to desire.
Abomination is a passion which is opposire to desire, for it is the same
whichmakes us to abhor or flee that which we most distaste; this was in
Christ himself. Luke That which is in high request with men, is in abomination
before God: abomination and hatred, both abhorres evil, but abomination does
shun evil in a higher degree than hatred, and hatha greater detestation of
it. Hatred respects the evil present, abomination the evil to come,

CHAP. IX. Of Pleasure or delight.
PLeasure, is a passion arising from the sweetness of the object which we
enjoy As the fabric of the heaven makes the motion upon the two poles of the
world: which are as the two points where it begins and ends, So all the
passions of our soul depend upon pleasure and pain, which arise from the
contentment or distaste, which we receive from the objects.

As desire looks to the thing to come, and love to the thing present: so
pleasure looks to the delight in enjoying the thing.

God was the center of man's delight in the creation.

Some thing is in the center, primo et per se; Aliquidest in centro. 1. per se
et immobiliter, 2. immobiliter, sed non per se, 3. mobiliter est in centro, 4
quod nullo modo est in centro.
Secondly, the metals in the earth are in the center, immooveable, but not
primo, for there they are by the earth where of they proceed. Thirdly a stone
above the earth is in the center, but rests not there immooveably, Fourthly,
some things are not in the center, as when iron is drawn up by the loadstone:
so when a man rests in a ship he is not in the center.

To make the application: A collation betwixt the second, innocent glorified,
and old Adam.
Jesus Christ the second Adam is in the center (God) primo and per se, first
and by himself, and rests there immoveably, therefore his delights must be the
greatest. The Angels and the glorified Spirits are in the center, and rest
there immooveably, but they are not there, primo and per se, therefore their
delight is not so great as Christ's. Man in his creation was in the center, but
he was there mutably, the refore his delight was not so great as the sight of
the glorified Spirits.

But man unregenerate rests not at all in the center, he is like the iron
drawn up by the loadstone which is not in the center: or like a man who rests
in a ship: therefore his delight must be most miserable. The souls of the
wicked are said to be, in a sling, 1 Samuel 25.21 the souls of my Lords enemies
shall be in a sling: we see in what a violent motion a stone when it is put in
a sling, it is not then in the proper center; so the soul when it is turned
from God, it never rests because it is out of the center. But when it returns
to the center, then it rests and takes true delight; therefore David prays,
Psalm 43. return my soul to thy rest: come from thy pleasures and rest on
God.

Therefore the rich man in the Gospel, Luke 12.18. when he had his barnes
full, and then said, soul take thy rest, he put his soul out of the center,
from true joy.

The moralists mark three sorts of pleasure, the first is called pure joy; A
collation betwixt the second and old Adam.
the second not pure joy; the third impure joy: it is said, Luk 10.21. that
Christ rejoiced in his Spirit; Triplex delectatio, pura, non pura, impura.
this was pure and most excellent joy in Christ's understanding, and it had no
grief as contrary to it, beholding that comfortable object, God. Secondly this
pure joy it bred in his understanding, Piccolh: de summo bono.
it came into his will, and here the joy was mixed, being partly pure, and
partly not pure; pure when it willed the salvation of man, partly not pure but
mixed with grief, when it willed the salvation of man, by drinking of that
bitter cup. But descending from his understanding and will to the sensual
part, it was there non pura, because in his sensual part he had no comfort:
but it was never impura, neither in his will nor sensual part: but now when he
is in glory, as his joy is pure in his understanding, so it is altogether pure
in his will and inferior faculties.

In corrupt man his joy begins not in his spirit, but only in his brutish and
sensitive part, and so ascending up to his will and understanding, makes it
impure joy altogether.

Quest. It may be asked, how could Christ have the full measure of joy at the
same time, and the full measure of sadness; seeing two contraries cannot be in
the same subject at once, in intensis gradibus in the highest degree?

Answ. Lessius, de summo bono.
Good and evil are two contraries, so that how much the love of goodness
increases, so much the detestation and hatred of evil decreaseth, but sadness
and delight are not contraies, but diverse. because they are exercised about
diverse objects; as sweetness and bitterness, are not contrary but diverse.
Sadness arises not from joy but from love, and it looks to another object
than joy does: but good and evil which are contraries, look both to one
object; for if I love a thing, I distaste all things contrary to it; but when I
am sad for a thing I am not joyful for the contrary, but I love it; so that
the contrariety arises here in respect of good and evil, and not in respect
of joy and sadness. So that these might be both in Christ together.

Secondly, it is answered, joy was in Christ in the highest degree, in his
understanding and will, as beholding the divine essence immediately; sadness
was in Christ in the highest degree; as carrying the punishment of our sins
upon him: these two passions here were set upon diverse objects: and therefore
Christ might have had the full measure of joy and sadness at the same time.

True joy or delight is only in the understanding.

There are two sorts of delights, Duplex delectatio, sensualis and spiritualis.
one in the sense or brutish, these are called voluptates, pleasures: the other
are called spiritual delights, only in the understanding, and these the most
perfect delights.

Quest. Whether does man's chief happiness consist in these delights or not?

Answ. Duae conditiones ad summum bonum requiruntur, 1 ut non fit propter
aliud, 2. ut habeat sufficientiam in se.
These delights which are not perfect cannot be a man's chief happiness, but
accompany his happiness. For there are two conditions required in chief
happiness First, that it be not ordained for another end. Secondly that it have
sufficient goodness of it self.

The first condition is not found in this perfect delight, because it is
ordained for another end: that is, for true happiness whom it acompanies: so
likewise it is defective in the second condition, for it has not sufficient
goodness of it self but from true happiness: therefore man's chief felicity
cannot consist in it.

True happiness is not in the delights of the senses, therefore the Epicures,
and Jews, who place their chief felicity in worldly pleasures erred: Solomon
Eccles. 5. when he seems to place our happiness, in these he speaks in
the person of the Epicurean.

Our chief happiness consists not in pleasure, therefore the pleasure of the
understanding, felicity, which requires a spiritual delight, and joy in the
holy Ghost.

The first Adam, his delight was in his understanding, but yet he placed not
his chief felicity in it, A collation betwixt the innocent, renewed and old
Adam.
for it was only a companion of his felicity: and so it is in the regenerate
Adam: but the old Adam his chief delight is in his sense, and therein he
places his true happiness. The delight of the regenerate is in his operation,
and his delight is to do the will of God: but the delights of unregenerate men
and beasts are their last end, and all that they do is for delight.

There is a two fold order, betwixt the operation and delectation in beasts.
Duplex ordo inter operationes and delectationes brutorum, 1. respectu Dei, 2.
respectu sensitivi appetitus,
First, in respect of God the author of nature. Secondly, in respect of the
sensitive appetite. If we respect God the creator of them: God joined these
delights, with the operations, as we put sawces to re lish meat; but he did
not appoint these operations for pleasure. If we respect the desires and
delights in beasts themselves, who know no other good but the sensual good,
then all which they do is for delight; so the unregenerate follow not God
their creator and his first institution, to make delight serve to their chief
felicity; but all that they do, they make it serve for their pleasure and
delight.

Object. But seeing beasts follow the instinct of nature, how comes it to pass
that they keep a contrary course to Gods institution, who appointed delight
for operation, and not to make delight their last end?

Answ. Duplex intentio suit Dei in creatione, primaria and secundaria.
God in the creation had a double intention or purpose; his principal, and
secundary purpose: his principal purpose was, ut individua and species
propagentur and conserventur; that particular things might be propagate, and
their kinds preserved; and for this he appointed delight to serve for their
operations, as hunger to give appetite to meat.

His secondary purpose was (respecting the beasts) by putting a natural
inclination in them to do, that they might attain pleasure.

Example, when the law is made, which proposes rewards of well-doing, the law
of the first intention proposes, that men should give themselves to well-doing,
and ordaines rewards only for that; but in the second place as accessory, it
intends, that he which is stirred up by rewards should seek his reward for
well-doing: in the first he looks to well-doing, and then to the reward; in the
second being stirred up by the reward he is encouraged to do well.

So God in his first consideration looks first to their doing, as the chiefest
end, and then to delight as subordinate to it; the second consideration here is
not contrary to the first. But God ordained not man in his first creation to
make pleasure his last end, as he did in beasts, or his first end, as the
wicked; but now the Epicure says, Let us eat, let us drink, for to morrow we
shall die, Esai. 22.13. 1 Cor. 15.32.

Spiritual delights, sensual delights.

There is a nearer conjunction betwixt the soul and its delight,

For first, delectationes, intellectuales and sensuales; quumque modis
differunt.
the understanding reaches not only to the accidents of things, but pearceth
inwardly to the essence and substances themselves; the senses see only the
accidents of things,

Secondly, delight to look upon him. So a Carver delights to fashion a Monster
although he delight not to look upon him. So a Poet delights to describe a
flea or a gnatte, although he delight not to feel them: all these prove that
the intellectual delights are far to be preferred to the sensual.

Thirdly, delights of intellectual things are more permanent, and therefore
breed a greater delight in man than the sensitive whose objects are evanishing.

Fourthly, corporal delights are in the sensitive part, they have need to be
ruled by reason: but the intellectual things are in reason it self, which is
the rule; and therefore more moderate; and consequently breeds the greatest
delight; as that Music which breeds the greatest harmony delights most.

Lastly, A collation betwixt the innocent, second glorified, and old Adam.
sensual delights may exceed measure, but the intellectual delights cannot
exceed measure.

In the first Adam the delights of his soul redounded to his body, neither
took they away the natural operations of it; for he did eat, drink, and
sleep. In the glorified Adam the joy of the soul shall redound to the body,
that some think he shall have no use of the baser senses, but only of his
noble senses, seeing and hearing. But in the old Adam there redounds no glory
from the soul to the body, for he is altogether sensual, The remedies to cure
the sinful delights.

That we may cure these delights, First, we must consider, how hurtful these
pleasures are to the word of God, for they choke it as well as thorny cares do,
Luke 8. These who are lovers of pleasure are in greatest danger.

Secondly, that we be not taken up with pleasures, Valerius Maximus brings
out of the Philosopher, Lib 7, Oap. 7.
saying that it was a most profitable precept of the Philosopher, that we
should look upon pleasures going away, wearied, deformed, and full of
repentance: we should look upon the sting and tail of these Mermaides, and not
upon their beautiful faces: therefore the Apostle sets before us, The shape
of this world passing away, 1 Cor. 7. Look not upon them as they are coming,
but as they are going. Putiphares wife, Genesis 39. and Amnon, 2 Samuel 13.3, 9.
beheld them as they were coming with sweetness and solace; but Joseph and
Thamar beheld them as they were departing with shame, grief, and remorse.

Thirdly, Augustine when he speaks of the Philosophers who placed their
chief happiness in pleasure, Lib. 5. decivit. Dei 3. cap. 20.
says, that the rest of the Philosophers used to refute them, by a picture, in
which pleasure sat as a Lady in her throne, and commanded every virtue to do
somewhat for her, and to quite something for her, so that by this sight it
might appear to them, how absurd a thing it was for them to place felicity in
pleasure.

Fourthly, pleasures, lest they be the cause of our ruin, and in this case we
must follow the old wise men of Troy, who cou^selled Priame to send back
Helena to the Grecians, and not to suffer himself to be any longer abused with
the charms of her great beauty, for that keeping her within their city was to
entertain the siege of a fatal and dangerous war, and to nourish a fire
which would consume them to ashes. So we must chase away these alluring
pleasures which will bring destruction to us.

They show that pleasure and sensual delights, Apud Apulcium.
are the greatest enemies to the soul, by this Apologue: Psyche the daughter
of God and Nature, Bodini theatrum nature.
had two sisters elder than her self, who were married before her; the eldest
complained that she was kept close up in prison, and never had liberty to go
abroad; the second was also married, but she had more liberty than her eldest
sister, for she might go abroad, but both of them envyed their youngest
sister Psyche, (being most beautiful) that she was married to one of the gods
above, therefore they both conspired to draw her away from the love of her
husband, showing her what pleasures and contentments, she might have here
below, if she would leave him: so she followed their direction and persuasion;
but at last she fell in repentance, and resolved to turn to her first love
again.

The application of the apologue is this, that the soul has first the
vegetative faculty, which is the eldest fister, who is shut up within the body
as a prison, that she cannot go abroad; then she has the sensitive faculty,
the second sister which hears, and sees, and has the intelligence abroad;
both these envy the youngest sister the understanding faculty, therefore by
delights and sinful pleasures, they labor to draw their youngest sister from
the contemplation of God, to whom she was married, until the soul by
repentance return unto God again.

CHAP. X. Of Sadness and grief.
Sadness is a passion of the soul which arises from a coffeehouse that we
have received from the objects, contrary to her inclination.

Sadness differs from dolor or grief, for Sadness is properly in the
understanding, and that is called heaviness; but grief is only in the
sensitive part, and it is common to men and beasts. Secondly, sadness is of
things past, present, and to come, because it follows the understanding that
comprehends all these times; but grief is only of things present.

The first Adam before his fall had no sadness; A Collation betwixt the
innocent, and second Adam.
because as yet he had not sinned: but the second Adam Jesus Christ, taking the
punishment of our sins upon him, had great sadness, carrying the burden of
the sins of all the elect, both past, present, and to come.

There was a double sadness in Christ: the first, Duplex tristitia in Christo;
passionis, and compassionis,
was of passion, the second, of compassion, he was much grieved for the pains
he sustained himself, then doluit; but much more for that which he had in
compassion for us, for then condoluit. We in the state of corruption are more
grieved for that which we suffer our selves, than we can be grieved for any
other: but Christ was more grieved for us, that we were separate from God.

Again, they mark, that Christ compatitur nobis, Christus compatitur nobis,
ratione charitatis and ratione justitiae.
he had pity upon us, either by way of charity, as when he saw the people
hungry in the wilderness he had compassion upon them. So when he wept for
Jerusalem, Mat. 23. or by way of obligation, when he was bound by obligation to
satisfy for us upon the Cross.

Ob. Sadness is of these things which befall us against our will, but nothing
befell to Christ against his will, therefore sadness was in Christ.

Answ. Duplex tristitia; absoluto, and respectu quodam.
A man may be sad for these things, which are not absolutely against his will,
but in some respect; as the cup which Christ drank, if we will respect Gods
glory and man's salvation, he drank it willingly; but respecting the cup it
self, it was against his will, because of the pain.

Some sadness arises praeter rationis imperium, A Collation betwixt the
second and renewed Adam.
besides the command of reason; as these first motions which upon a sudden do
surprise men. Secondly, there is a sadness, contrajudicium rationis, against
the judgment of reason, Tristitia exsurgit praeter, contra, vel secundum
rationis imperium.
which subdueth reason for a while, and this may be also in the children of
God. Thirdly, there is a sadness, secundum imperium rationis, according to the
command of reason, for his reason commands him to be sad; in the two first
senses, Christ was not sad, but he was sad in the third sense.

Bonaventure, interpreting these words of Seneca, tristitia turbans non est in
sapiente, expounds it well; tristitia perturbans non est in sapiente: although
sadness trouble a wise man, yet it perturbs him not; for a man not to be sad
when he ought to be sad, est durities et non sapientia, it is hardness of
heart and not wisdom; rejoice with those that rejoice, and weep with those
that weep, Romans 12. Christ himself had this passion, and although he was
troubled with his passion, yet he was not perturbed with it.

Quest. Duplex facult as animae, superior, and inferior.
When Christ says, Math. 26.38. My soul is heavy unto the death; whether was
this sadness in the superior faculty of the soul, or in the inferior?

Answ. Facultates superiores, sumuntur vel stricte, vel large.
If we take the superior faculties of the soul largely, then this sadness
was as well in the superior as inferior faculties of the soul; but if we
take them strictly, then this sadness was not in the superior faculties.

The superior faculties of the soul are taken largely both in the
understanding and the will, when they look not only to God immediately, but
also to the means which lead to eternity; as to the sufferings, pains and
grief, which it is to undergo before it come hither; they are taken strictly,
looking only to eternal things as eternal, and respecting only God
himself. When Christ's soul beheld immediately God and man's salvation, then it
was not sad, but when he beheld the means leading unto this salvation, here
arose the sadness.

They clear the matter further by this comparison. A man that is leaprous, the
Doctor prescribes him to drink some poison for his health: now in his
understanding he conceives what a good thing his health is, and in that he
rejoices; there is no sadness in the understanding here, taking the
understanding strictly; so he wills his health, taking the will strictly, and
there is no sadness in it neither; but when he wills his health by this
physic, and remembers that he must drink this poison; here comes in the
sadness.

There was grief and sadness, in Christ's soul, superior and inferior
faculties; therefore these who hold that Christ suffered only in his soul by
simpathy, from the pains which arose from the body, and not immediately in his
soul; extenuate mightily our Lords sufferings; for the soul of Christ was
immediately the object of the wrath of God, and therefore the Prophet Esaias cha
55 9 calls them his deaths, because he suffered the first death, and the
equivalent of the second death for us.

The dignity of Christ's person, 1. made him acceptable in the sight of God, 2.
it made his sufferings to be meritorious, 3. his sufferings were meritorious
for compensation in circumstances, but not in substance: therefore death it
self could not be remitted to him, neither grief, horror, nor sadness, in the
first two respects. But because some things were unbeseeming the person of
Christ (as the torments of hell,) the compensation of this was supplied by the
worthiness of the person; yet he suffered the equivalent of it, in pain and
smart, and this bred his sorrow.

Example, a man is owing a sum of money to his neighbor, either he pays him
back again in the same kind, as gold for gold, or by the equivalent, as silver
for gold; and this is sufficient to discharge the sum. So Christ paid the
equivalent of the pains of hell to God his Father.

If a man be owing his neighbor such a sum, either he must pay it, or go to
prison; to go to the prison is not a part of the sum, for if he pay it
before he go to prison, he has satisfied the debt. So Christ suffering these
pains for us, although he descended not really into hell to suffer, yet he
paid the debt, and for this his soul was heavy even unto the death, Math.
26.38.

The sadness of the regenerate is a sadness that has respect to God, A
collation betwixt the renewed and old Adam.
which brings salvation; but the sorrow of the worldlings brings death to
them, 2 Cor. 7.10. The sadness which is toward God brings repentance to
salvation which is not to be repented of: but the sadness of the world brings
death.

Quest. Can godly sorrow make a man sad, seeing God is the most comfortable
object?

Answ. The beholding of God in himself can bring no sadness to man, for he is
a most comfortable object: but the beholding of sin which hinders us from
the clear sight of that object which is most comfortable, it is that which
breeds the sorrow in the regenerate.

The remedies to cure Sadness.
To cure this passion of sadness: first, we must consider that it is sometimes
set upon the wrong object: sometimes it is immoderately set upon the right
object. When is is set upon the wrong object, Duplex objectum tristitiae,
verum, and falsum.
it must be turned to the right object. We are not to comfort a man so long as
the passion is set upon a wrong object, but we must do as the sailors do,
who when they are in a wrong course, turn the ship another way.

Secondly, Verum objectum tristitiae, vel est in defectu, vel excessu.
when the passion is set upon the right object, if the passion be in defect:
then the passion must be more sharpened, as the sails are to be hoysed up when
it is too calm; but if the passion be too vehement, then it must be moderate;
for if the wind be too great, then the sails must be pulled down a little.

Secondly, reason must sharply censure this passion, David, Psalm. 43. Why art
thou cast down my soul; for if reason speak but gently to this sullen
passion, it will be more sullen: as Eli's insolent sons after the mild reproof
of their father were more insolent, 1 Samuel 2.25.

The Jews took a wrong course to nourish this passion of sadness and to give
way to it: first they hired mourning women, Amos 5.16. these were called
praeficae and siticines, quia apud sitos, id est, sepulchroconditos,
caner^solebant: secondly, they used in their burials, when those of older age
were buried, to sound the dead sound with a Trumpet, or with a Cornet: and this
the Poet approves when he says;

Cum signum luctus cornu grave mugit adunco, (...)
That is,

On cornet pipes they play the mournful sound,
When corpse of aged men are laid in ground.
But when their little children died, they used to play upon a Whistle or some
small pipe, which Coelius Rodigin, makes manifest thus;

Tibia, cui teneros suetum deducere manes,
Lege Phrygum maesta. (...)
That is,

Whose use it was with music to convay,
The tender souls the Phrygian mournful way.
When Iairus his little daughter was dead, Math. 9.23. Christ thrust out the
minstrels who played at her death. When they hired mourning women and minstrels
to nourish this passion, they did as if a mother should hire a bawd to
prostitute her daughter.

When thou art in thy grief, grief: the Thessalonians mourned immoderately
for the dead like heathen, 1 Thessalonians. 4.13. because they remembered not that
glorious resurrection.

Remember Christ's passion, Esaias says, that it was, with his stripes that we
are healed, Esai. 53.5. The first stripe that Christ got in his passion was
this sadness, And he began to be sorrowful, Math, 26.38. My soul is heavy
to the death, and this breeds joy to us; remember also that Christ was
anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows to make us glad, Psalm.
45.

Go to the Preacher to whom the Lord has given the tongue of the learned,
Esaias 50.4. that he may speak a word in due season to the weary heart; the
Preacher must not comfort for worldly sorrow, but rather make them for this
more sorrowful: so when he sees the sinner cast down, he must then remit of
his severity, and then begin to comfort him. It was the fault of the Church of
Corinth, 1 Cor. 5. when they saw the incestuous Corinthian too much humbled for
his fault, and like to be swallowed up with grief, that they would remit
nothing of the strictness of their censures; so the Primitive Church was too
strict in their censures; continuing the penitents too long under them, which
brought in Satisfaction afterward in the Church.

Let us use the remedy of the Sacraments: Prove. 30. to this purpose, give wine
to him that is of a sad heart; when we see our selves as it were carried to
execution, then a draught of this precious wine of Christ's blood will refresh
us; and make us look cheerful again.

CHAP. XI. Of the passions in the irascible part of the soul.
Of the passion of Hope.
THere be five passions in the Irascible appetite; hope, despair, fear,
boldness, and anger.

Hope, is a passion of the soul, that we have of the impression of future
good, which presents it self to our imagination, as difficult to obtain,
whereby we endeavor to pursue it, conceiving that we are able to attain unto
it, and in the end to get the possession.

Hope differs from desire, which extends it self to all kind of good,
without any apprehension of difficulty; and therefore desire belongs to the
concupiscible appetite; whereas hope is subject to the Irascible, and
respects the future good gotten with difficulty, for no man did ever hope for
things which he holds impossible to attain unto.

Hope is considered here as a natural virtue in the first Adam, and not as a
theological or supernatural virtue, as it is in us now, and it is placed in
the soul, ut operationem expeditam reddat, that it may further man in his
operation, 1 Cor. 9.10. he that plougheth, plougheth in hope, and he that
thresheth, should be partaker of his hope.

The first Adam had hope to enjoy the life to come, A Collation betwixt the
innocent and glorified Adam.
and to be translated to a better estate, if he continued in obedience; this
hope was natural to him, and he hoped without difficulty to obtain the
thing hoped for; Secunda secundae, q. 13 art. 3.
for as Thomas shows well, this difficulty of hardness to obtain the thing
hoped for, is not always necessarily required in him that hopes; nam spes
etiam versatur circa bonum facile; Hope may be exercised about that which is
easy to obtain; but the true reason wherefore hope is said to be of things
hardly obtained is this, because he that hops, has one above him who is
more powerful than he is, who may perform that which he hops for; and
herein stands the reason of this why it is said hardly to be obtained, because
we hope, that that must be performed by another, though it be not hard to
be obtained in it self.

So the first Adam, hoped that God would perform that which he hoped for
without any difficulty. It is true, our hope now is with great difficulty, and
many wrastlings, therefore it is compared to an anchor which holds the ship in
a storm, Heb. 6.16.

The hope in the glorified, although it be evacuate in the life to come
touching the substance of our blessedness, yet touching the adjuncts of this
glory, Polanus in syntagmate.
they say we may have faith and hope still: as the souls glorified believe the
second coming of Christ, and they hope for the rising of the body, and the
perfection of the Church. But when it is objected, how can hope and vision
stand together, for faith and hope are of things not seen, Heb. 11. They
answer, That they cannot stand together touching one object, and in the same
respect; for they cease in the life to come, when the soul beholds God the
most absolute object, Dulpex objectum glorificatorum, absolutum and secundarim.
but yet in respect of secondary objects, and things yet not accomplished,
which the Saints believe shall be accomplished; relying upon the authority of
him who has promised, not seeing them yet by sight as they do God himself:
in this respect they say, that faith and hope are not yet altogether abolished
in the heavens.

The hope of the unregenerate, is but somnium vigilantium, a waking man's
dream: for as dreams in the night fill us with illusions, and vain forms,
which abuse us and make us imagine that we are rich in our extremest poverty
and greatest misery: So hope abusing the imagination of the unregenerate, fills
their souls with vain contentments.

CHAP. XII. Of Despair.
Despair is contrary to Hope. There are two kinds of oppositions in the
passions of the soul; the first is found amongst these, that have contrary
things for their objects, and that is only amongst the passions of the
concupiscible part; as betwixt love and hatred, whereof the one regards the
good, and the other the evil, which are two contraries and can never be in one
subject together, at one time in the same respect. The second opposition is
observed, betwixt these that regard the same object, but with diverse
considerations, and that is found amongst the irascible passions, whereof the
one seeks the good of the object, and the other flees it, by reason of the
difficulty which does inviron it. Example: courage, and fear, do both regard
an imminent danger, which presents it self to the imagination: but courage
looks upon it to encounter with it and vanquish it. Fear regards it to avoid
it, and flee from it; and so despair is contrary to hope after this manner:
for the object of hope (which is a good, difficult to be obtained) draws us
upon the one side so far as we imagine a power to obtain: but despair does
respect it on the other side, when we apprehend that by no means we can enjoy
it, then we give over and despair. This passion of despair was neither in the
first, nor second Adam.

Object. All pains of the damned ought to be suffered by Christ, but despair
is a pain of the damned; therefore it ought to have been suffered by Christ.

Answ. Desperatio non est poena sed adjunctum peccati.
Desperation is not a pain or a cause of the pain properly, but an adjunct or
consequent of the sin in the sinner, that suffers punishment, arising from
an inward cause. Christ had no grief of conscience which is an adjunct of
sin in the wicked, so neither had he despair.

It is a shameless slander in those who charge Calvine as though he gave out
that these words of Christ (my God, Comment super Math. cap.
my God, why have thou for saken me,) were words of despair: he accurseth
such hellish blasphemy, and shows that howsoever the flesh apprehended
destroying evils, and inferior reason shows no issueout of the same; yet
there was ever a most sure resolved persuasion resting in his heart, that he
should undoubtedly prevail against them, and overcome them.

Quest. Whether is infidelity and the hating of God a greater sin than
despair, or not?

Answ. Infidelity and hating of God in themselves, Differentia inter odium and
desperationem.
are more heinous sins than despair; for they are directly against God, who
is in himself truth and goodness: but despair is only against God: because
the wretched sinner cannot perceive his goodness to him, therefore it is not
so great a sin as the former.

Quest. Whether is presumption or despair the greater sin?

Answ. Despair is a greater sin than presumption, Differentia inter
praesumptionem, and desperationem,
because it sins against the attribute of Gods mercy, which is Gods most
glorious attribute toward man; for God inclines more to show mercy than to
punish: therefore when he punishes, he is said facere opus non suum, Esaias
28.21. When he punishes, he punishes to the third and fourth generation; but
he shows mercy to the thousandth generation, Exodus 20.6. therefore it must be
a greater sin to contemn his mercy than his justice.

Despair makes a man contemn Gods mercy, and presumption his justice. As
despair is a turning from God; so presumption is an immoderate conversion to
God: presumption makes a man think to obtain mercy without repentance; but
despair makes him think it impossible to obtain mercy though with repentance.

Desperation in men is either sudden, or longer ad vised. Again, it is either
under the sense of Gods wrath as Judas was; or under the Cross as many of the
pagans; or under the rage of melancholy or frenzy: therefore men that are to
fight with this monster, let them resort to the word of God, and take it to be
his second, and withal use these remedies following.

The remedies to cure this passion.
That we may cure this passion of despair; First, we must remember the great
mercies of God: if we respect the dimensions in corporal things, and apply
them to things spiritual, as the Apostle does, Ephesians. 3.18. where he speaks
of the breadth, length, depth, and height of the love of God which passes all
knowledge, that we might be filled with all fullness of God. So let us apply
these dimensions to the mercy of God, and we shall find it most comfortable.
For the latitude and breadth of Gods mercy, let us remember that which David
says, misericordia tua plena est terra, Psalm. 33.5. For the length of his
mercy, let us remember that which the Virgin Mary sings in her song, Luke
1.50. And his mercy is from one generation to many generations, to them that
fear him. For the depthh of his mercy, as it is a fearful thing to look
into the gulf of our sins as Cain did: So it is a comfortable thing to look
into the depth of Gods mercy, that where sin has abounded, grace may super
abound, Romans 5.20. Then for the great height of Gods mercy, what can we see
next under God higher than the heavens? yet the Prophet says, Psalm. 108. verse
5. Thy mercies are exalted above the heavens. And for the indurance of his
mercy David says, Psalm. 100. verse 17. that it is ab aeterno in aeternum.
Concerning the multitude of his mercies some have sought to reduce them to
seven, as Peter did, Matthew chapter 18. verse 2. but seeing Christ wills us,
not only, to forgive seven times, but seventy times seven times; much more
will he, Math. 18.22.

Secondly, remember that although thy sins were red like the scarlet, yet he
can make them white as the snow, Esaias. 1.18. Scarlet in the He brew it is
called (...) twice because it is twice dipped: we cannot wash this dye out of
the scarlet again: but although we be dyed once, twice, thrice in sin, by
recidivations, and falling again into sin, yet the mercy of God is such that
he can wash out all those sins.

Thirdly, when God looks upon the sins of his Saints through Christ; he
sees no iniquity in them, Number. 23.25. he sees no iniquity in Jacob. There
is speculum gibbum, sive sphaericum, a glass made like a round sphere. 2.
Speculum concavum, a hollow glass, 3. Speculum planum, a plain glass. We see
a thing in a plain glass, just as it is, neither more nor less: we see a
thing in a hollow glass more then it is, we see a thing in a round glass,
far less then it is. When the Lord looks upon the sins of the wicked, he
sees them just as they are: when Satan looks upon the infirmities of the
Saints, he sees them more than they are: but when God looks upon the sins
of his Saints, he sees them less than they are, or not at all: Ier. 50 20.
In those days and in that time, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for,
and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found.

CHAP. XIII. Of Fear.
Fear, is a distress and grief of the sovle, troubled by the imagination of
some approaching evil: wherewith a man is threatened without any appearance to
be able to avoid it easily. It is called an approaching evil, for when it is
present, it is no more fear but heaviness. Timor vel est naturalis, humanus,
mundanus, servilis, initialis vel filialis.


There be six sorts of fear: first, natural, whereby every thing shunnes the
destruction of it self; this is in a beast.

Secondly, humane, which arises of too much a desire to this life; Job 1. Skin
for skin and all that a man has, will he give for his life.

Third, is worldly, when a man is afraid for the loss of his goods, credit,
or such, Ioh. 12. Many of the rulers believed in him, but for fear of the
Pharisees they did not confess him, for they loved more the glory of men, than
the glory of God; and John says, Revel. 21. the fearful shall be cast out of
the holy City, that is, such fearful as fear more the loss of temporary
things, than the loss of Gods favor.

Fourth, servile, to avoid the punishment of sin, yet they retain still the
love and liking of sin; it is called servile fear because as the servant or
hireling works not for love of his master, but only for fear of punishment;
so the wicked fear God for fear of punishment, but not to love him. This
servile fear is called Esaus fear. So it is called an adulterous fear,
because, as the adulterous woman is afraid of her husband only for fear of
punishment; so a man in whom there is servile fear, he fears God only for
punishment.

Fifth, initiall, that makes a man cast from him the desire of sinning by
reason of the love of God which he has partly attained unto, and out of the
consideration of the woeful consequents of sin; with the right eye it
beholds God, and with the left eye it beholds the punishment, and as the needle
draws in the thread after it, so this fear draws in charity, and makes a
way for filial fear, and it is a mids betwixt servile and filial fear: but
it is not such a mids as these means that mediate betwixt those that are of
the same kind, as the middle colors are betwixt white and black, but as
that which is imperfect, is a mids betwixt that which is perfect and that which
is not.

Sixth, filial fear, called timor castus, as the good wife fears her husband
only out of love and not for fear so does the child of God. This fear is
called Isaacks fear: These make the fear of the Lord their treasure, Esaias.
36.6. These sorts of fears, may be taken up after this sort, Some sort of
fear is, from the spirit and with the spirit; as initiall and filial fear
are both from the spirit of sanctification, and with the spirit of
sanctification: some fear is, from the spirit, but not with the spirit; as
servile fear, Ios. 24. I will send my fear before you. Gods spirit works
this in men: but the spirit of sanctification is not joined with it: as the
morning is from the Sun, and yet not with the Sun. Again, some fear is,
with the spirit, and not from the spirit; as natural fear in man, for the
preservation of himself: this fear is not from the spirit of God, and yet it
is found. with the Spirit of sanctification, as in the children of God. Some
fear is, neither from the Spirit, nor with the spirit, as, humane and worldly
fear.

Filial fear excludes servile fear, 1 Ioh. 4.18. perfect love thrusts out
fear. Filial fear respects first sin and offense of God, and in the second
room the punishment: but servile fear respects only the punishment: Duplex
malum paena and culpa.
the one of them are the children of the freewoman, the other are but Hagars
brats, Gal. 4.24.

Filial fear and servile differ altogether: therefore the Schoolmen are
mistaken, distinguishing more subtly than truly betwixt attrition and
contrition they call attrition an imperfect humiliation, as Judas repentance;
they call contrition a perfect humiliation, as Peter's repentance: and they hold
that in man's conversion it is the same fear which remains still, that he had
before he was converted, and it remains in substance (say they) the same
fear, and is changed only in act, because it fears not as it did before, the
punishment only: and these two differ (say they) secundum statum, only, as
that which is imperfect from that which is perfect as a boy differs from a
man. But no fear which is servile fear can ever become a good fear Romans 8.
We have not received the spirit of fear to bondage, but of freedom: it must
be a new sort of fear then different from this servile fear, which makes the
Children of God stand in awe to offend him.

Man in his first estate, A collation betwixt the innocent, second, old and
renewed Adam.
had not mundane fear, nor servile fear, he did nothing for fear of
punishment but of love: he had not initiall fear in him, because that implies
an imperfection; he had not natural fear in him actually because there was
nothing to hurt him: he had only that filial fear, that reverence of God,
not to offend him. The second Adam the Lord Jesus Christ, he had neither
worldly, servile nor initiall fear, but he had natural and filial fear, he
had natural fear actually (which the first Adam had not) declining the
hurtful object which he saw before him.

The regenerate have not servile fear, or mundane fear: but natural,
initiall, and filial fear. Man in his corrupt estate, has neither initiall
nor filial fear, but natural, humane, worldly and servile fear.

In the life to come, A collation betwixt the glorified, renewed and old Adam.
Duplex timor filialis, evitare malum, and facere bonum.
natural fear, humane fear worldly, servile and initiall fear shall cease;
and only filial fear shall remain. Filial fear in this life does two
things, first it escheweth evil for fear of offending God, and fear of being
separate from him, which shall not remain in the life to come, for then the
Saints shall be so confirmed that they cannot sin. The second part of filial
fear is to reverence God as our chief happiness, and that shall remain in
the life to come, there shall be neither evil of punishment, nor evil of
sin; there shall be no evil of sin there; therefore that part of filial
fear shall cease: neither shall there be any fear of punishment there, but
to reverence God as our chief happiness: Perficietur in patria, non
abolebitur; non minuitur sed augetur reverentia timoris illis: this fear shall
be perfected in the life to come, but not abolished; this fear of reverence
shall not be diminished but augmented to the blessed. But filial fear in the
children of God here makes them to eschew evil both for offending of God, and
for fear of being separate from him. But the unregenerate only for fear of
punishment, fear him.

The remedies to cure this passion.
That we may cure the sinful passion of fear; First, many times we fear that
which is not evil, but only which has a show of evil, Psalm. 14.5. They
feared where there was no cause of fear: saepius opinione laboramus, quam re;
We are more troubled oftentimes with the conceit of a thing, than with the
thing it self: If the thing be evil which we fear, yet it is not so great
an evil as we take it to be, or perhaps that which we fear will not fall out;
or if it fall out, we shall not be disturbed with it, before it fall out. The
evil which thou fear is either imaginary, momentany, Timor vel mali est,
imaginarius, momentaneus, contingens, vel indeterminatus.
contingent or uncertain, whether it will fall out or not: Seneca says, Ne
sis miser ante tempus, quaedam nos magis torquent, quam debeant; quaedam ante
torquent, quam debeant; quaedem terquent, cum omnino non debeant: that is, Be
not too miserable before hand: some things trouble us more than they ought to
do, some things trouble us before they ought; and some things trouble us,
which ought not at all: rebus est demenda persona; pull the mask off things,
and then we shall not be so afraid of them.

2 Let the fear of the Lord possess thy heart, and then all other fears will
be cast out: when the dictator ruled in Rome, then all other officers ceased;
so when this true fear of God possesses the heart, then it will banish all
other fear.

3 There are some, that fear neither God nor man, as the unjust Judge, Luke
18.2. these are worse than the devil; for, he fears and trembles, Iam. 2.19.
There are some that fear both God and man; there are some who fear God and
not man: and there are some, who fear man, and not God. The remedy to fear
God, and to be free of servile fear, is first, to look upon Gods love, and
then to his justice, this will breed filial fear, in thee: but if thou look
first upon his justice, and then upon his love, that breeds but servile fear:
if thou look first upon man, and then upon God, that will breed only but a
humane and worldly fear; if thou look first upon God and then upon man, this
will breed filial fear.

4 The greatest servile fear is, superstitious fear, therefore idols are
called terriculamenta, Esaias. 45.16. all other prisoners sleep in their fetters
in the night, but these superstitious wretches, are affrighted in their sleep,
and sleep not soundly: they may be compared to little children, who first
black the faces of their fellows, and then are afraid of them: so they first
set up these images, and then superstitiously worshipping them, are afraid of
them: but the true remedy to cure this superstitious fear is, to learn in
spirit and truth to worship the Lord, Ioh. 4.

5 The life is taken three manner of ways in the Scriptures: Triplex vira in
homine physica politica, and theologica.
1 naturally, 2 politically, and 3 theologically. Naturally, when the soul and
the body are joined, and the soul quickens it. Politically Eccles. 6.8. what
has the poor that knows to walk before the living; the poor are as it were
dead in respect of the rich who have the comfortable means to make them live
well. Theologically, the just live by faith, Habac. 2.4. so Romans 7.8. and the
commandment which was ordained to life; fear him least who can but take thy
politic life from thee, (thy goods:) fear him but in the second degree who
can take thy natural life from thee: but fear him most of all who can take
thy spiritual life from thee, this is to kill the soul.

Of the passion of Boldness contrary to fear.
Boldness, is a passion of the soul, which fortifieth it against greatest
miseries, hardest to be avoided, and incourageth it to pursue good things which
are most painful to obtain. This passion is for the most part joined with
temeritie or rashness. When the saints of God stand forth for the defense of
his Church or Gods glory: it is not boldness, but courage or fortitude.

CHAP. XIV. Of Choler or Anger.
ANger, is a passion of the mind for wrong offered; it differs from hatred;
for anger seeks revenge sub ratione justi vindicativi, it has respect to
justice and revenge, and it is a sudden passion: but the passion of hatred is a
bad passion in us, it is ira inveterata. Augustine compares anger to a mote in
a man's eye, but hatred to a balke or a beam.

Anger is in God eminenter: in beasts it is but umbrairae, and in man it is
properly. A collation betwixt the innocent, and second renewed, old Adam.
Distinct. 13. q. ult


Bonaventure makes four sorts of anger; the first, which arises from a
detestation of the sin, this he calls affectus purae detestationis: that is,
when one detests sin purely, which might have been in Adam himself before
he fell, if he had been angry with Eva, when she enticed him to eat of the
forbidden fruit, Secondly, when there arises a detestation of the sin, with
a certain trouble in the sensual part, yet without any perturbation of the
mind, and this was in Christ. Thirdly, when not only the inferior faculties,
but also the superior are troubled: as in the children of God when they are
angry against sin, their zeal sometimes so disturbes them, that it hinders
their reason for a while, but afterward it grows more clear again: as when we
lay eye salve to the eyes, the eyes for a while are dimmer, but afterward they
see more clearly; so this zeal although it trouble reason for a while, yet
afterward it becomes more clear. Fourthly, it not only disturbes the
inferior faculties, but also blindes reason, and pulls out the eyes of it in
the unregenerate, as the Philistines did Sampsons eyes, Judge. 16.

Sometimes man uses not reason at all, A collation betwixt the old renewed and
and second Adam.
but like beasts follow instinct, as mad men and children; sometimes man uses
reason, but his reason is so corrupt and depraved, that his corrupt reason and
his peverse will makes his anger to be more sinful, as Absalons hatred toward
Amnon, which he kept two years within himself, but when he found
opportunity, he killed his brother, 2 Samuel 13. Thirdly reason may be rightly
set, but yet the sensual appetite so prevails, that it overcomes the will, as
in David when he would have killed Nabal, 1 Samuel 25. Fourthly, reason may be
rightly set and have the dominion, although anger be not fully subdued, yet it
prevails not, as it falls out in the children of God when they are standing in
the state of grace, tergiversatur in his, licet non reluctetur; it makes some
shift in the Children of God, although it resist not altogether. Fifthly, when
there is a full and total subjection of anger, and this was in Christ.

There are two sorts of anger; the anger of zeal, A collation betwixt the
second, and renewed Adam. Duplex ira, zeli and resipiscentiae.
and the anger of repentance; the anger of zeal is, a desire to punish sin,
as sin in others, and that was in Christ when he whipped out the buyers and
sellers out of the Temple, Luke 19.45. the zeal of Gods house did eat him up.
Psalm. 69.10. The anger of repentance is, when one inflicts a punishment upon
himself for his own sins, and is angry with himself for his own sin,
this was not in Christ, but in the regenerate.

The regenerate seek not a revenge, Gen 50.19. Betwixt the renewed and old
Adam.
and if they have authority from God to punish, non excedit modum, it is not
out of measure, Genesis 50. but the unregenerate being but private men, and having
no authority, will have, tooth for tooth, and eye for eye, Matthew. 5.18. this
is the Pharisees revenge; and sometimes he comes to Cains revenge, seven for
one, Genesis 4.25. and sometimes to Lameches revenge, seventy for one, Genesis 4.24.
and sometimes to Sampsons revenge, Judge. 16.18, 29, 30. now let me be revenged
for one of my eyes, three thousand for one.

The regenerate are slow to anger and ready to forgive, they remember;
therefore the Lord says, Lev. 19.18. ye shall neither revenge nor remember.
The Jews give an example of this: Simeon sent to borrow of Reuben, a hatchet;
Ruben refuses to lend it, Ruben sent the next day, to borrow a sickle from
Simeon; he grants it, but withal he says, lo here it is, I will not do to
Reuben as he did to me yesterday, although this be not ultio (as they say,) yet
it is retentio.

To render evil for good, perversitatis, perverse anger, such was that of
Judas in selling of Christ, Mat. 26. Quadruplex retributio, perversitatis,
fragilitatis, aequitatis, and perfectionis.
to render evil for evil, est fragilitatis, anger of infirmity, as Ioab when
he killed Abner, for slaying of his brother Hasael, 2 Samuel 3.27. to render
good for good, as Ahashuerus did to Mordecai, who honored him, because he had
discovered a treason plotted against him, this was aequitatis. To render good
for evil, this is perfectionis majoris: Bless them that curse you, Mat. 5.

To render evil for evil is natural for a corrupt man, this is found in
beasts; to render good for good, this is the Pharisees righteousness, Math.
5.20. Except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees, ye
cannot enter into the Kingdom of God: a Christian must do more than to render
good for good. To render evil for good, this the devils do; but to render
good for evil, this the Children of God do.

There are four counselors, longanimitas, or long-suffering, Quatuor
moderantur iram, longanimitas, mansuetudo, facilitas ad ignoscendum, and
clementia.
which holds back anger, lest it hasten to inflict the punishment. Second,
mansuetudo, mildness, which moderates the anger that it exceed not in words.
Third, facilitas ad ignoscendum, easiness to forgive, which moderates anger
that it last not too long. Fourth, clementia, meekness, which moderates the
punishment. The unregenerate wanting these four counselors, their anger
exceeds: first, they want long-suffering, and presently they are set in a rage:
secondly, they want mildness, which should moderate their anger, that it
exceed not in words: thirdly, they are (...), implacabiles, Romans 1. they cannot
be pleased; lastly, they are cruel and cannot be satisfied in their
punishment.

Quest. Whether is a man bound to remit the injury done to him or not, when
his neighbor desires pardon of him?

Answ. Three things arise of an injury done to us; Tria consequuntur injuriam,
ira in affectione, ira in vultu, and reparatio per leges.
first, hatred in our affection; secondly the sign of this anger is, when it
appears in the countenance; thirdly, when we intend action by law for the
wrong. We are bound to pardon the first, although our enemy sue it not of us;
we are bound to pardon the second, when our enemy sues it of us; but we are not
bound always to pardon the third; for we may in some cases, repair the wrong
done to us by Law, without any rancour in our heart, or show of anger in our
countenance.

The Hebrews say; if a man have offended his neighbor, he must go and seek
reconciliation of him: but if he will not be reconciled, he shall take three
men with him, who shall intercede for him, and seek reconciliation: but if he
yet will not pardon him, this is a great iniquity to be so cruel, and not to
pardon the offense, for it is the manner of the Israelites to be easily
reconciled, and to pardon wrongs, as Joseph was toward his brethren; then he
leaves his neighbor inexcusable. But if his brother die before he have offered
these things and be reconciled to him, he shall take ten men, and go to the
place where his brother was buried whom he has offended, and stand above the
dead, and say before these ten men, I have sinned against the Lord God of
Israel, and again this my brother N. to whom I did so and so.

Christ makes sundry degrees of unjust anger, Mat. 5. Tres gradus irae, 1.
iracelata, 2. raca. 3. irrisio.
He that is angry with his brother, shall be guilty of jungement; he that calls
his brother Raca, shall be guilty of the council; but he that calls his
brother fool, shall be guilty of hell fire; that is, of the greatest
punishment in hell; These that call their brother Raca, or are angry with their
brother, are guilty also of hell, although not in such a high degree; and
according as the finnes grow, so does the punishment. Anger without words, is
to be punished by judgment; anger expressed by words, is to be punished by
the council; but anger joined with words and contumely, is to be punished by
hell.

Augustine says, in primo est ira tantum; in secundo est ira and sermo; in
tertio ira est and certa expressio irrisionis: that is, in the first there is
but only anger; in the second is anger joined with words; in the third, anger
expressed with a certain gesture of mocking.

There are three sorts of unjust anger in the wicked: Triagenera injustae irae.
1. Fell. 3. (...), 3. Furor.
the first is, called fell, and these that are possessed with this anger art
called by the Greeks (...), quae est ira subito excandescens, which is anger
soon stirred up; and this comes from the humor, bilis, choler; as they are
soon stirred up, so they are soon quenched. The second is called (...), which
arises of an enduring anger, and these are called (...), bitter in their
anger; this comes of flava bilis, of yellow choler and anger, this is more
permanent in these. The third is called, furor, and these that are possessed
with this, are called (...), this comes from atrabilis, black choler or
melancholy, which cannot be satisfied but by the blood of the enemy.

Some are soon angry and soon quenched, these are like flax, (...) est
lonita^ (...), who is sudden in anger. (...), who is bitter in his arger.
soon kindled and soon burnt out. Others long ere they are angry, and long
ere they be pacified; like green wood, long ere it be kindled, and long ere it
be quenched; but the worst of all are these; that are soon angry and hardly
quenched, these are most opposite to God, who is slow to anger and ready to
forgive, Psalm. 103. he is called (...) erech appajim, as ye would say, one who
has wide nostrils, for these who have widest nostrils are most patient, as
these who have narrow nostrils are hasty.

The remedies to cure the passion of anger.
That we may settle this passion of anger; First, we are to consider the
persons of these whom we have offended: we must give place to wrath, and not
intempestive incendium extinguere, not to quench the fire unseasonably, for
then we rather increase the anger, when we go about in time of grief to
pacify them. So Jacob gave place to the anger of his brother Esau for a while,
by the counsel of Rebecca. Seneca says, Primam iram non audebimus oratione
mulcere, surda est and timens, dabimus illi spacium, remedia in remissionibus
morborum prosunt: that is, We go not about to pacify anger in the heat of
it, we give it leisure first to settle, we cure not fevers in their height,
but when they begin to remit.

Secondly, when others have offended us; that we may quench our anger: First,
Be angry but sin not, Ephesians. 4.25. Anger and sin are not two twins, yet
they are very like other; as flattery is very like to friendship, and can be
very hardly distinguished from it; for men oftentimes think themselves to be
angry for Gods cause, when as it is their own particular that mooves them. The
disciples called for fire from heaven upon the Samaritans, Luke 9.54. one would
have thought this to have been holy anger and zeal that moved them for Gods
glory, when as it was their own particular which moved them: so when the high
Priest rent his clothes Mat. 26.65. We must learn then to distinguish these
two, else our anger will be but sinful anger.

Thirdly, Let not the Sun go down upon thy wrath: Anger says Solomon,
Eccles. 7.9. rests in the bosom of fools; it goes to bed with them, rises
with them, continues with them, and goes oftentimes to the grave with them;
the first day it may be easily cured; the second day more hardly; but the third
day most hardly: A threefold cord cannot easily be broken, Eccles. 4.12.

Fourthly, Let reason rule thine anger, and command it; we ride not first, and
then bridle our horse, but first we bridle our horse and then ride: be not
first angry and then think to bridle thy anger with reason, for then thou will
deceive thy self; but let reason first rule, and then be angry.

Fifthly, Remember that thy prayers cannot be heard unless thou be first
reconciled to thy neighbor, Mat. 5 24. Leave thy gift at the Altar, and be
reconciled to him. So, 1 Timothy 2.4. the Apostle wills, that men lift up holy
hands without wrath. So, 1 Pet. 3.7. the man and the wife must not jarre, that
their prayers be not hindered; so thou can not hear the word with profit in
anger. Therefore the Apostle wills us like newborn babes to drink in the
Word, 1 Pet. 2.2. so, we cannot eat our passover unless the leaven of malice
and envy be cast out, 1 Cor. 5.8. Let us not celebrate the feast with the old
leaven of malice.

Sixthly, remember Christ's example; who when he was reviled, reviled not
again, Mark 15.32. learn to spread thy injuries before the Lord as Ezekias
did when Rabshekah railed against him, 2 King. 19.14.

Seventhly, Behold oftentimes the passion of Christ, and that will quench thine
anger. The Israelites when they were stung with fiery serpents, Numb. 21. so
soon as they looked upon the brazen serpent, they were healed; so when we are
injured and wronged by our enemies, if we behold the passion of Christ with
faith, it will quench the sting of our enemies anger.

Anger has nothing opposite to it, as the rest of the passions have, because
it rises of a present evil which we cannot shun. If it be present and we may
shun it, then there needs not a contrary passion. When the evil is not
present, and joined with difficulty if we may surmount it, then arises
courage; if we cannot surmount it, then arises the contrary passion fear. If
the evil be present and joined with difficulty, then arises anger, because we
cannot shun it; for if we can shun it, there can be no passion there.

Object. But mildness seems contrary to anger.

Answ. Mildness is not a passion but a virtue which moderates it, and is not
contrary to it.

So much of the image of God in man; in his knowledge, will and affections,
wherein especially the image of God consists. We come to his outward image of
God, which is his dominion over the creatures.

CHAP. XV. Of the second part of the image of God in man, in his dominion over
the creatures.
MAn before the fall was Lord over the creatures,

There is no creature that can use all the creatures but man; First, of beasts,
is afraid of the fire, and when he sees the light of it, he flees from it.
2. He had commandment over the living creatures, for as yet a little boy can
lead a great Elephant, and a child will drive a number of oxen before him;
the relicts of Gods image in man makes them stand in awe of him yet.

There are sundry creatures that excel man in some things;

Reason is only found in man, Iam. 3.7. All are tamed by man; which they
cannot do by themselves: that shows that man was made Lord over them.

We count that one of the most excellent qualities in beasts,

That which has a show of reason, and diminute in part only, should obey him
who has reason perfectly, and understanding of all things: but beasts have
only some show of reason, they know some particular things, but they have not
a full and an universal knowledge of things, therefore they are naturally
subject to man.

There is nothing swifter than the horse among beasts, and yet he carries man,
the dog though most fierce waits upon man; the Elephant for as great and
terrible as he is, yet he serves to be a sport to man, in public meetings he
learnes to leap, kneel and dance; and other beasts serve to feed man: we eat
the honey of the bees, we drink the milk of cattle, therefore all the beasts
are made subject to man.

Man was Lord over the creatures before the fall, and they were ready to obey
him, hence may be drawn these consequents.

It is lawful for men to hunt after the beasts and to catch them now, Aristl.
pol. 1. o. 5.
because that way he recovers the right over them again, that he had at the
beginning.

Man was Lord over the creatures before the fall: therefore he could be afraid
of none of them: we see that Eva was not afraid of the serpent, as Moses was
when he fled from it, Exodus 4.

Man has another sort of dominion over the living creatures, than that which
he has over the plants and herbs of the fields: for the dominion which he had
over the living creatures was per imperium rationis, but he had dominion over
the plants, per solum earum usum, only by using them.

Man was made Lord over the creatures, therefore when by sin he becomes a
beast, like a dog or a hog; how far then does he abase himself from his
first estate and dominion: Plato called this, Foedam animarum incorporationem,
which some mistaking, thought that he held that the souls of men entered into
beasts, but he meant only that men became brutish and sensual like beasts.

Quest. How were the beasts so far distant from Adam gathered unto him, and
how could they give homage to him, being so far from him? Gen, 9. ad liter.
cap. 4
Augustine holds that when the beasts were gathered together before man, that
it was not by the authority which man had over them being so far distant from
him: but by the ministry of the Angels, or by the immediate power of God, as
they were gathered in the Arc to Noah, Genesis 7.8.9. This seems most probable.

Before the fall the beasts were subject unto man: A collation betwixt the
innocent and old Adam.
but since the fall he has lost his dominion; they become enemies unto him,
they pick out his eyes, eat his flesh, lap his blood. Before the fall Gods
image made them stand in awe of him. Man stands in awe of the Kings herald,
because of his coat of arms, take off this coat of arms from him, and men
carry no respect to him: The image of God is as it were the Lords coat of
arms, which he put upon him, that made the creatures afraid of him. We have a
notable example of this in the primitive Church, Lib. 8. cap. 8,
as Eusebius testifies, when the Christians were cast naked to the wild
beasts: ye should have seen them stamping, raging, and staring against them,
but durst not set upon them, the image of God so affrayed them: therefore the
persecutors covered them with the skins of wild beasts, to make them run
upon them.

Christ when he was in the wilderness with the beasts forty days and forty
nights, A collation betwixt the second, renewed, and old Adam.
they hurt him not, Mark. 1. So when the image of God is restored to man in
holiness, they begin willingly to serve him: but they are enemies to the
unregenerate. The dogs that eat the flesh of Iezabel, 1 King. 9.35. yet they
lick the sores of Lazarus, Luke 16.21. The ravens that pick out the eyes of
these who are disobedient to their parents, Prove. 30.17. yet they feed Elias in
the wilderness, 1 Kin. 17.4.6 The serpents sting the Israelites in the
wilderness, Number. 21.6. yet the Viper when it leaps upon Paul's hand hurts him
not, Act. 28.3, 5. The fish eat the bodies of the wicked in the sea: yet the
Whale preserved Jonas, Ion. 1.17. The Lions that touch not Daniel: yet devour
his accusers, Daniel 6.17. It is true that there are some relicts of the image
of God left, which make the beasts to stand in awe of him: therefore Psalm. 104.
it is said, When men go to rest, then the beasts come forth to hunt for their
prey. But these remnants of the image of God in the unregenerate, do not so
terrify the beasts, as the image of God restored in the regenerate man does.

Quest. What benefit should Adam have had of the creatures before the fall: for
he had not need of them ad alimentum for nourishment: he had not need of them
ad indumentum for clothing: he had not need of them ad laboris adiumentum, to
help him to labor in his work, as we have now?

Answ. He had other uses of them, for they were the matter of the praising of
God. We see now when Kings and Princes keep Lions, Eagles, Bears, Tigers, and
such their subjects gather their greatness by this, and their soveraingty:
much more did Adam before the fall gather the greatness and excellency of God,
by the diversity of these creatures. Again, by them he should have learned
more experimental knowledge of the qualities of the creatures: therefore it is
said, that God brought them before Adam that he might see how he would call
them, Genesis 2.20.

As he was Lord over the beasts before the fall,

We see when the beasts were in the Arc, after the fall, the ravening beasts
lived not upon flesh,

As man had dominion over the brutish creatures before his fall,

Man's estate before the fall was no better than the estate of the Angels but
amongst the Angels some are superior and some inferior, Colos. 1.16. There
should have bin a willing subjection of the wife to the husband: so then there
should have bin a subjection of children toward their parents.

There was no servile subjection of man to man before the fall but voluntary.

The relickes we see of this after the fall, Nimrod, which was more than 2000.
years after the creation.

Servile and unwilling subjection came in after the fall.

Man is considered three ways: first as he has a respect unto God, Homo
tripliciter confideratur, 1. respectu dei, 2, respectu brutorum, 3. respectu
aliorum bominum.
Secondly, as he is considered with the beasts, in which respect he was Lord
over them, for they were made for him. Thirdly, as he is considered with other
men: and in this respect, some now are servants, and some are free. First, now
by nature some are servants, as the dull and blockish, unto them thut are of
quicker wit and understanding. Quintuplexservus, 1. naturae, 2, affectionum, 3,
fortunae 4. belli, 5, ex compacto.
Secondly, these who have commandment over their affections now, are morally
Lords over these that cannot command their affections. Thirdly, there are servi
fortume, as when the poor serve the rich Fourthly, there are servibelli, as
these that are taken slaves in the wars. Fifthly, these who are servants ex
pacto that sell themselves.

Servile subjection was contrary to the first estate of man: therefore every
one ought to seek freedom, providing he may have it with lawful means, that
so he may draw nearer to this first estate hence it was that God would have
such servants, who refused their liberty at the seven years end. Exodus 21.6.
marked with a note of infamy, boaring them through the ear: This curse to be
a servant was laid, first upon a disobedient son Cham, and we see to this
day, that the Moors Chams posterity, are sold like slaves yet. When men may
not have their liberty now by lawful means, they should not shake off the yoke
of servitude; this was the fault of sundry servants in the Apostles days, who
thought because they were the Lords freemen, they might shake off the yoke of
their masters: but the Apostle teaches them another lesson, 1 Timothy 6.1.
Whosoever servants are under the yoke, let them have a due respect to their
masters, lest the name of God and the word come to contempt.

Quest. But seeing all men are sinners now, why are not all men slaves?

Answ. If God would deal in justice with us now, all should be slaves, but
God has mittigated this to some to the end that common wealths and families
might stand.

Adam gave names to the creatures, as their Lord,

Therefore none should impose names to children but the fathers who have
superiority over them, Rachel called her son Benoni, Jacob called him
Benjamin, Genesis 35.18. Hence they gather well, that Christ as man had not a
father, because his mother is commanded to give him the name, Esaias. 7. (...) et
tu faemina vocabis, in the feminine gender.

Object But Hagar gave her son a name, Genesis 16.11. and yet he had a father;
then it may seem that the mother may likewise impose the name to the child.

Answ. She gave this name at the commandment of the Angel, which Abraham
afterward confirmed, otherwise she had no power to give it.

Therefore these fathers who give this power to others,

This dominion which Adam had over the creatures,

God has dominium merum, he has absolute, Dominium dei in credturis, est
absolutum, immediatum, et liberu^: dominium hominis est conditionatum and
liberum.
free, or immediate dominion over the creatures: Man had only but dominium
conditionatum: such a dominion that was not an absolute and simple dominion, to
use them at his pleasure.

They who had their inheritance in Israel, had not an absolute and immediate
dominion, for it was Emanuels land, Esaias 8.8. God had the absolute dominion:
but theirs was conditionatum; for they might not sell their inheritance to whom
they pleased, neither might they alienate their lands perpetually; but only
morgage them to the year of the Iubilee, Lev. 25.13. So the Levites had not
merum dominium of the tithes, but conditionatum, Levit. 23.4. For none of their
children who were leprous might eat of them, neither might a stranger eat of
them, neither might they sell them to others. Caleb had the property of Hebron,
and yet it is said to be given to the Levites; it was Calebs by right of
propriety, but it was the Priests because they dwelt there, and had the use of
the ground.

So Adam before his fall, he was but (...), dei usufructuarius, the tenant of
God, but God was the immediate Lord, qui habebat directum dominium, et ad omnes
usus, he had the supreme dominion and absolute use over all the creatures,

Adam had not nudum usum of the creatures, usu-fructuarius. The Lawyers
illustrate the matter by this example; Du plexusum creaturarum, nudus usus, et
usufructuarius.
if thou get the use of ones garden thou may gather roses, herbs, flowers
to thy own use, but thou can not sell them to others to make benefit of
them. But if thou be usu-fructuarius, then thou may make benefit of them,
and sell the fruit to others.

Another example, If one leave in his latter Will to thee the use of his flock,
thou may use his flock for dunging of thy ground; but thou may neither
sheare the sheep, nor milk them; for that pertaines to them for whom it is
left: but if he leave the vsu-fructum, then thou may use both the milk and
the wool.

Man in his first estate had not only nudum usum, but usu-fructum, Duplex
potestas, utendiet fruendi. Distinguunturhaec, dare usum et dare in usum.
he had not only a bare use of them for maintenance, but he was Lord over
them. He had not only power uti ijs, sed frui ijs; not only to use them but
also to enjoy them: and they distinguish these two: aliud est dare alicui usum;
that is, it is one thing to give a man the use of a thing, and another thing to
give him it unto use: he who gives the use of a thing, gives not the dominion
over it: but he who gives it unto use gives also dominion.

A man may have nudum usum, et illicitum rei; as when a thief takes a man's
horse.

Secondly; a man may have nudum vsum, sed licitum, Vsus rei multiplex: 1. nudus
et illicitus, 2. alicitus etutilis, 3. licitus sed non utilis, 4, usus utilis
et propriet as subordinata, 5. dominium directum et altum.
et vtilem; as when a man hires a horse.

Thirdly, a man may have nudum vsum, et licitum, sed non vtilem; as when the
servant of a banker changes money for his Master, all the commodity is his
masters.

Fourthly, a man my have vsum licitum, utilem, et proprietatem, sed
subordinatam: as he who holds his lands in fealty.

Fifthly, he who has the propriety, and dominium directum: this is called
dominium altum, this supreme dominion, Adam had not this supreme dominion,
but subordinate to God, Christ is called the Lord of the Sabbath, Mat. 12.8.
and man is called, Lord of the Sabbath, Mark. 2.27.28. how is Christ called the
Lord of the Sabbath. As the supreme and high Lord. Man is called Lord of the
Sabbath, not as the supreme, but as the subordinate Lord.

The first Adam had all things subject to him, but by subordination: A
collation betwixt the innocent and second Adam.
but the second Adam had them, by a more excellent manner from God his Father,
eminenter, by way of excellency. Psalm. 2. I will give thee the ends of the earth
for a possession.

Secondly, the first Adam had jus ad rem, jus in re, he had not only the
right to the things, Duplex potestas, authoritativa, and subauthoritativa.

Duplex jus ad rem, and in re.

(...).

Duplex ius: in communi, and in proprio.


but also the use of them But the second Adam had jus ad rem sed non in re, for
the most part; that is, he had the right to them, but the use of few of them
for the most part.

Quest. Had Christ nothing in propriety to himself, had he but only the
naked use of things?

Answ. There are sundry sorts of rights. First, that which many have right to
in common, as the Levites in Israel had right in common to the tithes: but
Barnabas a Levite who dwelt in Cyprus, out of Judea had his possessions proper
to himself, Acts 4. So the Church of Jerusalem had their goods in common.

Secondly, there is, usus juris et usus facti: the use of propriety, and the
naked use of things: the naked use is, when a man has only the naked use,
Duplex usus, iuris, and facti.
that he may neither sell it, nor give it to others: the use of propriety is,
when he may both use it himself and give the use of it to others, When a man
hires a house, then he has only the bare use of it, because he cannot let
it out to another, but when he has a Lease of it, then he has usum juris, and
may then let it to another.

Thirdly, Duplex jus, charitatis, and proprietatis.
there is a right of charity and a right of property: a man coming into a
vineyard, he may eat as many of the grapes as he pleases to satisfy his
hunger, Deuteronomy. 23.24. this is the right of charity: but he may carry none away
with him; this is the right of property. So the Disciples when they were hungry
upon the Sabbath, pulled the ears of corn, Matthew. 12.2. This was the right of
charity, but they carried none away with them, because they had not the right
of property; and in this sense it is that Solomon, Prove. 3.27. calls the poor
bagnale tobh, the Lords of thy goods: withhold not thy goods from the owners
thereof, that is, from the poor; the poor in their necessity have the use of
thy goods. That axiom is true then, Ius charitatis manet semper, sed non pro
semper, habent enim jus utendi, non pro omni tempore sed tempore necessitatis;
that is, Charity remains always, but we are not at all times to give our
goods; there is a time to give them, not all times, but in the time of
necessity; and in this sense is that of Luke to be understood, Luke 6.30. Give
to every one that asks of you; that is, who in extreme necessity asks of you.

Christ had not jus in communi, with the Disciples, Of the right that Christ as
man had to the creatures.
in the bag, Ioh. 12. For these that have a common right, one of them cannot
give without the consent of the rest; but Christ had a proper right to the
bag, and commanded Judas to use it for the benefit of the poor, Ioh. 13.29.

Secondly, Christ had not a bare and a naked use of things, but also he had the
use of property in some things, as the clothes which he wore, and the money
which he spent; he had not only the naked use to wear them, but also the
property of them, for he might have given them to others: it is true, he had
but nudum usum of the house which he dwelt in, Luke 9.58. The Foxes have holes,
but the Son of man, has not a hole wherein to hide his head, for he had not
the property of any house.

Thirdly, he had not only jus charitatis to things, but also the right of
property; neither had he these things as alms, for that which a man labors
for is not called alms, sol us titulus recipiendi, ratione naturalis
necessitatis facit mendicum, the only title of receiving in respect of
natural necessity, makes a beggar: when it is sought and given in this manner,
then it is alms.

Now that the second Adam had not his maintenance given him, by way of alms,
it is proved thus; first he had the ends of the earth given him for a
possession, Psalm. 2. and all things were put under his feet, Psalm. 8. he sent
for the man's colt, Luke 19.30. Which shows that he had right over all the
creatures.

Again, it is proved thus, If we sow to you spiritual things, ought ye not
to give us temporal things? 1 Cor. 9.11. but Jesus Christ sowed spiritual
things to them, therefore temporal things were his by right of property.

Thirdly, it is said, Who feeds the flock and eats not of the milk of it? 1
Cor. 9.7. as the shepherd and soldier have the right of property to their
wages, so had Christ.

Fourthly, Christ says Luke 10. Go into whatsoever house ye come to, and
eat that which is set before you: the Disciples had not only jus
gratitudinis, Duplex jus gratitudinis, and juris.
the right of thankfulness; but also jus juris, the right of property: Christ
had this right seeing he preached the Gospel. When Paul took no stipend from
the Corinthians, 2 Cor. 11.8. recessit a jure suo, he went from his right:
therefore others had this right of property, and so had Christ.

Object. But Christ willed his Disciples to leave all for his cause, Mat.
10.37. and he set himself as an example before them of poverty: therefore he
did renounce all right of things.

Answ. Duplex abnegatio reru^, in affectu, and in effectu.
We renounce all things two ways either in our affection, or in deed: they
renounced all in affection but not in deed.

Secondly, there are two sorts of poverty; material poverty, and formal
poverty. Christ left all things both moveable and immovable in his affection,
formally: Duplex paupert as: materialis, and formalis.
but not materially: formal poverty is this, when in our affection we are
ready to renounce all for Christ; but material poverty is, when we are
actually called to the renouncing of all.

Object. Mark. 10.21. Christ commanded the young man, to sell all and follow
him, if he would be perfect: therefore it may seem that material poverty, is
required of him that would be most absolutely perfect, and that Christ made
choice of this sort of poverty himself.

Answ. We must distinguish betwixt these two; first, to leave all, and to
follow Christ: Secondly, that he who trusts in his riches should sell all,
Prior ut scholastict loquuntur, facta est ad rem, posterior ad hominem, non
simplex.


The first part of this speech belongs to the matter it self, and the second
to the person: the first is common to all, because all are bound to leave all
for Christ in affection; but the second part belongs only to this young man,
who was so well conceited of himself, trusting in his riches, that he should
sell all, and should give of that which he sold to the poor: not that he
should give all to the poor when he sold it, but give of that which he sold to
the poor; non dare omnia, sed de omnibus, 2 Cor. 8.9.

Quest. But why bids he him sell all?

Answ. Because he had such confidence in his riches, for they hindered him from
following of Christ; therefore he bids him quite all actually; which precept
binds not others, it being particular to him.

Object. But Christ says, if thou will be perfect, go and sell all, then
this seems to be the pitch of perfection to renounce all: and is more than
that which the law requires.

Answ. Christ speaks not here of any perfection, above the perfection of the
Law; but of true perfection which is above imaginary perfection: as if he
should say: thou imaginest thou art perfect, and think that thou have kept
the whole Law, if it be so, yet one thing is resting to thee, sell all: thus
we see how Christ applies himself to his conceit here.

Object. But it may be said that this young man spoke not out of an ambitious
conceit, for the text says that Christ loved him.

Answ. The event shows that he spoke but out of the ambition of his heart,
and the words of Christ show this also, Mark. 10.24. How hard a thing is it for
a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God: and where it is said Christ loved
him, verse. 21. The Greek word (...), signifies friendly to speak to him,
and to deal gently with him; but Christ liked him not in the estate that he
was in, for he went away trusting still in his riches, and loving them better
than Christ.

Christ and his Disciples renounced not all kind of right of those things which
they had; Mark is false. Some have money, and love it; some want money and
love it; but these are most perfect who neither have it, nor love it: and to
this they apply that of the Apostle, Gal. 6.14. I am crucified to the world and
the world to me; as though a man could not beecrucified to the world, unless
he renounce it all, and go a begging.

Thus the Church of Rome serves God with willworship, which he never required
at their hand, Esaias, 1.12. By their vows of poverty, chastity and obedience:
this they make one of their counsels, of Evangelicke perfection.

So much of Gods Image in man: both inwardly in his soul, and outwardly in his
dominion and superiority over all inferior creatures: it rests to speak of
three conse quents proper to this image. 1. Wherefore Gods image was placed in
man. 2. This image being placed in man whether it was natural unto him, or
supernatural. 3. The benefit he reapeth by this Image: which was his society
with the Angels.

CHAP. XVI. Of the end wherefore God placed this image in Man.
GOd placed this image in man,

Similitude and likeness are a great cause of love: Adam loved Evah when he
saw her first, because she was like unto him, As a man when he looks into a
glass, he loves his image because it is like to him but dissimilitude breeds
hatred. A man loves not a serpent or a Toade, because they are most unlike him,
David marvailes that God should look upon man, Psalm. 8. but in the end he
brings in his similitude in Christ, or else he would hate us.

Secondly, God placed this image in man, as a mark of his possession;
therefore the Fathers called him nummum Dei; for even as Princes set their
image upon their coin, so did the Lord set his image upon man; therefore
miserable are these, who adulterate this coin, and blot out this Image of God:
he deserves now to be arrained as a traitor before God.

Man in innocence was like unto God, A collation betwixt the innocent and old
Adam.
but now he is become like unto the beasts of the field, Psalm. 49. now God may
justly exprobrate unto him, Behold man is become like one of us, There was a
great change in Naomi when she came to Bethlehem; she was not then Naomi
beautiful, but Mara bitterness: there is a greater change now in man when he
is fallen from his first estate, and lost this holy image.

Man was made to the jmage of God, Genesis 9. no Prince will suffer his image to
be defaced, much less will God. There arose a sedition at Antioch for that
Theodosius the Emperor exacted a new kind of tribute upon the people;
Theodoret. lib. 5. cap, 21.
in that commotion the people brake down the Image of the Empress Placilla,
(who was lately dead.) The Emperor in a great rage sent his forces against the
City to sack it. When the Herald came, and told this to the Citizens, one
Macedonius a Monk endued with heavenly wisdom, sent unto the Herald an
answer after this manner;

Tell the Emperor these words, that he is not only an Emperor, but also a
man, therefore let him not only look upon his Empire, but also upon himself:
for he being a man commands also these who are men: let him not then use men so
barbarously, who are made to the image of God. He is angry and that justly,
that the brazen image of his wife was thus contumeliously used, and shall not
the King of heaven be angry, to see his glorious image in man contumeliously
handled; Oh what a difference is there betwixt the reasonable soul, and the
brazen image; We for this image are able to set up an hundred, but he is not
able to set up a hair of these men again if he kill them.

These words being told the Emperor, he suppressed his anger and drew back
his forces: if men would take this course, and ponder it deeply in their
heart, they would not be so ready to break down this image of God by their
bloody cruelty.

CHAP. XVII. Whether the Image of God in Adam was natural or supernatural?
THe second consequent of the image of God being placed in man, is, concerning
the nature of it.

There are two things which principally we and the Church of Rome controvert
about, touching the image of God. The first is, conditio naturae, Duplex
conditio imaginis Dei, naturae, and Iustitiae.
the condition of nature: the second is, condtio justitiae, concernig man's
righteousness.

The Church of Rome holds, that there was concupiscence in in the nature of
man, being created in his pure- naturalls, but it was not a sin (say they) or
a punishment of sin as it is now, but a defect following the condition of
nature; Bellarm. lib. 7. cap, 28.
and they say that it was not from God but besides his intention. And they go
about to clear the matter by this comparison: when a Smith makes a sword of
iron, he is not the cause of the rust in the iron, but rust follows as a
consequent in the iron: but if this rebellion flow from the condition of
nature, how can God be free from the cause of sin, who is the author of nature?

Their comparison then taken from the Smith and the iron is altogether
impertinent: Triplex dissimilitudo compparation is.
first, the smith made not the iron, as God made man, therefore he cannot be
said to be the cause of the rust of iron, as God making man, concupiscence
necessarily follows him according to their position.

Secondly, the rust does not necessarily follow the iron, neither is the iron
the cause of it, but some external things: they make concupiscence necessary
to follow the body.

Thirdly, the Smith if he could, he would make such a sword that should take no
rust; but God (according to their judgment) made man such that concupiscence
did necessarily follow.

Before the fall there was no reluctation nor strife betwixt the superior and
inferior faculties in man; That there was no concupiscence in man before the
fall.
and therefore no concupiscence: our reasons are these.

First, our first parents were not ashamed when they were naked, Gen 2. but
after that Adam had sinned and saw himself naked, he fled from the presence
of God and hid himself even for very shame; it is the rebellion betwixt the
superior and inferior faculties that makes men ashamed.

Secondly, in Jesus Christ the second Adam, there was no rebellion, and yet he
was like to us in all things sin excepted, taking our nature upon him, and
the essential properties of it. As to be tempted, Mat. 4.1. Jesus was carried
by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted; So to fear, Hebr. 5.7. he was
heard in that which he feared. So to be angry, Mark. 3.5. He looked round
about on them angerly: So forgetfulness of his office by reason of the agony
astonishing his senses; Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me,
Mat. 26.39. Wherefore if this strife, betwixt the superior and inferior
faculties, was the consequent of nature in our whole estate, then Christ should
not have been blameless, which is blasphemy: for concupiscence is sin, Rom,
7.7.

Thirdly, if there had been rebellion, betwixt the superior and inferior
faculties before the fall; then man in his whole estate had not been happy for
Paul in respect of this concupiscence, is forced to cry out, Romans 7.11. O
wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death? and
original justice had not been such an excellent gift in that estate, but only
a restraint, to restrain this concupiscence that it bursted not forth.

Fourthly, if this rebellion flow from nature, how can God be free from sin
who is the author of nature? qui est causa causae, est causa causati, in
essentialiter subordinatis, he who is the cause of a cause, is likewise the
cause of the effect in things essentially subordinate: but God is the author of
man's nature and concupiscence: therefore according to their position, Of man's
original justice, according to the Church of Rome.
he must be the author of sin: this is blasphemy.

The Church of Rome holds, that this holiness was a supernatural thing to
man, and not natural in his first creation: and they go about to show the
matter by these comparisons.

They say, man's righteousness in his innocent estate, was like a garland set
upon a virgins head; the garland is no part of the virgins body, and although
the garland be removed, yet she remains still a virgin. So this original
righteousness, they make it as it were a garland, which being taken away from
man, no natural thing is blemished in him.

Secondly, they compare it to Sampsons locks, which when they were cut off,
nothing was taken from Sampsons nature.

Thirdly, they compare it to a bridle in a horse mouth, which is no part of the
horse, nor natural to him, but serves to bridle the horse and keep him in. So
say they, this original righteousness, was no natural thing in man before
the fall, but served only as a bridle to restrain concupiscence; and they put
a difference betwixt a naked man and a robbed man. Duplex homo, nudus and
spoliatus.
Man before his fall (say they) he was naked, but God did cast his cloak of
supernatural righteousness about him to cover him: but since the fall (say
they) he is not homo nudus sed spoliatus, a naked man, but spoiled of the
graces of God.

Hence is that division made by the Jesuits of the estate of man: Perer. lib.
5. in Genesis disput. de excellent. page 118.
the first estate (says he) is of man considered without grace or sin, (as
they term it) in his pure naturals; the second estate is of man in his
purenaturals, clothed with supernatural righteousness: the third estate is of
man degenerate and sinful: the fourth estate, is of man regenerate; and the
last is of man glorified. But to consider a man both void of grace and sin,
such a man was never, nor never shall be; neither did the Jewish or Christian
Church, ever divide the estate of man thus.

The Jewish Church takes up the estate of man in these three; the first they
call Adam, ratioue creationis, because he was made out of the red earth: the
second they call Enosh, man subject to all miseries: the third they call Ish,
man restored to blessedness and happiness.

The orthodoxe christian Church, divides the estate of man thus: the first
estate, is gratiae collatio, the bestowing of grace: the second is, collatae
amissio the loss of that grace bestowed: the third is, instauratio amissae,
the restoring of lost grace; and the fourth is, confirmatio instauratae, the
confirmation of restored grace.

We will show that his original righteousness, Of man's original justice,
according to the reformed Church.
was natural to man, and not supernatural: where we must consider: that
nature is take five ways:

First, a thing is natural by creation, as the soul and the body are natural
to man, because they give a being to him.

Secondly, for that which flows essentially and naturally from a thing, as
the faculties from the soul.

Thirdly, for that which cleaves most surely to nature, as sin does to the
soul now.

Fourthly, for that which beautifieth nature and helps it, as grace does.

Fifthly, for that which by generation is propagate to the posterity, as
original corruption.

Original justice was not natural to man in the first sense, for it was no
part of his essence. It was not natural to him in the second sense, for it
flowed not from the understanding essentially, as the faculties of the soul
do; but it was natural to him in the third sense, because he was created in
holiness, and was the subject of holiness: it was natural to him in the
fourth sense, because it made his nature perfect: It was natural to him in the
fifth sense, for he should have transmitted it to his posterity by generation,
if he had stood in holiness, as man does sin now, which is come in place of
it.

Original righteousness to the first Adam was natural, to the renewed Adam,
grace is supernatural; A collation betwixt the innocent, renewed, and old Adam.
to the old Adam, it is against his nature, so long as he continues in sin.

Our reasons proving, that original righteousness, was natural to Adam, and
not supernatural, are these.

First, since the fall, such was the image of God in man before the fall: but
the remnants of the Image of God in man since the fall, are natural, Romans
2.13. For by nature they do the things contained in the Law, 2 Cor. 11. Does
not nature teach you this? therefore the image of God in man before the fall
was natural.

Secondly, supernatural gifts are not hereditary, nor propagate by generation,
no more than a colt (to use their own similitude) is brought forth with a
bridle in his teeth: but man before the fall, should have begotten children in
his image in original justice: therefore original justice was not
supernatural to him.

Thirdly, by nature we are now the children of wrath; Ephesians. 2.3. therefore
original justice should not have been supernatural to man, but natural by
the rule of contraries.

Bellarmine, De great. prim. hom. cap. 5.
although he grant that there might have been a man, created as well without
grace as sin; yet he is enforced to acknowledge, that this point of
erroneous doctrine, did never generally prevail in the Roman Church: for there
were some (says he) excellently learned, that thought as we do; that man
must either be in the estate of grace, or sin; and that there is not a middle
estate: and that original righteousness was required to the integrity of
nature, and consequently that being lost, nature was corrupted and deprived of
all natural and moral rectitude. So that man after the fall of Adam, can do
nothing morally good, or that truly can be named a virtue, till he be renewed
by grace; as likewise Adam before his fall was not able to do any thing
morally good by natures power, without the assistance of special grace from
God.

But we must hold for our part, this to be the ground of no small error which
the Church of Rome lays; that man in his pure naturals, was void both of
grace and sin; this is the ground of many other errors which they maintain.

First, that concupiscence is natural to man, following always his creation.

Secondly, that natural gifts both in men and devils remain unblemished since
the fall.

Thirdly, that the corruption of nature consists not in any corrupt quality,
but only in the loss of supernatural grace.

Fourthly, that death is not an effect of sin properly, but it is from
nature, and it is only accidentally from sin; because sin removes that bridle
of original righteousness, which held back death.

Fifthly, that concupiscence is not sin in the regenerate.

Sixthly, that man now after his fall, is in the same estate wherein he was
before the fall in his pure naturals: for Adams sin has diminished nothing
from that which is natural: and the body, (they say) since the fall is no more
passible, than it was before in the pure naturals. So (they say) the mind of
man being considered by it self, without this supernatuall holiness, is no
more weakened by the fall, than it was before the fall in things natural.

Seventhly, that man has free will left in him after his fall: which grounds
are all false. Here we must do as Elisha did when he cured the waters of
Jericho, 2 King. 3. he went to the spring heads, and there cast in salt: so
must we go to this, as one of the springs from whence many errors in popery
proceed, and cure it first.

This popish platform of man's estate before his fall, is taken from the
schools of Philosophy, but not from Moses and the Prophets. The Philosophers
were ignorant of the nature of man in his whole estate, so were they ignorant
of his fall; and therefore they took up man in a middle estate. So these
Sophists following the Philosophers, and not the Scriptures, as though they had
never heard of man's creation, nor yet of his fall; imagine him to be a middle
sort of man, such a man as never was, neither in his whole estate, nor after
his fall: but they ought to have remembered that of the Apostle, Colos. 2.8.
Take heed lest any spoil you by Philosophy.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the consequents of Gods image in man; in his society with the
Angels.
THe third consequent that follows upon the image of God being placed in man
in his creation, is concerning the society and fellowship that he had with the
Angels so long as he stood in innocence.

Adam in his first estate was little inferior to the Angels.

It shall be the greatest perfection of man in glory,

The Angels did neither minister unto, A collation betwixt the innocent,
second, renewed, and old Adam.
nor keep the first Adam before his fall, they only loved him. The Angels
ministered to Christ the second Adam, and loved him, but did not keep him. The
Angels minister now to the renewed Adam, they love him and keep him; but they
neither minister to the wicked, love them, nor keep them.

First, the Angels neither did minister to Adam before his fall, nor did they
keep him, because he was in no danger, only they loved him: they ministered
to Jesus Christ, but they did not keep him, for he was comprehensor, as well as
viator. Christ is the head of the Angels, therefore he is not kept by them:
but they minister to the elect, and keep them by Christ; which privilege Adam
had not of them before his fall.

Object. It may seem that they did keep Christ, Psalm. 91. they shall keep
thee in all thy ways.

Answ. This is to be understood de Christo mystico, of Christ in his members;
that is, they shall keep thy members in all their ways. But this part of the
Psalm was misapplyed by the Devil to Christ in proper person, Matthew. 4. for
the Angels keep not Christ, but minister to him: but they both keep and
minister to his members the elect.

Object. But it may be said, that the elect have greater privileges then, than
Christ has, seeing they both keep them, and minister to them.

Answ. This argues not any prerogative that the Saints have above Christ, but
only their weakness and wants, that they have need of the Angels to preserve
them, as young children stand in need of nurses to wait upon them.

Object. It may seem that Angels are not ministering spirits in respect of the
elect, but in respect of Christ; because the Angel, Revel. 19.22. calls
himself, not our servant, but, our fellow servant. So the Angels are not
called the servants of the kingdoms, but, The Princes of the Kingdoms, Dan.
12. Thirdly, the Apostle proves Christ to be God, Heb. 2. because the Angels
are servants to him. A shepherd is not the servant of his sheep, although he
keeps them; but his Masters servant. So although the Angels keep us, yet they
seem not to be our ministers but Christ's.

Answ. The Scripture, Heb. 1. calls them ministering spirits, sent for them that
are elect; and although they be more excellent creatures in themselves, than
the elect; yet in Christ, and by Christ, they become ministering spirits to us.
Christ himself is not ashamed to call himself a servant to the elect, Mat.
20. I came not to be served, but to serve: why may not then the Angels be
said, to be ministers to the elect?

Object. It is a Maxim in Philosophy, that the end is more excellent than the
means tending to the end: but the safety of man is the end: and the Angels are
the means, therefore it may seem that man is more excellent than the Angels.

Answ. The end considered as the end, is always more excellent than the means
tending to the end, but not absolutely, touching the essence of the means; for
these things that are the means may be more excellent in themselves. Example:
The incarnation of Christ is more excellent than the redemption of man in it
self, and yet it is institute for another end; so the Sun, Moon, and stars
were institute to give influence to the inferior bodies, herbs, trees and
plants, and yet they are more excellent in themselves; but consider them as
means tending to that end, they are inferior to them.

The Angels neither love the wicked, nor minister to them, nor preserve them.
But here we must mark, when we say they minister not to them, this is to be
understood of their special and particular ministering, they attend them not,
as they do the elect; it is true, as God makes his Sun to shine as well upon
the unjust as the just, Mat. 5.45. so the Angels may be ministers sometimes of
outward things even to the wicked. Whosoever stepped down first into the poole
of Siloam, Ioh. 5.8. was cured whether good or bad: and the Angels brought
down Manna in the wilderness, Psalm. 78.25. to the bad Israelites, as well as
to the good: but they have not a particular care of the wicked as they have of
the elect of God; they come not up and down upon the Ladder, Christ, Ioh.
1.52. to minister to them as they do to the elect.

CHAP. XIX. Of Adams life before the fall, whether it was contemplative, or
practicke?
Adam had beside the Image of God placed in him, two royal prerogatives above
any man that ever was: the first was concerning his estate and condition of
life, whether it was in action, or contemplation. The second concerning his
marriage celebrated by God himself, in Paradise. Of the first prerogative is
entreated here.

Man's life before the fall, was more contemplative than practicke.

As from the Sun, first proceed bright beams, Adam to cognosce and
contemplate upon things; this contemplation, brought forth prudency, and at
last arts, as the shadow of prudency. This wisdom or contemplation was in
cognoscibilibus, in things to be known; but prudency was in agibilibus, in
things to be done; arts are in factibilibus, in things to be done by the hands.

Quest. Vita activa est prior in via generation is, sed vita contemplativa est
prior in via directionis.
It may be asked which of these two lives is to be preferred before another:
it might seem that prudeney is to be preferred before wisdom; for man is
bound to love God above all, and to help his neighbor; these we get not by
contemplation but by action. Again, it may seem that the contemplative life
is the best life, because in the active life there are many dangers and perils,
but not so in the contemplative.

Answ. To clear this point, we must mark these assertions following.

First, when we compare these two wisdom and prudency together, Duplex
bonitas; necessitatis, and excellentiae.
either we respect the necessity of them, or the excellency of them. If we
respect the necessity of them; then no doubt, prudency is most fit for
ourestate now.

If we mark the excellency of them, then we must use this distinction; one
thing is said to be better than another, either absolutely, or determinate to
this or that particular: as, to have four feet is good for a horse, but not
absolutely good, Duplex bonitas; absoluta and determinata.
for it is not good for a man. So to be a Philosopher is determinately good for
man, but not absolutely good; for it is not good for a horse. So wisdom and
prudency conferred together, wisdom absolutely is better than prudency; but
prudency in this case as we are now, is better for us.

Thirdly, Duplex cousideratio vitae humanae, respectu mediorum, and fin is.
if we consider the end of man's life; then contemplation is better than
action; but if we consider the means tending to the end, then action is
fitter for us, than contemplation. If we consider the end, it is more
excellent than the means; for all these practical arts and operations which
man does, are ordained (as to their properend,) to the contemplation of the
understanding: and all the contemplation of the understanding is ordained for
the metaphysickes: and all the knowledge which we have of the metaphysics: (in
so far as it precedes the knowledge which we have of God:) is ordained for
the knowledge of God, as the last end; Ioh. 17. This is life eternal to know
thee only, Matthew. 5. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God:
therefore the contemplative life, being the last end, must be most perfect in
it self; for it stands in need of fewer helps than the practicke life does.

These two sorts of lives, are so necessary both for this life, and for the
life to come, and are so straightly lincked, that we must labor to join them
together.

The active life, without the contemplative life, contemplative life, without
the active, is a most imperfect life; but join them both together, they make a
perfect Argus, having his eyes looking up and down.

These two sorts of lives are well compared to the two great lights in heaven,
the Sun and Moon: first, as the Moon has her light from the Sun, so has
prudency her light from wisdom. Secondly, as the Sun rules the day, and the
Moon the night; so wisdom rules our heavenly life; and prudency our earthly
life. Thirdly, as the moon is nearer to us than the Sun; so is prudency in
this estate nearer to us than wisdom.

Prudency and wisdom, active and contemplative life, should be joined
together: therefore these onagri, or wild asses, the Hermites; who give
themselves only to contemplation and withdraw themselves from the society of
men, never joining action to their contemplation; mistake altogether the end
wherefore man was placed here.

When Elias was in the wilderness, the Angel came to him and said; what do
thou here? So the Lord will say one day to these unprofitable members (that are
in the Church and Commonwealth) what do ye in the Wilderness; The Philosopher
could say, that he was either a God or a beast that could live in the
Wilderness; this their contemplative life has pride for the father, and
idleness for the mother.

The contemplative life, is the most excellent life, therefore that life that
draws nearest to it, must be the best. There are three sorts of life's, Triplex
vita, activa, effectiva, and voluptuaria.
the active life, the effective life, and the voluptuary. The active life
consists in managing and ruling things by prudency; this was David's life, and
it comes nearest to the contemplative life. The effective life consists in
dressing of the ground, in husbandry, and such; this was Vzziahs life:
therefore, 2 King. 15. He is called vir agri, because he delighted in tillage;
and this is further removed from the contemplative life, than the active life.
The voluptuary life was that in Solomon, when he gave himself to pleasure and
delights, so the life of Sardanapalus King of Assyria; and this is furthest
from the contemplative life. Adam had the contemplative life chiefly, he had
the Active and effective life; but he had not that voluptuary or sinful life,
delighting in pleasure.

The first Adam his life was contemplative, A collation betwixt the innocent,
old, and glorified Adam.
active, and effective. The old Adam his life is voluptuary, for the end of all
his actions is pleasure. The glorified Adam, his life is contemplative and
active only, Actiones internae quarum finis contemplaetio, manebunt in vita
futura, ut dilectio, amor: at actioues exttrnae quarum finis est actio, non
manebunt, quales sunt vir tutes morales quae diriguntur ad finem, (scilicet
contemplatiorem) at non versantur circa finem, quia hoo proprium est
contemplarionis.
and in this consists his last happiness.

In the life to come, the glorified Adam shall have all sorts of perfection in
him. First, his desire shall be perfected in his being (every thing naturally
desires the being and preservation of it self) for he shall be perpetually.
Secondly, his desire shall be fulfilled in these things that are common to him
and other living creatures, which is delight; his delights and pleasure shall
be spiritual altogether, and these far exceed corporal delights; because
men are contented to suffer many corporal torments for spiritual delights.
Thirdly, his desire shall be fulfilled in his reasonable desires; Quadruplex
defiderium; commune, animale, rationale, and intellectuale.
which is, to rule his active and civil life; In his active life, so to live
virtuously, that he cannot make defection to evil: in this civil life, for
all that a man desires in this life is honor, a good name and riches; the
desires of all these shall be perfected in the life to come; for honor, we
shall reign with him, Revel. 20. For a good name, none shall have place to
accuse or revile them there; for riches, Psalm. 111. Riches and glory are in his
house. Fourthly, his desire shall be fulfilled in his intellectual knowledge,
because then he shall attain to the full perfection of these things; that he
desires to know; and this shall be the perfection of his contemplative life;
in beholding God, which is the complement of all his other desires, and they
all aim at this.

Object. But it may be said that man's desire shall not be fulfilled in the life
to come by beholding God: for the souls in glory long for their bodies again,
and have not their full rest till they enjoy them.

Answ. Duplex desiderium; ex part appetibilis, and ex part appetentis.
The souls in glory desire no greater measure of joy, than to behold God, who
is the end and object of their blessed nesse. But they desire a greater
perfection in respect of themselves; because they do not so totally and fully
enjoy that which they desire to possess. A man sitting at a table furnished
with variety of dishes, he desires no more dishes than are at the table, yet
he desires to have a better stomach: so the souls in glory desire no greater
measure of blessedness than to behold God; but respecting the longing they
have for their bodies, they are not come to the fullness of their blessedness
till they be joined together again.

Quest. Whether shall the soul after the resurrection, being joined with the
body again, enjoy greater happiness, than it had without the body in heaven?

Answ. In respect of the object which is God, it shall have no greater
happiness; but in respect of it self, it shall have greater joy, both
extensive, because it shall rejoice in the glory of the body, Duplex gaudium;
extensivum, and intensivum. Picalhom. lib. 10. Etbic. Sexcordiriones vitae
bumanae, metaphora sumpta a carcere, a monstro, a mundo, a navi, a curru, and
ab^ave.
and intensive, because in the conjunction with the body, the operation
therefore shall be more forcible, when soul and body are joined together.

The Academickes make fix conditions of the life of man whereunto it is
resembled, which they set out to us by six metaphors. The first is in the
conjunction of the soul and the body; and herein they take the comparison from
a man in a Prison, and in this estate man had need of spurs to stir him up,
that he may come out of prison.

The second Condition of man's life is in consisting of contrary faculties; and
in this estate they compare him to a Monster, half man and half beast, the
sensual part fighting against the reasonable; here we must take heed ne pars
fera voret humanam, lest the brutish part overcome the reasonable.

The third condition makes him an absolute man, and then he is called the
little world, or epilogus mundi, the compend of the world; and so he should
labor to keep all things in a just frame.

The fourth condition, as he is aiming toward his end, and so he is compared
to a ship in the midst of the Sea, sailing toward the haven; reason is the
ship; the winds, waves, and rocks, are the many hazards we are exposed to in
this life; the oars are his affections and desires; and when the eye is set
upon eternal happiness, this is like the pole which directs the ship.

The fifth condition is then, when as the soul is purified by virtue, and
elevated above the own nature, then it is compared to a chariot, which
resembles the whole constitution of the soul joined to the body; the Coachman
is reason; the horses which draw the coach are two, one white and another
black; the white horse is the irascible appetite, the black is the
concupiscible appetite; the spurs which spur these horses forward, are,
desire of honor, and fear of shame.

The sixth condition is, when the soul by contemplation ascends to God, then it
is compared to a foul mounting upward, then it is no longer considered as
yoaked in the coach, for now the horses are loosed, and auriga sistens eos ad
praesepe, tribuit eis nectar and ambrosiam; that is, the coachman loosing the
horses, brings them to the manger, and gives them nectar and ambrosia to eat
and drink; for when the soul is taken up with this contemplation, beholding
the chief Good, then the appetite is satisfied with milk and honey as the
Scripture calls it. As nurses taking pleasure and delight to feed their babes,
when they have stilled them, they lay them up to sleep, and then they take
delight to feed themselves: so, when the sensible faculty shall be satisfied,
then shall our great delight be in contemplation to behold the face of God and
that eternal glory: whereupon is resolved that position laid down in the
beginning, that man's chief felicity in his life before the fall, was chiefly
in contemplation, and so shall it be in glory: although action in love do flow
from it, as the fruit from the tree.

CHAP. XX. Of Adams conjunct life, or his marriage.
THe second royal prerogative bestowed upon Adam in Paradise, was, that he had
his marriage immediately celebrated by God.

God made the woman of the man. He made not paires of males and females in
mankind, as he did of the rest of living creatures; but he made the one of
the other, first to show them the near conjunction which is betwixt them;
secondly, he made the woman of the man, that he might be her heed, and the
fountain of all mankind, which chiefly belonged to his dignity: thirdly, she
was made of him, that she might obey and honor him; Christ says, Mark. 2.27.
the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath; therefore as man was
made Lord over the Sabbath, so he was made Lord over the woman.

This subjection of the woman to the man, was showed by the veil which was put
upon the woman's head when she was married, Genesis 24.65. In the fifth of Numbers
when the husband accused the wife of adultery she was commanded to stand
bareheaded before the Priest, as not being now under her husbands subjection,
until she was cleared of this blot.

Secondly, this subjection is notably set out in that heavenly order, 1 Cor.
11.3. God is Christ's head, and Christ is the man's head, and the man is the
woman's head.

Thirdly, this subjection is likewise showed by that dream of Joseph, Genesis 37.
Where the father is compared to the Sun, the wife to the Moon, and the
children to the stars.

Fourthly, the Persians had this sovereignty over their wives, they had a
proverbiall kind of speech which was, and they shall speak the language of
their own people; that is, they shall live after the manner of their own
country, and have commandment over their wives, Esth. 1.20. vejit tenu jecar,
they put her in the masculine gender, to signify their ready obedience; for
when the Hebrews will commend a thing in women as well done, they put them in
the masculine gender: and again, when they will discommend men, they put them
in the feminine gender; because now they have committed abomination with idols.

Since the fall, A collation betwixt the innocent, and old Adam.
this heavenly order is mightily inverted, when the woman claymes sovereignty
over the man, and will not be subject to him: as she seeks superiority over
her husband; so if she could, she would pull Christ out of his place, and God
the Father out of his.

This inverting of natures order, has ever a curse joined with it, when such
effect superiority. Plutarch has a very good apologue for this: the members of
the body of the Serpent (says he) fell at variance among themselves; the
tail complained that the head had always the government, and desired that it
might rule the body; the simple head was content, but what became of it when
the tail took the guiding of the head and the rest of the body? it pulled the
head and the body, through the brambles and briars, and had almost spoiled the
whole body. So let us remember that apologue of the bramble, Judge. 9. When it
got the ruling of the trees of the field, what became of them, a fire came out
from it and burnt them.

In some case the Lord has granted as great power to the woman over the man,
as he has granted to the man over the woman, as in the mutual use of their
bodies: and in this case he is as well subject to his wife, as he is her Lord:
but in other things the man has thesuperioritie over the woman.

Quest. Seeing the woman has as great right over the body of the man, as the
man has over her body, how is it that Rachel with her mandrakes persuaded her
husband to lie with her? Genesis 30.15. It might seem she had not such a right
to claim this of her husband?

Answ. In this polygamie, there was some cause of exception, because a man had
two wives at once, and that of Christ may be fitly applied here, One man cannot
serve two masters, Mat. 6.24.

God made the woman of the rib of Adam.

She was not made of the eye as the Hebrews say, Dinah, 34.1. Neither was she
made of the ear, that she should not be auscultatrix a hearkener like Sarah,
Genesis 18.10.14. he made her not of the foot, that she should not be trodden upon
like the Serpent: But he made her of the rib, that she might be his
collateral, to eat of his morsels, drink of his cup, and sleep in his
bosom, 2 Samuel, 12.3.

Quest. When God took this rib out of Adams side, whether had Adam a rib more
than enough; or when it was taken out whether wanted he a rib? To say that he
wanted a rib, would imply an imperfection; to say that he had a rib more than
enough, would imply superfluity in Adam; which in the estate of innocence
cannot be granted. Nonut individuum sed ut species.


Answ. Adam must not be considered as other men, but as he who represented
whole mankind; and therefore he having a rib more then other men have, who are
but singular men, yet he had not a rib more than enough. The seed which is in
the body of man, is no superfluity in man, because it serves for the
continuation of his kind; So this rib was no superfluous thing in Adam,
although he had a rib more than the rest of mankind. We count it now a
superfluous thing, when a man has more fingers than ten, so to have more ribs
than twenty-foure.

Again, if we say it was one of his ordinary ribs, it will not follow, that
there was any defect, when this rib was taken out: for we may safely hold,
that God put in a new rib in place of it: for when Moses says, that God shut
up the flesh in place of it, it will not follow that he closed it up only with
flesh, but also with a rib, as Adam himself afterward showed, Genesis 2, 23. she
is flesh of my flesh, and bone of my bones.

Quest. But how could so little a matter as a bone, become the whole body of a
woman, was this the extending or rarifying of the bone, as we see ye rarefied
into water: or was it by adding new matter to the bone?

Thomas answers, Secunda secundae an. 3.
that this could not be by rarification of the bone, for then the body of Evah
should not have been solid enough, but it was as he holds, by addition of new
matter. As the five loaves which fed so many thousands in the wilderness. Mat.
14.17. was not by rarifying and extending them, but only by adding to them.

Quest. Whethere was the matter which was added to the rib, first turned into a
rib, and then made a woman, or was she immediately made a woman of this rib,
and the matter added to the rib?

Answ. It seems more probable, that the woman's body was made of this matter
and the rib, without any new conversion of this matter into a rib; neither need
we to grant two conversions or changes. Therefore the schoolmen say well, non
sunt multiplicanda miracula: it is not probable, that all this matter was
changed into a rib, and then it grew up into a body.

Quest. Why is she then rather said to be made of the rib, then of the matter
added to the rib?

Answ. Because principally and chiefly, God chose that rib, to make the woman
of it, and then he added the rest of the matter: although there was much more
added to the five loaves (which fed the people in the wilderness) than the
substance of the five loaves; yet they are said to be filled with the five
loaves, because God took them first and chiefly for this miracle, by adding
the rest of the substance miraculously for feeding of the people.

But we must mark here a difference, betwixt that which was added to the five
loaves, and this which was added to the rib of the man; for in that which was
miraculously added to the loaves, there was not a third thing made up of them:
but of this rib and the matter added to it,

God made them two, one flesh.

First, Adam is created one; secondly, two are made out of one; Adam prlmo
factus est unus, deinde duo; tertio vnus, quarto duo.
thirdly, two are made one again, by consent and conjunction: these three are
the works of God: but when they are dissolved again and made two by adultery,
this is the work of the devil.

There are three things betwixt the man and the wife; Trialigamenta inter
maritum and vxorem, unio, communio, and communicatio.
vnien: secondly, communion: thirdly, communicating.

By union they are made one flesh.

By communion, the man is not his own, but his wives, the wife is not her
own, but her husbands.

Communicating, is of their goods: Plato willed that in his commonwealth, meum
et tuum, should not be heard betwixt the man and the wife: but all should be
called the husbands: for as wine mixed with water, although there be much
water, and little wine, yet it is called wine: So although the wife bring much
substance to the house, and the husband but little; Meum et tuum, meam mihi,
tuum tibi, meotuum, tuo-meum.
yet all should be called the husbands. So that which is the husbands, must not
be reserved for himself alone, but make it meo-tuum, common with the wife.
The wife participates of his substance, she is bone of his bone and flesh of
his flesh: so his name, he is ish and she is isha. So among the Romans, it was
a proverb, When thou art called Cajus, I shall be called Caia: therefore she
should be partaker of his goods.

Quest. How is the man and the wife one?

Answ. They are not one, hypostatically: as Christ God and man: they are not
one, mystically: as Christ and his Church are one: they are not one,
physically; as the four Elements make up the body: Vnitas vel bypostatica,
physica, artificialis, seu naturalis, et divina.
they are not one artificially, as the stones and Timber make up a house: but
this unity or conjunction is partly natural, partly moral, and partly divine:
the natural part is, that they two are made one flesh: the moral part is,
that they should be alike in manners and condition; and the divine part is the
conformity in religion.

Quest. How is it that the Apostle applies these words, (1 Corinthians. 6.16. And
they two shall be one flesh,) to the Whore and the Harlot, which is spoken of
marriage here?

Answ. There are two things in marriage, Duae sunt parts matrimonij:
materialis, and formalis.
the material part, and the formal: the material part is the conjunction of
the bodies, the formal part is the conjunction of the hearts, and the blessing
of God upon them. The Whore and the Harlot are one flesh, materially, but not
formally, and thus is the Apostle to be understood.

And they two shall be one flesh, Mat. 19.

This takes away digamie: That digamie is unlawful.
There are two sorts of digamy, direct and indirect. He is called digamus
properly, who has two wives at one time, for this is direct digamie. Indirect
digamy again, is, when one wife being put away unjustly, Duplex digamia,
directa, and indirecta.
he marries another, and of this sort of digamie, the Apostle speaks, 1
Timothy 5.9. She must be the wife of one husband: by the Law of God, she might
not divorce from her first husband; but it was permitted amongst the Jews, and
commanded amongst the Gentiles. She was but the wife of the second husband jure
humano, Duplex jus; divinum, and humanum.
by humane law: but she was the wife of the first husband still, jure divino,
by the Law of God, and she might not marry another so long as he lived: if
she cast him off, and married another then she was the wife of two husbands.

The Church of Rome makes them Digamos, What the Church of Rome holds
concerning Digamy.
who marry one wife after another, although the first be dead or lawfully
repudiate; and such they debar to be Priests quia imperfecte repraesentant
personam Christi, because they represent Christ's person imperfectly; for they
say, Christ in virginity, married his Church a Virgin: therefore a Priest
being once married, and marrying again the second time, marries not in
virginity, neither can he a type of Christ, and his Church. They hold moreover,
that a man once being married, if his Wife dye, him they seclude not from the
Priesthood: but if a man marry a woman that has been married before, him they
seclude from the Priesthood. So if he have married a divorced woman him they
count digamos.

But all these grounds they have drawn from the ceremonial Law: for the high
Priest under the Law, might not marry a widow, a whore; nor a divorced woman:
he might not marry a widow, because he got not her first love: he might not
marry a divorced woman, because he got not her just love, Levit 21.7.14. He
might not marry a whore, because he got not her only love. So Christ will
have of his Church, her first love, her just love, and only love: That which
was typical to the high Priest under the Law, is it lawful for them to make a
rule of it under the Gospel?

So from the ceremonial Law they have ordained, that none who has any blemish
in his body may be a Priest; such they make irregular, and not capable of the
Priesthood.

So they make defectus natalitium an irregularity, that no bastard can be a
Priest, all borrowed from the ceremonial law.

And they two shall be one flesh, Mat. 19.

This condemns polygamy as well as digamy, a (...) dividere virum, because
when he is married to more, he is divided among them. Hence the Greek word
(...), and the Latin pellex which we call a concubine, or half wife.

To prove that Polygamie is unlawful, we will confirm it by two places of
Scripture: That Polygamy is unlawful.
the first is out of Levit. 18.18. Ye shall not take a woman to her sister:
that is, ye shall not take more at once. That this verse is meant of monogamie
is proved by analogy with the 16. verse, where it is said, thou shall not
uncover the nakedness of thy sister in Law. Again, the text would be too
far strained if it were other wise interpreted, for the Scripture calls
second wives in polygamie, vexers or enviers as here: and the Greek (...), as
Penninah is called the adversary of Anna, the other wife of Elkanah, 1 Samuel
1.6. So Adah and Zillah, the wives of Lamech. Genesis 4.23. Thirdly, because
digamie and polygamy should no ways be discharged in all the Scriptures if not
here except to the King, Deuteronomy. 17.16. which were contrary to the Scriptures:
and this Christ makes manifest, Mat. 19.5. and Paul, 1 Cor. 6.16.

The Karram among the Jews, called by the Greeks (...) (these followed the
literal sense of the Scriptures, and therefore were called Domini versuum:)
they followed this interpretation. But the Pharisees (in Christ's time)
interpreted the words thus, Ye shall not take a wife and her sister, so long
as she lives: but after she is dead ye may marry her sister, for (say they)
as two brethren may marry one wife, Deuteronomie 25.5. so may one man marry two
sisters, one successively after another.

But this was only a pharisaicall gloss contrary to the command of God: for
when the Lord commanded one brother to raise up seed to another, that was only
to his eldest brother, and therefore that place of Deuteronomy, If brethren
dwell together, and one of them want seed: (...) Vnus is to be understood,
Primus or primogenitus, for none of the brethren had this privilege but the
eldest brother, he was a type of Christ, that was the first borne among many
brethren, Romans 8.29. If seed had been raised up to any of the rest of the
brethren, it had bin incest, Lev. 18.

The second place to prove that polygamy is unlawful, is out of Deuteronomie
17.17. The King shall not multiply wives.

The Pharisees who gave way to the sins of the people, interpreted the Law
thus: The King shall not multiply wives; that is, he shall not have too many
wives; for they say David had eight wives, and yet this was no polygamy in him;
they add further, that it was lawful for the King to have eighteen wives, as
witnesses R. Solomon and Lyra. But they say Solomon trangressed this
commandment, in multyplying wives.

In this same place of Deuteronomie, it is said: the King shall not multiply
gold and silver. Now say they, as the King might exceed other men in riches:
why then was it simply discharged him to have many wives?

To this we answer, that when the Lord makes his covenant, it binds him
equally, Who sits upon the Throne, and him who draws the water, or hewes the
wood, Deuteronomy 29.11. The King has greater privileges, in honors and
dignities then other men have: but he has not greater power to sin, for he
is forbidden to multiply gold and silver: and that is, to seek for more than
may serve for his dignity and place: but he might never multiply wives more
then others: for the Law stands immovable, Genesis 2, And they two shall be one
flesh.

Object. But the Lord said to David, I have given thy masters wives into thy
bosom, 2 Samuel 12.8. Therefore a man might marry more wives.

Answ. God gives things two manner of ways. Sometimes he gives them by a
genrall dispensation and gift: and by this gift a man has not a right to the
thing, unless he get it confirmed by another right: and the things which God
permits in this sense, Dona a Deo dupliciter dantur. 1. generaliter, and
permissive. 2. exbene placito.
may be said to be. his gifts. As he gave Nebuchadnezzar power over the
Nations: but by this gift Nebuchadnezzar had no right, for God only permitted
him to tyrannize over them. But when God confirms this first gift to a man:
then he gives it ex been placito according to his good pleasure, as he gave Eva
to Adam, at the beginning.

God gave Saul's wives to David by the first gift, only by permission: but he
had never this gift confirmed, therefore no polygamie is lawful.

Quest. But what shall we think of this polygamie of the fathers?

Answ. Adulterium proprie et large sumptum.
We cannot hold it to be adultery, taking adultery properly: for if it had
been adultery in the proper signification: God who reproved David for his
adultery so often, would not have suffered this sin unreproved: but our Divines
make it a sin less than adultery, and more than fornication.

Yet taking adultery largely, it may be called adultery, Hosea. 9.16. They
shall commit adultery and shall, not increase: this seems to be spoken of the
polygamists, and not of the adulterers: for it were no punishment for. the
adulterer to want children: but the Polygamists did choose many wives of set
purpose, that they might multiply children. So that polygamy in the largest
sense, may be called adultery. Incest is sometimes called fornication, 1 Corinthians. 5. The less sin is there put for the greater sin: so when
polygamie is called adultery in the Scriptures, the more sin is put for the
less, yet it is not properly adultery, because God permitted it for the time,
that his Church might increase.

Quest. But how came it that the Prophets did not reprove this sin?

Answ. There is in a Country a fourfold sin: the first is called vitium
personae, Quadruplex vitium; personae, gentis; vocationis, and saeculi.
the sin of the person, that they reprooved, which was the sin of a
particular man.

Secondly, vitium gentis, the sin of a whole nation that sin they reprooved:
as the Prophets reproved the Jews for their stiffeneckednesse and hypocrisy.

Thirdly, there is vitium vocationis, the sin of a man's calling, as Rahab is
called a Taverner by Ios. 2.1. But James calls her a Harlot, James 2.25. This
sin they reproved.

Fourthly, there is vitium saeculi, when the sin overspreds all, and is
universally received as polygamy among the Jews: and this ye shall find the
prophets seldom to have reproved.

Quest. Whether had the Jews any dispensation of God in this their polygamie?

Answ. Some hold that God gave them a dispensation: and to prove this, first
they say that some Laws are stable, as the ordinances of the Church, Lex
sancta, vel est slabilis, immobilis, velincommutobilis,
which every man may not alter. Secondly, some laws are immovable, as the
Laws given by God himself in his second Table, cannot be dispensed with, but
by God himself who gave them. Thirdly, some Laws are incommutable, which
cannot be changed by God himself, without a stain of his holiness.

They say, that these laws of the second table which God had made, flow not
necessarily from him, as his justice and holiness do, but freely: for these
he wills, or not wills, without any stain of his holiness. As for example:
God is to be loved, therefore a man may not marry his brothers wife, this does
not follow necessarily in the strictest signification: but the precepts of the
first table cannot be dispensed with by God, without a stain of his
holiness. As for example God is to be beloved, therefore, he cannot dispense
that one should hate him: sine intrinseca repugnantia.

They say, that God dispensed with the fathers in polygamy, because God is
above the Law, which is given betwixt creature and creature, which in that
respect is immovable, although God himself may change it. But he is not
above the eternal law: because he is not above himself; therefore he cannot
dispense with that law which is repugnant to his eternity and glory; and these
are the precepts of the first table. But seeing polygamy is in the second
table, God might dispense with it, without any stain of his holiness.

Again, when it is demanded of these men, what scripture they can bring for
this dispensation: They answer that God himself says to Abraham, Genesis 21.
Hearken unto Sarah, in whatsoever she says to thee: by this admonition,
Abraham was moved to cast out Hagar and her son: although this might have
seemed contrary to the law of nature, therefore the Text says, this seemed
hard to Abraham. So when God says to Abraham, Hearken unto Sarah, in
whatsoever she says to thee: and Sarah bade him take his own hand-maide,
Genesis 16.1. then Sarah was Gods mouth to him in that point also.

Answ. These words, Hearken unto Sarah in all that she says; are not to be
understood in whatsoever she says; but in all that she says concerning
Hagar and her son, in that he was to hearken to her. Again, Abraham took
Hagar before he got this direction for to hearken to Sarah: so that this place
can be no warrant for a dispensation to the Patriarchs in their polygamy. it
was only a permission which God yielded unto for the time, as he granted them
a bill of divorce for the hardness of their hearts! but God cannot dispense
with any of his laws, neither in the first nor second Tables, they are so
near joined together, that those which break the one, do break the other
also.

Quest. Why did not God punish this sin in the fathers?

Answ. God does three things concerning sin. First he pardons sin: secondly,
he punishes sin, thirdly, he passes by sin, Triafacit Deus peccatoribus,
remittit peccatum, punit peccatum, and praeterit peccatum.
Romans 3.23. By the forgiveness of sins, that passed by.

A sin actually forgiven, and a sin passed by, differ. A sin is actually
pardoned in the elect coming to knowledge, when they have remorse for their
sin; and find the benefit of the pardon of the sin in particular. But God
passes by a sin, when the sinner in particular knows not this sin to be
a sin which he commits; and yet the remission of this sin is concluded
within the remission of the rest of their sins. The fathers when they got a
remission of the rest of their sins in the blood of Christ, they got also the
remission of the sin of polygamie, which was their sin of ignorance; and
therefore they were to offer a sacrifice for the sins of ignorance, Levit.
4.15.17. and among the rest for this polygamie.

Quest. How differed concubines then from other wives? First, they were not
solemnly married as the other wives, neither was there any solemn contract
betwixt them as betwixt the man and the wife; they had not dowry; their sons
did not inherit; yet when they were married, the Scripture calls them wives;
Judge. 19.1, 2, after that Absolon knew David's concubines, 2 Samuel 16. David
shut them up, and he knew them no more, but he closed them up to the day of
their death, and they lived in widowhood; whence Lyra gathers well, that
these concubines were wives.

Again, to prove that polygamie is sin, and unlawful, it is confirmed by
Christ's words; when he reduced marriage to the first institution again, Math.
19. Whosoever puts away his wife, and marries another, commits whoredom, much
more he who keeps his wife, and takes another to her, commits whoredom. The
Apostle, 1 Cor. 7. gives the like authority to the wife over the husband, as he
gives to the man over the wife: as it was never lawful for the wife to have
more husbands at once, therefore it was not lawful for a man from the
beginning, to have more wives at once.

This near conjunction betwixt man and the wife, cleaving to her. Genesis 2.

Christ when he expoundes these words, agglutinatur uxori, he is glewed to his
wife: for as glue joins two things together, and makes them one: so should
love be a glewing of their hearts together: amor coniugalis debet esse
reciprocus, the glue must take hold on both sides, Triplex est conjunctio,
naturalis, politica, and spiritualis,
or else the conjunction will not last long. There is a threefold conjunction;
first, natural: secondly, polytike, and thirdly, spiritual, the first is
common to us with the beasts, the second with the heathen and the third proper
only to the Christian: this third must be the chief ingredient, this is that
which they say, Nuptiae inchoantur in coelis, perficiuntur in terris, Marriages
are begun in heaven, and perfected upon the earth: then thalamus erit pro
templo, and thorus pro altari, that is, the wedding chamber shall be for the
Church, and the marriage bed for the Altar.

The woman was made a helper to the man.

This help stands in three things. religion, 1 Pet. Take heed that ye jarre
not, least Satan hinder your prayers, Tria adiumenta confert vxor viro suo. 1.
in religione.
he is speaking to the man and the wife here: such a helper was Priscilla to
Aquilla, Acts 18, Jobs. wife was not a helper to him in his religion, who bade
him curse God and dye: Job 2. nor Michol to David, when she scorned him as he
was dancing before the Arc, 2 Samuel 6. she was a hinderance to him in his
religion. So Salomons wives, when they drew him to Idolatry, 1 King. 11. were
not helpers to him in his religion.

Paul notes three sorts of conjunction, Triplex conjunctio; carnalis,
spiritualis, and spiritus, and carnis.
1 Corinthians. 6.16. the first is in the flesh only, as betwixt a man and a
whore, or a harlot: the second in the spirit only, as betwixt Christ and his
members; the third, in the flesh and the spirit, when two faithful are married
together: such will help one another in religion.

Secondly, she must help him in his labors, 2. in laboribus.
a wasting woman is compared to the ivy, it seems to uphold the tree, and in
the mean time suckes out the juice of it. A foolish woman overthrowes her
house Proverbes 14.1. but a virtuous woman is compared to a fruitful Vine,
Psalm 128.

Thirdly, now after the fall, 3. in doloribus.
she must help in his griefs. Ezekiel. 24.16. she is called, the delight of his
eyes, so Proverbes 5.19. she is called his hind or Roe: she must not be
like a drop of rain, or as a smoke in the house, continually to molest and
trouble it, Prove. 19.13.

She was made a helper like to himself?

The similitude betwixt the man and the wife, piety, Triplex similitudo vxoriad
virum. 1 in pietate. 2 gradibus dignitatis.

for this, see before in the former proposition.

Secondly, they must be alike in degrees, there would not be too great
inequality betwixt the persons who marry: but some make the inequality in
their own estimation, where theee is none at all.

That apologue in the 2 King 14.9. shows this well. The Thistle of Lebanon
sent to the Cedar of Lebanon to make a marriage with it, but the beasts of the
field tread down the Thistle But there was not so great odds betwixt the ten
tribes and the two tribes as betwixt the base Thistle, and the tall Cedar of
Lebanon: this came only from the high conceit which they had of themselves.

The Jews have another apologue, very fit for this purpose. They say that the
Moon upon a time sought to marry with the Sun, the Sun said that the Moon
could be no match to him; for he ruled the day and the year, he nourished all
things with his heat, he ruled the heart of man, the most excellent part of
the body, and by his heat he breeds the gold, the most excellent of the
metals. But the Moon replied, that there was not so great odds; for if the
Sun ruled the day, She ruled the night; if the Sun ruled the year, she
ruled the months: if he nourished things with his heat, yet he scorched and
burned many of them: and if it were not for the moisture which they receive of
her in the night, they would quickly perish; if he ruled the heart of man, she
rules the brain of man; if he breed the gold, she breeds the silver:
therefore there is not so great odds betwixt the Sun and the Moon, but they
may marry together.

Thirdly, 3. In aetate.
the man and the woman must be like in age. The mother of Dionysius the
tyrant, being very old, desired her son to cause a young man to marry her: he
answered; I can do any thing, but I cannot enforce nature: Naomi said, Ruth 1.
I am too old to marry again.

Among the Spartanes, there was a set time for their marriage: and they had
poenam (...) upon these who had deferred their marriage too long: their
punishment was, that they were never suffered to marry. Where these three
respects before mentioned (to wit, religion, degrees, and age) are not observed
in marriage; oftentimes the conjunction of them, is like the coupling of
Sampsons foxe-tayles, Judge. 15. which had a firebrand bound betwixt every of
them; so these that are unequally yoaked, the firebrand of Gods wrath falls
betwixt them sometimes.

Before the fall, it was not good for man to be alone, Genesis 2.

It is good for man not to be alone, quod bonum utile vocamus, that is, when
he has the gift of God to abstain, for the kingdom of God, Matthew. 19. that
he may the more exercise himself in these holy duties of prayer, and other
religious exercises.

Here we must mark, that there is a twofold good; Duplex bonum; expedientiae,
and morale.
to wit, the good of expediencie, and moral good. Moral good is opposite to
sin, but not expedient good. When Paul says, it is not good to marry, his
meaning is, that it is not expedient good at that time to marry, not that he
would make it a sin; for he says also, if he marry, he sins not.

In respect of circumstances, at that time it was better not to marry, this is
only bonum secundum quid, respectively good in respect of the persecutions
that were that time risen in the Church under the persecuting Emperors.

Virginity is not a virtue of it self, marriage is. That Virginity is not a
virtue, and therefore not to be vowed.


This is proved by two reasons: the first is, that all virtues by repentance
may be restored to man.

All virtues in time and place are commanded, Paul gives his advise in it, 1
Cor. 7. Therefore it is not a virtue.

Gerson uses a third reason thus, connexae, coupled together; and he who has
one of them is capable of them all; but married folks who have other virtues,
are not capable of irginity; therefore virginity is not a virtue.

But this reason holds not, Virtutes; vel sunt perfectae, vel imperfectae.
because all virtues are coupled together that are perfect virtues: but these
that are imperfect virtues, are not always coupled together. The perfect
virtues are prudency, temperancy, fortitude and justice, he that has one of
these has all the rest, but a man may have one of the inferior virtues, and
not have the rest, as the Church of Ephesus had patience, and suffered many
things for Christ, yet she fell from her first love, Revel. 2.

Object. But the Apostle says, 1 Corinthians. 7. The unmarried pleases the Lord,
therefore Virginity is a virtue.

Answ. Dupliciter placemus Deo; in Christo, and in officio: seu causaliter and
consequenter.
We please God two ways; first, only by his Son Christ as the cause;
secondly, we please God in that calling, that God has called us to; if we
have the gift of continency, then we please him in the unmarried life; if we
have not the gift, then we please him in marriage, 1 Timothy 2.15. Women shall be
saved through hearing of children; that is, they please God, when they are
called to that estate, to live in wedlock, and to bring up their children in
his fear; then they testify that they are in Christ; so that we please God as
well in the one estate as in the other.

Quest. But seeing Virginity is not a virtue, what will ye make it then?

Answ. Duplex bonum, per se, and ad aliquid.
There is a twofold good; First, that which is good in it self; Secondly, that
which is good for another end; fasting is not a thing that is good in it self;
for a man is not accepted before God that he fasts; it is but good for another
end, that is, when he fasts that he may be the more religiously disposed. So
virginity is not a thing that is good in it self, but good for another end,
that is, when a man lives a single life, having the gift of Chastity, that he
may be the more fit to serve God.

Virginity is no more acceptable before God than marriage; therefore the Church
of Rome preferring virginity so far above marriage, is strangely deluded:
for they glossing that parable of the sower, Mat. 13. say that Virginity
brings out a hundred fold; Widowhood sixty fold; and marriage, but thirty fold.

Again they say, quod conjugium pertinet ad veniam; Sanct. Mart-apud
Sulpitium, lib. 3.
virginitas ad gloriam; and fornicatio ad poenam, that is, marriage has need
of pardon; virginity deserves glory, and fornication punishment.

Thirdly, they say, that there are three crowns; Pontificij tres coronas
statuunt, martyrum, virginum, and doctorum: cui tres oponuntur inimici, caro,
mundus, Diabolus.
one for martyrs; a second for virgins; and the third for Doctors. To these
(say they) there are three enemies opposite: the flesh, the world, and the
Devil; the virgins overcome the flesh; the martyrs overcome the world; and
the Doctors overcome the Devil, by teaching the people, and drawing them out
of his tyranny; but they ordain no crown for the married estate; and thus
they make the ordinances of God prescribed in his Word, and established by
himself, to be of none effect.

Soli Deo gloria.
FINIS.
