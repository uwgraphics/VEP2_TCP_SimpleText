An Arrest of the Court of PARLIAMENT, The Princes and all the Chambers being
Assembled, August 22. 1652.
To give thanks to the King for the removal of the Cardinal MAZARIN, and to
beseech his Majesty to return to his good City of PARIS and to give Peace to
his People.
With the Declaration of the Princes
An extract of the Registers of the Parliament.
THis day the Court, all the Chambers being assembled, in the presence of
Beschefer Substitute for the Kings procureur General, Monsieur the Duke of
Orleans, and after him the Prince of Conde, said, that they had sufficiently
manifested by word and their Declarations made in Court, that the cause for
which they took up arms was only for the, removal of the Cardinal out of the
Kingdom. That upon advice given them they had brought to the Court their
Declarations signed, expressed in these terms.

THe resolution that the King has taken to cause the Cardinal Mazarin to
depart the Kingdom in this present conjuncture, justifies in some sort that
which we have done to hinder his entrance thereinto, and since he has been
come in, to expel him thence; so that no body can hereafter with reason blame
our conduct, but those who are willing to authorize his stay in France, who
have had the boldness to allege other things, and that to be only the pretense
for the War, and that there were causes of it that his removal would not be
able to take away; But as we protest that it has been the sole and true motive
which made us take up arms, so we come into this Company to assure it, that we
are ready to lay them down, and to execute sincerely the Declarations which we
have here made, pre-supposing that his departure out of the Kingdom be real:
and provided that it please his Majesty to do that which is necessary for the
peace of his People, and that which is always practiced in the like occasions;
which consists only in giving a General Act of Oblivion in good form, and to
remove the forces from about Paris, and to withdraw those that are in Guienne,
and the Provinces, to employ them otherwise upon the Frontires, and to
establish things in the same estate that they were before the present troubles,
and particularly that which concerns the reunion of the Parliament, and to
give a full assurance for the retiring those forces strangers that are under
our command. We are resolved to send an Express to his Majesty, to let him know
the same things, with all the respect we owe him, not doubting but that this
Company will think it sit so to do, and to conform our selves to the sense it
shall have in an occasion so important as is this, and whereof depends the
public peace:

In witness whereof we have signed the present Declaration.
The said Declaration being read and heard by the said Substitute, he said,
That it was out of an abundant goodness and affection that Monsiew the Duke of
Orleance, and Monsieur the Prince were willing to reiterate in word and writing
the same Declaration which had been heretofore made by them in this place, in
regard there was no need thereof, for that from the first time it was made by
them in this place, there has not been a man that is not persuaded that it was
most entirely sincere, and better written and engraven on their hearts
altogether royal, than in the register of this court; but since they had
witnessed so much good will for the good and welfare of the Estate, and for
this Company, that it would be further necessary to beseech them to employ
themselves toward the King, to be a means of his return to this city of Paris,
to honor and conserve it by his presence; and on the behalf of the Court, the
King having already by his goodness made the first step to make it sensible of
his graces and favors, this company are obliged to do all they can imagine
might be agreeable to the King, to answer to his good will, and to witness to
him with what affection they would render to him all submission and obedience
that he could defire, and to this end it seemed expedient to him to make a
deputation to go to the King to give him most humble thanks, for that he has
had regard to the Remonstrances of his Parliament, that if any thing has
happened that possibly might displease him, to beseech him to forget it, and to
be assured of the good intentions of this company; to make like supplication to
return to Paris, to assure the people, and to stop all distrusts formed by one
or the other party to foment divisions; If the Court shall think it good, to
add, that the Guards of the Ports be taken off, and that the levies of taxes
cease that have been imposed, it will be a thing very agreeable to the King.
And that this resolution be carried by such of the Genclemen as it shall please
the Court to depute, after it shall be known the King will please to hear them

The said Court has arrested and ordained, that the King be most humbly
thanked, for that it has pleased him to agree to the removal of the said
Cardinal Mazarin, that the Sovereign Companies, and the body of the Town be
advertised and conveened to make the same deputation, to beseech the said
Sovereign Lord the King to come to Paris, and to assure him of all the duties,
respects, submissions, and obediences of his Officers and Subjects. That the
said Sieur de Orleance, and the said Sieur Prince, be also thanked for their
good will, entreated to continue their good affection for the peace of the
Kingdom, and o send instantly with the most speed possible to his Majesty, to
accomplish that which is necessary for the good and repose of his Estate, and
to this end that the said Declaration remain with the Secretary of the said
Court.

Given in Parliament the 22 day of August, 1652.
