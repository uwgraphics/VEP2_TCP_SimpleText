A short Relation or Testimony of the working of the light of Christ in me,
from my Childhood, by one who is now a witness of the spirit of truth (whom the
world cannot receive) which does convince of sin, of righteousness and of
judgment: and brings all things to rememberance, and shows me things to come,
glory to the Lord for ever: W: B:
Come see a man which told me all things that ever I did, is not this the
Christ: Joh: 4:29:
IN the eternal light and life of God, (wherewith stand all mankind are
lighted) do I now stand and rejoice over the world and all its glory and
enmity over the beast and false prophet with in and without having received
power from the father of life (in the way of his judgments) after which my soul
had long breathed and thirsted, even from a Child, though then I knew not what
my soul panted for, but now know the mysteries of Gods everlasting Kingdom are
revealed to the babes that fear him, but to others its parables.

When I was about 10 years old, I do remember, that sometimes I desired to go
and sit alone quiet in some desert place, where I might bemoan my self and
weep in secret even until my heart was broken, not knowing wherefore, and did
begin to pray in fear to God with tears though I knew not who or where he was,
but had little to speak only some thing cried in me and breathed, confidently
believing that God heard me where ever he was, and would pity me and save me,
at which thanks did arise unto him, not knowing it was a seed in me which was
and is beloved of God, (contrary to the course of this world) to which the
blessing and promises are, that did arise in the quiet of my mind to break down
that which the Serpent and my own will had wrought in my heart contrary to God,
that thereby I might enjoy peace in the everlasting covenant of light; for at
any time when I had done or spoken that which was contrary to God, I was soon
checked for it, judged and condemned and put in fear, by his witness in my
conscience which beheld all my ways and wo^ds though never so secret, and is
the same that Job speaks of, which set a print upon his heels, and mark his
steps, Job 13.27. in which light I can see all that ever I have done, and do
remember the first oath that ever I swore, (being provoked by another lad) and
that I was smote with trembling scarceable to stand on my feet, by the witness
of God in my conscience which I know not then what it was, but could have fled
any way from it, being put in such horrible fear and condemned by it when I
had done any evil, so there is no place at last where the worker of iniquity
may hide himself, from the dreadful presence of God as David says.

So about 15 years old I went among the Soldiers (being the time of war) not
heeding the true guide, the light and spirit of God which strived often with me,
to lead me in meekness and fear, out of all strife which comes from the lust
that wars against the soul, I then was entertained, and became one among them
both in garrison and Army, where for a season I was kept and preserved out of
much wickedness by the fear of God in me, though I knew not then where he
was, nor long after; yet by his secret hand of power unexpected and undeserved,
was I preserved when many were slain on my right hand and on my left hand,
glory and praises to his power for ever, and ever.

But about 17 years old I was under the command of him called Major General
Massey, where I found many wicked and ungodly men, and some that had turned
from Gorings Army among them, through which company the honest principle in me
was betrayed, and even murdered, and I begin to be hardened from the fear of
God (for I was but a youth, and of a bashful countenance naturally, and was
soon checked for any evil, and felt the condemnation for it, quickly.) but now
I could swear and vapor among them and drink till I was sometime drunk, and
grew in it, until I even took delight in swearing and drunkenness, yet often
times when I was gone from my company alone and quiet, fear and dread from the
witness of God in me would seize upon me, in great and horrible terror and in
the night in dreams, was I often fearfully scared and tormented with fearful
sights and visions of Hell and Devils, death and damnation which indeed (in
that state) was my just portion, and so in the cool of the day I heard the
voice of God and was afraid, like Adam in the transgression and though I would
have hid my sin like him, yet the Lord did search it out.

And now I know God speaks unto man once, yea twice, yet man perceives it
not, in a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men,
in slumberings upon the bed, that he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide
prides from him, Job: 33:14: And in this company I continued near 2 years
until all was disbanded; about which time I was so smitten by Gods witness,
the light in my conscience that I began to leave of my swearing and lewdness,
and my profane compapany became even loathsome and burdensome unto me, and I
never swoar an oath from that time to this day which is about 10 years ago;
so at length I became a little zealous to hear the Priests, and began to look
into the Scriptures to get them to talk of, as many profane ones do now, to
make a covering; and then thought I must be guided by the Priests, who had the
learning and the tongues which they called the original, not knowing then that
their original began at Babell, where God confounded the languages, and the
people before were of one language, in the beginning (which is the original) so
their original is from Babell (which is confusion) where they still are, and
all their followers, who will partake of their plagues if they come not forth
to the light which is the original, before Babell or the Priests, or Lattin,
Greek, and Hebrew was, which Pilate set over him that is the original, Christ,
the true Prophet, which all are to hear, his name is called the word of God
which was in the beginning, John 1.1. so poor ignorant blind people that be from
the light which they be lighted withal, they cries up Greek, and Hebrew with
the Priests to be the original, and that the Scriptures cannot be understood
without it, not considering that they who had Lattin, Greek, and Hebrew,
crucified the son of God, who was in the beginning gloryfied with the Father
before the World began, (the original) by whom the world was made, the power
and wisdom of God, whose cross to the Greeks is foolishness, and to the Jews
a stumbling block, and the Greeks have Greek, and the Jews have Hebrew, as well
as the Priests and Pilate which knew not the son of God the original, but set
Lattin, Greek, and Hebrew atop of him, when they had crucified him, John
19.19:20.

So for a season, these Merchants of Babylon I traded with, receiving and bying
their wares, hoping it had been good durable stuff I had got of them, being it
was prised so high, and people cried they had the original and could give the
meanings of the Scriptures, and none else, and the Beast upheld or carried the
Whore and all the World wondered after them, as I did then; at length something
in me began to be more and more awakened and hungered after true bread, yet
thought I should be still fed at their Table, and did, until I was near
starved with the husks that the swine did eat, for a stirring word in me was,
give me food or else I perish, and went to hear them even with tears for
hunger many times, until I perceived they spoke not out of the mouth of the
Lord, the word of life, the true bread that came down from heaven; but had
studied and patcht up something from the Scriptures without them, mixing their
meanings and Babilonish whoreish wisdom and Serpents subtilty with it, and
bid us hear the word of God, and so we looked for light, but behold darkness
and dust we were fed with; and that was made sad in me, by them, which the Lord
God proclaimed joy and liberty to, as the Deceivers and false Prophets in ages
past did whom God was against.

And upon these Crafts men and Merchants of the great Whore, will the
perpetual plagues and vengeance of the Lord God be poured down without
mixture, and as they have done, so shall it be done to them, and God will fill
double to her, and she shall know that he is the Lord, that search the heart,
and shows unto man his thought, and that God is light, and in him is no
darkness (or mixture) at all, and the day is hastening in which they shall
howl and lament, for no man byeth her ware any more that is taught of the Lord,
and the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of his power as the waters
cover the Sea; and in that day the thief shall be ashamed that have stole the
word from his neighbor, and the false Prophet which deceived the Nations shall
be ashamed of his vision, and Diviners will be mad, and the Beast will hate the
Whore and burn her flesh with fire, and there will be dissolation, widdowhood,
and loss of children come upon her in one day, (he that reads let him
understand)

And this I can truly say, and do testify in the Lord,

That when a true hunger and thirst in me did arise after the living God, it
was often hurt, darkened and spoiled by the earthly wisdom, Philosophy and
vain deceit which came out of the Priests mouth, which beguiled me of my
reward, drawing out my mind from the pure measure of God within, insomuch that
the simple honest and meek principle which stirred in me was weary to hear them
any longer; and from no other ground did I at first deny them, but as that of
God in me discovered (and witnest against) them as such, as should never profit
the people at all, being out of his council not able to turn any from their
evil ways, but strengthening the hands of the wicked, and making the
righteous sad, this is their work as by their fruits is made manifest whose
reward shall be accordingly.

So in those days my soul was awakened by the witness of God, feeling the
burden of sin, and was often afraid of death, and misery, without end, but
knew not how to get out from under the power of sin and death, nor to escape
the wrath to come: being ignorant of him that saves from it, which is Christ
the power of God, that lights every man which comes into the World which
condemns sin in the flesh, but now I see that people perish for lack of
knowledge, and that the leaders of the people cause them to err, and they that
are led of them are destroyed, Isa. 9.16. for nothing will help or satisfy the
longing soul immortal, but the eternal true bread of life, the power of God,
which he gives to as many as ^^^ives him that condems for sin, and destroys
the works of the Devil who has the power of death, for the sting of death is
sin: so he delivers them from that which is the ground of bondage and fear of
death, who believes in him that is the resurrection and the life, over whom the
second death has no power, glory to the Lord for ever and ever.

So now having in measure began to leave the Priests, I kept at home, not
desiring for a season to hear any, but to be private and quiet alone, which was
a great cross to my Parents, Wife and Relations, and also to something in me,
and to my Companions and acquaintance which loved me with that love which
quickly turned to hatered, so I found it hard to break the customs that I had
lived in, and to become contrary to all my neighbors and acquaintance, and to
loose the love of them all, as that I saw I should, if I followed that which
let me see the Priests and the vanity of the World, and the Scripture speaks
not in vain, Jer. 13.23. Can the Ethiopian change his skin, no more can they
do good that are accustomed to do evil; hear this ye careless ones, that live
in the vanity of your minds, pleading for your customs, vanities, traditions
and fashions of the World that lie in wickedness, and for the fleshly lusts
which wars against your own souls; the Lord God will plague you with it, and
that will become the greatest torment to you, in which you have most delighted,
in the day of your visitation, then you shall know you were warned in your life
time; but in the midst of these my trials and temptations within and without,
a word was very nigh me, even in my heart, though I then know not what it was,
saying seek first the Kingdom of God; and mind eternal life, yet not knowing
where to seek or find it, but the deep consideration of it did much strengthen
me toward God, and some times even breathings and cries would ascend up from
the prisoner of hope in me, and my heart was even broken and melted by the
power of the word of life, which I felt therein hammering down the hardness
thereof, and renting the veil that separated me from peace with God; but not
knowing Christ within the hope of glory, which lights every man that comes
into the World, whose name is called the word of God, the Male in the flock
which opened the Womb, holy to the Lord, the Lamb slain from the foundation of
the World, (which lies in wickedness) the first and the last, the holy one in
the midst, whom my soul loves which had been peirced, wounded, and as it were
slain by that, which wars against the soul, and was a sufferer in Sodom and
Egypt, but now is Lord of lords, and King of kings, glory to him that sits upon
the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever more, amen.

So I began to heed and love that in me, which discovered sin and vanity and
the course of the whole World, and to take it to be my companion (or Kinswoman
as Solomon speak of wisdom) not knowing it to be the light of Christ, (the
wisdom and power of God) in my conscience in those days of ignorance, but I
saw often by it my own folly, and the whole World was out of course (or the way
of peace) in confusion and abomination, without the fear of God before their
eyes, in pride and envying one another in covetousness and wantonness,
dissimulation and falsehood, every one for his own ends and gain, even from the
Judge to the Priest, and likewise their followers, not a wise man found among
them, that feared the Lord and departed from evil, this I saw, and was
sometime even greived at the consideration of it, wishing in my heart I had
power to have helped it all, being much affected with unity and peace, meekness
and quietness, love and justness amongst men, that they might have lived as
Children of one Father, saying in my mind, did not all we come of Adam and had
we not all one Father and Mother in the beginning, why then should one envy
another and be high, proud, and stubborn against another, and murder each
other about a little earth or vain glory that will wither, and hate, and
strive, and be angry about religion, and judgments, and opinion, and even fight
one against another about these things: when I considered these things in my
mind, I desired God (in my heart) would remedy all this, and once put an end to
it, for I even felt the whole Creation groaning in bondage under these
oppressions at that time, yet not knowing that it was the light of Christ in
me, which sometimes checked me for sin and evil, that discovered these things
unto me, and did open my understanding that I might have known and understood
the thing that belonged to my everlasting peace; so that I can boldly say,
people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: and that strait is the gate, and
narrow is the way that leads to the l^fe, and few there be that have found it,
and that the mysteries of the Kingdom are hid from the wise and prudent of the
World, but revealed to babes, and to such as can become fools for Christ's sake
who is the light of the World, the wisdom and power of God, glory to him for
ever in the highest, who has brought me out of darkness into his marvelous
light, where I behold his likeness.

Now in these days, when I had even resolved never to hear the Priests, as to
be a follower of them any more, yet being out of my outward employment, and for
fear of loosing all, I through persuasions of the Serpent within, and of
others without, did hear them again, least I should have angered them, who had
intent to employ me, and prefer me, but I was terribly judged and condemned by
Gods witness in me, which before had let me see the deceit of the Priests, and
the vanity and error of their worship and ways, contrary to Christ and his
Apostle and their Doctrine, so in process of time I went into France 2 small
voyages, where having time, the Serpent led out my mind wholly to delight in the
art of Arithmetic, and the study and practice of navegation, which I saw I
might in short time attain, (being acquainted with numbering which is the
ground of many arts) which things took me up into an exceeding high m^untain,
showing glorious promises of the preferment riches and love of the world and
respect among men, which tickled the nature in me which went out from Gods
witness, even the pride of life which is not of the Father but the world,
which is the glory of the rich men, great men, and chief Captains, whose
flesh is to be given to the souls of heaven, in this the Supper of the great
God. So through the strong temptations and allurements of this flattering
harlot (the whoreish spirits gone from the light of whose cup all Nations and
Kings of the earth have drunk) the honest tender principle of equity, love and
meekness was even covered, lost and dead in me, and the spirit of the world I
let in again like a flood, (whose foundation had in some measure been shaken,
and the earth that lay upon the precious seed removed by the power of God) and
gross darkness again covered my soul and veiled its life and peace from it
which formerly it had felt and breathed after; so I can seal to the
scriptures, they that will be rich, fall into temptation and a snare, and into
many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in perdition and destruction,
but the snare is broken and I am escaped, glory to the living God for ever
more. Yet in that time I was in France, I was so much in the fear of God kept,
by his pure witness the light in my conscience, which showed me sin and evil,
that I dared not to be lewd or drunk, or act such wickedness as the Tempter
would have led me to, not knowing that it was the light of Christ which I
obeyed then, which saved me from that which the Devil would have drew me into,
so I can say with Jacob, God was in this place and I knew it not, therefore all
people, come to him that tells you all that ever you did, for if you knew the
gift of God, and loved him, you would ask of him water of life, but the
rebellious dwell in a dry Land: but though I was preserved out of these gross
evils outwardly, yet the love of the World, and the things of the World had a
strong hold in my heart, whereby the true love to equity, righteousness, and
mercy was vanished away, and the place of wisdom I knew not where to find,
though I sought it carefully when I felt the loss of it, but in a cross to
the will of man and of flesh, is that born which inherits Gods kingdom of
peace; for after a while, when I was in the midst of my vain thoughts and
imaginations, how to build great things in the earth, (to become rich, knowing
and honorable therein, to obtain the friendship of the World, and praise of
men,) a sudden stop like a cloud came upon it all, and I was struck with a
still silence in my mind, (like Adams cool of the day) wherein I saw that I
strived and wearyed my self for very vanity that would perish with the useing,
and that I like a fool might leave them in the midst of my days, so as I gave
heed to that which let me see these things to be but as shadow, and that it
was folly so eagerly to pursue that which made themselves wings, and thereby to
be beguiled of an eternal Crown of rest to my immortal soul, my former
condition came fresh into my remembrance, and I began to feel something stir
in me for life, which lay in death and bondage under Pharaoh in spiritually
Egypt, and as it were a cry ascended from the Prisoner, groaning afar off for
deliverance: and then I began to be troubled and condemned in my self; and my
peace in the earth was broken, and the flaming sword turned every way upon it;
then being afraid of shame, I strived with Gods spirit in me (not knowing what
it was all this while nor some time after) and would pass away the trouble as
much as I could sometime, and even wished I could be meek like others, for I
often witnessed Solomon's words: (in the midst of laughter the heart is made
sad,) and was nearer weeping then mirth many times in such Company, so I had no
rest to my soul in those days, being ignorant of my Teacher, the true
Shpeherd of Israel, which gives his sheep (that follow him) eternal life,
meek and low in the heart.

But now my soul being like one awakened from sleep, and hungery after that
which satisfies, I began again to seek for food and rest, and to enjoy life
and peace which changes not, then I thought in my mind what shall I do?
remembering the Priests (which were discovered by the same witness of G^d
again) to be miserable Comforters, and such as daub with untempered mortar, (as
all the World shall witness in the day at hand, when the wall is no more nor
they that daubed it) and Physicians of no value, but rather robbers and
murders of the innocent and just principle in poor ignorant people that cries
for deliverance.

Then not knowing what to do for life (being gone fo^th hunting abroad like
Esau and all his stock of Priests and Professors in the World for food) I went
among the people called Baptists to see if I could obtain rest and peace there
among them, thinking if they be the people of God, I had right to have
fellowship with them, and to partake of their promises and privileges, for I
often felt something in me which was beloved of God, so concluded that I was
one of the elect, not then knowing and discerning things that differ, that it
was a seed in man (which may be by him, oppressed and trod under foot) to which
the promises and the blessing is, and the elect is before the foundation of the
World, and the whole World lies in wickedness: Read this if thou can that cry
the election of a particular people, and the rest left to themselves, and
beware of the Doctrine of Devils, and remember that God is no respecter of
persons, and Christ the true light, lights every man that comes into the
World, in whom is the election and redemption, and he that knows not Christ in
him is a reprobate as says the Scripture 2 Cor. 13.5. So then I became a
constant follower of them, and at length was in that fellowship with them, and
Brotherhood which the natural carnal visible water was the ground off; for
before I was dipped in water they called me not Brother, but suddenly after they
did, yet I was the same every way as before, no more bettered nor satisfied by
the water after I came to Gods witness in me in the cool of the day, which
let me see my soul lay in death, though the comprehending mind had got a l^fe
and food in a profession, in which I had no true peace when all was performed
and done by which I thought to obtain: But it still fled from me as I tu^ned to
that in my heart which let me see my state and condition, even the light of
Christ though I knew not then what it was: so now I know there is no peace to
the wicked, and that the woe is to them that are covered with a covering and
not with the pure spirit of God which reproves the World of sin, neither should
I ever attained it in that way if I had walked therein 100 years: for we came
not to Christ (but denied him) whose flesh is meat indeed, and is the true
bread which gives life to the World: neither were we joined together in the
unity of the faith of the Lord of glory which is without respect of Persons,
and is a mystery held in a pure conscience, giving victory over the World,
being all from the light which we were lighted withal, that is to give people
the knowledge of God, in which the Saints inheritance and fellowship is.

But we were building a Tower (hoping the top would have reached to Heaven) in
our imaginations like the confounded Builders of old (like Nimrods stock) the
beginning of whose Kingdom was Babell that hunted before the Lord, who is that
spirit which will confound all your wisdom who build without his light, the
Cornerstone, the sure foundation, though you may say Lord, Lord, this availes
not, while ye are workers of iniquity you are shut out, so we were professing
and talking of the truth (which makes free) Christ the light, the way to the
Father, but we were in bondage, darkness and falsehood in the broad way,
wherein many hipocrites, deceitful workers, envious, proud, and covetous may
walk, keeping their covering of their profession, and talking of him that leads
to life out of death, darkness and all unrighteousness, in which you hold the
truth of God, his witness the light that you be lighted withal, which lets
you see you have not the true bread of life that gives peace, rest and
satisfaction to the soul, but feeds on the husk: notwithstanding your great
noise of him that is the substance of all, which ends the shadows, but
expects his Kingdom and glory and reign without you, o ye fools and blind;
is not the Kingdom of God within you? and is not the Kings daughter all
glorious within? and did not the King say: go not forth when they shall say
lo here and lo there, believe them not?

But in this state I was once with you until the Son of God opened his eyes
that was born blind, whom the Pharisees cast out, as they have many in this
age that tremble at the word of the Lord, but the Lord God of power has
appeared to their joy, and you shall be ashamed, though you may say the Lord be
glorified; in whose eternal light I then saw in this profession without life,
I was never like to have peace to that which was awakened in me, breathing for
the pure righteous power of the living God, which all men had been erred and
estranged from by transgression (the middle wall that seperates) which by the
higher power is broken down where the salvation is wrought out with fear and
trembling, which the professor denies, casting out such as tremble at the word
which is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, and the time is
come that they cannot endure sound Doctrine: this is to you all Priests,
Baptists and people that be from the light which you be lighted withal, that
lets you see your ungodly deeds and hard speeches, what shall I say more of
you. Why you pass over judgment, and so the love of God you know not, this is
from the Lord God to you, as shall be witness on your death bed:

So after a season, in this my breathing and longing condition, in which I
desired that God would make an alteration and change among us (being in all we
performed dead to the pure simple life of God, for which my soul thirsted) it
happened, that I heard a book read of the sufferings of some of the people of
God (who were called quakers) in a dungeon at Suesham, whose name and
sufferings was strange to me at that time; yet at the hearing of it, something
in me did arise with much tenderness and pity toward the innocent suffering
people, which drew tears from mine eyes, believing they did suffer for
conscience sake, and the same thing in me even said that God would avenge them
on the bloody persecutors, (which has been performed by his mighty hand of
power on some of them even to the cutting them of the earth as briars and
thorns for the fire) but did not know all this time what it was that let me
see these things, and knew not light from darkness (as is the state of
thousands, who profess Christ (as I did in words,) who lighte^^ every man that
comes into the world and leads his sheep out of darkness into the fould of
eternal life and peace from which the wise and prudent withal their
knowledge, comprehension and imaginations are shut out for ever.

Then I heard Jacob Behements books, and began to read much in them, and to
gather something of that into my comprehension and imaginations in the brain,
but this and all the other gave not p^ace and rest to the immortal soul which
still lay in death and bondage, by reason of transgression and sin; but not
long after came one, a Minister of the word of life (whose name few know) and
preached to the spirit in prison which rejoiced much at the sound of his words
to which I gave diligent heed, and was eternally convinced that it was the very
truth he declared, and that there is no other way to know God (or to be saved)
but as I walked in the light which I was lighted withal which did let me see
all my ungodly deeds and hard speeches that ever I had committed, which light
comes from Christ the Savior, and leads all that follow it, out of the evil
that is in the world, unto him that was before the world was, by whom it was
made, gloryfied with the Father; the substance of all the types, figures,
shaddows, ordenances, of which might be spoken many things, but he is the sum,
that redeems man by his blood (the life) out of the earth into which man was
driven in transgression, up unto God again before transgression was to the
beginning and the end:

So as to the true light in my heart, my mind was turned, many Scriptures came
fresh unto me confirming the truth of which he spoke, and the power of the
word, in my heart, of God, which the light comes from, began to stir and
work, and condemnation was administered upon all my former profession, and a
svvord was coming upon the earth, which had sat still in peace and open
war was proclaimed against the beast, whore, and false prophet, by the lamb
that was slain whose svvord came out of his mouth, and the prisoner of hope
rejoiced at the beginning of this day of vengeance, believing the year of
redemption was come; so that here was a change began, and that which seemed
strang^ to me was happened, which was quickly perceived by the baptists,
who were then my companions in profession (but not in tribulation) for I was
made to weep and lament, seeing all the religion in the world to be but as a
fading Leaf, without the pure life and power of God which saves from
sin, and brings into unity with him; so that I could no longer be satisfied
nor live, in a talk of God and Christ, and not enjoy the eternal rest, even
the sincere milk of the immortal word of life which my soul breathed after
even from a Child, though I knevv not what it was, nor where to find it;
but in this my troubled condition many baptists follovved day and night to
persuade me out of it, looking upon me, to be deluded and some with prayers,
and some with flatteryes, and others of them with envious words strived to
get me back to them, telling me that I was fallen from grace, and was become
under the Law, and making the blood of Christ of none effect, but I not
knovving then the blood to be the life, and that the life is the light of men,
though I was convinced in my conscience of the eternal truth, yet my
understanding God was confounding, and the day of the Lord was darkness and
not light to that part which had held the truth in unrighteousness (as they
shall all one day witness) where their covering is rent of them, and their
inside made more manifest, who by their many tattling words drevv out my
mind from Gods witness in me, and from the Law written in the heart, to
which I should have kept and been faithful (even the sure word of prophecy
which let me see all that ever I did) for Moses was faithful as a servant in
all his house, but this mystery I knew not then, and so to get ease turned out
my mind from the truth which is required in the inward parts, and gave heed to
seducing spirits, and words which darkened council, in so much that I joined
again with them in more zeal then before, and encouraged others to follovv
their strong imaginations from the letter of Scripture, looking for a Savior
without us, though the Scripture says Christ within the hope of glory, and
know ye not that Christ is in you except ye be reprobates, etc: And for his
coming without us, though he said, when they shall say lo here and lo there
believe them not, and go not forth: and for his Kingdom and glory without
us, though the Kings Daughter is all glorious within, and the King said, the
Kingdom of God is within you, and for his resurrection and life and reign
without us, when as the King said, I am the resurrection and the life, and am
come a light into the world, (who lights every man that comes into the
world) these things we imagined and builded one another up in contrary to the
Scripture, and to the Saints which builded up in that which is a miistery held
in a pure conscience; so we past over judgment (like the Pharisees and
hipocrites of old, which did profess and say, but do not) climbing up an
easier way then by the door, (Christ who condemns sin in the flesh) like
the theife that had stolen a covering, even words from the neighbor, but after
a season these things came heavy upon me, and was more harder to be judged out
and destroyed then all the other wickedness and iniquity that ever I
committed; for when I being unsatisfied came from the baptists again, (having
suffered persecution for the name of Christ) resolved with purpose of heart to
wait on the Lord, whatever became of all the world, their glory, profession,
or enmity: for a word was powerfully in me, [seek first the Kingdom of God] to
which I gave heed, and turned my mind again to the light which had checked me
for sin from my childe-hood, which Christ had enlightened me withal, and the
power of God was manifested, and his dreadful judgments fell on the whore
which went out from the life into a profession, and plagues, and famine, and
earthquakes, and thunders, war and tremblings, sighing, mourning, weeping,
and fasting, and great astonishments came upon that ground in me which before
professed the Scriptures: and all that ever I had acted or spoken out of the
light, was judged, cursed and condemned, whether, eating or forbearing, or
drinking or forbearing, lying down or rising up, sleeping or waking, going out
or coming in, all was judged and condemned until the meek came to ride King
upon the foal of an ass, and Sion redeemed with judgment, which came to pass
as obedience was yielded to the higher power, who with his mighty and peircing
sword wounded Leviathan and slew the Dragon that was in the Sea, and the great
whore was plagued (the beast and false Prophet together) of whose cupp of
fornication all Nations and Kings of the earth have drunk who must drink
freely as I have done, of the cupp of the wine of the fierceness of the wrath
of the Lord God almighty, or else shall never know rest and peace in the Land
of the Living;

For Caine the first birth, the envious one the murderer is vagabond from God,
and Ishmaell the wild man, the mocker is cast out, and Esau the cunning hunter
is rejected, the profane person, and all proud Hamans stock, and Naballs race,
these must have their part in the Lake of torment, for dreadful plagues and
vengeance is coming upon all the worlds nature from the terrible God of power,
who is now come to reign in righteousness, therefore woe to the inhabitance
of the earth, all ye proud, wanton, envious, covetous, and deceitful ones,
and all Hypocrites, and ungodly ones Torment, howling, wrath and perpetual
misery with lamentation forever is your portion, except you speedily repent:

Therefore all people upon earth turn your minds to light wherewith you are
enlightened by Christ Jesus the Savior which lets you see sin and evil,
least you be by him turned into everlasting misery and utter darkness, where
will be no end of your sorrow and pain, and repent and prise your time, and
stopp not the care nor close the eye against that in you which rises for
deliverance, and is sad in the midst of your vain mirth, which cannot be
satisfied with any thing of this World; but heed that which shows you the
evil of the World, for that leads out of it, and all its ways, worships,
fashion, and traditions, (which are vain and fading) up to Christ who is not
of the world, by whom it was made, who lights every man that comes into the
world, the salvation of all that obey him: And this is he who has led me out
of the world through great Tribulations unto the good Land of rest, glory to
him that sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever, whose
power once killed, but now makes alive, and having slain the enmity by the
blood of his Cross, whose own arm has brought salvation, glory and
everlasting praises unto the Lord God omnipotent, who have given power and
strength, wisdom, dominion and eternal blessing to the Lamb slain, who was
once in Sodom and Egypt crucified spiritually, but now his life the grave
cannot hold, but has rissen tryumphing over the principallityes and powers of
the world, by whose power the horse and his rider is cast into the sea, and now
reigns in righteousness, and in it does judge and make war, being Lord of
Lords, and King of Kings, whose name is called the word of God, from whence the
true light comes which lights every man that comes into the world,
everlasting prayers and glory to his powerful name in the highest, Amen:

6th. Month, 59. This is given forth in true love to the yet scattered of the
Flock, whom my Soul desires may come to know the rest at noon, in the life of
the Son of righteousness. by William Bailey.
