for, or touching the subscribing or taking the ENGAGEMENT.
WHereas many general and promissorie Oaths, and Engagements, in former times
imposed upon the People of this Nation, have proved burdens and snares to
tender Consciences; and yet have been exacted, under several penalties,
forfeitures, and losses; upon consideration whereof, and out of a tenderness of
requiring such obligations, Be it Ordained by His Highness, the Lord
PROTECTOR, by and with the advice and consent of the Council, That one Act of
Parliament, published in print the second day of January one thousand six
hundred forty and nine, entitled, An Act for subscribing the Engagement; And
certain Orders, entitled, Resolves touching the subscribing to an Engagement,
etc. And all and every Clause, Branch, Article, and Sentence in them, and every
or any of them contained, shall from and after the nineteenth day of J^nuary in
the year of our Lord one thousand six hundred fifty and three, stand and be
absolutely repealed, and adnulled; And that all and every Clause, Branch,
Article, Proviso or Sentence contained in any other Act, Ordinance, Resolves or
Order of Parliament, whereby the said Oath or Engagement is directed, and
appointed to be taken, and administered, and all and every the penalties,
losses, incapacities, disabilities, and forfeitures for not taking, or
subscribing the same, shall from and after the said nineteenth day of January,
in the year of our Lord one thousand six hundred fifty and three, (as to so

losses, incapacities, disabilities, and forfeitures for not taking or
subscribing the same) be, and are hereby, utterly repealed, and made void: And
that the said Oath or Engagement, where the same is appointed to be
Administered by it self, or where the same is inserted into any other Oath (as
to so much only as concerns the said Engagement) shall not, from or after
the said nineteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand six
hundred fifty and three, be administered unto, or taken by any Officer,
Minister of Justice, or other Person whatsoever; but the same shall from
thenceforth be wholly taken away and abolished to all intents and purposes
whatsoever. And that from and after the said nineteenth day of January, in the
said year of our Lord one thousand six hundred fifty and three, no place or
Office of trust within this Commonwealth, shall be made void, by reason of
the not taking or subscribing the said Engagement. And it is lastly Ordained by
the Authority aforesaid, That if any person or persons whatsoever have been
delaied, hindered, or prejudiced in any Course or proceedings of Law, Justice, or
Equity, or has not or cannot have the full benefit thereof, by reason or
means that such person or persons has not or have not taken or subscribed the
said Engagement, in such form, or at such time or times as has or have been
limited or appointed for the taking or subscribing thereof, such person or
persons shall from henceforth be admitted unto, and have such Course, pleadings
and Proceedings in Law, Justice, and Equity, as if such person or persons had
taken or subscribed the said Engagement, in such manner and form, and at such
time or times, as was or were directed or appointed for the taking or
subscribing thereof, and not otherwise.
