Mr Nathaniell Fiennes his Letter to his Father.
My Lord,
I Have sent to your Lordship a Relation of the last Battle fought in Keynton
Field, which I showed to the General and Lieutenant General of the Horse,
and diverse Colonels and Officers, and they conceive it to be right and
according to the truth: For the ill writing of it, I desire that your Lordship
would excuse me, for I had not time to write it over again; yet I suppose it
may be read, and your Lordship may cause it to be written fair, if your
Lordship think it worth so much. For that which your Lordship writes
concerning my brother John, it is a most false and malicious slander which that
fellow has raised upon him, that he should be the first man that fled on the
left wing, when as none of your Lordships sons were in the left wing, and my
brother John was not at all in the field while the fight was; for by occasion
that I entreated him on Saturday morning, when we marched toward Keynton
(little dreaming of a Battle the next day) to go to Evesham (which was but
three miles from the quarter where our Troops lay, before they marched with the
Army to Keynton) for to take some Arms that were come thither the night before,
for such of our men as wanted Arms, and so to come after to the Rendevouz at
Keynton. He could not come thither on Saturday with those men of both Troops
which went back with him to Evesham for their Arms, but the next day he came
thither between three or four of the clock; at which time our left wing being
defeated, many of the Run-aways met with him as he was coming to the Army; and
happily among the rest, this fellow that raised this report; for that Viuers
which your Lordship mentions, was not Captain Viuers (for he was in Banbury)
but a brother of his that was in one of Colonel Goodwins Troops, and as I
heard my brother say, he saw him there; and I heard my Lord General say, that
Vivers was one of the first that ran away: Now it seems that those men that
ran away so timely, seeing my brother before them, reported as if he had fled
from the Army, which is so contrary to the truth, that he took a great deal
of pains to make his own men and Captain Vivers men which were with him to
stand, and to stop the Run-aways that came from the Army, and this he did, and
made two or three stands, and at length gathered a pretty body upon a hill
together, and with them (there being Captain Keightlyes and Captain Cromwells
Troop, at length came to them also) be marched toward the Town; and hearing
the enemy was there (as indeed they were there with the greatest part of their
horse) they made a stand, and sending sorth their Scouts to give them
intelligence where the enemy and where our Forces were, at length they came to
knowledge of Colonel Hampdens Brigadoe that was coming another way to the
Town, and so joining themselves unto them, they came to the Army together. My
Lord General is very sensible of the wrong that this fellow has done my
brother, and will inquire after him to have him punished, as he has written to
my Lord Wharton concerning him, to let you know so much. Master Bond whom he
cites for one of his authors, denies that ere he spoke to my brother at all,
or that he saw any such thing of flying, as that base fellow reports, and
this your Lordship shall have under his hand. It had been a strange thing if my
brother that showed so much courage at Worcester, should have been so
faint-hearted upon this occasion: But I strange that men will give credit to
every idle fellow; if they will, they may hear that my Lord General, and all
the Officers every one of them ran away. But my Lord, as your Lordship has
great cause to be thankful, together with us, to God, that in all these late
actions of danger, has preserved the persons and lives of all your three Sons,
so also for preserving their honors, and the honor of Religion; that in this
cause they have never flinsht, but have all of them in their several places
and conditions been as forward to hazard their persons into the midst of theirs
and Gods enemies as any whosoever. And of the truth of this (though we do not
vapor so much as some do) there are enough, and those very honorable witnesses
that can and will affirm it as well as

Your Lordships most obedient Son, NATHANIEL FIENENES.

A most true Relation of the Battle fought by his Excellency and his Forces
against* the bloody Cavalliers.
THe two and twentieth of October, being Saturday, his Excellency the Earl of
Essex came with twelve Regiments of Foot, and two and forty Troops of Horse,
and a part of the Ammunition and Artillery, to Keynton, a little Market Town,
almost in the midway between Stratford upon the Avon, and Banbury, there being
three Regiments of foot, and nine or ten Troops of horse, with seven Pieces of
Cannon, and good store of Ammunition coming after, together with six Companies
of Dragooners: The Dragooners, and two of the Regiments of Foot, with the
Cannon, and nine or ten Troops of horse, came to Keynton on Sunday night, a
little before the day went down: The Regiment, viz. the Lord Rochfords, came
not into the Army till Monday in the afternoon. The Kings Army was lodged on
Saturday night, about Cro^reds and Edgeco^, some 6 or 7 miles from Kenyton; And
having, no doubt, got intelligence that part of our Army, and Artillery, with a
great part of our Ammunition was behind us, they thought they could not have a
better opportunity to fight with our Army, esp^cially if they could get the
advantage of the hill before us, it being a very high and steep assent, which
if they were put to the worst might serve them for a Retreat, as it did, it
being that which saved them, their Carriages, and the Colors of their
Regiments of foot that ran away; for of those that fought it out, we took most
of them, excepting only those two Regiments that stood it out till night, and
went off with their horse in an orderly way. The enemy having resolved to give
us Battle, and no whit doubting of the Victory, they being more then we were,
both in horse and foot (a considerable Brigado of our Army being behind) and
having a great opinion of the resolution of their Soldiers, wherein they were
partly deceived, and partly not, as it happened also on our side: They returned
back toward Edgehill, and made all possible speed to gain the hill before us
(which they did, by reason that his Excellency had not timely intelligence of
their design, otherwise we were much nearer the hill, and might have been
possessed of it before them) And by that time our Army was drawn out of the
Town about a mile and half toward the hill, the Dragooners, and some of the
enemies Foot were coming down the hill; Their horse having gotten down most of
them on their right hand, and placed themselves in a fair Meadow, at the bottom
of the hill; Their Cannon and Ammunition, with the Rere of their foot, were
something long ere they came down. And if we had charged them before their
Cannon and all their Foot were come down, we might have had a great advantage:
but they got all down in^o the Meadow at the foot of the hill, and there drew
up their Army very handsomely, their horse being on their right Wing for the
most part, and their Dragooners, and some few Troops of horse on their left
Wing; some of their prisoners said they had four Regiments of horse on that
wing also; but I could never speak with any of our Army, that either saw any
such number of horse, or could tell what they did, unless they went directly
to Keynton, to plunder the Carriages without charging our Army at all.

For our Army, it was drawn up upon a little rising ground, and being amongst
the horse, I could not well discern how the foot were drawn up; only I know
they were most of them a good space behind the horse, when we began to charge:
but for the horse, there were three Regiments on the right Wing of our Army,
viz. The Lord Generals Regiment, commanded by Sir Philip Stapleton; Sir
William Belfores Regiment, Lieutenant General of the horse; and the Lord
Fieldings Regiment, which stood behind the other two, in the way of reserve.

On the right Wing of our Army, was Sir James Ramsey, with some 24 Troops, for
many of our Troops were not in the Field that d^y. The Armies being thus placed
one against another with no great odds of wind or ground (but what there was
of wind the enemies had it, the ground b^ing reasonable indifferent on both
sides) after many shot of Cannon, which did very little hurt amongst us, and
very much amongst them, their foot advancing for the most part against our
right Wing, and their horse against the left Wing of our army. Their horse had
the better of our horse that were on our left Wing, and routing them, drove
them back upon our foot, and amongst the rest, upon Colonel Hollis his
Regiment, which was in the Rere, and they brake through it, yet they ran not
away, nor seemed to be at all dismayed at it; but four other Regiments ran
away, and fought not at all, and many of them cast away their Colors, and so
the enemy took them np, having scarce got so much as one Color or Cornet of
those Regiments or Troops that fought, whereas all the Colors that we got from
them, and the Kings Standard, which we had a long time in our possession, were
taken out of the midst of their best Regiments that fought it out very
resolutely: Our left Wing being thus put to the worst, the day was very
desperate on our side; and had not God clearly fought for us, we had lost it;
for had the enemies horse when they had routed the left Wing, fallen upon the
Rere of our right Wing, in all probability the army had been wholly defeated:
But they made directly to the Town, and there falling upon our Carriages, most
barbarously massacred a number of poor Waggoners and Carters that had no arms
to defend themselves, and so fell to pillaging and pursuing those that ran
away, so long, till they met with Colonel Hampden, who with the other Brigado
of the Army (which came with the Artillery and Ammunition which was behind)
was by this time come near to Keynton, and the enemies Troops falling upon him
as they pursued our men that ran away, he gave them a stop, and discharging
five pieces of Cannon against them, he slew some of them; whereupon they
returned in some fear and disorder: But when they came back into the Field,
they found all their Infantry, excepting two Regiments, cut in pieces or
defeated and run away; for it pleased God to put such courage into four or five
of our Regiments of foot, and two Regiments of horse, the Lord Generals,
commanded by Sir Philip Stapleton, and Sir William Belfores, that they defeated
all their Regiments of foot, except two. Sir William Belfores Regiment of horse
charged a Regiment of the enemies foot, before any foot came up to assist him,
and breaking into it, cut most of it off; and after, by the assistance of some
of our foot, he defeated another Regiment, and so we got up to the greatest
part of the enemies Ordnance, and took them, cutting off the Geers of the
horses that drew them, and killing the Gunners under the Carriages, but were
forced to leave them without any to guard them, by reason we were fain to make
good the day against seseverall Regiments of foot that still fought with a
great deal of resolution; especially that which was of the Kings Guard, where
his Standard was, close by which Sir William Belfores Regiment rode when they
came from taking the Ordnance; and they taking us to be their friends, and we
them some of our Company, shook hands with some of them, which was the cause
that after riding up toward the Lord Generals Regiment of horse, they gave
fire upon S. William Belfores Regiment, and discerning each other to be
firends, we joined Companies; and so with half the Lord Generals Regiment,
which his Excellency himself led up, charging the Kings Regiment, we defeated
it, took the Standard, took the General of the Kings Army, the Earl of
Lindley* and his son, and Colonel Vavasor, who was Lieutenant Colonel of that
Regiment, and killed Sir Edward Varney upon the place (who carried the
Standard) Colonel John Munroe, and diverse others: In this charge, and
generally throughout the day, the Lord Generals Troop, consisting most of
Gentlemen, carried themselves most valiantly; and had all our Troops, or our
left Wing been made of the same metal, the enemy had not made so easy an
impression into them. And what is said of my Lord Generals Troop, may most
truly, and to his high praise, be said of himself; and also that noble Earl,
the Earl of Bedford, General of the horse, for both of them rode all day,
being in the heads of the several Troops and Regiments, to give them
directions, and to bring them on upon the enemy, hazarding their persons as far
and further then any particular Soldier in the Army. By this time all the
enemies foot being dispersed and gone, excepting two Regiments, they retiring
themselves, found their Ordnance behind them without any Guard, and there they
made a stand, and made use of their Cannon, shooting diverse shot at us; at
which time our Regiment of foot began to want Powder, otherwise we had charged
them both with horse and foot, which in all probability would have utterly
ruined their Infantry, for those two Regiments were the only st^ke which they
had now left in the hedge: But partly through want of Ammunition, and partly
being tired with fighting all the day (the whole brunt of the Battle having
been sustained by two Regiments of horse, and four or five of foot) we made no
great haste to charge them, so that the enemies horse that had been pillaging
at Keynton had leisure to come about, some on one hand of us, and some on the
other, and so joined with their foot: Yet as they came back on our left hand,
Sir Philip Stapleton, with his Troop, went out to charge some 4 or 5 Troops of
them, which went away from him as fast as they could upon the spur to the rest
of their Company, and their foot that stood by their Ordnance, most of the
enemies horse being gathered to their foot, most of our horse also gathered to
our foot, and so we stood horse and foot one against the other till it was
night. Our Army being thus possessed of the ground that the enemy chose to
fight upon, stood there all night; the enemy having withdrawn their Army to the
top of the hill for more security to themselves, where they made great fires
all the night long, whilst we in the mean time drew back some of our own
Ordnance, which they had once in their possession, and some of theirs which
they had left behind.

The next morning, a little before it was light, we drew back our Army toward
the Town to our other Brigadoe and Artillary and Ammunition that was come and
lodged there, and the enemy drew out their horse in the morning upon the side
of the hill, where staying till toward night, whilst their foot was retyring
behind the hill and marching away, at length a little before night, their
horse also marched away; and about an hour after, our horse also marched
toward their Quarters, the Foot and some horse staying all night in their
Quarters, in and before Keynton; and the next day the whole Army both horse
and foot marched toward Warwick to refresh themselves; instead of which, if
they had marched toward Banbury, they would have found more victuals, and
had in all probabilities dispersed all the foot of the Kings Army, and taken
his Canon and Carriages, and sent his horse farther off to plunder, whereas
now because we did not follovv them though they quitted the field to us which
we fought on, and left their quarter before us the next day, yet they begin to
question who had the day: It is true, there were Colors and Canon taken on
both sides, without any great difference in the numbers, but for the number and
quality of men slain and hurt, it is verily believed, they lost four times as
many at the least as we did, and in saying four times as many, I am confident
I speak much below the truth. There were slain on their side the Earl of
Lindsey General of their Army, the Lord Aubigney brother to the Duke of
Richmond, Sir Edward Verny Colonel, John Mourse and diverse other gentlemen and
Commanders, and very many hurt. Of our side were slain the Lord St. John,
Colonel Charles Essex, Lievtenant-Colonell Ramsey, and none other of note,
either killed or dangerously hurt that I can hear of; they acknovvledge that
they lost 1200 men, but it is thought they lost 2000: and whereas they report
we lost diverse thousands, where one man judges that we lost 400, ten men
are of opinion that we lost not 200 Soldiers, besides the poor Waggoners and
Carters.

A LETTER, Purporting the true relation of the Skirmish at Worcester.
SIR,
I Would not have troubled you with the relation of the fight that happened
betwixt our Troops and those under the condust of Prince Rupert near Worcester
so long after the action, but that I understand you have still many false
reports concerning it at London, to the disadvantage of the public and of
particular persons: And though I shall not undertake (nor is it possible for any
one man) to give an exact account of all particulars, yet so far forth as I
shall make a relation of the business I shall make a true one according to that
which I either saw my self or received by credible information from others.

He that commanded in chief in this action was Colonel Brown, who being at
Alcester with his Regiment of Dragoones and two Troops of Horse, under the
command of Captain Nathaniell, and Captain John Fiennes, he went to my Lord
General, and as it should seem suggested to his Excellency that with addition
of some more Horse, he might do some service in surrounding the City of
Worcester, before his Excellency came thither with his Army, and in keeping all
supplies from going into the Town, and those Troops from going out that were
already in it. So Colonel Sands with his Regiment of horse, and three Troops
more being sent to Colonel Brown to Alcester, (though they had marched ten
miles that day) yet they were permitted only to refresh themselves an hour or
two, and to give their horses a little hay in a meddow
