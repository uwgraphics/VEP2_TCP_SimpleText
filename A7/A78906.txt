His Majesty's Message to the House of Commons, February 7. 1641
HIs Majesty taking notice of a Speech, pretending in the Title to have been
delivered by Mr Pym in a Conference, and printed by Order of the House of
Commons, in which it is affirmed, That since the stop upon the Ports against
all Irish Papists by both Houses, many of the chief Commanders, now in the head
of the Rebels, have been suffered to pass by His Majesty's immediate Warrant;
And being very certain of having used extreme Caution in the granting of
Passeports into Ireland; So that He conceives, either this Paper not to have
been so delivered and printed as it pretends, or this House to have received
some misinformation;

His Majesty would be resolved, Whether this Speech were so delivered and
Printed, and if it were, would have this House to review upon what Informations
that particular was grounded, that either that may be found upon re-examination
to have been false, and both this House and His Majesty injured by it; Or that
His Majesty may know by what means, and by whose fault, His Authority has
been so highly abused, as to be made to conduce to the assistance of that
Rebellion, which He so much detests and abhors, and that He may see Himself
fully vindicated from all reflections of the least suspicion of that kind.



Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill. 1641.
