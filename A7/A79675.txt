A FORM of PRAYER to be Used next after the General Thanksgiving, in all
Churches and Chapels within the Cities of London and Westminster, and elsewhere
within the Bills of Mortality, immediately after His Majesty's Return; and to
be Continued for a Fortnight.
O Most Gracious God, who, of thy infinite Goodness, have preserved our
Sovereign Lord the King from many Dangers abroad, and brought him back to us in
Safety with Honor and Renown, having made him the happy Instrument of
Restoring Peace to many Nations; We beseech thee to fill our hearts with
unfeigned thankfulness for so great Blessings. Give us grace to make a right
and pious Use of them: Lest thy Judgments, we have so long deserved, should yet
fall upon us. Continue, we pray thee, his Sacred Person under the watchful Care
of the same good Providence. Protect him from the Treachery and Violence of
Evil Men. Finish, O Lord, and Establish, in thy good time, the great Work thou
have begun by him. Grant, that under him, we may long enjoy the blessed fruits
of Peace, and true Religion; and that Destructions may come to a perpetual End:
that Truth, Righteousness and Mercy may flourish in all the Earth, to the glory
of thy great Name, through Jesus Christ our blessed Savior and Redeemer.

Amen.
FINIS.
