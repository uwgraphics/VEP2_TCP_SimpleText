A sweet and pleasant Sonet, entitled: My mind to me a kingdom is.
To the tune of, In Creet, etc,


My mind to me a Kingdom is,
such perfect joys therein I find,
It far exceeds all earthly bliss,
that world affords, or grows by kind:
Though much I want that most men have,
Yet does my mind forbid me crave.
Content I live, this is my stay,
I seek no more then may suffice,
I press to bear no haughty sway,
look what I lack my mind supplies:
Lo, thus I triumph like a King.
Content with that my mind does bring.
I see how plenty surfets often,
and hasty climbers often do fall,
I see how those that sit aloft,
mishap does threaten most of all,
They get, they toil, they spend with care,
Such care my mind could never bear.
I laugh not at another loss,
I grudge not at another gain,
No wordly wave my mind can toss,
I brook that is another bane:
I fear no foe, I scorn no friend,
I dread no death, I fear no end.
Some have too much, yet still they crave,
I little have, yet seek no more,
They are but poor, though much they have,
And I am rich with little store,
They poor, I rich, they beg, I give,
They lack, I lend, they pine, I live.
My wealth is health and perfect ease,
my conscience clear, my chief defense*
I never seek by bribes to please,
nor by desert to give offense:
Lo thus I live, thus will I die,
Would all did so as well as I.
No princely pomp, no wealthy store,
no force to get the victory,
No wily wit to salve a sore,
no shape to win a Lovers eye,
To none of these I yield as thrall,
For why my mind despises all.
I joy not at an earthly bliss,
I weigh not Cresus wealth a straw,
For Care, I care not what it is,
I fear not Fortunes fatal law:
My mind is such as may not move,
For beauty bright or force of love:
I wish not what I have at will,
I wander not to seek for more,
I like the plain, I clime no hill,
in greatest storm I sit on shore,
And laugh at those that toil in vain,
To get that must be lost again.
I kiss not were I wish to kill,
I feign no love where most I hate,
I break no sleep to win my will,
I wait not at the mighties gate,
I scorn no poor, I fear no rich,
I feel no want, nor have too much.
The Court, ne Cart, I like, ne loath,
extremes are counted worst of all,
The golden mean betwixt them both,
both farest sit, and fears no fall:
This is my choice, for why I find,
No wealth is like a quiet mind.
FINIS.
