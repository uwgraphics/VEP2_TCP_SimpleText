To the Right Honorable the Lord President BRADSHAVV.
My LORD,
SOme men meanly qualified have adventured Dedications of mean Pieces unto
Princes; but my impudence, I fear, transcends theirs; for indeed it would
better become me with a Rope about my neck to dedicate my self to your Justice,
then this piece to your Patronage: My Lord, I have deserved death, but you know
my retractations; and if acknowledgements of my former offenses against this
State may make any expiation, I beseech you to believe I have bin ingenuous: I
present this to your Lordship, not to inform you, but to disabuse the people,
for more of these Conspiracies then is revealed here is already known to you:
but since men falling off from a party, create enmities, and dangers to
themselves, as I now expect to do, I cannot propose a more undanted pattern to
my self, or desire a more Heroical Patron to this Pamphlet then your self. You
my Lord, have dared in a strange time to judge between a King and a Kingdom;
and like a wise Solomon you have (and yet without division) divided the true
living child to its own Mother. You have gone on gallantly, and not like those
other scorned Judges, who now appear upon the Bench again, but durst not sit
there when the grand Case was to be decided; those that hated you, now fear
you, and those that feared you before, now begin to honor you, and believe you
could not have gone on so, but that you are invisibly prompted by a more then
ordinary Power. You are now fixed in an Orb above mean enmities, and we that are
below, fear our enemies the less for your sake. In this I flatter not, and even
this blunt story I hope will testify me to be a man free from adulation: for
here I spare no man, nor party that falls within my Verge; Here most parties
may see themselves, how they are packt and shuffled for an after game, which is
speedily to be played; the Royalist, and the Presbyterian both may here see, if
they please, that the Cards are to be dealt by other hands then theirs. See
what complottings, what hurliburlies, what heart-burnings here are, whilst some
fond men make it their main hope, and ambition to undo themselves; because,
forsooth, they will needs take their enemies for friends, and friends for
enemies. Now the Spanish are landing here, the French there: now the Scots have
fifty thousand men to affront Cromwell, and yet can spare Massey ten thousand
more to take in Carlisle. Vt populi folia omni vento, sic populi corda hinc
inde omni rumore moventur. In the mean time, my Lord, God blesses your pious
Cause, and your pious Cause procures you a gallant Armado at Sea, a victorious
Army in Ireland, another as numerous in Scotland, a powerful Militia remaining
besides in England; neither is money, nor courage, nor unanimity wanting to all
these. Your enemies now have nothing to hope, but that confidence in your
wealth and strength will undo you: O herein let your evil counselors be made
good ones to you. But soft, I become a trespassor upon your precious time, and
I should beg pardon both for this fancy Dedication, and rude Excursion, but
that I have pardon to beg for greater offenses, and am not thereof as yet
sufficiently assured. Only if that pardon may not be granted to words, let it
be obtained by the constant future good comportment of

My Lord, The most real Servant of Englands Law, and particularly your Honors.
A. B. NOVICE.

Reader,
THou distrustest perhaps, this piece, which is now presented to thy view, that
it is a Romance, or a mere figment. But I assure thee it is not so, for some of
our greatest Statesmen know the reality of these things already: and thou shall
ere long, by another more serious tract, which is now in fitting for the
Press, receive a fuller confirmation. I will not call this an history, but a
miscellany rather of some passages historically written, and it chiefly
contains Scotch and French Transactions, together with the eminent
inter-actings of the Pontifical party; and sometimes I have made mention of my
self, whom I hope thou shall be better acquainted with hereafter. In the mean
time know, that I am of a sanguine complexion, and though I can in some degree
pity the miseries of the Cavaleer, and the knavery of the Presbyter, yet I am
more apt to laugh at their fooleries with Democritus, then to weep for them
with Heraclitus. I have been likewise at Rome, but could never swallow down all
her Fopperies; amongst all the miracles there, I never thought any of them was
a true one, but that wise men should believe in their truth. Yet I was much
bewitched with the pomp of that religion, and had died a zealous votary for it,
but that God by an Incomparable Mr G. of C. C. in Oxf.
Divine sent a spirit of conversion upon me. And now I hope to take the
Ministry upon me, and so draw others to God, by showing them the strange work
of God upon my self. Some will object against my style, as was once against
Erasmus, and say, that it is more vain then becomes a Divine, and more
satyricall then becomes a Christian: but consider the subject, and thou will
say it is not unsuitable thereunto.

Siquis est qui dictum in se inclementius
Existimavit esse, sic existimet.
I look for no favor at any parties hands, the whole world has no engagement
upon me, so highly am I independent; yet if any moderate man shall be offended
at my lightness, or tartness, to Him I will submit, and promise amends in my
next more secret, and more solid discourse. Read therefore, and censure, but
rest confident, what thou read here is true, and that I have written it
partly to exonerate my conscience of the guilt of an Incendiary, contracted
upon my soul for some years last past, and partly to make some amends to my
poor dilacerated Country. I am as fearful of poisoning the world with untruth
as any man can be, I know well.

Reader, In the last page of this book but one, in line 31. for Friends, read
Feuds.

FOr the indagation and redemption of Truth out of many dark counsels, black
enterprises and fatal accidents, (that so through the fair perspective of my
experience, and knowledge, others may attain to the discovery of things, that
now lie buried in deep vaults, below the guesses of ordinary men) I shall begin
a relation about the wars ending, at least when the same drew toward its
declension.

The late King was for his obstinacy by some judged constant; but indeed he was
one, that if he hated any man, he would never be perfectly reconciled to him,
nor moved by his persuasions, though never so convincing: and yet if he loved
any men (as he did sometimes for his own ends) he was almost servile to them,
and for their sakes he would be almost commanded to forsake his own judgment,
and knowledge. He was of himself fierce-harted, and subtil-headed, as his
enemies felt soarly, when he was left to himself: but to his flatterers, viz.
his only friends, when they pleased to charm him, he was weak both in
resolution, and judgment. So absolute a Master he was nevertheless Rustum
omnium legum privata principis voluntas.
of dissimulation, that doubtless therein he far exceeded Tiberius, and by this
art he could, when he saw occasion, close with the most mortal of his enemies,
and cast off the most meritorious of all his friends: and this he often did
when the face of his affairs changed, and required such a change in him. And
though there were some (such as his Queen, and some others who in his opinion
could not have several interests from his) that did wonderfully awe him, and
could drive him always from his best resolutions: yet there were none at all,
whom he could not dissemble withal, and reject, if he once suspected them
contrarily interessed to his ultimate ends of Tyranny; hence it is that the
world is so strangely divided about him: some men that knew him only by his
favors, and viewed him at a distance, canonize him for a Saint, and Martyr,
and scarce allow him second to Jesus Christ: whilst others who were disobliged
by him, and viewed him at a nearer distance, damn him with Judas, charge him
with the blood of 500000. Christians, of poisoning his Father, of betraying
those of his own religion in France, and Germany, and of being guilty of
perjury, and persidie beyond all example. This Charles, when Oxford began to
grow unsafe, and he saw he was put to his last refuge, knew it concerned him to
perform his masterpiece, which was in plain downright terms, to decieve his
own deceiving friends, by deserting them: and betaking himself to his first
professing enemies, the Scots, whom he judged of all men the most notoriou^,
and everlastingly perfidious. He fretted belike, and was stung to the quick,
(his intelectuals being amused, and not so well able to order him) that he must
now act a Kings part more Scenically, and not with that rigor as he was wont:
but according to the instructions of his old Court moralls, he held any
delusive plot honorable that might accomplish his designs, and so without
further reluctance he thought to play the pawn of a King, so he might give
check at last to the English victorious Liberty. He went not to the Scots, as
imagining them more true or generous then the English: but because he knew the
Scots were more easy to be wrought upon, and divided from their fellow
Covenanters, then the English. Besides, the peevish humor of revenge raged in
him, and this was the direct road that leads to public mischief: otherwise
being to make use of deceitful instruments for deceits sake, he would have
doubted, and feared that over reaching at last, which he found. It Is verily
thought if he had cast himself upon the ingenuity of the English, and not
totally lost their hearts by thus preferring the Scots before them, he might
have easily outwitted them, and that his own judgment had advertised him so,
had not ends of further imbroyling his three Kingdoms, and effunding more
humane blood overswayed him.

Howsoever, we the more active Catholics of his party (not then privy to the
secret negotiations betwixt him and Montril) thought his deserved ruin was at
that time inevitably approaching: and being left not to the wide world, but to
the narrow limits of beguirt Garrisons, we immediately consulted what course
was to be steered. Jam res ad restim rediit, we saw a shrewd declension
attending us, and we saw as apparent a tergiversation, or neutrality amongst
our selves, after we had felt one an others pulses. This was plain to us, we
could no longer serve our Catholic ends, by serving a Prince so far tottering,
and who made nothing less then Religion, nothing more then Tyranny his last
object, and design.

Now might you have seen whole swarms of us, creeping and crowding into those
places which most befreinded us, either for privacy or opportunity; Oxford and
most of the other unreduced Garrisons know this well enough.

At Oxford especially there was diverse other Factions besides ours; and these,
together with the wants of the Common soldiers, who now had neither pay nor
due supply, put all men upon new thoughts, and deliberations. Rupert had no
small boys among the General Officers that sided with him, and these ravingly
cursed their fortunes, that thus had brought them to serve a Runaway. On the
other side the grave privy Counselors, Ruperts Antagonists, though they ranted
not so high, yet showed a great repining, that his sacred Majesty (a pure
blasphemy) should thus leave them in the sudds. Also amongst these there were
diverse other pitiful subdivisions: as amongst the Cottingtonians and
Hoptonians: The Welsh were derided as lowsy Rogues, the Irish Rebels hooted at
for perpetual Cowards; Ruperts for Robbers; all without pay; none without
plunder; the Hoptonians, they were the white boys.

But let us speak ad rem; The Sir John Kempsfeild an eminent Commander of the
Horse, who never charged without a Crucifix on his breast.
Kempfieldians, a faction, of which we are able, and will now give account and
relation; it being almost the subjectum of this discourse.

True, we made not Sir John our Oracle, or Dictator, yet we now think it
convenient to let our Catholic Party march under his Which had for his

jealousy.
Coroner: we are not unknowing of, nor unknown to greater Agents for his
holiness, then was he, or any that now is in the City and Army; though I
confess his merit is not small, and his respect greater in Rome, where I last
left him in his Pilgrims weeds, ready to be dispatched away for an Irish
employment.

England, should I dare publicly to speak all I know of the persons of some
men, and their now black and dangerous actings and employments for the
restoring of (not Charles, but) -- to his ancient bloody Tyranny: Suffice thee
my Reader, thou shall know all in time, it must first be my work at the
Council Table; where I shall (God willing) bring in a horrible large Catalogue
of more pernitiously damnably dangerous Actors, then was in the year 1605. in
that infernal Powder plot: If ever there were such a fry of Devils in men's
shapes, yea in ministers too, crept in to undermine a People and State, judge
you, by that time I shall have discharged the duty of a Sound Convert, and a
Native English Gentleman, to those Patriots and worthies whom God by most
miraculous providence has owned to be our undoubtedly lawful Governors: But,

Non omnes volucres Auceps, non omnia lustra
Venator spoliat --
I shall do my uttermost.

Return we to see what the Catholic faction are a brewing: Each had their
Conventicle; the Cavaleer Buzzard, I may say Bayard, had their fools In Oxford,
a place so fitly called, for Newes-meeters.
Corner, and we our The Catholic savern so generally called.
Knaves: Some of us resolve one thing, some another, all agree in this, we must
desert the Royal Cause, and (as we could) get in with the Presbyter: One (of
such a quality) cries out, I Will compound and go home, fight Dog, fight Bear;
Another, I Will take the Covenant and turn Presbyter; But this last sort had
carried themselves mere Amphibiums in religion, and not openly known for real
Catholics; but a part of us, of more hot spirits, not of the laity, but of
some several orders, did conclude it our best way, not only clearly to
relinquish our party, but to engratiate our selves with the Enemy* by acting
some handsome piece of treachery, that in time we might revive the old
Catholic Cause, by more able and apt Instruments then by a company of staring
hare-brain'd Cavaleers; who are not able to act so powerfully as those we
desired to join Interest with, nor indeed (as Solomon speaks) when they had a
price in their hands, were they able to get wisdom.

And for this Conjunction were there very plausible reasons laid down: Say
some, Had the King prevailed against the People; the fawning Bishops, to uphold
their usurped power, would have stamped any Religion upon their Proselyte King,
that they again might have vanted in their Lawn sleeves and stolen Pedo
Episcopali grande inest mysterium.
Miters; the number of us Catholics being in England much inconsiderable to
that of Heretics, and the King not pertinacious, nor a jot solicitous of any
Religion which diminishes the least tittle of his monarchical prerogative: In
this huddle of opinions, up starts a Dominican, Fa: Car by name, now in Calice;
but then known by the degree of Quartermaster Lawrence, born at Hexam in
Northumberland; (and seriously in my opinion he spoke, (as we say) veteratorie,
like an old Fox:) Truly (said he) I can with better conscience and more liberty
fight for, and converse with the Scot, then the Infidel; the Presbyter then the
Cavaleer: I have more hopes of him for a Convert which is of some religion,
then of him which is of none; and so far (quoth he) may we call the King, but
his Party especially, true Cavaleers: And, if we truly consider some points of
the Religion, and (the rigidness I may not call it, but) the zeal of the
Presbyter, with its Discipline and Polity; you shall find (as in several
points I could plainly hold it forth and demonstrate the parallel) that there
is no Religion in the world does so nearly consent with the true Catholic
faith, as does the Scotch Presbytery; though I do not say it be super veritate
fundatum, as ours is: Besides, said he, I might urge the great hopes and
probability of a Presbyters conversion; for unde aliquis flatus ostenditur vela
dat; he is subject to turn with every wind, no men in the world being of more
unstable minds, and Witness the common-pr-Directory.

but he will) both the Leslies and the generality of the Brethren will make good;

it is but a Volaticum Iusjurandum, sealed with butter; which they will only make
use of to pick a quarrel with England, when they have need of one, and are out
of employment, which the French will soon find a way to put them upon, when

Runaway shall have once given an assurance of his real conversion to the
Catholic faith; and then shall you see the Presbyter the only staff we must
lean upon: But for the Cavaleers (said he) they are Duri Capitones, a company
of foolish obstinate Asses: our hardest task will be to yoke these Disparibus

us and the * other.

These and many other arguments being laid down by this Father, it was
instantly desired (by one known at that time generally, by no other name but
Captain Saint John's, and yet well known somewhere now in this Country, of the
order of Sunt qui Jesu nomen praetexentes hominum animas ipsi Satanae mancipant.
Jesus, though he then walked the streets in a Chlamys) how we should speedily
dispose of our selves.

Non ad praeteritum consul valet, immo futurum: The time and season required
our consultations to be brief and pithy; and the result was, that some of the
more aged, of unactive bodies for military exploits, but of busy spirits to set
things in combustion, and to augment feuds, should be left behind, and the rest
should inveigle as many as they possibly could of the Cavalry to fall off;
which to effect, some of our younger Novices dispersed themselves to several
petite Garrisons, which were not reduced to the States obedience, yea verily to
almost all the Royal unsurrendred Garrisons in England; for really we had
enough in Oxford to furnish them, besides what before they were stored with;
and there were few without Jesuits and priests.
some, some with many, I dare affirm none without any.

Nor was it long 'ere the fruits of our Projects did appear, As in the great
falling off of many, both Soldiers and men of eminency, which we could in any
way make stoop to the lure of Presbytery, and swallow the goodly godly
Covenant: more particularly, that almost total defection of the Wallingford
Horse, led off by one Beard and Pawlet, in which I my self had an hand:

But I shall deviate too much in instancing on the several successes of our
plots, nor must I be too particular, lest the Presbyterian chance to see day at
a little hole, and espy me through a cranny: My resolution and aim is to let
thee (Reader) now understand the Cause of our thus, and then seeming
compliances with that predominant Faction.

First, for Sir Jo. Pr. which then indeed ruled the roast, we were better able
in any notion to disguise our selves under their discipline then any other; for
whosoever would (forsooth) but down with the blessed Covenant, must be an
honest man, let him be what he would; which we could very lawfully do, and did,
being not unprovided of greater helps then Dispensations, seeing it was our
only way left to revive (as I have said) the Catholic quarrel upon better
terms, by better and more violently rigid Instruments.

Secondly, we knew, (and I am certain it was at that time the Roman sense) that
that Polypicaput, I mean that great jolly Turn coat, the little Queens husband,
being run away from himself and her (according to our judgment of his easy
nature) might (for ought we know) have been soon brought to have sung a
Palinodie, have veiled or turned as now his son assayes and crouches (at least
pretends) to do; and then we durst have warranted the case, that we would have
reduced England into a more hideous pickle then all they had hitherto sustained
in their quondam broyls; for had he turned Covenanteere, which our party did
assay by all inventible means to bring him to; and which he would have done,
had not the Monarchick-Lawn sleeves infused thoughts in him of a restoration
to his Arbitrary power, that he must be aut Caesar, aut Nullus, as of himself
he was resolved to be Rex aut Asinus; or had that Spanish (I think I might say,
L. Say.
Sayish) Treaty in the I Will of Wight but taken effect; two months had never
expired, before most of our chief enemies (this Commonwealths now Governors
best Patriots and Defendors) had all lain weltering in their own blood: And
then (as now it is) Presbyter, Cavaleer, yea, and Catholic too, having joined
interests, what must our next work have been? or what do thou think it now
will be when it is so?

Reader, Thy Genius (if thou art not made of wood) must necessarily prompt thee
to the conceit of no less then a Massacre, and universal ruin of all the
Antagonists and Opposers of those Hot-spurs; those three brethren in iniquity,
who though they are so diametrically opposite to each other in principles and
opinion, will out of pure malice (caused by their several bloody, ambitious
aspirings) join tails together to set on fire the fabric of a most polite
Government, and devast the people whom God will not suffer them to tyranize
over.

Well, Imagine this had been done, conceit this now a doing, now done: Suppose
we then London plundered (for what wild man thinks, or expects less from three
such mad enemies) the People and Country laid waste, desolate, and invassalled,
all their enemies throats cut, our then no little Queen with her French, and
Jermain lusty train returned (which was granted us by Treaty) all done, all
undone, and none left in the Scene but these three; who goes to the pot next?
No question, the Royalists and Catholics will be so conscientious, as strictly
to observe and keep each Punctilio of the pretty Scotch Covenant; no doubt but
the Catholics, and the Presbyters will thank the Cavaleer for his good
service, and restore his King with his Common Prayer and Bishops, though he
will be neither Papist nor Covenanter; if not thus, then without dispute,
Presbyter and Cavalier must both turn Catholics; and like enough so; I pray
thee Reader, do then but consider how soon we could, or can (when time serves)
set the Cavaleer and Presbyter together by the ears. We are not ignorant of the
old Adage, Publicae res privatis crescunt inimicitiis; which thus we will then
construe, When thieves fall out, we true men come by our goods; What
block-headed Presbyter or Scot (which is all one) knows not the Royalists to be
irreconcilable with them; whatsoever fair words, some old Court-Spaniel, or
young declared King may give them, in hope of future opportunity for revenge,
or a Crown; Prius lupus ovem ducat uxorem Cats and Dogs will sooner be
cater-cosins then they; Lites praeterritae facile fiunt renovatae; if not, we
will put in two hundred thousand pound to the bargain;

Quis tam distantes nodus conjunget amores? Well, now they be at it, now they
fight; or grant that they had done so; or that hereafter we see them to it
amonst themselves; which side do you think (in plain earnest) shall we
Catholics take? it is an even wager; truly neither, and yet both, if any; the
weakest, till they have confounded each other. I could give a shrewd hint of
Orders we received in the Colchestrian and Kentish.
Cambo-Brittanian Expeditions; in a word, our design is to put them to that
hard task, Penelopis telam texere, to do, and undo, till they have left nothing
undone for us; But of this more in its place.

I could here make an happy digression, yet pertinent enough, and a large one
if I would (but I will not) only to show the people (if they would but
understand and hear reason) the powerful hand of All-ruling Providence,
perspicuously demonstrating it self in their redemption and deliverance, out of
the jaws, and from the Snares and Gins laid for them by these three Enemies;
God himself owning This Cause by no less then miraculous successes and
unparalled vicissitudes and alterations, and which he has given in
Commission unto our most puissant and renouned Governors as his instruments of
a most splendid Reformation, and our happily achieved Liberty, which though it
has cost so much, and the completing thereof must necessarily require
something more; let us remember, that libertas potior est Metallis, and that we
were all once but mere slaves, bound in our own golden chains, under an
Arbitrary-ruling one man, a self willed and wildly-Tyrannizing Monarch;

Non been pro fulvo libertas venditur auro. That I may recover this large
deviation,

I must now return back to Oxford, where (as I told thee) I for my part was
employed; and now behold it is surrendered, and I with my Comrades left to
dispose of our selves, where we had best hopes to create new distempers: Now
the Oxford Articles were our only Guardians, and (like our black Master) our
time being short we resolve to ply our business; and truly we have not been
idle, what with tawing and clawing the the Cavalier and Presbyter, as you will
perceive ere we conclude this Relation.

And (Reader, I ask you) in what mode do you think now to meet with men of my
Orders? We have not only changed the habits of our minds but of our bodies
also: -- Our minds; for he that even now was upsie Cavaleer, high Royalists; he
that was nothing but to make the King a Pope, that so the Pope might be made
King, dances now after no Music so merrily as the Northern Bagpipe; the
profane Dammees left off, and nothing but the Holy Keevenaunt is heard in our
mouths. -- For our bodies, Proteus is less then a Fiction to us; He that
erewhile was a Commander in a ranting equipage, is now slinked into a Cobling
Stall, or Weavers Loome, or Tapsters Apron, or Coach-mans Box, or Beggars
Weeds, or Horsemans Frock, or Serving-mans Livery, or Tailors Shop, or a
Pulpit-thumping Presbyters Iippo; into what not? It is not unknown what trade
we drive beyond sea, when no trade comes amiss to us; I vow to God, I my self
have known one single Student in Rome to be his crafts-master in four several
Mysteries, and, though an Italian born, Speaking and Writing as fluent and
candid English, as the best English Orator; but Hoc dubit at fortasse aliquis,
nisi pagina praesens idfirma ratione probet; To make this good, our Governors,
the States of this Commonwealth (if they will deign to hear me now their true
servant; for they may not in this case, in utramvis aurem dormire) shall
eftsoon be able to cull out many a Sheep clothed Woof from their Stations,
Stalls, Loomes, Aprons, Weeds, Livories, Shops, yea, and Buff coats; what say
you to Pulpits too? Let not poor England (now like a Bird (Ah me) pursued by
several fierce-flying Falcons, and too too near the intended hard gripes of
their cruelly-sharp tallons) either out of a dull and drowzie sottishness, or a
fantastical humor of contradiction, suppose that I speak what I know not; if
I should tell them I can, and (now being about to do it) will (but privately
before Authority) produce a Catalogue of Catholics, (Fathers, so we will be
called) men of several Orders, and others that are Natives, who for the most
part have changed their Habitations, gone into remote Counties, and duly go to
Church too; of an incredible number now living in this Commonwealth under
several Notions, which I my self can Digito monstrare, point at with a dry
finger: I tell thee in general, There is scarce a Town or City but in some few
miles of it I can furnish thee Reader (to thy amazement be it spoken, and to
occasion thee to return devout thanks to God) with some, who have lived in
England these 6. 10, 20. Jo. B. of Ne. in Es.
40. 50. 5. 4. 3. one and two years unknown, unsuspected, but taken for clear
contrary men: let them avoid me if they can, their errand by this time is done.

Reader, think me not mad: indeed I have been, but am now come again to my
self: But to what (wot ye) was my mind bent in these Hurly-burlies? to play
the Presbyter: and whither went I (trow ye) after Oxfords rendition? even to my
guide Scots Brethren the Covenanters, but yet not presently into Scotland: my
colleagues and I, which were three (and indeed made three degrees of Malus,
pejor, pessimus.
comparison, one a Bre, of Oxf. Sh.
Priest, my self a Novice, the third (a Catesh --
prodigious name) as eminent a Jesuit as England has fathered these many
years) had determined if at that time there had been Halcionian quiet times at
Sea (as there were not for us guilty souls) to have passed directly over; but,
diverted twixt fear of detection and zeal of working more good (upon the
Presbyter) for the Catholic cause, we wheeled about and got us to Newcastle;
where we found the Gentleman that ran away from Oxford playing at Goffe.
Stowball with his Sodalitia, his guide chapmen; who (as emptitious as he was)
though they valued him not, because sese inscendi passus est, he suffered
himself to be fool ridden, yet knew well enough how to overvalue him.

Here in this Gally-maufrey of people and opinions (Cavies and Presbyters) we
could not in a weeks time devise in what shape to walk in: True, we had
resolved to be All-Presbyter; but the state of present affairs so ordered it,
that we must as yet be nothing but Cavaleers; for fear they (of whom there was
no small concourse) as some of them could, might detect us what we were, maugre
our shifting and sniffling pretensions to the contrary; And so once again we
did Dextrae conjungere Dextram fall in with the Cavaleer: For so great a resort
was there of shabby raggamuffian Gentlemen, and some, of our old Oxford
acquaintance, that we could not in civility (^ne eke in policy) shake them off:
and so expert are we in those frauds Daemoniacae, that (where occasion
presented it self) we became any thing to any man, (like the black Prince of
the air in his witchery Apparitions, or his white Emblem the Miller, who when

compliance with all, that we might but tempt some; which indeed was easily then
to be done with the poor Cavies, who were Cera tractabiliores pliable to any
advice that favored of the least revenge; but truly are Asini Homines mere
Asses: Here did we Cretizare cum Cretense hold a candle to the Devil, prompt
them to what we thought would best serve our own turns, 'till at last we had
fitted them to be made fools by the Scots; (which at any time they can easily
do, if they will but open and declare:) Thus we laughed in our sleeves (yet
still pretended to be equal sufferers with them in the Cause Royal) which
they might easily have perceived, had not their brains been dulled by the
Devil (that egregius delusionum artifex) and totally intoxicated with the
spirits of Mandragora:

Nor had we staid long here, 'ere great numbers of the Royal Party came
flocking to the Scotch Army, in hopes of more work for the Chirurgian: which

endeavors were not wanting to exasperate all Parties by all the stratagems our
wits could devise; seriously, our fomenting had even then made the Tynder take
fire, though we could not do it till here of late; Now it is done; judge you how
near it was then brought to an head, (but what will not money do with a Scot,
(now their Catasta is in readiness;) what will not a Scot do for money? An
ingenious Monsieur (at this instant, I believe, in Scotland) at a frollick

fomentings then grew near to an head; Near indeed; Not only excepted
Delinquents unpardonable Cavaleers, but Catholics, yea known Priests and
Jesuits, we also by a general order were publicly quartered in the most
affluent and secure Towns and Villages: You will think it strange to hear me
say there was at that time (and how much more now they have, like Sampsons
foxes, joined tails) to the number of two Regiments of Catholics; nay (to my
certain knowledge) there was one meer-all-wholly-a Catholic Regiment new
raised (before the money came down from London) and reduced, under the conduct
of my Lord Synclare a Presbyterian-Papist; and this also I protest to God I can
affirm for real truth, there was not only then to be a conjunction with
Montross, but Irish Rebels to be transported, and a war with England then
resolved upon; (see what money can do) had not these policies over ballanc't
their resolutions;

First, That the world would have cried shame upon them, that they should so
soon have broken their own Covenant with the English: which they resolved to
refer to a longer time, hoping to insinuate to the world, that the English
first began with them, whenever they shall have a mind to invade, ordisturbe
our tranquillity;

Secondly, That they should more then hazard the loss of the great sum, if
they did too soon show their teeth; and not being able to pretend the least
reason that would hold water, why they should pick a quarrel with their even
now Confederates: And as cunningly also did they repel the incessant
importunities of their prisoner-King; telling him, their surrendry of him would
prove for the best, and that it should be to no other intent but to furnish
them with more plausible pretenses for a war and breath with the English
States: For indeed they well considered, that the Parliament of England could
do no less in justice upon that Capital Delinquent, then what might bear them
out in the opinion of seduced Englishmen, as a sufficient excuse for their many
peremptory, bawling, mischeivous papers and messages, which (since that) they
have interruptingly dared to trouble our State with, besides that their other
years Runaway (...); and yet still are they so impiously politic (or rather
blockishly impudent) as to make this their pretense, that what they do, is for
their guide King (and his son) whom, rather then they would have been at the
charge to have kept him till this time, I dare say they would have poisoned (in

But all this while the poor Cavaleer is hood winkt, and held in strong
suspense; neither can they imagine whether these Scotisticall Pioneers will be

Yet welfare my Lord Synclare (if there be any Scot worth the whistling after,
I am confident it is he) I cannot be oblivious of his affable deportment, and
tender sympathy he had of the conditions of some of the pitiful Renegado
gentlemen. I dare aver, I can reckon up betwixt forty and fifty heretofore
high-flying Dammee-Raunters, now in a lowzie starving condition which he
releived, and were admitted sometimes to be drunk with his gor-bellied brother
Harry, that old Court-Curr, Harbert Price, That Welsh-French Gallowpoasted
fellow Turburvil Morgan, That easy Catholic, Durham gent. Colonel Jack
Forcer, with many others, which I could name, of greater quality, who did eat
of his free quarter bread, or had perished: But O the miseries of some
Gentlemen of lower quality then these! Synclare sometimes for the great ones
would go a begging to the great beggar for a suit; but for these poor souls not
a doit but Scotch fragments: If ever any of those Gentlemen, which were then
amongst them, confide in a Scot again, I shall swear they are Cur-Spaniels, and
horribly bewitched: Amongst these latter lower sort did we three get in for
quarters; pretending as much indigency as the meanest of them, and searching
out who were Catholics amongst them, that so we might List them under a
certain Collection; which very secretly and closely we had got raised of the
Northumberland Catholic Gentlemen: Nor did we easily give credence to any
that urged himself a Catholic; for indeed that would have made our number
swell too great (the Cavies being at that time ready to turn any thing, except
Roundhead, for some money to be chirpingly drunk, and sing away sorrow;) but
many real ones indeed were found, a great company of them being crowded into a
very good quarter, at Mistress Thyrwalls house, a Catholic widow, in a mile
of Hexam in Northumberland; amongst whom was Sir Thomas Tildesly with a
tottered tail as well as the rest, who sent for Mr. Bre -- to speak with him,
whither we being come, with him found a company of lamentable Tag-rags
(outvying our disguise) going under the names of Colonels, Majors, and
Captains; some playing at Irish, some at Gleek, all at Noddy, except Sir
Thomas, who with a poor Scholar was playing at Chess; Mr Bre -- asking his
business with him; He told us, that he had been informed of our Negotiation,
and desired us to enter his List in ours; amongst whom we found some doubtful
and unknown names; which, we told him were not safe to be admitted for fear of
discovery; He assured us, they were all very faithful Royalists (which did not
please us) and wanting very much, even ready to perish with hunger and
nakedness; amongst which that Scholar, for whom Sir Thomas seemed to be very
highly solicitous: No sooner almost was he with some of the rest admitted, and
had once or twice received collections, but some of them cried Roast-meat to
their unadmitted Comrades, which truly fell out very inauspiciously for the
Catholics, worse for the Cavies; the collection stopped, and we resolved for a
dispersing march: For, near about this time was the bargain made, and hands
struck betwixt the English and the Scots, for that Old-New-Nothing; and with
him all the English both Catholic and Cavies to be surrendered prisoners upon
the sum (as justly we might) for Incendiaries. This news being soon sent us
(and in troth not too early, for it was in the nick-time) from Newcastle by
some of our Agents there, we well hoped to have had some laughing sport; for
after our flight (which was into Scotland) had they stayed a little-little
longer, the poor Cabbs had been all surprised, if not surrendered to our
Parliament Army then upon a close march; but in Edenbourgh, we had not been an
whole week, before the ragged Regiment came tottering in there, many thousand
millions strong, thicker then when they first shifted into the cleanly Scottish
Army, out of Gods blessing, yet not into the warm Sun, but a stinking cold
climate

And what can you devize these poor gentlemen can do here for subsistence?
truly it was miraculous to see the miseries they endured at the hands, and in
the sight of those unpittying hard-hearted Cannibals the Scots: nay, they did

jear at their calamities, saying, there gangs a brave English Cavaleer, whylk
fought and run away for his King, etc. Now I believe thou supposest the
Catholic also to be hard put to it here, or that (at least) he was forced to
live on the main stock; no (really,) we found friends enough here, even of our
own Order. I can assure thee (Reader) a Catholic delights in no air (besides
his own) so well as in a Presbyterian. Moreover, we here met with Monsieur
Montril the French Agent, who was then consulting with the Scotch States, about
the last Hambletonian engagement, though since they account it sinful for being
basted; with him we immediately fell into some consultation and action, as you
shall hear anon.

But O the poor Cab, his guts pay for it; there was not one of them but hunger
had taught some occupation or other to get money, and it were but enough to buy
Scotch bread: some Captains got their meat by dressing Troupers horses, not one
Scot breathing would bestow a Bawdle on an Englishman without some service done
for it; they would rather call them Lownes, and bid them get out of the
Country. The Scholar (I spoke of) he drives a trade with the College, when
instead of some subtle questions, the Master put him (as he told me) to expound
a Chapter in the Bible, which he did till he had pounded out four or five A
poor sum in Scotch money.
pund of them, and more had he had of them, but that they demanding his name,
and he telling them, they said it was a Popish name, (as I remember it was
Pawlet, or some such name) the Scholar wittily replied, we have many good
Protestants of that name in Herefordshire: after this great purchase he and one
Major Thomas Right set up a trade of making sweet powder for hair with Rice, a
trick of the Scholars, by which they lived well, and cozened the Scots very
handsomely.

But no going back was there for them, whither they could fly God knows,
themselves know not. Reader, thou must not conceive, that of all these
Gentlemen there were none which were thus distressed, but merely for their
foolishly and falsely conceited loialty, though the most part were so indeed;
certainly there were many, Homines gregorii amongst them, raskally fellows,
some Thieves, some Bankrupts, some abject Sons, some Prodigals; as the Scholar
would often make me take pity on him, when he would use to tell me,
Miserabilis fuit homuncio: He was a castaway.
that an unnatural Father, and hard Mother in Law was his Parliament; many
(like him) had several occasions that reduced them to these dilemma's of misery.

And now was there a convention of the Scots States in Parliament, which puts
the Cabs (as poor as they were) into a shrewd fright, and themselves into a
puzzle, which way they should dispose of them; for had they rudely betrayed
them into the hands of the English Army, which demanded them in the bargain
upon the sum, they had too soon displayed to the world their perfidious
dealing with the Cabs Idol; but, which is the main thing they had then
falsified with the French to whom they had engaged to sell these cattle for so
much the head, to serve in their wars against the Spaniard till such time as
they had both ripened their quarrel against the English, and then shall the
poor Cabs be brought back again, to usher on, and set a face upon the Popish
French, and Presbyterian Scottish Design, which what it is, you will here
toward the end.

The general bruit now blown over all Edinburgh was, that the great blades were
to be culled out and sent to London; but for the rest, if they would take
conditions, they should be conveyed from the hands of their enemies, and be
accommodated to serve some foreign Prince (the last is true enough, but the
other as false as a Scot) their stinking States only made an Order to this
purpose, that thereby they might give an Item to excepted persons to secure
themselves; and (as they must confess) to my knowledge they had private orders
given them, to clap themselves into a disguize, and not to walk so publicly in
the streets; and thus they show themselves Scots still with the English States,
for by thus doing they conceived they should be able to evade, if not flatly
deny any just demands agreed upon in the former paction between England and
them.

These raskally doings being thus carried on for some weeks in Hugger mugger,
and the Cavaleers having some slender allowance, they knew not from whom; at
last they all began to insinuate to them, that the Scots had picked a just
quarrel with the Roundheads, and that they should in a short time invade, upon
pretense of redeeming the even now sold Bondslave from his captivity, and bring
him (like a painted Pageant) in pomp up to London: But this poor pretense,
though politic enough to catch the credulity of the throughout gulld Cavaleer,
because opinionating ends ever by words; yet we (who ever judged of men's words
by their ends) knew the inside of the piece to be clean contrary; for, the
Scots (though they had an egging mind to have more plunder) were advisedly too
cowardly to be thus valiantly foolish, knowing the strength and resolution of
that gallant dreadful Army of England, whom they durst as well eat Peark as
look upon; though they now make some flourishes, of purpose to get some gelt
for the Son as well as the Father; and then you should see them fling him off,
and creep to an Englishmans elbowe for another confederacy.

In the mean time while things fell out very happily for our Party, the Cabs
knew nothing but what we thought fit to tell them; and they very quietly
acquiesced in our Oracles: For now was I (with my two forementioned Comerades)
employed afresh by Monsieur Montril, about such a like business as we had in
Northumberland; which was to muster all the Gentlemen we could ferret out, and
to take a strict and particular list of all that were Catholics; which we in
time effected, and delivered it to the Monsieur, who commanded us to attend him
the next day at Hally-Rood house, where D. Hambleton played Rex, and kept court
as Lord Protector and Steward in the Dotage of his Cousin: whither when we came,
and were called for to the Presence, The We all conferred in the french tongue.
Duke (a rightwary, pure Saint of Scotland, as being pretty competently
politic, abundantly zealous, and very indifferently religious) first demanded
of the Agent, whether we were such as he might dare to confide and employ in
his Masters business, we being Englishmen, and for ought I know (quoth he)
Cavaleers: they are such (replied the Monsieur) who do omnes unum studere, and
whose Characters I have received from no slender Testimony; besides, this
gentleman (pointing to Mr. Catesb --) being my old acquaintance, and a real
servant to the Flur de luis; whom (being English; and, as they are) I dare
sooner trust then any men alive, none being able to do our business with that
influence and facility they may, with their old dear acquainted Oxonions:
Gentlemen, (quoth the Duke then to us) were it not prejudicial to your selves,
as you have no reason to think, I could wish that I knew how to equal my
respects to your several qualities: But be confident, I am overjoyed in this
blessed opportunity of serving his Most Christian Majesty: Here are up and down
this City a crew of odd fellows, old beaten Soldiers of the King of Englands
party, who can now serve for nothing better then to fill ditches, thereby to
salve their lost honors, when they shall shed their blood in the service of a
more puissant Prince, to whose gracious Majesty I shall ever devote my best
performance: Let it be your part (therefore) as much as in you lies, to prepare
them for this Expedition, which you will the easlyer effect, by taking these
few verbal Instructions with you: [much to this purpose] First let them
understand by you from me, the great compassion I take on their several
distresses and sad conditions, and how studious I am to better it, and to
render them capeable of doing his A double-tongued Scot.
Majesty of England more good service, and that to this end I am very willing
to engage my self unto hs Majesty of France's Agent (here) for some competent
sum of money for their subsistence and future pay, which who so lists may
receive; and that I will freely (but privately) procure of the States of this
Kingdom Passes for their going beyond Sea, and will also provide vessels, and
be my self at the charge of their Transportation: all which I shall do as a
demonstration and pledge of that service I owe to my young Mr. the Prince of
England; whom (be sure to tell them what I say) by their and others recourse to
him, with some foraign Princes assistances, I hope (and little doubt) speedily
to see in an invasive capacity to revenge his Si non ante diem Parcae sua fila

Fathers indignities, and power out floods of the blood of those rebellious
Roundheads: You shall also (said he) take money with you to give advance to all
those who shall enroll themselves as soldiers for the French expedition, (for
under that Notion you must tell them it must be carried on) that so the States
of this Kingdom may not be unfurnisht of a pretense and excuse against the
urgings of those of England, when they shall see us play foul play under-board:
But above all, I beseech you, that you make a diligent enquiry into the temper
and employment of some of those Anglers; I am told there are some amongst them
of most accomplished parts; and my Agents in London have given me warning, that
there are certainly some of them employed by the English Parliament as Spies
and Intelligencers concerning the transactions and consultations of me and this
State; Let such be nippily marked and taken notice of; and where you shall find
deserts in any other of them, as conducible to our purpose, proceed to collate
large and particular encouragements: Gentlemen (quoth he) you may not; and I
know you are not ignorant of the end of our design; in which, while we seem to
help these base scoundrels, our ambition is to serve his King of France.
most Christian Majesty, according to our long-continued and lately renewed
obligation, against either Spanish or English adversary; at the present to
fight the one, and ere long to invade the other; the latter of which his
Majesty may hereafter easily atchieve, having so many plausible pretensions on
his side; as not only the restoration of his nearest Ally, but (which is the
main string of his bow) his entering with so many native Englishmen, which will
stop the people from banding against his forces when they enter, and occasion
many thousands to join with them against their own Natives and Countrymen;
which when God shall please to bring to pass, I shall then be openly able to
declare to the world, how much I am in Allegiance his subject, and in
conscience your servant.

Thus after our most humble regratulations to his Grace for these pictae
tectoria linguae, and indeed his affable and noble deportment to us, with his
tender respect of our religious qualities (for the Agent had whisperingly told
him what Mr. Catwas) we were now departing the presence, when presently we were
remaunded by the Monsieur, who told us, that he had a very great desire to see
as many of the gentlemen as could be got together at a Rendezvous, if the Duke
held it safe; to which Mr. Br answered it were more convenient to defer that
for one week longer, till more of them had listed themselves, and by their
Advance recruited their tottered condition, and amended their equipage; to
which the Monsieur answered, Gods death, let it be even so, or else they will
take me for a very merry gentleman; meaning belike, He should be unable to hold
his countenance, and restrain laughter.

And now the poor Cabs do captare Ranam shoot at a crow and kill an owl; they
have brought their hogs to a fair market, (like the Devil when he threw them
into the Sea,) of a foul event, they have a fair labor, they must not only be
content to be beaten out of the Kingdom, but be Ni resipiscant fustibus and
flagris nae ipsi vapulabunt.
beaten in again, to usher in and make room for those, who when they have
served their turn of them, will use them and their King both alike; nay they
shall be forced to fight against themselves; Sic vos non vobis, etc. so that
the more victories they win, the more miserable they make themselves, and
un-king their Prince: This plot was never so strong against them, as it is at
this moment, as in time I shall declare: But they will not be induced to
believe the French to be other then real Assisters, and that they do not catch
at their crown; and, I must confess, their reason seems to be somewhat solid in
this particular; Because (say they) we know our King to be reconciled to the
Roman-Catholike Church, and hereby he has ingratiated himself with, and
engaged all the Catholic Princes of Europe for his assistance: Ah Friend, I
know the pulse of the French not to beat so violently for Religion, when a
crown lies at stake; they hope (I Will warrant thee) to see a Lewis crowned in
Londre, as there was a Henry in Paris: But they say, His Holiness has obliged
all Catholic Princes to be aiding, and amongst them the French; who, if ever
he wins England, (it is more then probable) maugre the Pope, will count himself
fitter to be Defender of the Faith, then he that just now was converted to it
to regain a crown: And this is but merely brutorum ratio, all the reason they
have.

Well, but let us look back and see what we Presbyterian-Cavaleers are doing at
Edinburgh amongst the Cavaleer-Presbyterians; Our time is wholly spent in
listing who list to taste of the Esca of our hooks; and no little trouble was
it for us to ferret them out of the several holes they had buried themselves
in; Our first two days work was, to pretend the disclosing of a great secret
to all we met, that they should give notice to all the right Cavaleers they
knew, to meet at a Green a quarter of a mile beyond the Kings Hally-Rood-House,
near a little Alehouse there, called the Worlds end, where Duke Hambleton had
by us intended (out of his pure pity) a distribution of money to all
distressed English Officers, and Gentlemen soldiers of the Kings party,
according to their several qualities, and that there would be made some
propositions for the seting a foot again of our old quarrel with the English
Rebels: O how greedily was this Gudgeon swallowed! Those that had but twelve

black dogs, drunk a health that night in Scotch Ale to the brave Duke; and
thus we made every one prove a Decoy to his Comrade; and our appointed time
being come, our work we found done to our hands, and some Punds drunk upon
score in the Dukes health before ere we came at them, where we found the silly
souls extremely frolic and blythe, Hic saltat laetus, hic est sermon facetus,
every man fancying vanities to himself (and building castles in the Air, as yet
still they do upon a Scotch foundation) according to the defect of his
judgment and discretion;

Ex improviso fallitur omnis homo: And so they are resolved to be once more
Imbelli adminiculo ne sustenteris.
deceived by them before they will learn better forecast.

Nor when we came did we piddle with them a whit, but forthwith accosted them
with the most prestigious sugar candid words we could invent, not forgetting
one tittle of our Instructions, which we confirmed for truths, by a certain
token the Duke had sent by us, which was twenty shillings sterlin to drink his
dear Master the Kings Health, and a confusion and damnation to the Parliament,
besides, half so much for the King of France his Health; desiring them to
accept of these poor favors he had sent them, as a token of what more he
intended to do, as a sympathy of their loyal sufferings, but especially as a
demonstration of his fidelity (though formerly mistrusted) to his Master: Thus
having told our tales, and recruted every man with a considerable sum in his
pocket, (besides their heads full of Nobilis Alla) we desired them all quietly
to disperse themselves, and in the mean while to put themselves into as hansom
an equipage as they could, till our meeting again (that day sevenight) in the
same place, when if we did not presently fall upon action; we told them, we
were commanded to assure them upon the Dukes honor, they were safe, and that
there should be a very competent and large allowance offorded the very meanest
of them all; and so they straglingly parted like fools as they came;

Qui leviter credit, deceptus saepe recedit: I cannot call it good nature in
them, but a shallowness of experience, contracted through customary overmuch
talk, more boasting, through too little observation, and no pondering; for
certainly no cattle in world are more easily beguiled then the Cavaleers
generally by an overweening credulity; the true occasional use of a wise
distrust and slow Belief, either not reaching, or else misplacing, seldom
deliberating, till surrounded with fears, who are ill Counselors, and never
determining but upon hopes and wishes, who are false Astrologers: The dull
Phrygian could Sero sapere, the Cavaleer will nunquam; He is always
extravagantly talking of many generations past; never once roundly considering,
how that Then was Then, and Now is Now. But, to our Relation:

We staid not this night, till we had informed the Agent how far and fair a
progress we had made in the business, who seemed very pleasant at the relation
of the several pretty passages at our Tap-lash Rendezvous, some Devotions being
that night performed at his lodgings (at which the Duke was present, and many
other Scotch Gentry, though some people will hardly think it) we had the honor
to be commanded to take our repast there that night, and waiting his Honors
leisure, and further pleasure with us, he told us, there was no more to be
said, till the Duke had completed many things with the States, which to him he
had, engaged for: I will only add this (said he) for our comfort. I doubt not
(by the fair progress we have already transacted with these The Scots.
people) but to see our three Cabs, Presbyters, Independants.
enemies beaten by themselves, and a way made for the banner of Christ, and the
Standard of my Master, to be in time set up in that base adjacent Heretical
plot of earth: Master Ca -- told him, though our hopes were once great by our
influence on the King and his party, yet it would be greater then ever, if we
could once see a conjunction betwixt the Royalist and Presbyter, and both
willing to accept of aid, from his most Christian Majesty: you shall see
strange things done (quoth the Agent) if ever we can but bring them to shake
hands, though with the teeth outward; which in some time (though perchance also
with some little difficulty) we shall bring about: The Royallist is
sufficiently madded already; for they say, they will take the Turks, yea, the
Devils side to conquer England, and in time you shall see, we shall work on the
dissatisfactions of the Presbyter, that we shall bring them to join with us and
their enemies, to overthrow their brethren and friends.

And now (Reader) I can busy thy fancy with little of this weeks work, only
the great mirth of the Jovialists, they are no small boys now, and (I Will warrant
you) drink no small Bear: New faces still appear to be listed, an't were for
the Turk, all is one; thirty English shillings advance was then a considerable
sum; In three or four days the Agent sent a Gentleman to command our
attendance at the Dukes Court, when he (we no sooner being come) asked us,
whether our number did increase, or decrease? We assured him, that we had
listed thirty six more then we had advance money for, which was presently
delivered us; But said he to the Duke, how shall we provide now to keep them
together from running away? By doing as you do now, (quoth the Duke) meaning by
letting them have money enough belike; but it was presently resolved upon, that
a party of Horse should scour the Country England ward; and it was given out,
that it was only to surprise and take up wandering English Malignants and
Delinquents, and to send them to the Parliament of England; But the next thing
put to the Question by my self, was, who were fittest to be chosen for the
Officers of these listed men? Well said, (quoth the Agent) a thing indeed most
necessary next to be consulted on; for either we must pitch upon some of our
own friends, or at least their enemies; my meaning is, Catholic or Presbyter,
the last being as serviceable to promote our enterprises as the first: Here is
a noble Gentleman (quoth Master Cat --) one Colonel Forcer, who is not only
discreet, but really their enemy (and your servant) yet very popular amongst
them (for the fools have a vein still to love us, how plain soever our
practices appear against them,) he is one that by a certain interest (besides
Religion) would be glad by any means to advantage and set forward the French
Design; being also not ignorant of the greatest state of affairs, and does very
well know how great hopes we have for the advancement of the Catholic Cause,
by bringing the Cavaleer under the Lee of the Presbyter; In Troth you have only
anticipated me (quoth the Monsieur) tell him I kiss his hand, and desire a word
with him, for had you not mentioned him, I must have had some conference with
him about some higher concernment.

And thus again we parted with Orders to return with most convenient speed,
which the next day we did, the Colonel in our Company; and after some private
conference betwixt Monsieur Montril and himself, we were soon dispatched, and
gave out among the Totterdemallions, that all things were now concluded, but
that a Colonel General was wanting, which we doubted would be a Scot, if we did
not solicit the Agent, that we might select Officers among our selves; and
amongst us none so fit and faithful a Conducter as would noble Colonel Forcer
be, which they every one presently relished.

Well, now approaches the second and last day of our liquorish Worlds-End
Rendezvous; where (after high Bravadoes, how we would plunder London, and
torture the Roundheads at our return into England, making no distinction
between Independent or Presbyter, when we had subdued them both) it was at last
generally given to understand, Thar the farthest way about was our nearest way
home, and that we must first visit France, where we should lie at Rack and
Manger (Free quarter) in Garrison against the Spaniard, till such time as a
League and Amnestie could be procured betwixt the French and them, and until
the difference betwixt the Independent and Presbyter did flame to the very
height; which we assured them would erelong so come to pass, and that it would
prove a very feasible business by flattering the one, to destroy both.

But behold, the grand Pa -- the Monsieur approaches, where (by reason of
different languages) at the first accost there was nothing but dumb shows, and
Serviteur tres humbles; but there came a Scotch Interpreter with him, who was
commanded to express the Agent in this wise: Gallant Sirs, his Honor (here)
has commanded me to let you know, that though he be indeed a French man, yet
he was ever naturally devoted to the service of great Britains Monarch, and
that by the solicitation of the most renownedly virtuous Henrietta Maria, their
Queen his Mistress, he was now employed by his Majesty of France to agitate
concerning the English affairs, and in special particular for the restoration
of his most distressed Majesty of England; and understanding, that so
considerable a number of his party (most gallant Genlemen and Commanders) had
by the cruelty of the enemy been beaten into this Kingdom for refuge and
safeguard, things indeed fell out more successfully for his business then he
could have wished for, or expected; because now he was not only in a capacity
to serve their Prince, but the Gentlemen in their miserable exigencies; and to
put them into that way which must of necessity be followed for the reducing of
the English Rebels: He hopes he has no cause to doubt of the aversness of any
in the promotion of this business; if there be any such (for perchance you may
not be alike zealous in a good cause) it is desired, that they would please to
urge their reasons, to show, why it may not be accounted more safe to go into
France to your Prince, then to return back into the jaws of your merciless
enemies: Your accommodation there shall befit Gentlemen of your quality, and in
prcoess of time you shall find your work done to your hands, by some unknown
servants of yours, who are now stirring up of fewdes, and flinging Marrow-bones
betwixt those two Curs, the Presbyterian and Independent; yea, some there are,
that are invisibly acting in their very Councels and Army; whom if they cannot
involve into a quarrel one against the other, they shall raise up some strange
The Levellers, a Plot of the Jesuits.
spirits amongst them that shall vigorously oppose, and perchance utterly
confound them both; If this string fails, there is another stronger for the
Bow. And now Gentlemen, if there be any of you that make exceptions, or desire
to have any one of the Articles more plainly expounded to you, (for there were
articles drawn and agreed upon betwixt them) let them now be pleased to speak;
there is nothing in which his Honor is not very desirous to give each of you
satisfaction to the full: and whosoever of you have any request to promote
concerning himself or friend, he may be heard, and in reason his request
granted: Gentlemen, Your Quarters are now taken up in Leith, where you may
freely reside by the connivance of these States, that when time shall serve you
may be there ready to imbarque.

So they all with great unanimity declared their forwardness in the action; his
Honor then saluting them with a general Sa Sa parted from them, telling them
he hoped shortly to be with them, and to see them all safely arrived in France,
and in a little while in England again.

And now for the Antycerae, for here are fools enough to make a pretty
formidable Fleet: In short time a right merry Gale commands our personal
appearance a board, whither we ganged as drunkenly reeling as the Ship, omnium
getherum, all together; Quot capita, tot sensus, as many heads, so many
windmills and aerie Castles; Seventeen days (which is much for so short a
journey) we were tumbled at Sea, enduring two very shrewd tempests; and really
the Cast-awaies were like to be wrack't; yet all this did hardly allay the
furious impieties of the Damme Blades till the Seamen bid them for shame
prepare for death; which some of them did only by banning and cursing the
Roundheaded French and Scotch Rogues; yet at last we (by a strange
preservation) were whirled into Dunkirke Harbor, where the then naturalized
Governor for the French, (Raunt zau) maugre the Agents Letters, sent us
packing again, and would not so much as admit us to put our noses within his
theivish Garrison, when he understood but what countrymen we were, (so strong a
jealousy have the French ever had of the English) fearing that the Parliament
of England having almost brought their business at home to an handsome period,
might also have employed us in a surprizall of that Port of Robbers; thereby to
have opened a gap to the liberty of the miserably persecuted Reformists there;
a Work worthy our States, when God shall please to put them upon it, which in
blessed time may be done, when the Cavish Remora's of this Nation shall once
have their bellies-full of rebelling and jarres.

Well, again we hoyst Sail, and in some 10 or 12. hours put in at Saint
Johnstones, betwixt Bulloine and Calais, the very place where Harry the Eight
won Bullione; And here we got some provant for our weather beaten paunches: the
Peasants gazeing upon us, and admiring what mind had blown thither such a
company of odd blasted fellows: Here we looked for an Army to be gone into
England out of hand; we had those amongst us that asked of the French where the
great body lay, that were bound for England; They swore by no small bones, that
they more doubted of English to invade there; the name of Cromwell being more
terrible amongst them then ever Henry the Eight was: this made the Gallants
loll their ears and laugh at one an other: Not long after we had Quarters
assigned at Gain in Picardy, though we were not like to gain much by the
bargain; For that accommodation (which the Agent spoke of in Scotland)
befitting gentlemen of our quality, we found to be the lousy straw which the
Suitzers had left behind them and a crust when we could catch it; So that we
were like to be fed with a bit and a knock; for in a months space we were
drawn into the field, up to Durlane, for the releif of Armantiers, not one
Monsieur-Article observed, but all dishonorably broken: In a word, to be brief,
within a quarter of a year that brave Gallant number of Fusees were squandred
all to pieces, knocked of the head, or starved: Oh the horrid miseries,
incivilities, affronts, hardships and contempt these poor Caitiffes felt and
received at the hands of the French, by many degrees (if possible) surpassing
those former miseries they endured by the Scots! There was not a man amongst
them, that if he were found napping, (as we call it, lagging) but the French
usually butchered him for no other respect but quatenus Englishmen, such is
their love to the Royal party of England: I have now concluded this part of
our Comi-Tragaedy, leaving the poor Cabs in the ditches, and those of them left
alive to unspeakable misery, the judgments of God pursuing them, whither so
ever they fly, for these horrible impieties of debauched Drunkeness and hellish
Healths to men's Damnations; for their familiar Oaths and Blasphemies, their
wild whorings, their cunning adulteratings (and then awingly-borrowings, but
absolutely robbings of) the Families, where ever (under feigned freindship)
they (for their secret ends and way of subsistence) by their joviall
insmuations creep into; and especially for their foolishly-disobedient and
blindly-obstinate treacheries against their dearest Parent their Country, in an
humorous defense of a Tyrannical King and Papisticall Queen ( King James
Father the L. Darley hanged it Scotland, the Queen of Scots his Popish Mother,
and his second son both beheaded in England; King James himself and his eldest
Son more then suspected to be both poisoned; His Daughters husband with her

Wanton, and a Florentine Popish W. by the mothers: And now I come to relate
some observations and certain passages, which befell and intervende during my
stay in France.

Mr. Ca. I know not upon what sudden change of mind, or whether (most
secretly) imployd in some Agitation, presently got away for Saint Omers, and so
to Spain; whence he promised after some season to return and meet us at the
English court at German en Lay; Mr. Br. and I speedily caroatcht thither, where
when we came, we found a very strong report flying up and down amongst the
Religious, (and yet choakt with as much privacy as could possibly be) that
something might be done for England this year; yet in short space it was blown
over: For it was given to understand, that the Presbyter had not wholly fallen
off and deserted the Parliament; which was meant by that last but new Southern
Colch. Ken. and Wall.
rupture, in which the French and catholics in general were on edge to have a
finger: But, upon better deliberation, (having not then the power and influence
on the Scots and English* Presbyters, which by reason of the young King they now
have*) they have reserved their strength for this very years after game: And
most strangely confident were they all, that a breach one way or other would be
wrought betwixt them; especially when they heard of the Peoples eager violence
crying out for Justice against the Capital Delinquent; for they hoped this
would have reduced the Parliament to an hard Dilemma; as whither it were
fitter, to deny the requests and clamours of the generality of the people, and
so incense them; or else, by stopping the due course of Justice, to claw with a
few inconsiderate discontented Laodiceans whose lukewarm neutrality (having in
time of yore, put their hands to the plough of Reformation) turns them clear
off from what they had first engaged themselves to complete: Which piece of
Justice as it must of necessiry have been done, they resolved would (without
doubt) very sufficiently provoke the Presbyter; (happily because they had not
the honor of doing it themselves) the Cavaleers themselves are generally (all
of them) fully of this opinion; and, say they, had these been suffered to
domineer over us, we had not found that equal intermixture of justice with
mercy, which we now do find at the hands of the Independent; the little finger
of their gouty-loyned Covenant, which none of us would take, would have proved
heavier to us then that line of an Engagement which we all have taken; nay they
now say, that a reconciliation betwixt them is merely impossible; and yet they
all hope, if they stir no more in rebellion, they shall see the happy day of a
general pardon from their now Governors.

But that which was the greatest obstruction, and did most of all bind the
hands of the French from meddling in the last new Presbyterian and Malignant
Rebellion, was first not only the Spanish difference (which caused them to have
an eye in their pole) not being yet made up, as anon I shall speak of;
secondly, nor only the proneness of their own enslaved people to attain that
precious liberty which the English had chalkt them out the way of; but thirdly,
(and which is all in all) Cardinal Mazarin, Father D and a Ies.
Le M. had not yet done their do with their young P. Chapter
Pupil; but a fair and hopeful progress they had made in the business; They
had brought him (by that time we came thither) to this, that he would very
usually (but closely) go to see the fashion of a Private Mass with his Mother;
and to my knowledge I have seen, that he can cross himself prettily of a young
Beginner; but to Confession indeed they could not of a long time bring him,
(though he might not be ashamed to confess what in forty weeks was so visibly
seen by that young French Lady of Honor; another young dainty French* English
Heir Apparent) yet at last great promises prevailed, and the better to confirm
them, his brother Jemmy (whipped into a Religion by his Mother, and turning like
a twyne thread) was forthwith to be Capt a Cardinal, and (besides) all
Catholic Princes should be invited and consulted with for an unanimous
invasion of England.

But lo news comes a loft upon the wings of the Wind, that the people and
State of England had summoned his Father to an high Court of Judicature to
bring him to a trial for all the innocent blood he had spilt, and the hideous
devastations he had caused: This was no little good news to the Cardinalical
party, (I mean the Jesuitical) for in my next I shall satisfy thee concerning
their cunning workings; how even these, who pretend so much charity and
friendship to the Son, did seek by all machinations to expidite and accelerate
this high piece of Justice upon the Father: and now say his Tutors to him, If
they proceed to death with your father, it will prove the better for you; for
it will utterly allienate the hearts and affections of the people from them,
and you shall find them to be the more eagerly violent for your re-investment,
not considering the change of your Religion, which by any means shall not be
publicly known to any but your good Catholic Subjects of England, till such
time as you have wrested power enough into your own hands to protect it and
your self in it; but indeed the Lad had some of the Fathers astutiousness in
him, and presently asked the Cardinal the same question which his Father once did
the King of Spain, when he was almost easily entreated to have turned to the
Faith Catholic; How shall I (said he) ever expect to be King of England, if
once the English should understand I am turned Catholic? To which they easily
gave a satisfactory resolution, telling him, That (as the case now stood) he
must never look to be admitted but by Fire and Sword; the main force of arms
must make way for him, neither could he ever in the least probability atchieve
that, or put it in execution, without the aid of Catholic Princes, which
they will never be brought to act in, without a firm assurance of your real
and faithful conversion.

It Is true, I must ingenuously acknowledge, for some term of time he made a
little pauze upon this hard Lecture; but no sooner was there certain news
arrived of his Fathers decollation, but he was heard by some of his attendance
to swear a great oath, That he would turn Turk, or any thing, to be revenged of
the bloody English; which mad boyish words were like to lose him the Lord
Hopton, and other of the most considerable of his party of the Episcopal
Protestants; for they plainly saw the great endeavors therewere for his
conversion; besides, that most times they were secluded and barred from their
attendances; and indeed they could not otherwise judge, but that he would
easily be induced to Popery, who was resolved to turn Alcoranite, or any thing
for revenge: Besides, all his Chaplains were turned to the wild world a
grazing, except only those who did constantly assert their real conversion, as
that Scotch dissembling Hypocrite (yet most rare Linguist) Doctor Chrichton
did, and some few others: Hopton it is true (and some more which I could easily
name) was packing up to be gone, and desert such a dangerous cause and rash
Master (had he been admitted to pardon;) but he was won and wound back again
by that old subtle Fox (that Church-Papist, or rather Atheist) Cottington, and
by the great Protestations and entreaties of many others English and French,
(not for the least affection they bear him, but) well considering, how fit and
plausibly he may serve to usher in a foreign Enemy, and be a Nose of Wax to
the great design of Englands second Conquest; especially being so popular
amongst many of the Western seduced people, who think verily that good man will
never come with those who have a design clearly to conquer this Nation, and
fall to their old Fire and Faggot burning sport.

And now the great Overtures for a Spanish Treaty are set on foot, a difficult
thing to be brought to pass, yet harder to be concluded, (such a natural
Antipathy is there betwixt these Spa. and Fra.
two Nations:) but the Jesuits (I know not how) at last effected it in some
sort, and there was canvasing the business in private betwixt them above a
quarter of a year, before the world could as much as take notice of such a
thing; and when it did break forth, (such things cannot be hid in a dark
Lanthorn) Propositions on both sides were so smothered, (at least adulterated,
before they came to the ears of men) that scarce any Neighbor Nations could
give their positive judgments what would be the conclusion and result of that
Game-underboard: The reason of all this covert closeness was, because their
discourse was most concerning that pretty prey of A handsome plot of ground
lying convenient for many Catholic purposes, and after which the Popes chops
have a long time watered; expecting by the Jesuitical Plough of Italian Policy
(guided by Beelzebub, and drawn by a mixed Team of French and Spanish Agents, to
which Cottington is Carter) to convert that good Pasture of Pro^estants into
Romish-Arable, that it may be sharply reaped by the Sword, and the grain
cruelly threshed out (at the Barn*door of Rome) by the Scepter of a Catholic
Conqueror: it were excellent for the Pope, then he might here again glean
Peter Pence, convert easy souls, and carry more straw to Rome; who ever
remained firm (resolved) to be left as stubble for the fire.
England: It was urged by one to the other, that never was there a fairer
opportunity then now to be revenged of those reforming Apostates, to fall on
and surprise them, they thought it fit to make Hay while the Sun shined; and
the most they yet disagree about, is who shall have the crop when it is mowed:
The French make mountainous offers of returning such and such Fl. Cat. etc.
places into the Spaniards possession, if he may be suffered to enjoy the
conquest, the Spaniard being to furnish him with so much money, men, arms,
shipping, ammunition, etc. for so long a time: Alas noble Monsieur, this is not
like to fadge, for it runs diametrically opposite to that general opinion of
the Spaniards, of an universal Monarchy; Truly Gentlemen, I humbly conceive,
You reckon before your Host; You count your Chickens when the eggs are adled:
We have an Army (and, because our confidence is not in the fleshly arm of man)
that by the power of God will not fear to meet you half ways any where, at any
time; and we have not a people so witchedly besotted, that because you bring
along with you one whom you make your stalking horse to your mischievous
designs, will therefore open the door to let him in, that so you may come
crowding in at his back; Do your worst, we fear you not, though there were
eighty eight Nations more of you, all invading us on the next fifth of November.

But here a great while they have stuck fast in this Quagmire, not for a long
time resolving one way or other, leaving the desperate English Youth in sad
dumps to think, and a great greedy suspense to imagine why they so long
procrastinate their assistances: And here (really) a man would have thought
they would have been plunge^ (...) everlasting; but what they have done in it,
(their Tutor) the Devil knows; only thus much I am sure of, they have made the
Lad believe, that without fail this Summer (and very probable) they will fall
on, and put him (out of doubt) out of his pain: To this purpose he is put upon
a work to beguil himself, I am mightily deceived if he do not find himself
Cony-catch'd in it, and all the Lutheran and Calvinist States and Princes
besides, (who will find themselves merely drawn in) that have engaged in some
aid of men and money, etc. They shall only lead the Van, and be the forlorn
Hope to the Rear-Catholiques, who will come powdering in too, but in their
breeches with a vengeance; Well, but to these the young Papist has sent
Beggars to implore aid for the Protestant Cause in good Tru-ly; having
Commissioned his Emissaries to engage, and make promise of a very faithful
repaiment of all their several charges and expenses, by a general Tax upon the
people, when (the skies falling) he shall be able to catch Larks in England;
which to constult, about they are to meet at Breda, where now a Babel of them
are concurringly tumbled together; The Catholic he stands behind the
Hangings, and neatly observes all their resolutions; nor indeed does any thing
pass as resolved without the Councel-Boord of France, their Approbation and
Concurrence, a Journall of their Transactions having been weekly posted up to

of the Mazarini.

his Holiness) on all the Acts there passed.

So that now (Reader) I will give thee a touch and but a glympse of the
invading plot, how it is laid; because I intend (as soon as I have received my
packet, and conferred circumstances; for indeed I am now out of Suspected a
Convert.
their books) to come again speedily into the Press, and speak plain English;
showing thee some score of Catholics, Priests, Jesuits, and traiterous
Presbyterians
Names, which will even astonish thee to think, that we have so long hugged
such vipers in our bosoms: And then will I show thee the second part of this
story, beginning from German en Lay-to Breda, and so forward, in which there
shall appear plain truths, and thou will be forced to believe them in spite of
thy malignant heart; when it shall be made evident to thee, that at (...) they
take it for granted, that we are already conquered, and reduced to the Faith,
so confident are they in the Resolutions of their main Ayders, the
Presbyterians: Exitus acta probat, The proof of the pudding is in the eating
good Mr. Pope.

[Ambition to rule, is more potent in One that is up; then Malice, to revenge,
prevalent in one that is down:

And,

To one that is down, Auxiliaries obtained, not by coin, but upon courtesy
(wherein may be craft) are most dangerous:

For,

A Foreign Prince needs no greater invitation to seize upon a Crown to
himself, then when requested to regain it for another;

Yet,

Let no Civil Discords encourage any Forraigner to invade, since they that are
factious among themselves (and jealous one of another) for this or that party,
are ever (especially being already provided with an old conquering Army) more
strongly prepared, when the whole is at stake, to encounter with a common
Enemy; for, whom Civil Commotions set at variance, Foreign Hostility
reconciles:

And surely,

A wise Forraigner would be cautious in undertaking an expensive Design upon
the report of such as are exiled their Country, whose ends expect Advantages
from their Assistance, their miseries laying hold of all Opportunities, and
seeking to be made whole, though upon their ruin; for, an Invader repelled,
must expect (at the next bout) to be Invaded;

However,

If Forraigners will be Fools, who can help it? Reader, be thou wise, in
relying on God, and being true to thy Country: Let no flattering wish deceive
thee, malice urge thee, price nor promise bribe thee, nor ought else tempt thee
to take part with any Enemy of the State: Assure thy self (if thou do)
whoever wins, thou art lost; If the State prevail, thou art branded for a
Rebel, and marked for death; If the Enemy prosper, thou shall be reckoned as a
Traitor, and not secured of thy life. He serves the State, that destroys a
Rebel; And it is a common thing for a foreign Prince, that loves the Treason,
to hate the Traitor: Above all, presume not on Secrecy, such confidence has
undone many: Innumerous are the ways of finding out a man, besides finding him
in the very act; Nor think a good wit can assuredly carry thee through an ill
business; Every man may not be the Wit he thinks himself; And if he be, or
more, yet none so cunning to cover, but to discover there are others as wise.
If you think well to seem faithful, you must needs think it is better to be
so. Humanum est errare, condonare Divinum: Whoever wanders (as I have) let him
quickly return to God, his Country, and himself. The Shortest errors are the
best: Be not ashamed to be wise, be thou encouraged; for Peter (through the
merciful aspect of Jesus) doubled the grace by repenting, which he had lost by
offending:]

Now for the Plot, it is thus laid: (Reader, thou have it from a good hand, and
an affectionate heart, to thy good; Believe it to thy preservation, for which
be thankful; and doubt it not, in simple ingratitude to God, and to thy
destruction:) The Scots, that is, the Presbyterians both of England and
Scotland (for London has a lusty finger in the Breda-pye) are the fore horses
to draw on the good Catholic Design; The little Queen (this every one knows)
has laid a strict command on her Lad, by all possible means to compose
differences, and close interests with his guide friends the Scots and English
Presbyters, upon any kind of conditions, how base or ignoble soever, so that
they may be brought to grapple with the English State; These are to advance and
keep some spudder in the North, to draw down a considerable party thitherward;
the English-brethren are by all possible means to work some strong diversion
(if they can, or dare) in the Southern, or some other parts: The Montrossians
at first were designed to keep warm the backs of the Scots, and presently with
their foreign Mercenaries, Danes, Swedes, Suitzers, Kerns, Normans, and some
Germans, to advance as near the guide town of Edinburgh as they could: But this
(too late for their advantage) was perceived; and did put the Leslyans to more
then an halt in their resolutions, even to a turning faces upon the Hurreying
Invaders; so that now it seems they are remaunded, and have cross orders to
hoyse for Ireland (as it is given out) to make all clear there in a trice: but
this is but a flim-flam, they are (as I have some reason to suppose and report)
to join with the Lord Hopton in the Western Islands, who is only useful, and
employed for naught else, but to cover an Outlandish Invasive Enemy, with his
plausible presence, and some English with him: and others to prick on the
Jockies to be sent in their steed into Scotland, but not till the English and
Scots come to Handy-gripes. Nor are any to second Hopton but these, and some
Flemish aid by sea and land, till he has made the Gap wide, and the way clear
for some other Party: and then, expect from all parts and Kingdoms some
sweeping Armies of Catholics to land in several places at once, which (as the
Cavalcers themselves do brag and give out) shall come like a flood, and in a
trice rush and overflow the whole land like an Et tunc immenso impetu Hostis
confinibus ingruit.
Inundation: But of this more in my next Treatise, which I am confident will be
convincing enough to stir up the spirits of the most venemously unsatisfied
ones that are, to an unanimous opposition of (at least) all the foreign
Enemies of our Peace and Country: who if ever (as God forbid) they should come
to gain a conquest over poor England, be ye assured, Presbyterians and
Cavaleers too, that ye also must to pot, and are in as great a Predicament (of
confusion) as he that is now and ever,

Epilogue to the Author.
SIR,
YOur Papers you were pleased to communicate to me, I here return; and as you
desired, they have been read over, and I am ready to give you this account of
them. First, I believe you report nothing but truth in them: for these
particulars agree exactly with my general Observations. 2ly, I believe many of
those, who have been formerly of an other opinion, will be convinced with your
report. 3ly, I believe you will hereby gain no discredit, nor incur danger
except only from those, who are most certain, and knowing that you speak truth
herein. I mean plainly if you provoke any enemies hereby, it will be the
Cavaleers, the Papists, and Presbyterians, and yet all Papists, Presbyterians
and Cavaleers, though they know these things are more then probable, do not
certainly know, by any privity of their own, that they were so acted as to
particulars, as is here described: and therefore you need not fear all. As for
the Independents they are rather justified, then provoked hereby; and as for
the Levellers, though you pretty well describe them, yet you insist not much
upon them; and if you had; they are not very formidable at this time, partly
because the major part of them never yet fell totally from the Ordinances of
God, or from us, and all such now as fell not so far have quitted their
blasphemous, Atheistical ringleaders, and I am in great hopes, that some of
them which have not yet retracted, may be woone upon by your clear, ingenuous
discoveries, therefore do not withdraw one foot backwards; Tutum est cumtimeas
infer gradum. You know what Scipio said being once employed upon an hard
service: Necesse est ut eam, non ut vivam: and you know better what our Savior
said; He tbat will save his life shall loose it; and he that will loose his
life for my sake, shall save it. You seem to me to be inspired as Sampson was
against the Philistines, spare not then to provoke them, send your firebrarnds
by the tayls of your coupled foxes into their standing corn: if you survive
your conflict, you will enjoy your victory here: if not, yet you will pull down
the pillars of your enemies, and perishing together with them, you will be
inwreathed with a more glorious laurel hereafter. You need doubt none, but the
one-eyd, mungrell, half-witted medly of Cavaleers, and Presbyterians; and yet
these, though they are now odly cemented, and daubed together with untempered
mortar, cannot but wonder at your account of things palpably designed long
since, and now so visibly here acted, where their Enemies known interests, and
their own present sufferings are so consonant, and correspondent, and answer as
lively as faces in a glass. We may suppose that some of our Enemies are
dementated by God, but we may withal suppose that there is a moderate sort,
such as the Arguilians amongst the Scotch Presbyterians, and such as the
Hoptonians amongst the English Prelaticall Cavaleers, that may find their old
suspicions strangely sympathizing with these discoveries. It must needs be
evident to the Arguilians by this time, that their young King, when he had
swallowed the Covenant, and was bound thereby to prosecute all Prelaticall,
Popish Cavaleers, yet at the same time intended that Montrosse by his
Commission should confound all Covenanters by Prelaticall, and Popish
Cavaleers; but the particular paces, and gradations which He made, when he
designed things so contrary, and the proposed means of accomplishing the same,
will be now better understood then ever. Likewise by this time it must needs be
evident to the Hoptonians, that the same young Master of theirs, when he went
to Mass with his Mother in France, and Courted the Pope, and all Catholic
Princes for aids against his Heretical Rebels in England, He yet was resolved
at the same time to engage himself by the Scotch Covenant to extirpate all
Popery and Prelacy. But it will be now more evident to them, what the
particular inductions, conjurations, and mysteries of the Romish Cabal was,
which made that reconciliation betwixt things so irreconcilable in his weak,
abused understanding. These mysteries after you are once thoroughly read, and
studied, will appear no great mysteries: that which before was only
intelligible, by your Narrative of particulars will be presented as visible. He
that has eyes to see, will not shut them at your scenes; he that has eyes, but
not to see (for such there were in our Saviors days) will be as stupefied
though a messenger from the dead came to salute him. In you are opened to the
world strange counsels, strange actions, and strange events, and the symetry
that is betwixt your events and your actions, betwixt your actions and
counsels, must needs convince every man, who is not cauterisd by the
unsearchable judgments of God. In ethics wisdom is justified by her Children,
and Truth has the looking-glass of time, and times events to view herself in,
even as in the Mathematics, Rectum est sui Index, and obliqui. I need say no
more: seeing men will judge of this piece of yours by the times; and know the
times by this piece of yours: for a Lamp brought into a dark room makes it
self known, as well as all other things in that room.

Give me leave to Print, and bind up together with this Narrative of yours,
two Letters which were communicated to me lately from a cordial Friend, and I
believe they will not appear very heterogeneous. I will paraphrase nothing upon
them, let them paraphrase for themselves. Adiu.


SIR,
SInce his Lordship desires to know my opinion touching his Majesty's Affairs,
I shall with all freedom communicate what I conceive in ordinary reason, to be
the most probable course for his re-advancement, and the restitution of
Monarchy. And as touching this, the surest way to proceed in is, to take a
survey of the causes of its ruin, and also of the Scottish Interest, since it
pretends a restoration of the regal. Whence the destruction of the English
Monarchy proceeded, may easily be perceived, if we consider the time of its
deelension, which began with the days of our departure from the Roman Church:
For, during the continuance of that profession among us, the Faith of the
people being subjected to the Dictates and Decrees of the Church, they were
like wax, apt to receive the Impression of any Principle, which the Church was
pleased to impose upon them; and so by reason of that compliance which was
maintained between the Pope and the Monarch, and the Priests and the Lords, for
their mutual preservation, the people were the more easily ridden, and seldom
or never contemned the Bridle. By this means, in those days, implicit faith
and blind obedience was a maxim that passed current in Politics, as well as
Ecclesiastics, whilst the great ones of the Clergy and Laity shared all
Authority between Them: And though many Quarrels arose between the Pope and the
Monarch touching their several Jurisdiction^ (...) the Arcana Imperii were
still kept under lock and key, and so their Authorities remained entire ever,
in relation to the people. But when the Protestant Religion began to take place
among us, the Priests soon lost the command of those Reins which they held over
the Conscience; Implicit obedience was immediately cashired, and the people
having liberty allowed in things sacred made bold to pry into the Civil, and
the reverential law to the Priesthood being quitted, the less reverence was
born to the regal Authority.

Nevertheless, the reforming Clergy (to make amends) endeavored what lay in
them to establish their own Interest, and twist it again with that of the Crown
upon a Protestant Account; and as to outward splendour, they seemed to make the
King somewhat more than he was before, plundring the Pope of the Title of
Supreme Head of the Church to bestow it upon him. And farther, it must be
acknowledged, the Bishops did what lay in them to support and advance his
Prerogative; and they did it a long time: But alas, the first Reformers having
opened the eyes of the People, their Successors knew not which way, to shut
them up again, because the multitude were instructed in time to know as much as
themselves; and knowledge is ever attended with a desire of liberty, and will
require satisfaction in reason, before men will yield up their Intellects and
obedience.

Hence it was, that after men had a liberty given to read the Scriptures, they
made bold of Themselves to interpret (every one after his own sense) as well as
to read, and by this means they furnished themselves with matter enough to pelt
at the Bishops; which order of men being beaten down as the main pillars, every
man saw the necessity of a Fall of the Monarchy it self. Upon this account came
in the Presbyter with his new Form of Government hewn out of the Scriptures to
supplant the Protestant, and after him the Independent, who fetches Arguments
likewise from the same Fountain, which puzzle all the world to prove the
necessity of any Nati^nall Form of Church Government at all; and so the harmony
betwixt the two Polities of Church and State being lost, it is obvious to every
common understanding, that a change of the Roman Religion, was the original,
or the first moving Cause, of this alteration of government, and the ruin of
Monarchy in England.

Now the Cause of the disease being known, I suppose it is no hard matter to
prescribe his Majesty a remedy for recovery: And to this end, his best course
is, to take the Counsel of Hippocrates, Contraria contrariis curanda. Since
the English Kings have lost the Crown by departing from the Roman Church, sure
the way to get it again is to return thither, and if it can be re-gained upon
that Account, it will never be lost again: For, if I have any judgment in
Affairs of this world, certainly there is no way left under heaven to allay the
present Opinions and subdivisions of Faction in point of Religion, and to
compose the civil Feuds that follow them, but by reducing the Members of this
distracted Body, and swallowing up all, into a Monarchical Catholic
uniformity. For, as things now stand, and as long as there is an Indulgence of
that humor called Liberty of Conscience, it is impossible this Nation should be
in any Form but that of a Republic; and until Conscience be muzzled again
with the old Catholic Bond of Implicit obedience, it will ever be barking, and
except such a Principle come in credit, it would be as impossible for his
Majesty to keep possession hereafter, as it is now to get it, upon any other
Terms, than an engaging with and for the Catholic Religion.

And that there is no way but this for a recovery, will be made very evident by
stating the condition of those parties in the three Kingdoms that pretend to
his restitution; which I shall now effect in brief. The party that makes most
noise in this particular is the Presbyterian; and at present there is a strong
Report of his Majesty's Inclination to Them; but how such a Course can be
justified in reason, I do not see, since there is no possible medium to
reconcile the two Polities, Regal and Presbyteriall, they being as
contra-distinct in nature, as unitas and multitudo, Monarchy and Polyarchy,
both claiming (not an equality of power, but) the Supremacy: And though the
Presbyterian claims his, in a way collateral (that is, In ordine ad
Spiritualia) as to civil Things, yet the pretended derivation of their
Authority more directly and immediately from Christ, as his special Ministers,
and sole Administrators of his discipline (to whose Scepter all earthly powers
ought to bow, and obey) cuts the very Throa of all Civil Power, and (by
consequence) assassinates the regal dignity. This being the true nature of
that Faction, I suppose his Majesty has little Cause to be in love with it,
or to b^leeve he can by imbarquing himself in that bottom, make a saving voyage
upon the present Adventure, so as to return like himself, or to be what he
would be.

Nor do I see, what probability can be therein, to carry the day against the
present prevailing party in England. That bruised Reed Scotland, is the grand
Asylum (In quo n^^ Boreas ipse manner velit;) and whether the poverty and
pusillanimity of the Scottish Rabble be able to struggle with the wealth and
power of England, is well worthy Consideration. As for their Party among the
English, the chief Actors (the curtain being now*drawn) are become
inconsiderable and contemptible, and Presbytery it self (in the latitude
demanded) is universally odious to the Nation: Some Remnants they have likewise
in Ireland, but not fit to be named, in order to the great work of restitution.
Moreover, it is to be observed, that a Close with that party, will utterly
disoblige those two grand ones, the Royall-Protestant and the Catholic.

Now as touching these two, it is true indeed, they seem at present in a very
low condition, but their hearts are firm, their number great, and as long as
they are so, nothing wants but means and opportunity which must be sought
after; and neither of Them being to be had at home, the Rise of all must be
from abroad. And if we look into foreign parts, the Protestant has but few
Friends, the Catholic many. The Protestant can do much joined with the
Catholic, but nothing without him, and therefore the key of the work, must be
to bring these two to an union; which I suppose is no hard matter to effect,
since the late loosnes in Church discipline has rendered the Protestant or
Episcopal Cavaleers (as they call them) very indifferent, either to be of no
Religion, or of any, as is evident by the many Proselites which flow in daily
unto the Church of Rome: Besides it is a thing not disputed now, but firmly
believed by most of the ingenious and generous sort of our Nobility, Gentry,
and old Clergy, that the difference betwixt us and Rome is not in fundamentals,
but only in a few ceremonies and circumstantials, which though they formerly
seemed superstitious extravagancies, yet now are looked upon by them (as with an
eye of experience) to be necessary points of Prudence, Infatuare plebem, to
charm, and keep the world in order. These things being considered, it will be
no hard matter for his Majesty to mint the old Protestant and Catholic with
the same stamp, and make them both bear the same Royal Image and
Superscription. As for pretenses of Conscience, which may arise to oppose the
reason of this, I suppose his Majesty cannot but have so much of Prince in him,
as to know it is a mere vanity to puzzle Conscience in matters of Ceremony; and
there is not a Chaplain of his, but must be master of so much reason as to give
him full satisfaction touching this particular: But if his Clergies Doctrine
will not do it, yet let him be convinced, and instructed by the example and
practice of his heroic Grandfather, the great Henry of France; who judging the
differences in Religion not to be fundamental, made no scruple to take the
Catholic way, when he could not come by the Protestant, to a plenary
possession. And my opinion is, if his Majesty take the same Course, the Pope
himself, and all the Catholics throughout Europe, prizing England highly, will
use all means for a recovery; which will be so much the more easy to attain
upon that score; in regard the Catholics, or such as are at least
half-Catholicks, are now chief in possession of the kingdom of Ireland; who
would all be extremely distasted, and not so cordially pursue the Royal
Interest, if once his Majesty should make a real close with the Scotch
Presbyterians.

Nevertheless, though a real Close would be destructive, yet I cannot but
recommend a pretended one, to be of all other engines, the most necessary to
carry on his Majesty's design, that whilst he shakes hands with them in
public, he stick fast to his true Friends in private. And above all things it
were requisite his pretenses be kept so high still toward the Presbyters, that
they have no cause to suspect him: For, if he effect nothing else thereby, yet
this great benefit must needs ensue, that it will obstruct any union or Accord,
and maintain Friends, betwixt Them and the Independents. By any means let all
arts be used to keep these from uniting, and then the work is half done to his
hands, otherwise it will be little less then impossible. Liberavi animam meam.
Let my Lord know I have delivered my opinion with all sincerity and freedom,
being confident I shall stand upright in his Judgment and his Majesty's, when
they have well weighed my Allegations. I am,

(Sir) Your very affectionate humble Servant: M. P.


SIR,
I Received yours of the 8th. instant, and the same day I went and showed his
Lordship, who went immediately and imparted it to his Majesty, who has kept it
locked up ever since in his Cabinet. I perceive, that in the judgment of them
all you have hit the nail on the head, and his Majesty resolves to send a copy
of it to the Queen at Paris, to whom I know it will be every jot as welcome.
You might imagine, that I flatter you, if I should deliver the opinions of his
Majesty's true Friends, in the same language that they express, concerning
your extraordinary parts and merits; but take this for all: They say, there
never came a more judicious and solid express from any English pen; and it is
exceedingly wondered, that you should jump so evenly in your judgment with the
greatest heads in Europe, upon whose Counsel and Advice his Majesty solely
depends; And this so exactly (my Lord says) as if you had conversed and
compared notes together.

As for the Scots, assure your self his Majesty abhors them, any farther than
for his own ends; and it has been already resolved to keep close (touching
them) to the Rule prescribed in your letter; therefore be not moved at all, if
you chance hereafter to hear of our agreement with Them: For, it is the Queens
Advice, we should do it upon any Terms whatsoever. For news, I refer you to the
enclosed Copy, desiring to hear from you upon all occasions; but this piece of
good news more give me leave here to tell you, that you will never want a
gracious Master of his Majesty, who expects your privacy, and is resolved fully
to reward you, as soon as it shall please God to restore him: And touching
this, you will suddenly receive greater Testimonies and Assurances than mine;
in the mean time he shall take all opportunities to premove that good opinion
which you have already attained, and use my utmost endeavor every way to
deserve the reputation of,

Yours, etc.
