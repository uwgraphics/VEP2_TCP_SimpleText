AN ANTIDOTE AGAINST An Infectious Air.

OR A Short Reply of Wel-wishers unto the Good and Peace of this Kingdom; Unto
the Declaration of the 11th of February, 1647.

Is it fit to say unto a King thou art wicked, or to Princes ye are ungodly?

Job 34.18. Printed in the Year, MDCXLVII.

A brief Reply to the Declaration of the House of Commons.
WE have read your Declaration, and have thought good to give you this short
account of those impressions that it has left with us. We find it of that
nature, that it would feign prompt others to think more than it self dares
speak or utter, and yet speaks much more than it proves. But though we should
take all insinuations for assertions, and all assertions for probations, we
cannot see how all together would be sufficient to bring home the conclusions:
neither that which is expressly set down as the professed drift of the whole
Book: nor yet those that it is farther to usher in: The great sinew of that
Body: The maine wheel or spring of your Engine, which if any thing must do
your feat of dis-uniting the hearts of the Kingdom from his Majesty, and
justifying your professed rejection of him, is that which concerns the death
of the late King. A matter in deed of a very high nature; and though you are
loath to express your selves therein, yet it is not hard to discern what
thoughts you would thereby commend unto us. But if you can clearly make good
what you intend, why did you not speak it plainly? If you cannot, why do you
go about by malicious art to insinuate that which you are not able to make
good? Men that are under the power of others, use indeed sometimes to speak
timorous verities: But where men armed with greatness and strength, speak
fearfully, there the Truth is in danger.

But do you believe, or can you think to persuade us, that the honor of so
great a King, or his just power and Rights, are to be laid under foot upon
surmises? upon quodlibeticall and uncertain conjectures, whose grounds and
foundations are rather in the conceits and apprehensions of men variable
according to the variety of their affections, than in the reality of things or
actions? When events are liable to diverse causes, and those that have their
residence within the breasts of men, to fix them upon one without any sound
reason for the choice, but because it appearres most serviceable to our
purposes, is a fallacy of too open a collusion; That we should trust our
judgments with it in so great a matter; and therefore since you have proved
nothing against his Majesty, in that particular, we cannot but infer, that
all that you want of evidence against him lies against your selves, and does
convince you to have committed as high an offense against the duty of Subjects,
at against the candor of Christians.

As for us, The pious life of his Majesty; His exemplary carriage in the whole
demeanor of his life The quiet and undisturbed temper of his mind,
notwithstanding the surly storms wherewith he has been attempted: His mercy
toward others, even toward his enemies, unlikely to consist with such horrid
cruelty toward his own -- His constancy and undauntednesse of spirit in his
sufferings, together with his great and commemorable patience; assisted with
the great improbability of the act, as having in it too little an hire of
advantage to procure the undertaking of so high an impiety, as that which
brought a far greater addition of burden than honor upon his back: The
consideration of the dear affection between him and his Royal Father, never
interrupted by any distaste likely to hatch such a viper in so noble a breast.
These and many more together, with the highest engagement of Christian charity
to our King, as they do bind us, and even enforce us to abhominate and abhor
the thought of that thought, which you seem to desire to infuse into us, and
to keep our breasts armed and grounded, however you have or may disarme us
otherwise against any insinuations that may lead us thereunto:

So when we consider the rules and practices of some Politicians, and the
nature of man, which is observed to be such, as it is apt to hate those whom
they have wronged, and to wrong them more; when we consider what has been done
already, what is daily done, and what it is some men's interest, as the world
judges of Interests to do: we cannot but incline to adhere rather unto this
choice, to believe it much more likely that such a thing may be forged by some
against him, than that he could commit such a thing against his Father without
any such inducements either of revenge or interest: and where the guilt of this
is now let the world judge, and which is the greater offense of the two.

But secondly, in case it could be proved, and so fully, so demonstratively
proved, as is requisite to overcome that large portion of Charity which is due
unto a King above all other sorts of men, and to him for ought we know above
all other Kings, much the more for the sad condition wherein you keep him, so
clearly as to be victorions over so many and so disswasive improbabilities that
present themselves in array against it: we should indeed even then admit it
with great reluctance, as a truth that it might be thought a kind of impiety to
understand; we should then (when we must needs) look upon it as a sad and
great affliction unto our Nation, and as a great cause of humiliation (not of
triumph or insulting) unto us; That God should suffer our King to fall into
such a depth of impiety, for the sins of the Magistrate as of the Minister, are
usually the judgments of the people for their sins: But yet nevertheless, we
should hold it our duty even in that case to cry out with the holy Prophet,
Micha 7.9. We will bear the indignation of the Lord, because we have sinned
against him, etc. And to let our selves to the duties of Fasting, and Prayers,
and Tears, for the lamentation and expiation of so horrid an iniquity from his
Majesty and the Kingdom. But we could not be persuaded that it were a
Christian course for us to make His iniquity the countenance or excuse of ours:
or admit it as a supersedeas or discharge of the bond of our allegiance, though
it should render it indeed much discomfortable unto us; for as a Child owes his
filial honor and obedience not to a good Father, but to a Father, be he good
or bad: so Subjects their allegrance not to a good King but to the King: and
though we deny not but Potentates may forfeit their Crowns by their
impieties, yet the holy Word of God leads us to believe that none is thereby
enabled to take that forfeiture but God; Saul forfeited his Crown by his
Sacrilegious intrusion into the Office and Function of the Priesthood, 1 Samuel
13 8. etc. and doubled that forfeiture by his disobedience unto the Command of
God concerning Agag and the spoil, 1 Samuel 1^.9. etc. And God both times
proceeds to sentence against him: but yet none must take the forfeiture, nor
put the Sentence in execution, till God himself was pleased to do it: And
therefore notwithstanding all that, David durst not lift up his hand against
him, 1 Samuel 24. and 26. David himself afterward, though an holy man, yet was
so far left unto himself for a time by God, that he fell into two horrid and
unworthy sins: base in the eyes of men as well as heinous in the sight of
God: First, committing adultery with Bathshcha, at such a time when her husband
whom he so vilely wronged therein, was employed in the hazarding of his life to
do his service; and then to cover that, treacherously contriving and procuring
his murder: and yet this was no good plea to justify Absalom or the son of
Bichri in their rebellions: no nor yet Shimei in his foule-mouthed railing
against him for it: But all of them were in their times overtaken with their
rewards: and David yet ended his days in peace, being reconciled to God by his
repentance. Nero was as it were a Devil incarnate, so had, that his
wickedness added glory to the persecutions of those that suffered by him: And
Tertullian uses it as an argument to prove Christianity to be good, because
Nero opposed it: He made it his sport to see his own Imperial City set on
fire before his face: and then when he had done, caused it most falsely and most
wickedly to be laid upon the Christians. And embrued his hands in the blood of
his own Mother: and yet it is observed this very Nero was then Emperor and
Governor of the Remanes at that very time when Saint Paul wrote unto them to
be subject unto the higher powers: and tells them withal, that whoever resists
shall receive to himself damnation. Let not any think that in this we plead
for the wickedness of Kings: we are so far from it, that as we do believe
the same sins to be more heinous in them then in other men, and that their
very iniquities contract greatness from their greatness: so we know and wish
they may always remember that their punishments, if they take not heed, will
keep the proportion too, and prove that sentence Canonical, though it be
written in the Apocrypha, that great men shall be greatly tormented; so that
they shall get nothing by their impunitie from men. Neither is it for their
sakes, but for others that they are so privileged: For the preservation of
Government, which is the good of the people.

Nor would we wish any to imagine that we think these patterns of wickedness
have any such paralells in his sacred Majesty's story, if it may be truly set
down as some would persuade, but only to show the unforciblenesse of such kind
of deductions as our days have produced: and if it may be, to prevent the like
hereafter. And to show you here, that the Kings Right unto his Crown and
Government is entire against all that you have said, though it could be made
appear (which God forbid we should imagine) and if so, than there is no ground
for us either to withdraw our Allegiance from him: nor is there any
justification to be found for your strange, undutifull, and we think
unpatterned resolutions: Wherein you that are subjects, and in the highest
consideration of your unlapsed Being; but the great Council of the King have
resolved, not only to make no more addresses to him, but to receive no Messages
from him; so that if he should happily learn so much humility more by his
sufferings, as to petition you for food or raiment, or to obtain a Physician
for his body, in case of sickness, or a Divine for his soul in another case,
or in any other way wherein the good of the Kingdom may be concerned never so
much; yet like the Adder you have stopped your ears against him, and forbidden
all others under the danger of the penalties of Traitors (a strange punishment
for such a sin) not to receive any Messages from him, nor to make any unto
him.

As if to imprison your King, to banish Him into an Island, to Sequester Him
from the comforts of His Wife, His Children, His Friends, His Servants; to
deprive Him of the very means of His Salvation, by denying Him the assistance
of His Chaplains: as if all this and much more were nothing, unless you did
withal interdict Him all Society of Mankind: the monstious injustice and
cruelty whereof we may well wish had rather been found amongst Purkes and
Heathens thou us: and grieve that it should pollute any Christian and English
Story; But that we may save you the labor of studying, or troubling your
selves overmuch about the disposing of the Government of this Kingdom; we
desire you to remember, that whenever, and by what means soever the Lord
shall please to put a period unto the Reign of His Majesty, we are
sufficiently instructed who it is that is immediately to succeed Him in the
Government; since we have not yet forgetten by his long and forced absence,
that we have a Noble Prince in the world, descended from the blood not only of
the Ancient Kings of these Nations, in so continued and unquestionable a
descent, as is enough to stop the mouth of malice it self; but also from the
Loins of many glorious Foreign Kings, whose Interest God defend we should
have any thought of violating, or consenting with any that shall attempt i^:
and whilst it is so, there is no imaginable he mane Act or accident that can
put the Government of this Nation into your hands, or leave it to your
disposing So that your conclusions that you draw so hard for, that you have
even broken your Geeres, stick still in the mire, and you are run away without
them, gingling your Bells as if all were at your heels: we are still to seek
for a sound reason why the King should be secluded from His Government, or from
the addresses of a Parliament unto Him, whose very Essence depends upon a
correspondence and communion with him, since it is their very Parliamentary
being to be His Councellers; which cannot stand with a professed interception
of addresses unto Him, and from Him; nor yet it that were as you would have it,
were we to expect a new way of Government or Governors from you. And if the
Giant and the A^hilles of your Declaration, with all the allowances that can be
admitted is so weak, much less will your purposes lind a For resse in any
thing else that you have said, which for our selves we have no power to
examine; nor have we found truth and sidelity so constant a Companion with all
things that have been averred with much confidence in these times, as to depend
in this upon bare avercoments; Si satis est accusasse, quis taudem innocens?
God himself should not be innocent, if to be accused were to be convicted; we
hold it therefore most unjust and unreasonable for us to admit any of those
aspersions which you have laid upon His Majesty into our belief, or to make
any results at all upon them in the least degree prejudicial to His Majesty
in our opinions, until we shall see as well what His Majesty can answer, as
what you have objected against Him; for since it is a justice not to be denied
to the meanest of Subjects, nay, to the greatest slaves, that they have liberty
to speak for themselves, before judgment be given upon their accusation: we
must tell you that we hold it a thing against all equity and right, for you to
take the freed^^^e to say what you please against His Majesty, and in the mean
time to keep Him in that restraint, that He can neither know what you have
objected, nor has liberty to make His Answer thereunto; We do therefore desire
it of you in point of justice to His Majesty, and in regard of satisfaction to
our selves, that this Declaration of yours may be speedily communicated to His
Majesty, and that He may have free liberty (with the help of such
Secretaries, and others that shall be needful, to help His Memory, and to do
Him other requisite service therein,) to make what Answer He shall think fit
thereunto: and that the said Answer may be as freely published and perused as
this your Declaration. If you shall deny us this, we shall have so much the
more reason to continue and augment our suspicions: That there was too much
gall in that ink that wrote those lines which you have sent abroad, and that
they are not of such solid matter as to endure the examination and trial of a
just Reply, and shall therefore endeavor to banish all other impressions
thereof from us, but of hatred unto such unrighteous practices, and that which
we shall now briefly set down:

First, that we believe it not impossible, nor a thing to be much wondered (...)
by us, or to stick by us in any great prejudice to his Majesty: That the sad
condition and manifold difficulties wherewith his Majesty has encountered
through the miscarriages of others, have found him a man: and therefore
(possibly) have driven him some times into some refuges that were not so proper
for him at other times, and in another temper of things: as we have observed
many miscarriages perhaps in others, on less temptations.

2. That in the manage of such affairs which his Majesty has been put upon:
and in such a crowd of extraordinary and various exigents, it was not always
possible for His Majesty to do all things with His own hand, or to examine
all things by His own are or judgment, that have passed as His Acts: many
things were necessary to be committed to the trust of others: and if perhaps
any of them have failed therein, we dare not lay this to the charge of His
Majesty.

3. Therefore we conceive in all equity, that his Majesty ought not to be judged
of by us or his people, by the passages that have fallen out in this distemper
of his Reign. As we judge not of the complexion of bodies in their distempers,
but in their natural and healthful constitutions, and therefore we conceive
all or the greatest part that has fallen out in this business, though it did
appear (as it does not,) ought to have bin left out of your Declaration.

4. And then fourthly, we can remember or find so little before these times,
that has not been repaired abundantly, or satisfied by his Majesty, that we
can find nothing to rest an evil thought against him justly thereupon.

5. That we find in the recollection unto our memories, of diverse passages
that have of late fallen from his Majesty: That you have no such cause as you
pretend to complain of his obstruction of Peace, since we have found him
willing as appears by his late Messages unto you: To sacrifice all his own
power and greatness upon the matter, (more for ought we find than ever any
King yet offered) to the peace and preservation of us his people: And that the
maine things that he stands upon, are the interest of his people in Religion
and Liberty, and the interest of his son, and not his own, and we should be
most unthankful should we desert him for seeking to guard as in those things
which are so precious unto us.

6. That we are upon good grounds so well persuaded of his Majesty, that we
doubt not but very much of what is charged against him will fall short of
evidence: and are the issues of her of misinformation or mis-interpretation.

And lastly, we desire to let you know that our Allegiance is yet unmoved by
this battery: so far that we do yet desire of you the restitution of our
King, and that his may be admitted to a personal Treaty; that we may enjoy
again the benefit of that happy Government which has (...) so prosperous and
comfortable unto us. And that you will not to make good your own ends and
purposes, expose us unto the hazard or another bloody war, lest your selves
be partakers of the evils thereof. Assuring you, that although we know not what
God may permit you to force us unto otherwise by that power which you have,
with other colors and profession, gotten into your hands; Yet in this we shall
not fall by Gods help; In endeavoring to preserve our Allegiance to His
Majesty and our fidelity to His Posterity after Him: Desiting only t^ be
tesolved of this one question by you as the latter ends Why the House of Lords
was waved in a matter of so great concernment to the Kingdom.

We beseech God of his infinite mercy to restore His Majesty in His good time
from that sad (...) of affliction He is in, not only to the great hurt, but
dishonor also of this Nation; and that he will put some softness into your
hearts, that you may yet think upon those courses that may be for the
preservation of this poor abused and bleeding Kingdom, from an utter and
final destruction.

FINIS.
