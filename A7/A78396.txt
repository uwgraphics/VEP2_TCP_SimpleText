THE Cavalliers advice to his Majesty, together with his answer to their
desires. Also his Majesty's Intentions for the avoiding of my Lord of Essex his
approach with certain Propositions propounded by the Cavalliers unto His
Majesty, concerning the procurement of their general pardon, all which truly
gathered and compacted out of a letter sent from Coventry, to a Cizen of LONDON.
THe Cavalliers having Intelligence of my Lord of Essex, his coming toward
them and knowing themselves to be fare to weak to oppose so great an Army as
they suppose he would bring along with him, therefore they thought it meet
amongst themselves to Petition. and desire his Majesty for the safety of their
persons: to be pleased to take to his royal considerration for the obtaining of
some means for their safer protection, and as for their parts they knew noe
better way then for his Majesty to Cross the Sea: and crave the assistance of
foreign Forces, his Majesty hearing of their petition seemd much to dislike
of it, alleging that were no better then for to avoid Scylla, and fall into
Charybdis, therefore His Majesty after a small contemplation resolved them what
he would do, which was to effect, that he would remove all his Forces by
degrees unto Wales to Loyd-loo Castle, where he well knew he should find many
faithful and trusty persons, especially my Lord of Carbery, and whatsoever
power and Forces he could raise, likewise alleging that the mountains and
hills would be cumbersome for my Lord of Essex and his horsemen to come over,
especially with their Ammunition; but yet with all this the Cavalliers were not
thoroughly satisfied, for their wicked guilty Consciences harbored still a
jealousy of future dangers, therefore they urged certain Propositions to his
Majesty, of which the chief were these three particulars. First, that if His
Majesty would not with prone willingness condescend to their desire, he would
be pleased to continue in the same steadfast resolutions (to wit) adventure and
undergo all dangers whatsoever (without any yielding) as they would do, or
that in case if his Majesty did unite himself with His both Houses of
Parliament, he would be pleased to obtain them a general pardon for all
crimes whatsoever that may be laid to their charge, the second proposition and
demand was, that seeing they had adventured both their lives and fortunes in
His Majesty's behalf and service to the prejudice and danger of their utter
ruin, that His Majesty would be pleased in consideration thereof amply to
reward them for their said adventure, and if that in case His Majesty were not
of power sufficient to accomplish the same to so great a number, that then he
would be pleased to give them way to satisfy themselves, to connive at their
wickedness that they might pillage the houses of all those that should any way
oppose his will and thereby satisfy themselves. The third and last was, that
if His Majesty would not cross the Sea for his safety, he would be pleased to
give way for the Irish Rebels to come over to assist his person. To their
first demand His Majesty answered that he would willingly undergo and be equal
sharers in all their dangers, but as for his yielding, ere he would see His 3.
Kingdoms massacred, upon lawful and just considerations he was resolved to
comply with his both Houses of Parliament, but wirh such an exception as that
there should be a general pardon granted to all, or at least wise he would
endeavor with his utmost power to procure the same, to their second demand he
answered, that for their loyalty to him in adventuring their lives and fortunes
in his behalf, it should not be unthought of, if ought in him might yield
requital, yet would not he by no means consent to the rifling and pillaging
of any of his Subjects houses without they were manifestly known to be
Traitors to his Person, at their third and last demand, he seemed to be
extraordinarily moved by reason of so unjust a Petition, therefore he gave to
that a plain and flat denial, only for the safety of his person, his
resolution was to go to Wales to Loyd-loo Chastle afterward if he found not
that a sufficient harbor, he would take to further consideration, concerning
crossing the Sea, the Cavalliers at this being dismayed partly through fear of
future dangers, and partly to avoid my Lord of Essex his approach, many of them
fled away and forsook his Majesty, others more resolutely bent, kept still with
his Person toward Wales, where it is reported his Majesty intends to take
harbor. Likewise many of the Scots hearing of my Lord of Essex his intention
came over to Dover Castle, with a desire to present their service unto his
Excellency and their endeavors, for the assistance of his person, where they
no sooner landed, but that they heard beating of drums by certain Cavalliers
for the levying of men in his Majesty's service against the Parliament, they
desirous to know further the Cavalliers intention, went to them under pretense
of being assistance for them, but finding their resolutions to be so wicked,
neither agreeable to the Laws of God, nor the laws of man, fell there upon
them turning their faces about, so that the Cavalliers were greatly
discomfited, and glad every man to run away, and shift for himself.

Oxford Scholars in like manner had a great overthrow by the four hundred
Troopers sent thither by the command of both the honorable Houses of
Parliament, to search certain Delinquents and Cavalliers, and other
ill-affected persons which the Scholars there had harbored, for the Scholars
before the said Troopers arived thither were mighty unruly, beating the
Townsmen away, so that they were fame to fly for refuge, some to Abington,
some to Tame, others to Botley leaving all their goods behind them, but at the
coming thither of the said Troopers they all returned and joined forces
together. The Scholars had no intellgence of then coming until they were
almost upon the skirts of the Town past Shotover wood, then they suspected
their intentions, and caused the gates of every College to be shut, but the
Troopers no sooner came over the bridge, but that they began to batter at
Magdalen College, and Magdalen Hall being the two first in their way, but first
demanding for Doctor Fruen, being President of the College to have the gates
opened, who the Scholars replied was out of town at Gloucester, for he is Deane
of that Cathedral, yet nevertheless the gates were not opened for the
present, till such time that the Soldiers began to batter the Chapel
windows, whereof one window being at the East end of the Chapel of Dark
work which was valued at an hundred pound, which was beaten down to pieces,
with many other windows of thirty pound price; Upon this assault the gates
were opened and entrance was given, and there they found certain Cavalliers in
Scholars habits, who were known to be so by their Feathers, Buffe Coats, and
other Warlik habits found in their Chambers.

Some nine or ten of the Scholars there behaved themselves very saucily
toward the Soldiers, scoffing at them, and at the honorable Houses of
Parliament, especially one Robinson a Demi of that College, he with the rest
were taken Prisoners; they made search for Ammunition but they found none,
only great store of Plate, among which a piece was termed by the name of the
Parliament pot (given it seems by some of the Nobility at the last Parliament
held there) which was valued to be worth threescore pound; all this while many
of the Troopers were dispersed to several Colleges, some to new College,
some to All-Soules, others to Bailoll, and Saint John's, they found some small
store of Ammunition, which as it was thought was conveyed thither by Bishop
Laud, for he has been formerly of that College. In this house likewise one
Painter a Master of Arts was found with a Libell in his pocket, made against
certain men of that County that stood firmly affected for the Parliament,
those that went to search Jesus College found no Ammunition there, only the
Doctor somewhat stern, and as they conceived by his discourse no extraordinary
well wisher to the honorable Houses of Parliament; this College was not well
fraught with Plate, all the store they had was conveyed and hid in the
Mansiples house at Saint Giles Parish, who told the Soldiers at their
approaching unto his house that they were all knaves, for which he was feign
to fly for his pains. Also one Edwards a North Wales man, fellow of this House
was taken prisoner for the abusefull terms he spoke in the behalf of a
Cavallier that was a friend of his

Some of the most ignorant Troopers went to the Schools taking it for a
College, and there lay searching and tumbling too and fro of the Library
Books; but all this while the chief of the Cavalliers were sheltred in Christ
Church, where they had above the gate laid heaps of stones at their entering
for to fall on the Troopers heads. Some others stood in study windows with
Pistolls in their hands, but our men having notice by the Citizens of all that
they intended, went in at the back Gate opposite to Oriall College, and
through Canterbury quadrangle, so that some of the Scholars and Cavalliers
hastening to fly away, running through the other gate were cruelly wounded in
their own Traps, and taken by our Soldiers thereby, to the number of two
hundred, whereof fourscore are already sent to London, and imprisoned in
several places, the rest are in hand hourly expected to come; many places of
the Colleges are extremely pestred by our Soldiers, by reason of the
Scholars obstinacy, especially their Libraries and windows, and many of the
Cavalliers are still lurking there in by places as well as the Colleges, which
makes our Soldiers so long billet there without returning.

FINIS.
