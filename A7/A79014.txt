C. R.

BY THE KING.
His Majesty's Proclamation forbidding all His loving Subjects of the Counties
of Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire, to raise any Forces without His
Majesty's Consent, or to enter into any Association or Protestation for the
assistance of the Rebellion against His Majesty.

WHEREAS We have been informed of certain Propositions agreed upon by some
seditious Persons of Our several Counties of Kent, Surry, Sussex and
Hampshire, for an Association betwixt the said Counties, to raise an Army of
3000 Foot, and 300 Horse, and great sums of Money for the maintenance
thereof, and an Invitation to Our good Subjects of that County, to enter into a
Protestation to assist them in this odious and unnatural Rebellion; We do
hereby Declare for the satisfaction of all our loving Subjects of those
Counties, and that they may not be seduced from their Obedience by the cunning
and subtilty of those men, That the entering into such an Association and
Protestation, and raising of men or contributing Money upon the same, is an Act
of high Treason, and an endeavor to take away Our Life from Us: And We do
therefore straightly Charge and Command all Our loving Subjects whatsoever upon
their Allegiance not to enter into any such Association or Protestation, and
such, as by color of such Authority have assembled together, that they
immediately di^band and repair to their Houses. And We do once more renew Our
offer of a free and gracious Pardon to all Our Subjects of Our said four
several Counties, excepting those whom We before excepted in Our several
Proclamations concerning those Our Counties, against all which We shall proceed
according to the Rules of the Law, as against Persons guilty of high Treason;
And whom We do hereby require all Our Officers and Ministers of Justice, and
all Our loving Subjects whatsoever, to apprehend and cause to be kept in safe
custody. And Our Express Pleasure is, and We do hereby Will and Command all
the several Tenants of the Persons excepted in Our Proclamation for those
four Counties of Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire, and all other Persons
who are any way indebted unto them, and all the Tenants to any other Person of
any of the said Counties, who is now in Actual and open Rebellion against Us,
or who after the publishing of this Our Proclamation shall contribute to the
maintenance of the Armies now in Rebellion against Us, under the conduct of
Robert Earl of Essex, or of any other Person or Persons, or that shall join
in any such traitorous Association or Protestation, That they forbear to pay
any Rents or Debts due to the said several Persons, but detain the same in
their hands toward the maintenance of the Peace of the Counties, and the
reparation of such Men who have suffered by the violence of the others. And if
any Soldier or Soldiers now under Command against Us in either of Our said
four Counties, shall within six days after the publishing of this Our
Proclamation, apprehend and bring before Us, or any Officers of Our Army, or
any other Our Minister of Justice, so that the Person apprehended be kept in
safe Custody, the bodies of any of the Persons so excepted by Us, or of any of
the Commanders or Officers now in Rebellion against Us in any of the said four
Counties, such Soldier or Soldiers, besides their Pardons, shall receive such
liberal Rewards by Pensions, or otherwise, as their several services in
respect of the qualities of the Persons so apprehended shall deserve. And if
any Commander or Officer (except the Persons before excepted) now in Rebellion
against Us, in any of the said four Counties, shall within five days after
this Our Proclamation published, being convinced in his Conscience of his
damnable Offense against God and Us, in assisting this odious Rebellion,
return to his Alleagiance and repair to Our Army, and commit no hostile Act
in the mean while against Us, We shall not only Pardon him, but so far employ
him as his quality and deme^nour shall deserve. And We do hereby require all
Our loving Subjects of what degree or quality soever, within Our said four
several Counties, upon their Allegiance, and as they tender the cause of God,
the Protestant Religion, being invaded and threatened to be rooted up by
Anabaptists, Brownists, and Atheists, of Us, and Our Posterity (Our Life being
sought after by this Rebellion, and of themselves, the Law and Liberty of the
Subject being in apparent hazard to be subjected to an Arbitrary Lawless
power, of a few Schismatic, factious, and ambitious Persons) to assist Us in
Person, or with the Loan of Money, Plate, and Horses, in this Our great
necessity. And having said thus much out of Our tender Regard of Our Subjects
of those our Counties; If they shall henceforward be guilty of the premises:
And shall either by Loan or contribution assist the said Army of Rebels,
assemble and muster themselves in Arms withour Authority derived from Us under
Our Hand, or shall enter into any Oath of Association for opposing Us and Our
Army, and so compel Us to send part of Our Forces thither to reduce them to
their Obedience; they must Answer the miseries that must follow, to God, and
their Country. And Our Pleasure is, That this Our Proclamation be Read in all
the Parish Churches and Chapels in the said four several Counttes.

Given at Our Court at Oxford, this sixteenth day of February, in the
Eighteenth year of Our Reign.
