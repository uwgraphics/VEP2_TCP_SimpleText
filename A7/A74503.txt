AN ORDINANCE FOR Passing Custodies OF Idiots and Lunaticks.
WHereas by an Act of the late Parliament on the behalf of Idiots and Lunaticks,
it was, among other things, enacted, That the Bills for passing of the Custodies
of the said Idiots and Lunaticks, should be signed by the Council of State
before the Commissioners of the Great Seal of England should pass the same
under the said Seal; And whereas that Council is since dissolved, Be it
Ordemed by his Highness the Lord PROTECTOR, by and with the advice and consent
of his Council, That the Chancellor, Keeper, or Commissioners of the Great Seal
for the time being, do not pass the said Custodies under the Great Seal, before
the same be signed by His Highness the Lord PROTECTOR, and that the same so
signed by His Highness, shall be a sufficient warrant for passing the same
under the said Great Seal, Any Law, Statute, Act, Ordinance or Custom to the
contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.

Monday 20th March, 1653.
Ordered by his Highness the Lord PROTECTOR and the COUNCIL, that this
Ordinance be forthwith printed and published.

Hen. Scobell, Clerk of the Council.
