Rare Physic for the Church sick of an Ague.
THE languishing Church being extreme sick of many dangerous diseases, had
once began almost to sing its ultimum vale to the World, it was so turbulently
distracted by the contentious opinions of some Schismatic disturbers
thereof: And being in this deep Malady, many in an honest deploration condoled
her estate; yet commiserating her distress farther, they would not leave her
desolate of relief and comfort, but did co unitely concur in one unanimous
contribution to elevate and restore her to its former prosperity and pristine
health. First then they agreed in a conclusive determination to send for all
the Neighbors round to visit and consolate her: The Protestants were first
sent for, because they were the next Neighbors to her, who when they beheld
apparently her desperate sickness, every one endeavored to add a salve
thereunto; one would have cast her water, but the two Universities dammed up,
and stopped the running thereof, for fear it should run to Amst^rdam:
Another perceiving an obstacle there, labored to find out her Disease,
supposing her to be sick of the Mother: A third replied, that she could scarce
attain to that maturity, since she labored so lately of a young Suckling:
Another answered, that she was abused by one living at the backside of Brownes
barn, who ^ut of his running Hogshead broached such strange and prodigious
prophesies to his prickear'd Auditors, that it stuck deeply in her Stomach, and
from thence she contracted so great a burning Fever, that many Books could not
withstand the Flame thereof. They sent secondly to the Roundheads desiring
their assistance to help this distorted Church, but they were so greatly
employed at Cheapside-Crosse, that they could spare no time to come to her. The
puritans were next sent for, but they were in such hasty preparation for
New England, that their consciences could not suffer them to steal so much
time, to comfort the sick, which they never could endure to do in their
lives. There are many places for several men appointed, and yet I wonder
extremely, that one should be deficient: There is Newgate appointed for
Thieves, Bridewell for idle persons, the Counters for Drunkards, ^^^gate for
Debtors, Bedlam for mad men, and Hospitals for lame persons; yet amongst them
all (I wonder) there is no place for Fools, but in their New plantation (I
think) they will erect an hospital^ for Fools, where they may do many
miraculous deeds of charity, yet I hope some of them will be wise enough to
admit themselves there first, because charity begins at home. The Familists
were next sent for, but some of the holy Brethren being asleep, the others
were occupied by their wives in a conjunction copulative, and being so
zealously employed, they could not s^ffurate so much time to come. Thus the
Church being variously distracted between these Sects, is involved in an
irremiable labyrinth of opinions, and hereupon recontracted such desperate
diseases, that it still requires a more auxiliary remedy. The surest way then,
that I can conceive herefrom, is to send for the Doctors, who I suppose have
more sciential skill to resolve us of her malady, but they with their New Canons
are so employed in the Tower to defend the City, for they would otherwise
willingly have come, but only they stumbled on the protestation and the Tower
stood in their way, which hindered their voluntary readiness: But in my
opinion it was well they were excluded by so opportune an obstacle, for
otherwise (it is to be feared) they would have rather brought her former
dis^emper to a deep Consumption, and so consequently she might have layn on
her deathbed: but thanks be to the Omnipotent indulgencie of Almighty God, who
sent true and skillful Physicians unto her, to cure her disease; I mean the
Parliament, that illustrious Assembly of both Temporal and Ecclesiastical
Physicians: These as soon as they first perspicuously perceived the
dangerousnes of the disease, which by the long negligence of time she had
contracted, began first to cast her water, which made so many Fly over the
Ocean, that then she did seem respectively to recover. And after, there was
some hopes of preservative health remaining, they thought it most expedient to
give her next a sound purge, which made so many impedimen all excrements of
papisticall adherents be evacuated from her, that she began to wax stronger
and stronger: Thus the Church was delivered our of the almost incurable disease
of popery and superstition, and so Flourshed a while; till at length for want
of strong suporters she became feeble again, and by the imaginary
countenancing of too much licentiousnes, she is now sick of the Staggers, and
unless she has another purge given her, and that speedily too, to purge her
from Brownianisme, necessarily she will fall into the former, or as bad, if not
worse) disease: For as the one swelled too high in popish opinions, and had
almost overwhelmed her, so the latter dives so low in Heresy, that it will (it
is supposed) almost sink her: But the Judicious and physical knowledge of the
parliament will no doubt accurately cure her; the best way that I can conceive
for her recovery is to be let blood, and then some hopes of reformation may be
expected to her great health and prosperity, the Kingdoms happiness, and the
Immortal Glory of those illustrious Physicians of the Parliament.

FINIS.
