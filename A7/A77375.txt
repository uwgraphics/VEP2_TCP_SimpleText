The Letter of Colonel Bridges.
Sir be pleased to receave a Relation of the Victory whereof I have now sent an
Express to the Honorable Committee of both Kingdoms.
PRince Maurices Regement, the Reformado troop, Collo^el Knottisfords troop,
Captain Wilds troop, and Captain Gunters troop being sent by the Prince to
intercept the convoy of Powder and Match which I sent with the party desighned
for Gloucester, And for that end came to Quienton in Gl^u^estershire, but
finding the party had passed by some hours before, and having intelligence
that all our horse were marched from Warwick, resolved to (...) the advantage
to plunder the C^ came to Stratford upon Avon, and demanded 800 pounds or they
would plunder the town; but upon the present payment of a 10 pounds, Remitted
the rest, and came toward Warwick, and in their march swept away all the Beasts
they met withal, of which I having notice (being desirous to save the
Country as well as I could) prevailed with Captain Andrews who was then
accidentally in Town with 80 of Newport Horse which were also to March to
Gloucester, being also assisted by the committee of Worcestershire with 30 or
40 of Captain Milwards and Captain Halfords Troops, with these and about a
dozen of our own Horse that staid behind our Troop having drawn four
companies out of the Town and Castle, I advanced toward the Enemy, who by
this was come within two miles of Warwick: having in Sherborne Field put
themselves in four considerable Bodies, and sent a small party away with their
plundered Beasts; we lyned the hedges with our foot and faced them with our
Horse near two hours, in which time, in some loose skirmishes we having
killed one and took two or three prisoners, the Enemy drew of and being to
march through a long lane J caused the foot to advance, and when the Rear
guard took the lane, J desired the Horse to charge, which they did
accordingly, but the enemy having a convenient place in the midst of the Lane
to draw up a reserve, made good their own retreat, and beat our men back in
some disorder but Major Castle and my self hastening up with the foot, and
having almost Recovered the end of the Lane perceiveing them disordered, J
galloped up, and by persuasions and threats, caused the Horse to rally; and
make a stand which the enemy perceiving forbore to pursue their advantage:
Whereupon I desired Major Hawkswor^h (who was also accidentally in town, and
behaved himself very gallantly in the whole action that he would hold the
enemy in play with the Horse in the Lane, that Major Castle and my self might
in the interim bring up the foot on the other side of the hedge; But the enemy
perceiving our intentions, marched ^o with out any loss, and drew up a gain
in the next field, and we did the like, and there faced eachother three or
four hours, sometimes skirmishing with small parties of Horse, and the foot
otherwhiles sending some Musket balls amongst them, where by the enemy
received some small loss, as we did from their Carbines J having my Horse
also shot: At length I perceiveing the enemies resolution to March away, there
being ashort Lane at the end of this Great field through which they must
necessarily March: and much troubled to think of the poor Countries loss
called the Officers together and told them, this was the last opportunity
which if lost the Enemy would march clear away, and therefore desired Major
Hawksworth and Captain Andrews to be ready when the Enemies Rear guard
should come to take the lane to give them a resolute charge and conceiving that
if they could put them to the Rout, happily all the rest might thereby be
disordered: and in case our hor should be put to the worse, I desired they
would retire behind the foot, which I would cause to advance as fast as I
could to countenance them, and did not doubt through Gods blessing) but to hold
up the enemy until they should have time to rally, and be ready to give, or
receive another charge, which they assenting to, and I having imparted our
resolves to the several divisions, caused the foot to advance which the enemy
perceiving, and in a greater body then they expected, hasted to make a retreat
through the lane, but in a very orderly manner. And Major Hawksworth, Captain
Andrews, Captain Milward and some other horse Officers according to the former
conclusions took their time so right, and quitted themselves so bravely, as in
their first charge they took Pitcher the Captain of the Reformadoes, who
commanded the Rear guard, and routed not only that party, but all the rest:
killed about ten in the place, and in the persuit (whereof diverse were Officers
and men of good quality) wounded very many, and diverse mortally, took near
sixty prisoners, of which many very considerable, 120 horses at least, one
horse colors which was all I saw in the field, or could hear of, pursued them
4 or 5 miles, recovered all the plundered beasts, and one cart load of broad
cloth, and utterly scattered the remainder of them: so as the Princes Surgeon
that is sent hither to take care of their wounded men, tells us he has not
known such a route: some flying to Camden, Evesham, Worcester, Witch, many
without Hats, others without horses, and few with swords, the praise of all
which be given to God, who only gives all victories, I rest.

This Victory was obtained Friday the 13 of April 1645

Your humble Servant I. B
