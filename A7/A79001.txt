By the King
A Proclamation for the authorizing an uniformity of the Book of Common
Prayer to Be used throughout the REALM.
ALthough it cannot be unknown to Our Subjects by the former Declarations we
have published, what Our purposes and proceedings have been in matrers of
Religion since our coming to this Crown: Yet the same being now by Us reduced
to a settled form, We have occasion to repeat somewhat of that which has
passed: and how at our very first entry into the Realm, being entertained and
importuned with Informations of sundry Ministers, complaning of the errors and
imperfections of the Church here, as well in matters of Doctrine, as of
Discipline: Although We had no reason to presume that things were so far
amiss, as was pretended, because We had seen the Kingdom under that form of
Religion which by Law was established in the days of the late Queen of famous
memory, blessed with a peace and prosperity, both extraordinary and of many
years continuance (a strong evidence that God was there with well pleased,)
Yet because the importunity of the Complainers was great, their afsirmations
vehement, and the zeal wherewith the same did seem to be accompained, very
specious: We were moved thereby to, make it Our occassion to discharge the
duty Which is the chiefest of all Kingly duties, that is to settle the
affairs of Religion, and the Service of God before there own. Which while we
ware in hand to do as the contagion of the sisicknesse reigning in Our City of
London and other places, would permit an assembly of persons meet for that
purpose; Some of those who misliked the state of Religion here established,
presuming more of Our intents then ever We gave them cause to do, and
transported with humor, began such proceedings, as did raither raise a
scandal in the Church, then rake offense away. For both they used forms of
public serving of God not hear allowed, held assemblies without Authority,
and did other things carrying a very show of Sedition more then of Zeal: whom
We restrained by a former Proclamation in the month of October last, and gave
intimation of the co^nerence We intended to be had With as much speed is
conveniently could be, for the ordering of those things of the Church, which
accordingly followed in the month of January last at Our Honor of Hampton
Court where before Our Self, and Our Privy Counsel were assembled many of
the gravest Bishops and Prelates of the Realm, and many other learned men,
as well of those that are conformable to the State of the Church established, as
of those that dissented. Among whom what Our pains were, what Our patience in
heareing and replying, and what the indifferency and uprightness of Our
judgment in determining, We leave to the report of those who heard the same,
contenting our Self with the sincerity of Our own heart therein. But We
cannot conceal, that the success of that Conference was such, as happens to
many other things, which mooving great expectation before they be entered into,
in their issue produce small effects. For We found mighty and vehement
Informations supported with so weak and slender proofs as it appears unto
Us, and Our Counsel, that there was no cause why any change should have been
at all in that which was most impugned, the book of Common Prayer, containing
the form of the public Service of God here established, neither in the
doctrine which appeared to be sincere, nor in the Forms and Rite which were
justified out of the practice of the Primitive Church Notwith standing, we
thought meet, with consent of the Bishops and other learned men there present,
That some small things might raither be explaned then change, not that the
same might not very well have been borne with by men who have made a reasonable
construction of them: but for that in a matter concerning the Service of God
We were nice, or rather jealous, that the public Form thereof should be
free not only from blame, but from suspicion, so as neither the common
Adversary should have advantage to wrest ought therein contained, to other
sense then the Church of England intends, nor any troublesome or ignorant
person of this Church be able to take the least occasion of cavil against it:
And for that purpose gave forth Our Commission under our great Seal of
England, to the Archbishop of Canterbury and others, according to the form
which the Laws of the Realm in like Case prescribe to be used, to make the
said Explanation, and to cause the whole Book of Common Prayer to be newly
printed. Which being now done, and established anew after so serious a
deliberation, although We doubt not but all our Subjects both Ministers and
others, will receive the same with such reverence as appertains, and conform
themselves there to every man in that which him concerns: Yet have we thought
it necessary, to make known by Proclamation Our authorizing of the same, And
to Requier and enjoyne all men, as well Ecclesiastical as Temporal, to
Conform themselves unto it, And to the practice thereof, as the only public
form of serving God, established and allowed to be in this Realm. And the
rather for that all the learned men who were there present, as well of the
Bishops as others, promised their conformity in the practice of it, only
making suit to Us; that some few might be borne with for a time.

Werefore We require all Archbishops, Bishops, and all public Ministers
as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, to do their duty in causing the same to be
obeyed, and in punishing the offenders according to the Laws of the Realm
heretofore established, for the authorizing of the said book of Common prayer.
And We think it also necessary, that the said Archbishops and Bishops, do
each of them in his Province and Diocese take order, That every parish do
procure to themselves within such time as they shall think good to limite, one
of the said Book so explained. And last of all We do admonish all men, that
hereafter they shall not expect, nor attempt any further alteration in the
Common and public form of Gods Service, from this which is now established,
for that neither will We give way to any to presume, that our own judgments
having determined in a matter of this weight shall be swaied to alteration by
the frivolous suggestions of any light spirit: neither are We ignorant of the
inconveniences that do arise in Government, by admitting innovation in things
once settled by mature deliberation: And how necessary it is to use constancy
in the upholding of the public determination of State, for that such is the
unquietness and unstedfastnesse of some dispositions, affecting every year
new forms of things, as, if they should be followed in their unconstancie,
would make all actions of States ridiculous and contemptible: whereas the
steadfast maintaining of things by good advice established, is the wealth of all
the Commonwealth.

Given at our Court the 5: day of March.
Printed at London 1642.
