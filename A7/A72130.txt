TO HIS SINGVLER good friend and loouing Cuntreyman, Master Robert Handley
Citizen and Grocer of London and Merchant Venterer into the Cuntries of Spain
Richard Galis wishes long life and prosperity to the pleasure of God and his
souls health.
AFter I was given to understand of your safe return from Spanish soil (most
deer and singular good Friend) and of your happy arrival here into this
City, I was often in heart more desirous, then in effects any vviaesable,
with some small toke^ of my good vvil to gratulate your vvelcome home, and to
thentent I might not be touched with that odible vice of Ingratitude (a vice
of all men most to be detested) I imagined many times with my self which
way I might best frame mine ability, by using some part of renuneration for
your manifold courtesies (as we upon my self as for my sake upon my Friends
employed) to avoid the same, emongst which my cogitations this handful of
scribled and banerpapers containing the vvunderfull and most strange cruelty
of Elizabeth Style alias Rockingham and her associates lately at Abingdon
revvarded with the guerdo^ due for their demerits, came to my mind, which
after I had finished albeit at the first deeming them unworthy of dedication
to any: yet at the last incensed with the natuall instinct of your gentle
disposition I was imboldened (the rather for that that you your self have
tasted of their cup of displeasure) to commend the same being the first fruits
of my labor to the gathering of your loouing hands thereby outwardly to shevve
what the inward heart desires if ability did not want, hoping that with
the most renowned Persian King Artaxerxes you vvil freendly vouchsafe
tha^kfully to receive this handful of cold water, the entire cognisaunce of
my vvilling mind, offered unto you, desiring you as leisure may serve you
thorovvly with your friends to peruse it, by reuoluing vvherof if you find
any delight, gently to think of the writer who wishes you increase of
health, wealth and felicity until the ti^e that Atrapos shall cut of the
thread of this your mortal life and that after you have passed the pace and
run the race of this short voyage and iournye and of this brittle frail and
unconstant life you may be placed, sociated, knit and comined in that
glittering light and blesfull life of that celestial Jerusalem amongst the
company of heavenly Souls and holy minds which do enjoy the life that only
may be called life and only Emire invincible.



Your assured Friend in the Lord Richard Galis.

AS thou have all ready most (gentle Reader begun to satisfy thy greedye eyes
with the freendly survey of the late confession of Elizabeth Style alias
Rockingam, comprehending not a handful to the number of their deuilish pagea^ts
played. So persevere still I beseech thee with no less good will to peruse this
true edition for thy sake and contentatio^ only set forth describing the
strange, cruel and diabolical tyranny practiced through the little regard
and great necligence of Magistrates in these our days winking at ye faults of
the Offenders which neither regarded the pitteful plaints of the tormented, nor
the continual plagues of the Tormentor powered out day by day upon their honest
and inocent Neighbors, some bereft of life, some of their wits and some of
the natural course of their lims.

Emongst which I being one of the least that suffered most and oftnest went to
ye pot, thought it good to set forth some part both of mine own troubles
and of diverse others for thy behoof, in reuolui^g whereof, if iro^ my hands thou
expect for my philed phrase or learned style being but misled up in a homely
cuntrie Cabin where the practice of the stayle and whip more riper is then
lernings lore, thou shall greatly be deceived. But if a plain Shepherds tale
neither profane or fained, oftener occupied in the tarbox and sheephook,
Instruments more fit for me then either pen or inck may serve thy turn: receive
thy desire. Employe therefore thy pains in pervsing the same, and if any thing
thou find that either presently co^tenteth thy mind or that herafter prove to
thy proffit: give thanks to them (and not to me) at whose instance I framed the
same, which do on in requital of my pains: I have that which I do expect.
Thus farwell gentle Reader.

The first attempt of Elizabeth Style alias Mother Rockingam and her
confederates Witches executed for their offenses the twentiesix day of February
last past practiced against the Author.
BEING AT Diverse and sundry times greeuouslye vexed, troubled and tormented
as well in Body as in Mind, some times in my raging fits detesting and
abhorring all Company, eftsoon again ernestly desiring the same, I often
Imagined with my self what strange disease and greef it should be that so
should (being whole in Body and not ouercharged with sickness, although
exempt of perfect remembrance) abate my flesh and weaken my Body, and lying in
my bed forworne with unquiet rest, heavy with over much watchi^g, and desirous to
va^quish my pains by taking a little sleep: suddenly about twelve a clock in
the night a shodowe of a huge and mighty black Cat, appeered in my Chamber,
which ye more as she approached near my bed side: so much the more began my
here to stand upright, my heart to faint, and my pains more and more to
increase, in so much I was constrained to call for my Fathers Maid, to vring a
Candle, whereby I might more clearly behold mine Enemy which did so euelly
entreat me, which Maid, being entered into my Chamber: I willed to look for
ye Cat, but she was not to be found, neither could the light which she brought
continue burning, at which strange sight being amassed: the Maid being gone to
bed again, and I left tumbling and tossing in my bed, more like to dye then any
longer to live, my sheets wringing wet with sweat caused through this sudden
fear, I called at the last to my remembrance a Brother of mine named James
Galis who about the A^e off fifteen years falling out with one Mother Dutton
one of the hellish brood, and at that time suspected to be in that indeed
which afterward she proved was in like sort taken in his bed, and bereft of
his wits, which until this day are not his own still crying away with the Witch
away with the Witch, I forewith coniectured that the same Cat which so amazed
me, was either some Witch or of some Witches sending and that my pains before
and at that instaunce sustained was by some Witch practiced upon me. Whereupon
knowing that prayer in all troubles and extremities was the cheifest string
whereon each true Christian ought for to strike, I took my prayer book wherein
was contained as well wholesome and godly prayers as psalms, and with the
brackish tears distilling from the fountains of my eyes, I sometimes red
therein, and sometime again singing Psalms to the honor and glory of God which
had vouchsafed of his mere mercy and goodness to strenghthen me in this my
afflictions, utterly from the bottom of my heart detesting and having in
defiaunce all the crew of deuilish Enchaunters, whereof England at this day
does abound. Persuading my self that God being my helper, buckler and
defense, neither any Witch nor all the Devils in hell (were they in number as
many as the sands in the Sea could have once power to hurt me, all this while
not forgetting Job whose faith no plague, no greef pain, nor vexation, that
ever Satan by Gods sufferaunce might over charge him with could not any wise
remove, thus as I have said, spending and contriuing weary and painful night
in prayer, Aurora began to show her self, whose cristall cleernes as it
appeered: so began my pains to surcease, and I to be exonerated of the burden
thereof, which when I felt: I caused forwith the Bible to be brought me, and
incontinently I trurned to the before remembered history of that just man Job,
of whose steadfast faith and mild patience when I had read and read again,
such strength in the Lord did so abound in me, that after that time all the
plagues, mischiefs and torments practiced by the said hellish Hagges against
me could not afray me.

How the Author occasioned to walk to Cluevvorth met with Mother Dutton
whom he (least thinking on) brought to Windsor before the Magistrates
which without any examination set her at liberty.
Recovered of my greefs and by Gods divine providence restored by little and
little to my former health, bearing yet in mind some part of the said Mother
Duttons dealing used upon my said Brother James, and after that upon my self, I
determined hap what hap might, when convenient leisure might serve to bring the
said Mother Dutton to Windesore, before the Magistrates there, to the intent if
otherwise she could not purge herself the better of that wherewith she should
be charged: she might receive such condign punishment as for such Offe^ders by
the laws of ye Realm was due and provided. Which determination as it was then
remembered: so in process of time was it forgotten, til it fortuned that
walking one day after dinner to walk to Cluewoorth about certain my affairs
which I had there to do: she met me full in the face, whose sudden meeting
remoouing my former intent then set in obliuio^: caused me furiously to lay
hold upon her arm, by the which without many words given I brought her to
the hall a prison in Windesor desiring the keeper thereof surely to keep her in
his custody until commandment were given him by the Magistrates to the
contrary which he denied to do without some special warrant from ye Mayor or
the Justice for his discharge, whereupon I led her before Master Richard
Readforth at ye time Mayor of Windesor desiring him as he was true Officer to
God and to his Prince to give his warrant to the Iaylor for the better save
keeping of this Witch here brought by me before him, who for her deuilish
Sorceries and enchauntments cruelly practiced upon diverse honest men deserue^th
not to live, affirming that if I could not prove her by sufficient trial to
be a weed woorthye of plucking up: I would receive such punishment as might be
to all (attempting the like either against man or woman) a good ensample but he
being belike as a great number be now a days ye more pity, and I would to
God it may be amended, mistrusting her deuilish practices and fearing least
some mischief might succeed his correction either to him or his, altogether
forgetting his oath and duty toward God and his Prince, for the due punishment
of Offenders in yt case had and provided commanded me yt without further delay
I should let her go, which forthwith I did no less bewailing her liberty
then lamenting the lack of better Magistrates to weed out such Malefactors.



How the said Mother Dutton after her delivery from the Authors hands by the
Mayor, practiced with her Associates his ouerthroovve.
AFter this pestilent Witch was set at liberty, she with her Confederates
perceiving the little regard the Magistrates appointed to minister Justice, for
the punishment of vice had of the complaints made and put up against the^ and
greatly encouraged thereby, ceased not now to practice all kind of means to
vex, trouble and molest me which because of my steadfast faith in God they
could not by the^ selves nor by their wicked spirits execute the same upon me,
they stirred up others to be their cruel ministers in the same.

First procuring my Friends whom Nature lincked in the league of love and
Freendship utterly to detest me, shamefully to use me, and that which grieved
me most maliciously to envy me, in such sort and so long that I often
times wished exchange of my life for a most hasty and speedy death, thus
living there in exile where reason would I should have been most of all
succored, hated of all without cause, and looued of few, it chanced that a
Friend of mine Master Robert Handley (before rehearsed) who at that time for
recreation sake making his aboade at a house of his in the cuntrie was likewise
bewitched in his limbs so that he was not able to go, who suspecting his
greefes to come by witchcraft, caused me to be sent for partly for
Freendships sake which always has been equal betwixt us, and partly to use
that by my means which he him self by reason of his greefs could not put in
practice, to whom when I was come after a little talk had, he told me that
he douted very much least he was bewitched, wherefore (quoth he) good R.
Galis, if any spark of Freendship has ever been kindled betwixt us: I pray:
thee to fetch me a Witch, at whose sight, hope persuades me I shall find
ease. At which words being indeed greatly moved: inwardly (as one who
looued his entire Friend) bewailing my Friends troubles more then my own, I
went forth with out any word speaking, and amongst the crew of these helhounds
I gat me and within one half hour after God being my help: I brought four
before him, whose names ensue, videllicet Audrey the Mistress, Elizabeth Style
allias Mother Rockingham, Mother Dutton and Mother Devil, all which four I
caused to kneel down before the said Master Handley and one Master Henry
Bust Studient in Physic (charging them holding a good cudgel over their backs)
as ever they would pass thence a live, not only to tell what the said Master
Handley ayled: but also to ease him of his greef, to whom they replied using
many excuses, that they neither could tell him his desease much less to help
him thereof.

Then going about to know how they had spent their time in the service of God:
I examined them in the Lords prayer, the belief and the ten Commandments,
wherein I found them (to my great greef) as blind as a beetle and as wise as a
Calfe, then demanding the cause of their necligence therein, they replied that
since they were borne they were never taught them, neither could they find any
that would instruct them therein, and therefore it was to hard for them upon so
short a warning to answer unto my objections, which replication when I heard,
sorye for their time so ill employed: I drue my purse and gave each of them a
penny, charging them as they looued their own souls health: diligently to learn
the^ least that they come to so^e ill end, for (said I) it can not other, wise
be but that for want of the one ye must love the other and for the lack of the
grace of God, the love of his holy word and commandments: ye must needs
serve the Devil your Lord and Master, and there withal I bad them in God his
name to depart, and in short space after my Friend Master Handley came to his
old course I mean to his former health.

How the same four Witches after their departure from Master Handley his
house wrought the Authors imprisonment and of his torments suffered during the
time of his being in hold.
WHen these four loouing Sisters were departed from my Friends house, being of
me no other wise entreated or used then you have heard, misdeeming (and not
without good cause) that I would woork their overthrow in time if I might be
suffered, they sought by prison to a bridge my days, and because they
themselves would be blameless and void of suspicion, not contented with my
pains passed being now hated, abhorred and as it were spitted at of all men,
and especially of my own Parents and natural Brethren and brought even to ye
very brik of desperation (had not God of his infinite mercy and goodness with his
mighty hand held me up giving me a great patience worthy to suffer his cross
laid upon me for my offenses) they caused their Familiars without the which
they could not do any thing, to stir up and against me to incence the Mayor
and Burgesses of the town of Windesor (whereof my father whilst he lived was a
cheef member) who without any offense committed, any hurt pretended, or
complaint made against me, clapped me up in Prison fast locked in a deep
dungion, into the which I was let up and down with a rope laden with as many
gyues and manacles as either my legs could carry or my hands be able to bear,
there to remain without bail, until their further pleasure were therein had, a
cruelty more worthy for a traitor or a murderer then for any true subject to
God and to his Prince. After I was thus enclosed in ye dark, deprived of all
humain company, refused to have any bed for my money, or liberty of the Prison
upon good and sufficient bond, I then began to mistrust my self, and feared the
sudain loss of my life, which easily then might have been deprived and with
some surmised tale easily answered to the world, though not hid from the face
of the Lord, nevertheless emboldened by the mighty help of God to cast away
all fear and patiently to suffer my troubles: I ceased not according to my
accustomed use and to my great comfort and consolation, to sing to the honor
and praise of God the forty one the forty two and the three and forty
Psalms, beginning The man is blessed that careful is the needy consider. etc.
during thexecution of which cruelty: a pittieful sound of groaning voice opened
the gates of mine ears, and presently my yro^s which before by workema^s
cunning were riuetted on, making a wonderful great noise much like to a Smyth
working of his metal, fell of of my legs, and I taken in so strange a case
by the space of two hours, that I thought ye soul forthwith would have left
the chariot of my mortal body. But still perseuering in my prayers, I ceased
not to call upon the Lord, not only for my deliverance: but also that it
would please him to turn the hearts of them which had so unjustly used their
correction upon me. In the morning when it was day, being not called to mine
answer: I desired that I might be permitted to have some conference with
Master Doctor Day Deane of the Castle royal of Windsore, or with Master
Doctor Wicham of the same Chapel, prebende men of great wisdom and
learning, to thente^t I might (with their opinions) be fully resolved of that
which gnawed my conscience, which by no means I could obtain, but within two
days after called to my answer before the Mayor and his brethren, and
examined of my yrons falling of, I told them as before is declared, who having
naught else to charge me with, gave order for my deliverance, using with such
extremity their like power upon me more then a score of times, which here to
express would be to long, and more tedious to the Reader, so that I was forced
of my self to weaue the web of mine own banisheme^t, rather desirous to
live amiddes the deserts of Lybia among the Sauadge and wild beasts then in
Windsore with my parents and kindred.

How by the help of Sir Henry Neuell Knight, Master Richard Ward Esquier,
and other Gentlemen of worship, the author gat leave to pass the seas into
Flaunders, where for a time he served under Captain Morgaine.
FInding here in native soil no place of rest to shrowde my careful head but
only an ougly dungeon without light or comfort, no refuge succor or help,
but that which strangers imparted unto me, I immagined daily with my self
what were best for me to do to avoid these troubles daily more and more
increasing. Sometimes musing upon this, sometime upon that, now devising one
thing, then by and by an other, the lamentable estate and subversion of the
low country in Flanders, came to my mind, whereof a while considering, I
determined to address my self toward that coast, there to spend (if not the
remainder of my days) yet at the least some part of my youthful years in the
service of some one Gentleman or other. Nothing doubting, but that God knowing
mine innocence and the righteousness of my cause, would not only prosper my
attempt: but also give me happy success to the end of my trauayles. Upon the
which point being fully persuaded, loath without license. First of my dear
father had and obtained to depart (nevertheless his unkind dealinges
considered) I bended my steps to the worshipful Sir Henry Neuell Knight, who
with Master Richard Ward Esquier, by way of humble petition, I moved to
talk with my father about the premises, at whose importunate and earnest
perswasio^s being overcome, granted their requests, whereof being
advertised joyful to see my desire take his effect, what haste I made to set
all things in order for my travail, let the^ judge that have tasted the like
distress. In fine armed at all assaies to counteruayle my journey before
pretended, and ready pressed to set forward on my way, a double sorrow began to
combat with in me, and therewithal a doubtful imagination. The one willing
me to cease travail and enjoy the presence of my tender parents, and loving
companions no less careful of my health then my self, the other encouraging
me to avoid the daily assaults of my adversaries by changing the soil to
submit my self into the hands of Lady Fortune. Thus traversing in doubtful
doubt, now musing on the one, then thinking on the other, and troubled beyond
all measure, what were best to be done: I pawsed me a while. At the last
overcome with desire to proceade on my journey: I determined to put my self to
ye mercy of Aeolus puffing blasts and to the merciles waves of Neptunes
swelling Seaes.

The next day bidding my Friends and Cuntrie farwell, I trauiled toward London,
and from thence I shipped my self into Holland whether being safely arrived
good hay so fell out on my side that before I had spent a day or two in seeking
best for my advantage, I found unlooked for of Master William Morgan Gentleman
such gentle intertainment that I employed all my enduour to augment my credit
with him, under whom I spent some time on the land, some times on the seas as
occasion served as the Soldiers life desires not rest in one place, half a
years service.

How his Captain leaving the Cuntrie the Author was pricked with a loouely
motion to his native Cuntrie to make return to his Father, who upon his
submission received him again.
THe vprores a little before rife in Holand and in all the Cuntries there
about, by valiant prowess of martial Knights suppressed: my Captain (leaving
the Cuntrie) gave me occasion to think of my Friends in England in the midst
of all mine Enemies not forgotten, which for to see an earnest desire kindled
my breast, and vanquished with love and duty had toward them, I made my
return again to Windesor, more to reco^sile my self to my deer father to who^e
before my departure I gave some occasion of displeasure, then for any affection
I bare to the town, before whose Fatherly aspect, when I was approached, my
outward tears declaring my inward greefs: I fell prostrate on my knees and
recognizing my former follies, I craved meditation of forgiveness upon my speedy
amendme^t. At the which submission pardoning that which was past upon
performance of my promise most like a loouing Father received me again greatly
ioying my safe return. Nevertheless desirous not to remain with him abooue
three or four days: I departed and made my repair to London, and in Tower
street became Covenant with Master Stephen Heath a Vintner, til such time as
my Father oppressed with infinite pains by means of this damnable sect did
call me home cruelties and injuries done and wrought against the branch could
not once stanch their cruel minds, thirsting after innocent blood, without
the life of my dear father, whose bitter pains diminishing his wonted
strength by little and little caused him to yield unto the mercy of death, to
the everlasting grief of all that loved him, but especially to me and other
his poor children, left as sheep without a guide to the mercy of the Woulf.
Alas what should I say? to render unto him his due praise, I want
sufficiency, and to make long discourse of his mild and meek patience,
wherein he continued unto the last hour of his gasping breath, I can not for
tears and grief, wherefore against my will I am cut of from my purpose. But
thus much you shall understand that no persuasions could prevail with him
that he was bewitched, such was his strong belief in God, and yet diverse time
sighingly complaining, would say: O Lord, shall a man dye and be not sick?
my heart is whole, and yet my inward pains consume me, and so meekely like a
Lamb to the glory of God, taking and suffering his troubles, passed the
straightes of this mortal life, to lodge with Lazarus in Abraham's bosom.

Hhvve the Author after his fathers death abiding with his mother for her
better comfort, framing him self to live in the world, was prevented by the
said witches to his utter undoing to this day.
MY dear father by these helhoundes and Impes of the deuell, thus bereft me,
and intiered in the ground (after whom we must all hie) I determined to the
comfort of my mother, sorrowing the want of her wedded make, to abide with her,
framing my self like a subject to live, and as it became an honest man to do,
so long as the time of his pilgrimage gives him leave to abide, I went (with
that little which God and my father had left me for my better maintenance) to
buy sheep and other cattle, whereby by due foresight and diligent taking
heed; I might make return of my principal with some advantage, but
according to the proverb, he that reckons before his host must reckon
twice, and so it fell to my lot. For after I had stored my self with the said
Cattaill more worth at the time of their sale, then the money I paid for them,
they began now one then an other and in fine almost all to dye, and the rest
living in such a case, lest that I was constrained to take half the money they
cost me gaining by them as Dickins did by his Dishes who bying five for
twopence sold six for a penny, my cattail thus being consumed, and many other
attempts enterprised by me, turned topsie turuie, mine old accustomed and
raging fits began to set foot within my mind I to imagine that Satan's whelps
were now setting a broch the vessel of their despite to seek my utter spoil
and confusion. Wherefore I addressed my self to the woorshipfull Sir Henry Neuel
Knight, who sufficently before persuaded of my troubles, and greatly with my
good Lady his bedfellowe, (with whom I had often conference) pitying mine
estate. I besought even in the bowels of our Lord Jesus Christ that either my
Adversaries who hourly tormented me might be cut of: or I my self to receive
the like punishment if good and sufficient proof were not on my side against
them.

How upon complaints made by the Author to Sir Henry Neuel they were
commanded to be brought before him, and not being able to answer him in the
Articles of the Christian faith, they were publikly set under the Pulpit,
Upon which complaint after Sir Henry Neuel had advised him self, moved with
the pittefull aspect of my wildishe countenance, promise was made me that at a
prefixed day he only for that purpose would come to Windesore, and upon due
examination had, seek redress of my troubles. At which day appointed, I posted
me to the lodging of the said Sir Henry Neuel being in the Castle, there to
renew the remembrance of his promise, who knowing mine errand upon my first
entrance into his Chamber commaundid me forthwith to bring them before him, at
which commandment, you may think I made no delay, but hasted me about my
business, and brought before him as many as I suspected, which were, Audrey the
Mistress, Elizabeth Style, Mother Dutton and Mother Nelson, saying, Sir I have
executed your commandment and brought them into your presence, which if by
good and sufficient trial, I can not prove to be Witches: let me receive the
punishment due unto them, at which words quoth Sir Henry unto them, what say
you to this? Then his Woorship further examined them in the presence of Master
Doctor Wickham Master Wullard a Prebend of the Castle, Master Morris, and
Master Stafferton Gentlemen, how and after what sort they lived, whom they
served and how they had employed their time, they answered, as every one would
in his own case the best, saying, yt where they had been suspected to be
Witches and woorkers of mischief against their neighbors, it was contrary and
that the occasion put up against them was rather upon malice then otherwise.
Then said I under your Woorships correction, if they be such good livers as
they make them selves to be: I beseech you to examine them in the Articles of
the Christian faith, and upon their answer judge of the rest. Then quoth
Master Wickham, can you say the Lords prayer which he has taught you? No
forsooth quoth one, no forsooth quoth an other and likewise the rest, upon
which replycation: Master Wickham began with a most godly protestation to
persuade them not only to forsake their damnable ways before and at that time
used, and diligently to learn the Lords prayer, the belief, and the ten
Commandments, but also daily for their better instructions to have recourse
unto the Temple of God, to hear his divine service, and for th'xecution there
of (because none durst wade so far against them as I) I was appointed
ouerseer, being charged that on the next Sunday following they should be
brought to the Church, and publikly in the presence of all men to be set under
the Pulpit during the time of Service.

How the said Witches were brought to the place appointed and how Audrey
the Mistress and Mother Nelson with in short time after died, upon whose
death the Author felt most grievous torments.
COnceiui^g some good hope of future redress upon thexamination had before the
said Gentlemen of woorship if otherwise they were not converted from their
folly: I hied me home to my Chamber, where locking the door to me I fell flat
on the ground rendering thanks unto all mighty God for that it had pleased him
of his infinite mercy to open the blind eyes of the Magistrates at the last to
look upon such Offenders which before through their necligence, nusted up in
all kind of wickedness, ceased not day nor night to oppress the Inocent, (my
prayer ended) I went about my business until the day was come wherein I should
do my duty, at which day I armed my self in the Lord against the said
Witches, whom gently entreating more to win their hearts unto ye Lord, then for
any fear I had of them: I co^ducted them to the Church and in the place
appointed I set them down, (my self not standing far of the^) where after by
the Preacher they had received their lesson, and schooled for their lewd
behavior and idle life spent to no profit, but to invent wickedness and
mischief, they departed home. Afterward whether it were for greef of the
correction executed, or the inward gnawing of conscience, feeling themselves by
the Preacher touched at the quick, (I cannot tell) but with in short space
after, Audrey the Mistress and Mother Nelson dyed, after whose death the
sisters left behind given over to their own lusts and suffered to wallowe in
their own wickedness, made their assembly in the pits in Master Dodges
backside, a place where all their mischief was pretended, and there in
generally agreed either to bring me unto my end, or living still to feel a life
a hundred times more sharp then a present death, if otherwise the sooner I
sought not means to dislodge my self, and desirous not to use any delay in
furthering their intents, about their accustomed hours of meeting in the
night: my bed, ordained for my quiet rest became the augmentor of my greefs,
and in stead of sleep I was fed with continual watchings, caused through the
extreme torturs and grievous pains sustained in the night. Thus having over
passed many nights in pains, diverse and sundry times the aforesaid Cat or the
devil him self in a Cats likeness: used to frequent and haunt my Chamber hurring
and buzing about my bed, vexing and troubling me beyond all measure, in such
strange and lamentable wise, that I was enforced with my weapon lying drawn
vopon my bed to keep my self waking in prayers least being overcome with
sleep: I should be strangled in my bed.



The Author being almost spent with grief, complains him the third time to
Sir Henry Neuell, before whom he brought the said Elizabeth Style bound
with a cart rope on the market day.
COnsumed with these infinite pains both in body and purse each night assailed
with a new grief, lothing any longer to live, seeing that in four years
past, no reformation might be had for all my complaints. Leaving my careful
bed, the witness of my grief and of my inward sorrow: I made me ready and
girding my Skeane about my middle with a good cudgill in my hand, I gate me to
Farneham to the house of father Roseman, whom furiously pulling out of his
house by head and shoulders I charged (not using any daliaunce with me) to tell
me my griefs. Who being aghast at my dealinges, and fearing least that being
not able to govern me in my fury, I would strike of his head: Said, O master
you are bewitched, you are bewitched, wherefore look to your self, if not: in
fine you will be distroyed, for you have many wicked women in Windsore, and such
as do much harm, and who practiced the like on me once, because I did
displease them. Then I bad him tell me what they were, who answered, that
their names were Elizabeth Style, Mother Dutton, and Mother Deuell, at which
words leaving him (not altogether recovered of the fear he conceived by me)
I went to the said Elizabeth Styles house, charging her to go with me unto
Sir Henry Neuelles, which squatting down upon her buttockes, she denied to
do. Then finding a Carte rope hard by, I bound it about her myddle, and
laid the rope on my shoulder, wherewith forceably I pulled her out of her
house, drawing her a long the streate, being on the market day (not one
daring once to help me) but a little boy, which held the rope by the end)
until I came unto the lodging of Sir Henry Neuell, unto whom in the presence
of a company of Gentlemen at that time talking with him, I offered up my
present, saying, behold here rigth worshipful, I have brought you here a
monster, which because of her feebled lymmes, is not able to go, I have taken
pains to draw. Then she began to curse, banne and swear, foming at the
mouth like a bore, to the great astonishement of all the beholders, which
amassed with that horrible sight (more for fear I think then for any good
will) suffered her to escape, with the which departure (as I could not choose
being greatly grieved) seeing that for all my complaints made, no hope of
redress was to be looked for at the Magistrates hands: I thought now to use
mine own force upon them. Wherefore daily frequenting my self to have once a
day my recourse by their doors, I would now one, then an other, so Ribrost
with my cudgel (carried always about me for the same purpose) that in the end
getting the upper hand, I had them in such awe, that the Scholar having
offended, feared not so much his Masters correction as they did my presence,
as afterward it appeared by Mother Dutton, who so soon as she had heard of
my coming that way: would have run and locked her self into a Cheste for
fear.

How the Author having occasion to be abroad one night at the hour of their
meeting, he savve the Deuell in a Carte sitting, and how by the help of God
he put him to flight, and of other strange accidents done by him.
MY courage now being augmented by the triumphant victory gotten over mine
enemies, and feeling no more taste of my passed grieffes, my business so
falling forth, it was my chance one night about xj. of the clock in the night
to ride by the place where these Impes acustomed use was to meet, to my house.

And in my way as I was ryding, my horse Leeyng of a very good stomach,
sudainly stopped flinging and lashing out behind, snorting and taking on out
of all measure, neither proceading further nor retorning back, wherewith all
being little amassed because it was no strange thing unto me, I alighted and
taking my sword drawn in the one hand, and my buckler in the other, casting
mine eye aside to see if I could perceive any body stirring, I sudainly spied
a most horrible sight and oughly feende sitting in a poor man's cart, like one
ryding to fetch in his harvest, with a pair of eyes burning like the fiery
flames, whose ougly shape when I beheld, falling on my knees in the mids of
the dirt, I besought God to assist me with his strength against this feende,
and that through his mighty power I might get the victory. Then rising, I
went toward the place where this good fellow was watching for his pray. At
whom (my faith steadfastly set in the Lord) I let fly with my sword, saying,
avoid Satan avoid, and in the name of God I charge thee to avoid, thou have
naught to do with me, wherefore go hunte after the Do which has caused thee
here to sit. At which words: a great light appeared round about the carte
where he sat, and therewithal an horrible sent of brymstone was dispersed
abroad, but he was no more seen afterward, with the which sent Master
Afton of the Scalding house coming that way the self same present time,
thought presently to have died, had not help come in the mean time.

This done, I gate me to my horse, upon whose back when I was amounted: I
passed to my house as quietly as might be without harm, where not forgetting
the goodness of God toward them that put their trust in him, I spent an
hour or two in prayer. The next day being come, no less desirous to be
revenged of them then they were to molest me before: Hoping still to find a
means to cut them off, and to weed them clean from the face of the earth,
I practiced many attemptes, and not so many as often executed to the intent I
might be brought to some further answer, for the extirpating and pulling up
the said wicked weeds by the roots. And because there was no Justice that
would execute his office therein by the oath derected unto them. I determined
to prove what I could do my self, wherefore I gat me a pound of brimstone,
and melted the same and dipped therein as it melted a great dry linen cloth,
and into a houile of straw of mother Duttons, I thrust it whereunto I put a
great fire brande being of it self (the brimstone taken away) sufficient
enough to have consumed a hundredth times as much, which burned unto ashes, yt
straw not once perished. An other time likewise, one Richard Parker standing
by, having bought a quarter of a pound of gunne poulder, and as much of
brimstone, I chose an arrowe from out of a sheafe, and thereunto I bound the
said poulder and brimstone with stringes, making therein a little touchhole
whereby to give fire thereunto (when I thought it good) and thrust the same
into an other houile adjoining to her house, fully determined to bring her
together with her house by fire to play the last act of her tragedy, unto the
which, with a match set at the end of a long stick I gave fire, which arrowe
albeit, it consumed to ashes, yet nevertheless ye straw still remained
without any sign of hurt which strange sight when I beheld, being a thing
no less strange to be told, then hard to be believed: I sighing, said to my
self. O Lord, what shall I do unto this wicked impe, and to the rest of her
confederates, whom neither fire or sword may devour, neither Gods thundering
threats provoke to repentance. To suffer them longer to experiment life in
their wickedness, and to the overthrow of their neighbors, my heart refuses.
And still to contriue and spend my time about it: is to my hinderance. If I
complain me of their detestable doings: the magistrates seame deaf, if I
(as enemies to God and their Prince) molest or urge them: imprisonment laden
with gyues falls out to my share. If I crave help of the inferior sort (my
correction so affrayes them) that albeit they would help, yet they dare not.
Thus do I see al hope of ma^s help taken from me, and all comfort bereft
me: Wherefore I will henceforth cease and bridle my desires. And unto thee O
Lord, which knowing the secrets of all men's hearts, can and wilt, when thou
see the time, root out and pull up from thy good and chosen plants such
wicked graftes. To thee (I say) will I remitte my cause, and seek to lodge
and settle my self in some other soil where justice may be ministered, vice
corrected, and wrongs redressed. And therewithal departed to my house, from
whence within few days, after I had set my affairs in good order: I departed
to seek my adventures, since which time of my departure, it has pleases God
at the last to strike these wicked and defestable livers with the rod of his
correction. Who with the pot of their wickedness so long powered the water of
God his vengeance upon them that at the length they were apprehended and
committed to the common gaile there to remain until by due proof of their
diabolical livings be tried, and after trial had, receive the Guerdon
answerable their demerites, where being found guilty and convicted of the
crime objected against them: they suffered at Abingdon the six and twenty
day of February last past for the same, as by the brief and sum of their
confession here ensuing, thou may more at large perceive.

The confession of Elizabeth Style, alias Rockinham, a vvitch dwelling in
Windsor in the County of Bark, declared in the gaile of Reading, in the
said County in the xxi. year of the reign of our most dread sovereign Lady
Elizabeth. Queen of England, France and Ireland etc.
ELizabeth Style, alias Rockingham apprehended for her witchcraft used in
Windsore, and for the same brought before Sir Henry Neuel Knight, was by him
examined, who for that he by manifest proofs of her unjust and dishonest
behavior, found her an offendour unto the Queens Majesty's liege people,
committed her to the common gaile at Reading, where she being examined, had
(the fear of God pricking her thereunto as it seamed) some remorse of
conscience, and confessed before Thomas Row, the Iaylour, John Knight, the
Cunstable John Griffith an Inholder, and one William Pryntall, of diverse as
well men as women, that used to do much harm, by Sorcery, witchecrafte, and
enchanteme^ts, whose names hereafter ensue.

1 First that one father Rosiman alias Osborne, dwelling in Farneham in the
County of Buckingham, and his daughter are witches, and that the said Rosiman
can alter and change him self into any kind of beast that him lists.

2 Item one mother Dutton, dwelling within Hodgkins in the parish of Cleworth
nere Windsore, can tell every man's errand as soon as she sees him, and
works by a spirit in likeness of a tode which she nominateth Mawde, and she
gives him a drop of blood in her flancke, and keeps him always in a gardein
in a border of grene herbs.

3 Item one mother Deuell dwelling in Windsore by the pound, keeps a black
Cat which she names Iyll, and uses to carry it in her lap, and feeds it
with blood and milk, and Rosimans daughter has a white Cat.

4 Item one mother Margaret a lame woman, gooing with crutches, feeds a
kitling with crummes of bread and with some of her blood, and calls it Iynne.

5 Item the said Elizabeth Style, says that she her self kept a Ratte, which
she named Philip, the which she fed with crummes of bread and blood of her
right arm about the hand wrest, the place thereof not hidden, and says, that
further she with the rest has given her right side to the Devil.

6 Item this examinat further, says that father Rosimond and his daughter,
mother Margarete, mother Dutto^, and her self, were accustomed to make their
meeting on the backside of Master Dodges, where they used to confer of such
their enterprises as before they had determined of and practiced.

7 Item she also confesses that mother Deuell was a poor woman, and used to
go about begging of the alms of her honest neighbors, which if they did once
deny her request; mischief always ensued to them or to their cattle.

8 Ite^ she further says, yt as concerning their craft and wicked practices,
they have used it upon diverse and sundry persons, of who^ one Langford a
Farmer, inhabiti^g in Windsore by the thea^es side was one, who died thereby and
whose maid shortly after drunk of yt same cup whereof the master before had
tasted.

9 Item one master Richard Galis Gent, (father of the author) who in times
past, and yt thrice at ye least, as well for his wisdom as for his pollitique
and good government, had been Mayor of windsore, was by their practice brought
likewise to his end.

10 Ite^ one Switcher a Butcher, was served of ye same sauce.

11 Item she also says that she her self was the death of one Saddock by a
clap she gave him on the shoulder, because he brake his promise in not giving
her an old cloak which he promised to do.

12. Item that Mother Denel did over speak one William Foster a Fisher, and
one Hill his wife a Baker.

13. Item she also confesses that they altogether with one consent over spoke
on Humfrey Hesey and his wife, Richard Mils and John Mattingley, so that they
lay every one long time sick before they could recover again their health also
and one Mastline a (...)

14 Item she says that on a time a Child (being a man's Son in Windesore)
hurled a stone on her house wherewith being moved to anger she took his pot
from him, threatened to be even with him, wherwithall the Child went home
wards, and in the way meeting his Father he told him what had happened. To
whom his Father said: ye have done some unhappiness to her, come with me and
I will speak with her, and as they went togithers toward her house, the Child
sudainly began to cry out Oh my hand my hand, and his Father meruailing what
he ailed looking upon his hand and beholding it turned clean out of course and
that otherwise then Nature had framed it: took it in his hand and assayed to
have turned it right again, but he and an other man a neighbor of his (being
with him at that present) could not do it, the which was helped afterward by
Mother Dutton,

15. Item she says that as woorking the death of th'afore named Lanckforde,
Master Galis Lankfoords Maid and Suitcher the said Mother Dutton did make a
picture of wax and did stick a hauthorn prick as it were against the heart of it
that they died shortly after, and the said pictures they conveyed in a hole
made for the nonce in the Chimney coruer, before the which they set two bricks
and as the wax melted so the man consumed unto death by which means she says
they could kill any of what degree soever.

16. Item she also says that the said Mother Dutton did give a picture but
whether it were of man or woman she does not remember and the man that had it
of her, she thinkeh to be dead, and also yt one Gorge Whiting servant to
Matthew Pain of Caton had a picture of her self for one Foster, for that that
the same Gorge and Foster fell at words and the picture, was made in Mother
Duttons house, and Mother Devil said to her bun, spare not to plague him,
thrusting a hauthorn prick against the heart of it, so yt he lay at the point of
death, a long time but in the end Mother Dutton recovered him again, using
their extremity by kiling of a Cow of his.

17 Item the said Elizabeth says that the said Mother Dutton and Mother Devil
were the first Inticers of her to all those before said doings, and that she
and every of them did often times meet together at Master Dodges pits and
so^etime at the pound about eleven a clock at night, and that Mother Dutton and
Mother Devil did alure her to do and exercise yt craft which they them selves
then and before used, and with them to sorsake God and all his woorks and to
give her self to the Devil.

18 Item she says that on a time she went to old Rosimans house and found
him sitting at the root of an oak like an Ape and there talked with him long,
and leaving him at her departure in the same shape, and at an other time she
found him like an horse.

19. Item she says that she went on a time to old Windesore to the bedmaker
to beg milk which she could not have because the maid was a milking but at her
return she said her Rat had prouidid both milk and cream.

20 Item she confesses that one Mother Audrey being one of the four that
sat under the Pulpit before she wed inhabiting in the Alms house was the cheef
Mistress of them all but she is dead.

21 Item she says that four or five of the ablest men in Windesor (if she
had been so disposed) should not have brought her to the Gaile but that she
came of her own accord, for by the way as she went with John Brown to the
Gaile who was her Guide thither, her Bun came to her in the like nesse of a
great black Cat and would have had her away, but hoping for favor, she
banished him again.

22 Item she also says that their words of charm wear these, come on let
us go about it, and presently they were changed into a new shape.

To all which aforesaid Articles the said Elizabeth said she would affirm,
and unto her death truly stand to.

This is not to be forgotten that the said Mother Style albeit at the time of
her apprehension and conduction to the Gaile she was of perfect limme and
joint: yet nevertheless was she after the said confession made, so altered
and changed, by the inchauntments of her own Confederates: that she was ye
most odiblest creature that ever man beheld, insomuch that she was brought
upon a barrowe to her arrainment before the Judges.

This is to be remembered also that amongst the Offenders before said, and that
at the time of their execution, Mother Margaret being upon the ladder and
ready to play the last act, of her life, and commiting her self to the
merecie of the law, by the which she was adjudged for her deserts to suffer
death: began to say the Lords prayer in the which she continued til she came
to these words and forgive us our trespases etc. at which place making a stay
crying out against one Sauoye Haruy of Windesor Ostler her accuser, which then
was coming toward the place of the execution where they all suffered to see
her end, saying art thou come to cast me away? and speak to the People then
standing by, mark the end of him before this time tweluemoonth, and waxing
ougly to the terror of the Beholders she impatiently ended her life.

Finis.
The Conclusion to the Reader.
THhus have thou heard here most loouing Reader how much the foolish pity
and slacknes of the Magistrates of Windesore in executing their office, has
given occasion to these wicked Imps the Daughters of the Devil, to persist in
their follye, thou have heard also remembered unto thee what drifts of deuelish
devises since the first time of mother Duttons apprehension and brought by me
before Master Richard Redforth then Mayor of Windesore, has by them been
practiced to the great hurt of the Inhabitaunts, their neighbors, and to thy
great admiracion, which if at that present had been as thorowely sifted out as
it was but wincked at, and as to late (I may say) it has been by some, (since
those persons in the before confession mentioned and by their enchauntments
brought to their ends) not only had enjoyed their lives until this day: but I
also a most loouing Father and they them selves an assured and steadfast rock
in the time of their need, where now by their sufferance we be deprived of
both. But since to call things long time past in oblivion to remembrance
again, will but increace my greef and renew my sorrow: I therefore will with the
vale of scilence cover that which my heart desired to express. Only I beseech
the heavenly Father who is the giver of all goodness that this ensample past and
now to all men most apparaunt, may be so printed and rooted in the hearts of all
Magistrates appointed for the execution of true and upright Justice to the
maintenaune of the good and pulling down of the wicked, that from hence forth
not only all poor men's causes may be pitied, their complaints accepted, and
their wrongs redressed: but also that by their careful industry and diligence
employed, all Sorcerers, Witches and Charmerers may utterly be weeded out from
the face of the earth to the commeditie of a commonwealth and to the honor and
glory of God, to whom be all praise, laud, dominion and power for ever and
ever Amen.
