BY THE KING.
A Proclamation prohibiting the buying or disposing of any the lading of the
Ship called the SANCTA CLARA, lately brought into South-Hampton.
COMPLAINT having been made unto His Majesty, by Don Alonco de Cardenas
Ambassador from the King of Spain, that a Ship called the Sancta Clara
belonging to the said King and His Subjects, has been lately treacherously
brought to South-Hampton, by one Captain Bennet Strafford and others, from
Sancto Domingo, the said Ship being laden with Silver, Cocheneale, and other
Wares and Merchandises to a very great value; And that the said Ship and Goods,
being by the said Ambassador arrested, and the said Bennet Strafford
apprehended, whilst a suite for the said Ship and Goods is depending in the
Court of Admiralty, the Silver (part of the lading of the said Ship to a very
great value) has been disposed of contrary to Law, without any other security
given for the same, then the empty Name of public Faith, which without His
Majesty cannot (as is well known to all the world) be engaged, or if engaged
without His Majesty, is not valid, or to be relied on for satisfaction. And it
is further complained by the said Ambassador, That the Cocheneale, and other
Merchandises formerly sequestered at London and South-Hampton, albeit they are
not perishable, but have rather increased in their Price and Value, are likely
to be sold against the Will of those who pretend to be the Owners, (Parties to
the suite depending in the said Court of Admiralty) which is alleged to be
apparently against the Rules of Law, and practices of that Court in such Cases.
His Majesty well weighing what may be the ill Consequences of such injurious
Proceedings, manifestly contrary to the Law, and the Articles of Treaty between
the two Crowns, and plainly foreseeing how heavily it may light upon such of
His good Subjects, who have Estates in Spain, and how destructive it may prove
to the Trade and Commerce of his Subjects and Kingdoms, does hereby not only
expressly Charge and Command the Judge of his Admiralty, and all others whom it
may concern, to proceed in a Business of such Value and consequence, with
Care, Expedition, and according to Justice; But does also expressly prohibit
all persons, of what condition soever, upon pretense of any Order or Warrant
from one or both Houses of Parliament, or any Authority derived from thence, to
buy, meddle with, or dispose of any part of the said Cocheneale, or other Goods
or Merchandises belonging to the said Ship, until the propriety thereof shall
be judicially decided and determined, Upon pain of His Majesty's high
Displeasure, and of being responsible and liable to payment and satisfacton for
whatsoever damage shall happen to any of His Majesty's Subjects, whose Goods or
Estates shall for that Cause be embargued or seized in Spain:

Given at the Court at Oxford, the second day of January, in the Eighteenth
year of His Majesty's Reign.
