PRINCE CHARLES His gracious resolution concerning the affairs of this
KINGDOM.
MAy it please your sacred Majesty, I am by the commands of that lively Image
of your Royal virtues, your gracious Son, our hopeful Prince Charles,
first, to make an humble tender of his duty to your Majesty, and then to
remonstrate to your supreme wisdom the sense His Highness has in these so
tender years of the calamitous and intolerable afflictions that march as it
were magnis Catervis, through your Majesty's Dominions, and the resolution his
gracious desire has fixed on; (with your Majesty's favorable allowance) for
their sudden cure and remedy: Your Highness was pleased in his infancy to
commit the Prince, the darling and little eye of this Kingdom, to my tuition,
and without arrogating any thing to my own pains (in that absit jactantia
verbis) I must assure your Majesty in his very disposition then appeared the
tru^ character of Royalty, written by the hand of nature in the fair Table of
his mind; and though velle and nolle was not then in his reach, it being not
capable in so young yeare^ of the use of reason; yet that strong propension was
in his soul to good, that he appeared in all his actions as if he had been
molded for the Sovereignty and Empire of the world. And those childish and
gentle virtues once meeting (as now by his age they have done) with the
guidance of reason and discretion how incomparable and admirable they will
grow, to the joy of the whole kingdom, and comfort of your Majesty, may be
conjectured by this, that he does with so much tenderness and grief resent the
distractions and dissentions, seeming in every place of your Majesty's
dominions, and with much earnestness, beseech your goodness to accept from me
his intentions and resolutions concerning the composing these differences,
which certainly have not been infused into the Prince His Highness, by any
counsels or persuasions of mine, or any other that attend his gracious person,
but are merely the issues of his own Minerva, the conceptions of his excellent
and increasing fancy. He is not ignorant (as says his Highness, and so
enjoined me to inform your Majesty) that the injuries and disobediences which
have been attempted against your Royal dignity, by diverse of your subjects,
ought not to be put up without punishing the offenders; but his Highness
humbly beseeches you to make more use of your mercy then justice; and surely in
that (under your Royal pardon) the judicious infant has delivered that which
heaven commands, and commends to Rulers of the Earth; namely, to show mercy, I
will show mercy to the merciful; but your sacred goodness is so well skilled
in all the works of mercy, that it does appear a needless labor in his
Highness to incite your disposition to that which is already as inseparable to
your Royal nature, as is your reason. The particular, if it please your
Majesty, in which His Grace implores (for his sake) your compassion, is, that
you would graciously be pleased to let no further prosecution of justice, or
punishment, be used against the persons of Captain Lilbarne, and others of the
Parliaments Commanders, now prisoners here, and by the severe Letter of the Law
condemned to death, his Highness believing, and not without reason (the
Parliament having declared as much) that whatsoever punishment shall be
inflicted on them, the same will be extended to the persons of such noble
Gentlemen as in your Majesty's service by the uncertain chance of war have
been made their Captives. And surely my opinion in that is concurrent with that
of the Princes: besides, there can be no greater ornament to Imperial Majesty,
then to remit the offenses of their Subjects, especially when it is apparent
they were not intentionall nor malicious offenses, as my charity induces me to
believe these Captains never entertained the meanest thought of disloyalty to
your sacred person or dignity, but came into the field as it were in the
Company, and by the examples of their neighbors; nor should a publieke crime
be attributed to a few private men, such as these are, who having the authority
of Parliament for their putting on Arms, believe in their misled Consciences,
it was warrant sufficient for them to do their endeavors in these unhappy
Civil wars: For the general State of the Kingdom now dissected into
several factions and distractions, the Prince has oftentimes even with tears
bewailed to me and others the miseries which oppressively are did used
throughout your Majesty's (his royal fathers) dominions; of which, though his
yet budding reason cannot comprehend the absolute causes; yet he gives a shrewd
guess at them, far above the expectation of his tender years: he has
informed me out of his own Genius, Royal Sir, that he conceives businesses
have been transacted between your sacred Self and your high Court of
Parliament, with too much acrimony and violence, for as much as his small
reading had informed his understanding, he had gathered, that the English
Parliaments were the best and most necessary Counselors of the Engl sh Kings,
and then again complained he was fearful your Majesty had been
misinformed against your Parliament by some, who for their own pernicious
ends, affected the fomentation and continuance of these dissentions, so
prettily reasoning the causes and effects of these distractions, that in truth
with much joy I heard his Highness, resembling him to that young hopeful
Monarch of this Nation, Edward the sixth, who was endued with an inspired
wisdom above his years; concluding with my self, that if that Kingdom were
to be held unhappy that had a child to their King* how fortunate and blessed
were ours, that had a Prince, who, though in years a child, was a man in the
purity and solidnesse of his discretion another Solomon; that (when heaven
takes your Majesty from us) might sit upon the throne of his father David, and
govern his people Israel with wisdom and equity: and surely we may believe,
that heaven, as it has conferred an eminent dignity upon Princes, transcending
that of other inferior persons, it has likewise furnished and adorned them
with more select and superlative understandings and indowments of the mind then
are in other men.

But to his Highness resolution, with which he desired me to acquaint your
sacred Majesty, he does first resolve, that if God should please to take your
Majesty from him and us (which in his mercy we all hope he will not) during
the time of these afflictions and distractions, that he a child should then
come to a Scepter so encumbered, a Kingdom so perplexed and rent in pieces with
civil troubles, that it were impossible for him ever to quench the wildfire of
these distractions, which out of the confidence of his weakness, and the
inabilities of his youth, would increase past his extinguishment, and so
diminish the Royalty of this Crown; that he should be impossibilited for ever
attaining to the full Imperial State and absolute Monarchall dignity of his
famous ancestors, a fortune I know to the greatness of his spirit far more
intolerable than death it self. Next, may it please your Majesty, he resolves,
that if these bloody and inhumane wars run thus through the body of this
Kingdom, that as their subsequents must necessarily follow, devastations,
ruins of Cities and Towns by fire and sword, murders of men, women and
children by the cruelty and barbarousnesse of the soldiers, the utter
extirpation of Gods true Religion and worship, sects and schisms usurping the
face of truth, and bewitching the minds of ignorant minded people: All which
misfortunes he imagines are reflexive on his gracious self* as he is your
son and (if God do not for our sins take him away from us) must succeed
your Grace in the royalties of this and your other Dominions; the towns or
Cities that shall or have been ruined in these wars; his Highness accounts as
part of his patrimony rioted from his inheritance; the subjects your Majesty
loses, he concludes might have lived to have been his, and believes that their
decreasing is a diminution to his power and the abilities of this Kingdom.
Finally, he takes to heart so all the evils which now overspread the face of
this our earth, that they almost include his gentle and sweet disposition to an
unwelcome melancholy; that it may prove prejudicial to his health and our
hopes. And truly, so please your Majesty, if when your wisdom shall fully take
it into your gracious consideration, nothing can be more destructive to the
obedience which the Subject of England (should the Prince ever arrive to be
King) ought to pay his Highness, then the remembrance of these wars happening
in your reign: the people who always believe of times past according to the
traditions they have from their father, being apt to credit that those bloody
mischiefs were only occasioned by your Majesty, and so your memory will be
nothing grateful to posterity; and where they do not affect the memory of the
father, hardly can that various beast, the multitude, ever be induced to love
and reverence the son. Besides, should the wars continue, what insufferable
daily miseries must this wretched Kingdom expect, when all places shall only
be, as it were, constant scenes where Tragedies are daily acted; and for that
Phoenix, true Religion, which has long beautified this Nation, if she expire by
the malignity of these wars, we must not expect a new one will miraculously
arise out of the parents ashes; a new one there may, but not a true one, it
will rather be a Harpy then a Phoenix, some strange compound of sundry schisms,
polluting the beauty of the Church of God, or perhaps every man will be of his
own Religion, or else be of none at all.

And what a strange and uncouth metamorphosis this will be, your Majesty may
judge, and so depresse the Serpent while it is in the Egg, lest if brought
forth, it grow up a Dragon formidable for its poisonous venom to all your
Dominions. In the Princes name therefore, most dre^d Sovereign, and by his
appointment, and for his sweet sake, the staff and prop of your age, and the
growing hope of this Kingdom, I am to beseech your Majesty to think on some
way for a speedy Accommodation betwixt your Self and the honorable your High
Court of Parliament. The Prince, your gracious and hopeful son entreats it,
your Nobles hope and expect it, and briefly, as the maine support of your
Royal dignity and the prosperity of all your Kingdom, your people that bleed
with these wounds, and groan under that burden of war, implore it from your
goodness; for all their sakes, in especial for your Princely sons, for whom
I am now employed an inelegant Orator, great King perform it. And so begging
your Royal pardon, if the zeal I have to the Cause and your Majesty's
service, have made me transcend my Commission, I beseech him in whose hands are
all the corners of the earth, and the hearts of Princes, to give no less then
Methusala's date to your reign over us, in peace, prosperity and plenty.

FINIS.
