Concerning the Judgments of God; for and against what they are decreed, and
what Judgment is in it self. And also what is the eternal Judgment of God
against the wicked and ungodly.
THe Judgment of God is according to his mind and w^ll and is not against, but
for his creature, and attends to his creatures preservation, and it never
became painful to his creature, until he went from his Spirits guidance, and
then into the unsoundnesse of Judgment for according to sound and true
Judgment he wroug^^ and established all his Decreeings, (in the council of
(...) Will, and working of his mighty Power) and therein his purposes and
determinations are exalted; so that the Judgments of God are against nothing
but what makes for his creatures hurt, and they that have such an eye of
respect thereto, and faith and belief therein, are made sound in Judgment
thereby.

For the working of the Spirit of God is first in the Judgment of the
creature, wherein it convinces him of sin, and offense to the Spirit of God,
and for that reproves him; and then of righteousness (in the same mind held and
retained;) and as it leads from the one (the self-righteousnesse, etc.) so it
leads to the other (the righteousness of God wrought by faith in him,) and
then comes the Prince of the power of the Air to be judged: But in this work
the judgment of the creature, in reference to what has been first joined to,)
comes forth torn and unsound; for God first breaks and tares the creature from
other Lovers then Himself; the cause of the bruising being then in the
creature, and as he submits to the Judgment of God, a short work is made in
the Earth, without any struglings and strivings of such the creature; for all
the struglings and strivings of the creature, is to keep life in that the
Judgment is against, and therein is the pain, and woundings, and bruises of
the creature, and the weakness and nakedness of the creature comes thereby to
be seen, which otherwise would be covered, hid, and healed, (as Judgment had
its due on the wrong part in the creature,) and that which is for Judgment,
either for the Sword, or the Famine, or the Plague, given up thereto.)

And the plagues and torment cease, and the creature then comes forth sound
and wholesome in Judgment, and to be of a healing spirit, and saving nature,
and the plague stays in the Earth, and good tidings, and the Gospel of peace
springs up, and the storm is alayed, and all is quieted and calme^ within and
without; and then, How beautiful are their feet on the Mountains! and over
every high hill they can walk pleasantly, that being under which was once over
(when the Seed was in the Valleys of Israel;) but then comes to be raised, and
truth to spring up over all.

And thus are all the Judgments of God according to righteousness, and thereby
is Zion redeemed, even by the spirit of judgment and burning; and so the
Judgments are for a light, and then mercy and truth meets (in one,) and in
that one righteousness and peace can, and does embrace and kiss each other;
and so Zion has the Law of God, and his Word goes forth from Jerusalem, and
Daughters of Zion a^e no more healed deceitfully, nor no smooth thing preached
to the world, but Judgment laid to the Line, and Righteousness to the
Plummet; and yet all at home quiet and well composed; but the uneven and rugged
is abroad, and then the hewings and plainings goes on the uneven, and that
according to true and sound Judgment, where nothing even is battered against,
but the Line takes that in, but the rugged it leaves out, and the hewers sets
on that.

And so though the fire be eternal (that is kindled in such) and shall never
go out, yet the pain is not eternal; but as the creature is made as willing to
leave the evil (that God does show unto him, and judge in him) as God is, so
to discover and judge it, he dies from the evil, and so all pain in the
Judgment of God cease, and then come death or life, or any afflictions
(though he sees it come up under the sufferance of Gods Spirit, and in
judgment to the cause thereof,) yet the cause being removed in him, he has
learned content therein and there under, having a faith in the redeemed life,
and the work of God therein, that has kept from fainting by the way, and does
keep from desparation or sinking of spirit, under any outward afflictions, so
the Creation of God shall be redeemed (in all the world,) and not without
Judgment to that which has caused it to suffer, and none that keeps in the
sense of its sufferance and faith of the redemption thereof, shall ever be left
to fail by presumption or desparation under this Judgment.

The Ground of all the occasion of offense in the world, at this day (given or
taken in the wrong Ground and Part) and how, and wherein many are offended in
Christ, (it being the same mind that gives the just occasion of offense, that
unjustly takes occasion therein.)
THe Ground of all the occasion of offense in the world, and at this day (given
and taken in the wrong part;) is against Christ, that many are stumbling at
(because he is become a Rock of offense to both the houses of Israel,) and
offenses will come, but woe unto them by whom they so come; yet herein is a
consideration very great and weighty; that the whole man is not to be judged in
the occasion given or taken (in this wrong part and ground;) for there may be a
good ground from whence these tares comes and proceeds, and in this ground
God sowed good seed, but this is the enemies work (while the good man slept,)
and he it is sowed all these tares, that cumbers the ground, and take heed of
being too hasty, in the plucking them up, least thou also offend the Lord of
the Harvest (that art offended at the tares,) for both are to grow together
until then.

Now that which gives, or takes offense (in the wrong ground and part) is self;
for self is high and will full, and cannot bear any thing it sees or imagines
amiss in others, but presently falls to judging, never considering where it
be thy place to judge, and whether it be Gods time, way, and manner (thou art
giving sentence in;) that would have nothing judged before the secret of the
heart be manifest? or rather whether something be not got up that would usurp
the Seat and Authority of Judgment (for, and to self?) And then if the thing
were really an evil thou may spy out or imagine, and so readily passest
sentence on) it being thy place rather to bear and suffer it (until an
Authority in God is raised to minister for the removing thereof) in the want of
patience, and the wisdom of God to manage the matter thou undertakest, thou
manifests thy own evil, and weakness in judgment, and it appears that it
is the secret of thy own heart that the judgment of God is against, thou art
so fiercely pouring out against others; and well thou may raise a Devil in
that mind, and strengthen the evil thou would seem to judge (when out of
the Authority of God) but cast him out or alay him thou can not (in that
mind, blinded with self conceit), because that is first to be removed at home,
and the judgment of God kept thereon there (against what defiles Gods way and
manner of ministering judgment to the world) er'e the healing virtue of the
spring of life can give forth, to the necessity of the creature of God, and
that arise which is felt in God, and thou received in the Authority of
Judgment against evil; but well thou may beat the Air, and sow wind,
never will a true subjection attend that Ministry, that at best can but make
subject for wrath, while the conscionable principle, and that which makes
subject therefore, is, not come into, and dwelt in; but a mind continued in,
would have fire come down from Heaven and consume such they are not in charity
with, and secretly wishes and desires evil in their hearts, may befall their
Adversary; as was seen of old, (and yet this once was a Prophets and Disciples
state; as remember Jonah, that rather pityed a Gourd that came up in one night,
and to morrow was not, than six score thousand persons; and the reason, because
of a state of Prophecy, he was come to, and to have a word from the Lord, and
therein was strengthened in the judgment of what God had shown him; but not in
the life of pity; of that he was convinced by a weaker means;) well verily this
is the greatest sign can be given to this Generation (even the repentings of
the people at the preachings of a Prophet, and of God in judgments against
them;) were this read through, it would preach much in this Age.

For it is commonly said, They hate not the persons, but the evil in the
persons; and yet many would have the persons of men destroyed, rather than they
loose the honor of a Prophet, yea and sorely strike at the whole man, and yet
say it is for Conscience sake, and the Cause is Gods, they are so zealous for;
and wherein does it appear? can thou then feed thy enemy? can lay down thy
life for him? can stoop to be reconciled to him (to the abasing self to the
death? to the crossing thy own will to the utmost?) this will try thy Cause or
Zeal, whoever thou art, ^or I am no respecter of persons in this work: or
rather art thou backbiting, and persecuting, and smiting with tongue or hand,
or both? and yet is thy Cause God's? But such are Heretics (says the world)
they are enemies to truth, and such are Gods enemies, and not ours, and we
cannot forgive them? Well then, Are ye Christians? Such that are Gods enemies,
are Christ's; and such that were his, he laid down his life for, and prayed the
Father to forgive; and the Cause was Gods, he came about, and in the name of,
that he could have revenged himself (in) on his enemies; for He could have
prayed the Father, and have had more than twelve Legions of Angels to deliver
him.

So this is to make an Argument to hold; but then thou may say, this life of
forgiveness is on conditions of repentance (then indeed not only till seavan
times, but seaventy times, thou can be content to forgive, or as often as thy
brother may offend thee?) But have thou used a means therefore, to take one or
two with thee, if he will not hear thee, and reason of the thing between ye in
love (Or is it really an evil thou art offended at?) else the occasion is in
t^ee? that take it so before it be justly given; for he must be convinced of
an evil therein, before he can truly and rightly leave it; and if the practice
or thing thou take occasion at, be not absolutely an evil in its self, nor
the practiser sees no evil therein to him, in the use or practice thereof, he
must needs be a hypocrite to leave it for another words, and at best but a
man-pleaser, and time-server, (unless for Conscience sake it be a thing may be
yielded to, and there be a spirit fitted thereto of God) And the God of peace
and love persuade the upright hearted herein.

Besides, Thou art to consider against whom, and what the offense is; and if it
be against God only, may be there has been, and is come up the life of
repentance (which is more than words,) that has been brought forth from what
has been wrought in secret in the hidden r^tired life of converse with God,)
and then what matters it where a testimony be given to man or men (in words?)
seeing it may be a matter of Conscience to the convert, to come under the
censure of men, against whom he is not convinced of any just occasion of
offense, but sees the ground to be one (in them that took occasion at what was
an offense to the Spirit of God, [with himself that gave it;] And then what
took occasion (through an evil eye that has watched for haultings) to magnify
and exalt self [in the selfish creaturely Judgment] concerning what is spyed
out of the creatures weakness) he well knows will be further strengthened by
such submissions of men and to men (that his converse with God has altered his
conversation toward; for which only he desires to be believed;) in that the
offense was only and chiefly against God (though accidentally the creature has
been, or may be, or probably will make it self concerned therein;) and the life
of repentance [from evill] is that which God looks at only. Yea,

You High and Mighty of the earth, that are in the hard Judgments of the
worldly spirit, and in the fault-finding nature [of what takes occasion against
the innocent,] search what spirit ye are of (that would make a man offendour
for a word, or lay a snare for him that reproves sin in the Gates, and would
pervert the just for a thing of naught:) Consider your way before the Lord,
whether ye are doing as ye would be done by (that so readily pass judgment
against the creature of God (for and about outward things and outward Worships
and Service] and yet pretend your zeal to be for God, that looks inward, and at
the heart, and seeks and requires such worship, and such to worship him, that
worship him in Spirit and in Truth;) will your imprisonments and cruel censures
[think ye.] about such things as these, give ye ease (when Gods witness is
awakened for himself [in all the world] as I am assured it shall? you are
verily those that give just occasion to God against you, and are in the just
cause of offense to his Spirit, and Spirits work and workings, though in the
same mind ye take offense against him [that many are offended in,] for the day
has dawned, and the day light does manifest the fulfilling of the words of
Christ, that said, Me they hate (speaking of the world) because I bear witness
against the deeds thereof, that they are evil; and it was not so much them that
followed him as for his sake that came into the world to bear witness against
the deeds thereof) that was the cause and ground of the worlds hatred and
offense (they take at and against them;) that he called blind-guides, that
would seem to strain at a gnat, and swallow a Camel; and to find fault with a
moat in their brothers eye, and could not see the beam in their own; which is
the most dangerous estate in the world. And

Therefore was these sayings given forth of old, that we might not be offended
in what comes to pass; but that self the offendour [against the Spirit and
Life of God,] that first appeared [in the world] and still does appear to be
the offended, may be judged in all hearts (in reference to what is given or
taken in the wrong part;) and God over all may be exalted for evermore: I say,
that first appeared in the offense or enmity against the Spirit of God, and was
offended thereat; for the Devil was a Liar from the beginning, and by the
Spirit of the world [even lies and falsehood,] bewitched and deceived and
betrayed the creature of God from its first and true guide, that abode not in
the truth, but when he told a lie spoke of himself, and out of co^^^^t (in and
with that condition God first placed and stated his creature in) into offense
against the Spirit of God, was that first man lead, and his sense charmed
asleep with and in the worlds beauty and alurements (where things has been
falsely spelled to him) and therein he first brought forth the offendour
against Gods Spirit, and yet one that first took the occasion of offense (that
was angry and full of wrath with his brother, about outward sacrifice of the
worldly spirits worship, and rose up against him to slay him, because of sin
that lay at his door, whereby was caused non acceptance with God;) wherefore he
was not nor is not accounted and reckoned of the Seed of Adam, as him that was
begotten in his own Image, but was and is the Seed of the envious one (where
ever he reigns and rules end bears Dominion.) And this Seed is that Cham that
delights to be uncovering the nakedness of that which is by nature its father,
and rejoices in discovering and discoursing the creaturely weakness (where it
is not in charity with the creature of God, and in the upbraiding insulting
mind over its brother;) and on it is the fathers curse (it was begotten by)
that is awakened out of the sleep his son had mocked him in, and therefore has
caused him to be a servant of servants, that in their omission of duty to God,
have therein neglected to do unto Christ whether sick or in prison, in his
members, etc.) as he has required and commanded, as that which they have done
unto them (by imprisonments and cru^l usage, etc.) he takes done unto himself;
and so causes them to be brought before him that would not he should reig^
over them) that he might slay them with the edge of the Sword of Justice, and
so they never come to be eased of their servitude, and to come to the year of
Jubilee (that sets free the captivated and enbondaged Seed and Prisoner of
hope;) but stick in the birth [by the way,] and sit down in the worldly
Judgments, and Confessions, and Repentings, and think they are heard for their
much speaking, and large Professions and protestations (all which stands in the
enmity against the Spirit of God, and well-being of his Creature;) for he has
been wearied out with words, and with the Confessions and Repentings of the
world, either to those called their ghostly Fathers [in private,] once or twice
a year;) or in public every week to profess to come before God, and tell him,
they have erred and strayed from his ways like lost Sheep, and done those
things they ought not to have done, and left undone those things they ought to
have done, etc. and that no soundness is in them from the crown of the head to
the sole of the foot;) and thus to continue all their lifetime (in the
unsoundness, and unwholness, and unwholsomness of life and spirit, and judgment
and conversation;) and yet to sit as Judges over their fellow creatures in
cases of Conscience, and to give sentence for the execution of justice (for
that they themselves are ready to confess is but a sp^t in respect to that
pollution the body of nature (in the ^all and transgression against God) is
stained and corrupted with) needs must be to look at a meat in their brothers
eye, not discerning the beam in their own; and this must be concluded hard
measure, and the same must they expect from God, in this day of judgment.
