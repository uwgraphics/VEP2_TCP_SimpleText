HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT By the King.
A Proclamation for the establishing of the Peace and Quiet of the Church of
England.
THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, in His most religious care, and Princely
consideration, of the Peace of this Church and Common wealth of England, and
other his Dominions, whereof God of his goodness has, under his Son Christ
Jesus, made him the supreme Governor, observing, that in all ages great
disturbances, both to Church and State, have ensued out of small beginnings,
when the seeds of Contention were not timely prevented, and finding, that of
late some Questions and Opinions seem to have been broched or raised in
matters of Doctrine, and the Tenants of our Religion, which at first only
being meant against the Papists, but afterward by the sharp and indiscreete
handling and maintaining of some of either parts, have given much offense to
the sober and well grounded Readers, and Hearers of these late written Books
on both sides, which may justly be feared, will raise some hopes in the
professed enemies of our Religion, the Romish Catholics, that by degrees, the
professors of our Religion may be drawn first to Schism, and after to
plain Popery.

His Majesty therefore, in the integrity of His own heart, and singular
providence of the peaceable government of that people, which God has committed
to His charge, has thought fit, by the advice of His reverend Bishops, to
declare and publish, not only to His own people, but also to the whole world,
His utter dislike to all those, who to show the subtilty of their wits, or to
please their own humors, or vent their own passions, do, or shall adventure
to stir or move any new Opinions, not only contrary, but differing from the
sound and Orthodoxall grounds of the true Religion, sincerely professed, and
happily established in the Church of England; And also to declare His full and
constant resolution, that neither in matter of Doctrine, or Discipline of the
Church, nor in the government of the State, he will admit of the least
innovation, but by Gods assistance will so guide the Scepter of these His
Kingdoms and Dominions, by the Divine providence put into his hand, as shall
be for the comfort and assurance of His sober, religious, and well affected
Subjects, and for the repressing and severe punishing of the insolences of
such, as out of any sinister respects, or disaffection to his Person or
Government, shall dare either in Church or State, to disturb or disquiet the
peace thereof.
