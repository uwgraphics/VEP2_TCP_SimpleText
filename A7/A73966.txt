By the King. A Proclamation inhibiting the Importation of Pepper from foreign
parts, by any other persons then those of the East Indian Company.
FOrasmuch as it is not unknown, That in former times when all or the greatest
part of Pepper, and other Spices of the grouth of the East Indies, was brought
into this our Realm of England and Principality of Wales by Strangers only,
the same was then sold at very high Rates, until such time as some of our own
Merchants did themselves trade into those parts, and bringing in good
quantities of those Commodities, did sell the same at much lower prices, to the
great relief and benefit of all our Subjects in general: And forasmuch as we
do find, That the establishment and continuance of this Trade, has and will
be more and more an occasion to employ and increase the great Shipping of this
Kingdom, which has heretofore been out of use, as being not so necessary for
Trade in Countries that are not so far remote: For these, and some other
reasons which have been delivered unto us, being desirous to encourage this
Company, and to maintain that Trade by all good and lawful means; And
experience teaching us, That if there should be, till the Trade were better
settled, a free and general liberty for all persons whatsoever to bring in
those Commodities, it would be an occasion to ouerlay the Trade, and Strangers
would of purpose vent their Spices at small Rates, thereby to enforce our own
Subjects to desist from trading into those Countries: We with the advice of
our Privy Council, have thought fit, for some time to restrain the
Importation of Pepper from foreign parts, by any others then by the Merchants
jointly of the East Indian Company. And therefore we do hereby will and
command all person and persons whatsoever, either our natural borne Subjects,
Denizens, or Strangers (not being the Company aforesaid) to forbear to bring
into these our Dominions of England and Wales, any Pepper, directly or
indirectly, upon pain of forfeiture of the goods, and what other punishment
they may incur by any contempt and default herein. And to the end, this our
pleasure may be more duly observed, We do likewise charge and command all
Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, Waiters, Farmours of our Customs and their
Deputies, and all other our Officers of the Ports, within our Territories
aforesaid, That they do not give any Bills of Entry for Pepper that is
brought in from foreign Countries, by any other then those who shall be known
to be of the Company aforesaid: Neither shall they suffer it to be landed, or
being so, shall seize the same to our use as justly forfaited. And moreover,
they and every of them, shall use their best means and endeavors to hinder and
prevent all secret and fraudulent practizes of such as shall seek to bring it
that Commodity, Notwithstanding this our pleasure published to the contrary.

ANd because we are careful to prevent al inconveniences to the generality of
our Subjects, in case they should be hardly dealt with under this restraint, by
those that have the whole mass of Pepper in their own hands; Although we
hold the Company to be compounded of many good and honest Merchants and others,
yet because there is no Society wherein all are of one temper, And out of the
care we have always had for the common good of all our people more then of any
particular Society; we thought it not safe to repose so much confidence in a
part of our people, as to leave the whole Body subject to their wills, in
matter of this nature.

And therefore having well examined what might be an indifferent price to yield
to the Merchants competent gain for the maintenance of so great and long a
Trade, and so needful for the support of Navigations, and yet not be
ouerchargeable to the rest of our people, who have on the other side daily use
of that kind of Spice; We have conditioned with them, and limited, That they
shall utter Pepper at the rate of Two shillings six pence the pound, and not
exceed, to any that shall come or send for it, upon pain of our high
displeasure.

Which provision, and limitation being made by us in favor of the community
of our Subjects, we have thought good to publish and make known to all men, To
the end that if it fall out, that such as by way of Retaile do utter to our
people dwelling in places remote from our City of London, and other parts
where Shipping does ariue, that kind of Spice, there be exacted any prices
excessive, it may appear that the same is not for want of due provision made
to prevent it, but by the ouergreedinesse of those which shall sell it. In
which consideration, although we know, that there are many reasons, why those
that sell by Retaile, should demand a further price then they pay for it here,
as well in respect of the distance of place, forbearing of their money, as many
other things incident to that kind of Trade: Yet the better to contain them
within the bounds of reasonable gain, we have thought good to make known thus
much, thereby to express our own care of our loving Subjects, and to show
them the means whereby they may avoid such further burden, as may be cast
upon them by any that shall go about by any undue practice, to raise
immoderate gain, under color or pretext of that course which we have taken
for the reasons aforesaid.

Given at Newmarket the last day of November, in the seventh year of our
Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty, ANNO 1609.
