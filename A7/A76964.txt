in Suffolk.

Now first Published by his Son in Law H.W.

2 Timothy 2.13. Hold fast the form of Sound words.

OXFORD, Printed by W. Hall for R. Davis Anno Dom. MDCLX.

To the Christian READER
THIS Solid, Pithy Catechism which holds forth the Form of sound words, and
this excellent. Sermon tending much to edification I received from the hands of
a religious and grave Matron, an old Disciple, and steadfast Christian the
surviver of her Dear Husband the worthy Author. After deliberate perusal of
what is here presented to publik view. I cannot but give this Testimony to the
truth that here is an Iliad in a Nutshell, I mean a great deal of good
profitable matter comprised in a Narrow room: there is much in a little and that
which is sound and Orthodox. Although I never had any personal acquaintance
with the reverend Author yet having contracted affinity with his Family (to
which I be are great respect) and likewise for his choice work and profitable
Labors in the Ministry (An evident Testimony I have from several manuscripts,
which I have seeen) I conceive my self obliged to to make an honorable
mention of this Reverend Divine, being one of those whom the Apostle would have
highly esteemed of, 1 Thessalonians. 5.12, 13. And we beseech you Brethren to know
them, which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,
and to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake. As for the work
(because there is so much worth as abundantly to commend it self) I need add no
more.

Concerning the Author who livd a saint on earth and (I question not) is now a
saint in glory, because he is out of the reach of fear, and flateries, I shall
mentia particular or two, of special observation worthy of Imitation. What I
shall make mention of I Will reduce unto two heads. 1. Before he entered into the
Ministry. 2. After he was settled in a Pastoral Cure.

1. Before he entered itto to the Ministry he was a hopeful studious Scholar
in Emanuel College in Cambridge a Society eminent for Religion and Learning.
And he had a Dr John Preston.
Tutor there of great worth and ability the glory of the place where he lived.
There he made great proficiencie in Religion and Learning wherefore being well
qualifyd to fix upon a calling, his Sir James Bacon.
Father a Knight of great Quality sent to him, that he would have him be a
Lawyer, and to that purpose he would remove him from the Vniverfity to one of
the Inns of Court: whereupon he answered (as I can produce his letter for
proof hereof) with much reverence to his Father, used strong reasons for his
great desire to give himself to the work of the Ministry: And notwithstanding
his Fathers frequent solicitations, yet he (showing all duty and observance to
him) persisted in the resolution which God fixed in his heart, and retained it
inviolably which was to dedicate himself to Christ in the work of the
Gospel; Whereunto his Father yielded as being prevailed withal, and overcome
by the strength of his Sons Reasons, so that it hence evidently appears, that
he took upon him the Ministerial Function not upon necessity but choice, not
constrainedly, but willingly, not for sinister respects and self-interests but
for Gods glory.

3. After he entered into the Ministry having been Lecturer several years at
Bow in Cheapside at London where his name is fresh and green (as I have heard)
amongst some ancient Professors yet alive: he removed to Burgate in Suffolk,
where he exercised his ministry for many years, and there finished his course.
He was in all his Relations as Pastor, Husband, Father, Master, Faithful,
Loving, Conscientious, one who walked by the rule of David in Psalm. 101. His
godly conversation, learning, wisdom, charity are abundantly known to many,
not only in his own Parish, but likewise in the adjacent parishes where he
lived. And let this be mentioned as a Character of honor for the Perpetuating
of his memory, and for a pattern of imitation, that notwithstanding sore and
grievous bodily infirmities by the stone, strangury etc. yet (when he could not
go of himself) he would be carried to the Public Congregation, and there
Prach the Gospel. I shall not make a larger Preface to so short a Volumne;
yett his Motto may be fitly applied to the ensuing work. Pondere non numero.
Throughout the whole there is sound Doctrine plainly and profitably handled. If
therehy thou profitest (Reader) and so thou may if it be not thy own fault
give God the glory and labor thereby to be more grounded and stablished in the
truths that are in Jesus, And so I remain,

Thy souls Servant H. W.
OXON. May 2. 1660.
A PRACTICAL CATECHISM, Introductory to a large exposition of Reverend Mr
PERKINS his CATECHISM.
Question.

WHy art thou called a Christian?

Ans. Because I profess the Christian Religion.

Q. What is the Christian Religion?

A. Christian Religion is a Heavenly Art, or a wholesome Doctrine according to
Godliness, revealed and taught by Christ, showing us the right way to eternal
life. 1 Cor. 2.7. 1 Timothy 6.3. Tit. 1.1, 2. 2 Timothy 1.13. Tit. 2.10. 2 John v. 9.
Joh. 6.68.17.3.

Q. Why is Christian Religion called a Doctrine according to Godliness?

A. Because it is a pattern of Gods most holy will: and that excellent Rule
which Christ has given us to walk by, teaching us to deny ungodliness, and
worldly lusts, and to live soberly righteously, and Godly in this present
world. Tit. 2.11, 12.

Q. Are all those Christians that are so called?

A. No: to make a Christian indeed these three things must concur. 1. Sound
knowledge: 2. Faith unfeigned: 3. Holy obedience. They and they only are
Christians indeed, the only true Christians such as are truly ingrafted into
Christ. who have attained to the true knowledge of God and have put on Christ
by Faith; and yield obedience to the Doctrine of Christ. Romans 2.28, 29. Joh.
17.3. Romans 13.14. Gal. 3.26, 27. Romans chapter 6. v. 17.

Q. Tell me then, what is required of those that have taken upon them the
honorable title of Christians?

A. First they must be diligent in learning the Heavenly art of Christianity
Prove. 8.32, 34. Secondly they must earnestly contend for the Christian Faith,
Jude v. 3. Thirdly they must endeavor by a holy and unblameable life to adorn
the Doctrine of Christ. Tit. 2.10.

Q. Where is the Christian Religion taught?

A. In the writings of the Prophets, and Apostles, which are called the holy
Scriptures. Romans 1.2. 2 Timothy 3.15.

Q. What were these Prophets and Apostles?

A. They were Teachers called, and sent immediately by God; instructed by
Christ himself; and infallibly assisted by the holy Ghost in whatsoever
Doctrines delivered to the Church, either by word, or writing. And therefore
the Doctrine of of the Prophets, and Apostles is to be received, and embraced
as the Doctrine of Christ. Luc. 1.70. Gal. 1.1. Gal. 1.11, 12. 1 Pet. 1.10, 11.
2 Pet. 1.21. Joh: 16.13. 2 Pet. 1.19, 20. Ephesians. 2.20. Jude v. 17.

Q. Why are the writings of the Prophets and Apostles called the Scriptures?

A. Scripture is a Latin word, which signifies writing: now because, of all
writings that ever were published, these are the worthiest, therefore ((...) by
an excellency) they are styled the Scriptures.

Q Why are they called the Holy Scriptures?

A. The Scriptures are holy in these 4. respects,

First because the holy Ghost did indite, and dictate whatsoever is written in
this precious Book. 2 Pet. 1.21. Act. 28.25.

Secondly, because the Penmen of Scripture were holy men of God, holy Prophets
and holy Apostles. Luc. 1.70. Ephesians. 3.5.

Thirdly because the holy will of God is here revealed: whatsoever is recorded
in the Scripture is an holy Truth; Prove. 30.5. Luc. 1.72. Romans 7.12. Tit. 1.1.
Psalm. 12.6.

Fourthly because the word is a powerful instrument, whereby the elect of God
are sanctified and made holy. Joh. 17.17.

Q. Seeing the Scriptures are so holy, whether may Lay people read them and
speak of them?

A. Yes they may read them, so they address themselves to the reading of them
with holy affections: they may speak of them so they speak of them with
reverence, and allege them to those holy ends for which they were written; as
to gain some glory to God, who is the Author of holy writ: and to edify one
another in their Christian Faith. Jude. v. 20. 2 Timothy 3.16. Romans 15.4.

Q. But many think, that it belongs to Churchmen only to search and Study the
Scripture: tell me therefore whether is it a duty that God requires of all
Christians to read and search the Scriptures?

A. Yes, all the disciples of Christ (that are able to read) ought to read
and search the Scriptures as well Laymen, as Ministers.

Q. How may that appear?

A. By these arguments,

First because the precepts enjoining this duty are general, and extend as
well to the Lay People, as to Ministers. Read Joh. 5.39. Col. 3.16. Deuteronomy. 6,
6, 7, 8, 9. Deuteronomy. 17.18, 19.

Secondly we have examples of all sorts recorded in Scripture, which show, that
this exercise of piety is commendable in all ages, in all degrees and
callings, Read 2 Timothy 3.15. Act. 8.28. Act. 17.11. 2 Pet. 1.19.

Thirdly, God has made such gracious Promises as may encourage all Christians
to perform this duty. Read Rev. 1.3. Psalm. 25.14. Joh. 7.17.

Fourthly, that which was written to all, and is commended to be read unto all.
why should it not be free for all to read. See Romans 1. v. 7. 1 These. 5.27.
Col. 4.16.

Object. But the Scriptures are obscure and hard to be understood, and
therefore simple and unlearned men cannot profit by reading of them.

Ans. The Scriptures are in themselves perspicuous, and plain enough: They are
written in such a style as is most fit for the Instruction of the whole Church,
yea all things that are necessary to be known and believed of all men to
salvation are plainly and manifestly laid down in the Scriptures. And therefore
all sorts of men may profit by reading of them. Psalm. 19.7. Prove. 1.4. Psalm.
119.130. Prove. 6.23. Psalm. 119.115. 2 Pet. 1.19.

Q. Seeing you affirm the Scriptures to be in themselves perspicuous, and yet
they seeem dark to many that read them, tell me therefore to whom are the
Scriptures plain and easy to be understood?

A. To Spiritual and Regenerate Persons, using the means, which God has
appointed to bring us to the right understanding of the Scriptures. All the
words of wisdom are plain to him that understands. Prove. 8.9. 1 Cor. 2.15.

But to natural, and carnal men, neglecting the means they seem very dark,
and obscure. See 1 Cor. 2.14. 2 Cor. 4.3, 4.

Q. Tell me then what are the ordinary Means, which are to be used to bring
us to the right understanding of the Scriptures?

A. They are these.

1. Humble and fervent prayers unto God: we must entreat the Lord to open the
eyes of our understanding, that so we may understand the Scriptures. Psalm.
119.18, 68. Luc. 24.45. Prove. 2.2.

2. Frequent and attentive reading, with Confideration of all the circumstances
of the Text.

3. Conference of other places: we must compare Scripture with Scripture, and
expound one place of Scripture by another.

4. We must get humble and docible hearts: we must read the word with a desire
to learn the Truth: and with a purpose to submit unto it. Psalm. 19.9.14. Prove.
8.32.

5. We must make conscience of the practice of what we know. Joh. 7.17. Psalm.
119.100.

6. We must with diligence attend upon the public Ministry of the Word, 1
These. 5.20.

Q. How are the Scriptures divided?

A. Into the old and new Testament.

Q. How is the Old Testament divided?

A. Into the Law and the Prophets; or Moses and the Prophets, Mat. 11.13. Luc.
16.29.31.

Q. Does this Division comprehend the whole Old Testament.

A. Yes For by Moses we are to understand the five Books of Moses, which
contain the whole Law: and by the Prophets we are to understand all those
Books which the holy Prophets have written as expositions of the Law of Moses.
Luc. 24.27. Act. 28.23.

Q. Whether are the books called Apocripha to be received as part of the Old
Testament, and accounted Canonical Scripture or no?

A. The whole Old Testament from the beginning of Genesis to the end of Malachy
is Canonical Scripture: But the Books called Apocrypha, are no part of this
sacred Canon; and therefore they are fitly distinguished from the authentical
Books of the old Testament by this title Apocripha.

Q. How may this appear, that these Apocryphal Books are not to be accounted
Canonical Scripture?

A. By these Arguments.

1. All the Canonical Books of the old Testament were written by Prophets in
the Hebrew tongue: But these Apocryphal books were not penned by Prophets,
neither were they written Originally in the Hebrew tongue,

2. All the Canonical Books of the Old Testament were committed to the Jews
and they wear faithful Registers of them. But the Jews never received these
Apocryphal books as Canonical, never kept them as the Oracles of God. Romans
3.2.

3. Many errors and humane frailties are found in these Apocriphall Books
which cannot agree to Books indicted by the holy Ghost. And therefore these
Books are not to be accounted Canonical. Read Tob. 6.6, 7. and Tob. 5.11,
12. Tob. 12.15. compared with Rev. 8.2, 3, 4. 2 Macc. 14.37, 41, 42. and 2
Macc. 12.43, 44. Eccles. 46.20. compared with 1 Samuel 28.6. etc.

Q. What are the number of the Books that are to be accounted Canonical?

A. The Canonical Books of the Old Testament are thirty nine: the Canonical
Books of the New Testament are twenty seven.

Q. Why are the Scriptures of the Old, and New Testament called Canonical?

A. Because they contain the Canon, or Rule of our Faith and life. Gal. 6.16.
Phil. 3. verse. 16.

Q. What is the proper Office of this Canon of Scriptures?

A. First our Faith must be measured by this sacred Canon.

Secondly all Controversies in Religion must be divided be this Rule of truth.

Thirdly our life and all our actions must be guided by the Canonical
Scripture, as by a straight Line and Rule. Gal. 6.16.

Q. Seeing you affirm Canonical Scripture to be the Rule of Faith, and the
Judge of all controversies, tell me therefore, how know you that the Scriptures
are of infallible truth?

A. The Scriptures are the very word of God: and therefore of infallible truth,
and divine Authority. They therefore that ground their faith upon Canonical
Scripture, build upon a Rock, and not upon the sand. 2 Pet. 1.19.

Q. How know you the Scriptures to be the very Word of God?

A. First the Scripture does testify this of it self, 2 Timothy 3. verse. 16. All
Scripture is given by inspiration of God. etc. 2 Peter 1. v. 21.

Secondly, Gods own spirit, does testify to the consciences of his Children,
and assure them, that the Scriptures are the Oracles of God. 1 John 2.20, 27.

Thirdly, many Arguments may be drawn out of Canonical Scriptures, whereby we
may, discern these Books to be no humane writings but the very word of God.

Q. What are those Arguments, which may induce a reasonable man to believe that
the Scriptures are the Word of God?

A. They are these; First the purity and divine perfection of the Doctrine
contained in Scripture: Here are many sacred and heavenly Mysteries concerning
men's Salvation, which are far above the reach of humane reason, and could
never have been found out, had not God revealed them by his Spirit. Psalm. 19.7.
119.96. Prove. 30. verse. 5. 1 Timothy 3. verse. 16. 1 Cor. 2. verse. 7, 9, 10.

2. The Scriptures contain many Prophesies of such things as could not be
foreseen in their causes: which have been fulfilled in the same manner as they
were foretold. Genesis 15.13, 14. 49.10. 1 King. 13.2, 3, 5. Isai. 44.28.45. 1.
Jer. 25.11, 12. 2 These. 2.7, 8.

3. The Scriptures are of admirable power and efficacy to humble and terrify
the Sinner to comfort the conscience, and to convent the Soul Heb. 4. verse.
12. Act. 24. v. 25. Psalm. 19. verse. 7.

4. Such is the grace and Majesty of the Scriptures, though written in a
plain and easy style as is not to be found in any humane Author. 1 Timothy 5.
verse. 21. 1 Corinthians. 1.17, 18, 21, 24.

5. The sweet Harmony, and perfect concord of every part of Scripture with
other: notwithstanding these Books were written by diverse persons in sundry
places at sundry times.

6. The Antiquity of the Scriptures above all humane writings. And the
admirable preservation of this Book, notwithstanding the strange malice of
Satan, and his wicked Instruments against it.

7. The gracious simplicity of the Penmen of Scripture, who neither spare their
friends nor themselves, but most freely and impartially set down their own
faults, and infirmities, as well as others: which had they been guided by
humane reason, they would never have done.

8. The constant Testimony of many holy Martyrs; and of the Church of Christ
in all ages.

Q. You have proved the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and therefore I doubt
not but a Christian may boldly build his Faith upon them: But whether are the
Scriptures a sufficient and perfect Rule of Faith and Obedience?

A. Yes, all points of necessary Faith and practice are contained in the
written word, and therefore the Scriptures are a sufficient and perfect Rule.

Q. What are we to understand by the Contents of Scripture.

A. By the Contents of Scripture, we must understand not only what is expressed
in so many letters and syllables, but whatsoever may thence by manifest and
necessary consequence be deduced.

Q. How may it appear that the Scriptures are a sufficient and perfect rule?

A. By these Arguments: First, the Scriptures are able to make a man wise to
Salvation through Faith in Jesus Christ. 2 Timothy 3.15. Jam. 1.21. Joh. 20.31.

2. The Law and the Gospel (which are the subject matter of Scripture) are
both perfect. The Law is so perfect a Rule of all to be done that nothing may
be added to it or taken from it: Deuteronomy. 4. v. 2. Deuteronomy. 12. v. 32. The Gospel is
so perfect a Rule of all things needful to be believed that nothing may be
added to it or taken from it. See Gal. 1.8, 9.

3. All that we need to bring us to Salvation is either to be taught, or
reproved, or instructed, or corrected, or comforted. But all this the
Scriptures are able to do, they are able to teach, to reprove, to correct, to
instruct in all righteousness, and to comfort in all estates. Read 2 Timothy
3.16. Prove. 2.1, 9. Romans 15.4. Psalm. 119.50. Isai. 8.20. Luc. 16.29, 31. Joh.
5.39. Ephesians. 2.20. Lu. 24.44. Act. 26.22, 25. Act. 28.23.

4. The Scriptures are able to furnish the man of God (that is the Minister)
sufficiently to every duty of the Ministry, and to make him perfect (whose
duty it is to declare the whole Counsel of God to the People) therefore they
are much more able to give the people sufficient Instruction So 2 Timothy 3.17.
Act. 20.27.

5. The Scripture is styled a Rule: now a Rule must be fit to measure that
which is to be measured by it without addition otherwise it is no just Rule.
Gal. 6.16. Phil. 3.16.

Q. What gather you from this Doctrine of the Sufficiency of the Scriptures?

A. Seeing the Scriptures are a sufficient, and perfect Rule, therefore we need
no unwritten verities no Traditions of men to supply any supposed defect of the
written word of God. Isai. 29.13. Mat. 15.6, 9. Col. 2.8.

The six Principles of Mr PERKINS expounded.
The first Principle.
Q. WHat do thou believe concerning God?

A. There is one God, Creator and Governor of all things, distinguished into
the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

The Exposition.
Q. What particulars are to be observed in this Principle?

A. Three things are here set down to be believed concerning God. First the
Unity of the Godhead. 2. The Distinction of this one God into three persons.
3. The works, whereby God has made himself known.

Q. How is God One?

A. In being and Essence: the Spiritual Essence of God is but one, and no more
in number. Deuteronomy. 6.4. Mark 12.32. 1 Cor. 8.4, 5, 6.

Q. Can you give me any true Definition or Description of God?

A. God as he is in himself is known to himself only; and therefore a perfect
definition of God cannot be given: but yet he may be described sufficiently to
distinguish him from all Idols, from all Creatures whatsoever. Job. 11.7.

Q. How may God be described?

A. By his Attributes.

Q. What are the Attributes of God?

A. They are those essential properties which are attributed to God in
Scripture, that we may thereby the better conceive of his incomprehensible
Essence.

Q. Tell me how may God be described by his Attributes?

A. Thus. God is a spirit absolutely perfect, Eternal, Infinite and Immutable.
See Joh. 4.24. Genesis 17.1. Psalm. 90.2, 4. Isai. 44.6. and 1 Timothy 1.17. Psalm.
139.7, 8, 9, 10. Jer. 23.24. Mal. 3.6. Psalm. 102.26, 27. Jam. 1.17.

Q. How else?

A. Thus. The Lord is a living God, of divine understanding, and will, of
infinite power, and infinitely holy, infinitely Just, infinitely Merciful,
etc. See Deuteronomy. 5.26. Jer. 10.10. Psalm. 139.2, 3, 4. and 147.5. Romans 11.33.
Exodus 33.19. Dan. 4.35. Job. 42.2. Psalm. 115.3. and 135.6. Isai. 6.3. Hab.
1.13. Deuteronomy. 32.4. Exodus 20.5, 6. and 34.6, 7. Psalm. 103.8, 9.

Q How is this one God distinguished?

A. Into the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. And these three Persons, or
Subsistencyes are not three Gods, but one God, having one and the same simple,
and divine Essence together. Mat. 3.16, 17. and 28.19. 2 Cor. 13.14. 1 John
5.7. Joh. 10.30, 38. and 14.9, 10, 11.

Q. What is the Father?

A. The Father is the first Person in the Trinity, who by a divine generation
has eternally begotten his beloved Son of himself. Prove. 8.22, 25. Joh.
1.1. Mat. 3.17. Heb. 7.3.

Q. What is the Son?

A. The son is the second Person, begotten of the Father from all eternity;
who is also called the Word, Joh. 1.1. and 1 John 5.7. Heb. 1.6. Joh. 1.14.18.

Q. What is the holy Ghost?

A. The Holy Ghost is the third Person proceeding from the Father and the Son.
Joh. 14.26, and 15.26. and 16.7. Gal. 4.6.

Q. Wherein do these three Persons differ?

A. They differ not in degree or dignity, for they are Coequall: Joh. 5.17,
18. Phil. 2.6. But they are distinct in order and manner of subsisting. The
Father is a Person without beginning, and therefore the first in order. Jo.
5.17, 18. Phil. 2.6.

The Son is of the Father alone, and therefore the second person in order.

The holy Ghost is of the Father, and of the Son, and therefore the third
Person in order, Mat. 28.19. 1 John 5.7.

Q. How else are these three Persons distinguished?

A. By their relative and personal properties.

The relative and personal property of the Father is to be unbegotten, and to
beget. Psalm. 2.7. Heb. 1.5.

The relative property of the Son is to be begotten Joh. 1.14.18.

The relative property of the Holy Ghost is to proceed. Joh. 15.26.

Q. What are the works whereby God has made himself known to the world?

A. Creation and Providenc; which are usually attributed to God the Father.

Q. What is Creation?

A. Creation is the first outward work of God whereby of nothing he made all
things very good. Genesis 1.1.31. Heb. 11.3. Romans 4.17.

Q. With what instrument did God make the world?

A. God used no other Instrument, but his word. Genesis 1.3, 8, 9. Psalm. 33.6.9.
and 148.5. Heb. 11.3.

Q. How long did God continue working before this great work was finished?

A. Six days.

Q. To what end did God make the world?

A. For the communication of his goodness; and the manifestation of his Glory.
Psalm. 115.16. Prove. 16.4. Rev. 4.11.

Q. What is Providence?

A. Providence is the second outward work of God whereby he preserves and
governs all the Creatures he has made, and provideth for every one of them.
Neh. 9.6. Psalm. 36.6. Heb. 1.3. Act. 17.28. Psalm. 136.25. and 245.25, 16. 1
Pet. 4.19. and 5.7.

Q Does the Providence and Government of God extend to all things?

A. Yes, there is not any creature, there is not any thing belonging to any
creature but comes under the hand of Gods government, and under the eye of his
Providence. Psalm. 136.25. Prove. 15.3. Joh. 1.17. and 4.6, 7, 8. Psalm. 147.9.
Luc. 12.6, 7.24, 27, 28.

Q How does God provide for his Creatures?

A. Ordinarily God provideth for them by ordinary means and this is styled
Gods ordinary Providence. Sometimes God provideth for them extraordinarily and
by miracle; and this is called his extraordinary Providence. Psalm. 147 8, 9.
Hos. 2.21, 22. Act. 14.17. Romans 10.13, 14, 15. Exodus 14.21, 22. and 34, 28.
Deuteronomy. 8.34. Neh. 9.20, 21. 1 King. 17.4, 6. Dan. 3.

The second PRINCIPLE.
WHat do thou believe concerning Man, and concerning thine own self?

A. All men are wholly corrupted with sin through Adams fall, and so are
become slaves of Satan, and guilty of eternal damnation.

The Exposition.
Q. What is the Sum of this Principle?

A. The estate of Man as he is fallen, is here expressed. all men by nature are
sinful and miserable.

The estate of Man by creation is here employed: for Adams fall does imply a
good and happy estate, from which he fell.

Q. What was Adam?

A. The first man that God made, and the common Root of Mankind.

Q. What was the estate wherein Adam was created, and from which he fell?

A. Adam was made in the Image, and likeness of God a most excellent and
happy Creature. And such as was the estate of Adam, such should have been the
estate of all his posterity, if he had not fallen. Genesis 1.27. Jam. 3.9. Eccl.
7.29.

Q. Seeing man was created in the image of God, tell me wherein did this image
consist.

A. It consisted chiefly in those excellent gifts and habits of Wisdom,
Holiness, and Righteousness which God bestowed upon Man, whereby man was able
in a Spiritual manner to resemble the Wisdom, Holiness, and Righteousness
of God his Creator. Col. 3.10. Ephesians. 4.24.

Q. How did Adam loose his Original Righteousness that God bestowed on him?

A. By his disobedience, in eating the fruit of that tree, whereof God had
expressly commanded him, that he should not eat Genesis 3.

Q. What tree was it, the fruit whereof was forbidden?

A. The tree of knowledge of good and evil. Genesis 2.17.

Q. Was this transgression of Adam the transgression of all men?

A. Yes, Adam was the common Root of Mankind all men were in his loins, and
therefore in Adam all have sinned. Romans 5.12. Heb. 7.9, 10.

Q. What is the estate of man by nature since the fall of Adam?

Ans. All men are by nature the children of wrath being dead in trespasses and
sins. Ephesians. 2.1, 3. Ephesians. 4.18. Col. 2.13. 1 Timothy 5. verse. 6.

Q. What is sin?

A. Sin is the Transgression or breach of the Law of God. 1 John 3.4.

Q. How many sorts of sins are there?

A. Two: Original Corruption, Actual Transgressions.

Q. What particulars are needful to be known concerning Original sin?

A. These four: first the parts whereof it consists: secondly, the parties
corrupted, and infected with it; thirdly, the Extent of it; 4ly the outward
Efficient cause of it: whereof the three latter are expressed in this Principle.

Q. What are the parts of Original sin?

A. The parts whereof it consists are two: the privation and absence of
Original righteousness, and the contrary habit of unrighteousness, or an
indisposition to good, and an inclination, and pronenesse to all manner of
evil. 1 Cor. 2.14. Genesis 6.5. and 8.21.

Q. What parties are infected with Original sin?

A. All men whatsoever, that descend from Adam by ordinary generation: no
creature begotten of Adam is exempted from this corruption. Such as the Root
is such will the branches be: like egg, like bird. Romans 3.19 and 5.12. Genesis
6.5.

Q. What is the extent of it?

A. This Original corruption is the defilement of the whole man; all the
powers and faculties of the soul, and all the members of the body are infected
with it. The mind is vain, and fleshly: the understanding dark and blind.
Joh. 15.16. 1 These. 5.23. Ephesians. 4.17. Col. 2.18. Ephesians. 4.18. Romans 8.7. 1 Cor.
2.14 2 Cor. 3.5.

The Conscience is defiled, Tit. 1.15.

The will is perverse obstinate and Rebellious. Phil. 2.13. Joh. 15.5. Joh.
15.16. Ezekiel. 36.26. Mat. 23.37. Gal. 3.17.

The affections are unruly, and disordered. Gal. 5.24. Romans 7.23. Prove. 2.14.
Ephesians. 4.19.

And all the members of the body are the ready Instruments of the soul for the
execution of sin. Romans 6.13, 19.

Q. Whence comes this Original sin? what is the Efficient cause of it?

A. The transgression, and disobedience of Adam. By one man sin entered into
the world, Romans 5.12, 19. All men were in Adams loins, when he sinned; and
therefore all men being equally guilty of Adams Transgression, are equally
infected with Original sin from the womb. Psalm: 51 5. and 58.3.

Q. What are the fruits, that Original sin brings forth?

A. All actual sins: Evil thoughts in the mind; inordinate affections in
the heart; corrupt speeches, and wicked deeds are as streams, that flow
continually from this impure Fountain, this sink, and puddle of Original
Concupiscence. Gen: 6.5. Mar: 7.21, 22. Jam. 1.14, 15. Romans 7.13.

Q. What is the Punishment, that every sin deserves?

A. The curse of God. Cursed is every one, that continues not in all things,
which are written in the book of the law to do them, Gal. 3.10.

Q. What are the parts, and branches of this?

A. They are these, viz. 1. Spiritual bondage under Satan. All men by nature
are slaves of Satan, to whom they have voluntarily enthralled themselves.
Satan reigns in the hearts of natural men, and they willingly acknowledge
him to be their Prince, by doing his will, living under his laws and
delighting in his works of darkness. Joh. 8.34.44. Romans 6.20. 2 Cor. 4.4. Joh.
12.31. Ephesians. 2.2. 2 Timothy 2.26. Heb. 2.15. 1 John 5.19.

2. Temporal calamities, and Judgments innumerable. See Deuteronomy. 28.

3. Temporal death which is the Separation of the soul from the body Romans
1.32. and 5.12.

4. Eternal death and Damnation in Hell. Romans 8.6, 13. Mar. 16.16.

Q. What is Hell?

A. It is a place prepared of God for the eternal punishment of the wicked,
both Angels and Men: where the worm dies not and the fire is not quenched,
where the torments are both endless and easeless. Mat. 25.41. Isa. 30.33. Mar.
943.48.

Q. Does every sin deserve eternal death?

A. Yes; every sin being committed against an infinite God, deserves eternal
punishment.

Q. When shall sinners be cast into Hell?

A. The souls of the wicked when they go out of their bodies are sent
immediately to Hell, where they are kept imprisoned until the day of
Judgment: and then these bodies shall be joined to their souls, and both
together shall be cast into hell fire; as they sinned together on earth so they
shall suffer together in hell everlastingly. Lu. 16.22, 23. Mat. 10.28. Mat.
25.46.

The Third PRINCIPLE.
Q. WHat means is left for thee to escape this damnable estate?

A. Jesus Christ the eternal Son of God, being made man, by his death upon
the Cross, and by his righteousness, has perfectly alone by himself
accomplished all things that are needful for the salvation of man.

The Exposition.
Q. What is the sum of this Principle?

A. This Principle contains the comfortable Doctrine of perfect Salvation by
Christ, which is the sum of the Gospel.

Q. What are the parts of this principle?

A. They are principally two,

First the Author of Salvation, the person of the Redeemer is here described.

Secondly the great work of Redemption is expounded.

Q. Who is the Redeemer?

A. Jesus Christ.

Q. Why is the Redeemer called Jesus?

A. Jesus is the proper name of the Redeemer and it signifies a Savior. The
Redeemer was called Jesus, because he was to save his people from their sins,
Mat. 1.21.

Q. Why is the Redeemer called Christ?

A. As Jesus is the proper name of the Redeemer, so Christ is the name of his
office, and it signisieth one anointed. The Redeemer, was called Christ, or
Messiah, because he was ananointed of God that he might be a fit (a) Prophet,
and (b) Priest, and (c) King to his Israel. Joh. 4.25. (a) Luke 4.18. and
24.19. Mat. 17.5. and 21.11. (b) Psalm. 110.4. Heb. 5.5, 6. (c) Psalm 45.6, 7.
Luc. 1.32, 33.

Q. How was the Redeemer anointed.

A. The Spirit of God was powered upon him without measure: God anointed him
with the holy Ghost and power: Act. 10 38. Heb. 1.9. Psalm. 45.7, 8. Joh. 3.34.
Isai: 61.1. Lu. 4 18.

Q. Wherein does the Prophetical office of Christ consist?

A. The Prophetical office of Christ consists in revealing to the Church the
whole will of his Father: even all things necessary to salvation. Math. 11.27.
Joh. 1.18. Deuteronomy. 18.18. Joh. 15.15.

Christ is the great Doctor of the Church, who teaches his Disciples,
outwardly by his Word, and inwardly by his Spirit. Mat. 23.8, 10. Heb. 3.1.

Q. Wherein consists the Pristhood of Christ?

A. It consists chiefly in offering himself a propitiatory sacrifice to his
Father, to the end he might fully satisfy the Justice of God for our sins,
and so might reconcile us unto his Father. Ephesians. 5.2. Romans 3.25. 1 John 2.2.
and 4.10. Mat. 20.28. Isa. 53.10. Heb. 9. verse. 26.

To this satisfaction which Christ made to the Justice of God, while he was
upon earth, we may add the perpetual intercession, which he makes for us now
in Heaven. And so the parts of his Priesthood are two. Expiation and
Intercession. Romans 8 34. Heb. 7.24, 25. and 9.24.

Q. Wherein does the Kingdom of Christ consist?

A. 1. In the Collection of his Church, and gathering his subjects out of the
world Act. 15.18. Col. 1.13.

2. In the protection, and peaceable government of his Church in the world: in
the defending his subjects and subduing his and their enemies. Isa. 11.6, 7, 8,
9. Mat. 16.18. Joh. 10.28. Psalm. 110.1, 2. and Psalm. 2.9.

3. In rewarding his subjects and punishing his enemies in the world to come.
Mat. 25.33, 34, 41, 46. Joh. 5.28.29.

Q. What kind of person is Christ the Redeemer?

A. Christ is the eternal Son of God made man, that is, God and man in one
person. Hence he was called Immanuel, which signifies God with us. Mat. 1.23.
Is. 7.14. 1 Timothy 3.16.

Q. Tell me more particularly, what is to be considered in the person of Christ
the Redeemer?

A. His two natures divine and humane: and the union of them.

Q. How are we to conceive of the Divine nature or Godhead of Christ?

A. Christ is the natural and only begotten Son of God: coessentiall,
coequall and coeternall with God the Father and God the holy Ghost. Joh. 1.14,
18. Joh. 10.30. Phil: 2.6. Joh: 1.1. and 17.5. Romans 9.5.

Q. How are we to conceive of the Humane nature or manhood of Christ.

A. The Manhood of Christ consists of a reasonable soul, and of a true
humane body: and subsisteth in the second person of the Deity. Mat. 26.38. and
17.5. Lu. 24.39. Heb. 2.14. 1 John 1.1.

Q. Was Christ like unto Adam, Abraham and other Men?

A: Yes, as he is true God, so he is true man. Christ our Savior took to him
the substance, the Essential properties and the common infirmities of man's
nature: he was like unto us in all things, yet without sin. 1 Timothy: 2.5. Joh:
4.6, 7. Mar: 11.12, 13. Heb: 2.17. and 4.15. and 7.26. 1 John 2.1.

Q: How did Christ become man?

A: He was not begotten but was made man. He was conceived of the holy Ghost
and borne of the Virgin Mary. Rom: 1.3. Gal: 4.4. Mal: 1.18.20. Lu: 1.30, 31.

Q. How are we to understand this, that Christ was conceived by the Holy Ghost?

A. Thus, Christ was conceived not of the substance but of the power of the
Holy Ghost: the holy Ghost by his incomprehensible power wrought his conceptio^
supernaturally. Lu: 1.35.

Q: How are we to conceive of the Union of these two natures of Christ?

A. Although Christ consist of two Natures, yet he is but one Person. The
manhood of Christ is united immediately to the Person of the Son, and by the
person, to the Godhead of the Son: and so the nature assuming, and the
nature assumed, make but one Person of the Redeemer, one Christ. Joh. 1.14.
Luke 1.35. Col. 2.9.

Q. What kind of union is this?

A. A Personal union, but not a union of Persons: a Union of natures not in
nature: a Union of two natures in one person.

Q: But are not these two natures mingled and confounded in Christ?

A: No verily; although they be inseparably united in person, yet they remain
still distinct in substance, properties, and actions, 1 Pet. 3.18. 2 Cor. 13.4.

Q: Why was it necessary that God and man should be thus united in Christ's
Person?

A: It was necessary that Christ should be God-man, that he might be a fit
Mediator between God and man; that he might be every way fit both to reconcile
God to man, and man to God.

Q: Tell me more particularly why was it necessary, that Christ should be Man?

A. It was necessary that Christ should be made man; First that the Lord might
perform the promise, which was made to Adam in Paradise, that the seed of the
woman should bruise the Serpents head, Gen: 3.15. If Christ had not been made
of a woman, he could not have been the promised Messiah.

Secondly, because our redeemer was to suffer and dye for us: but God could not
suffer. 1 Timothy: 12.5, 6.

Thirdly because it makes most for the glory of Gods justice to exact
satisfaction from that nature, that had sinned. Man had sinned and therefore
man must suffer. Heb. 2.14, 16.

Q: Why was it necessary, that Christ should be God also?

A. 1. That he might not be swallowed up of death, that he might be able to
bear the wrath of God, and to conquer and overcome Satan, Death and Hell for
us.

2. That his obedience, and sufferings might be of infinite value and merit.
Act. 20.28.

Q. Hitherto of the person of the Redeemer; it remains to consider of the
work of Redemption? Tell me now what kind of work is this work of
Redemption?

A. As the Person of the Redeemer is wonderful; Isa: 9.6. so the work of
Redemption which he has wrought for us, is admirable: as two distinct natures
concur to make the Person of the Redeemer: so the operations of both these
natures concur to the effecting of this great work of Man's Redemption.

Q. How may this admirable work of Redemption be described?

A. Redemption is a most gracious, and powerful deliverance out of the
captivity of sin, and Satan; and from the curse of the Law. Tit. 2.14. Heb:
2.14, 15. Gal. 3.13.

Q. How, and with what price has Christ redeemed us?

A. Not with silver, and gold, but with his precious blood. Christ has
redeemed us, by making full satisfaction unto the justice of God for us. 1 Pet:
1.18, 19. Ephesians: 1.7. Col: 1.14.

Q. To whom was the price of Redemption paid?

A. Christ paid the price of our Redemption to God his Father. We were captives
to Satan, no otherwise, then as Satan is the minister of God for the execution
of that curse of the Law, which the justice of God has denounced, and
threatened against all sinners: and therefore Satisfaction was to be made unto
God. Gal: 3.10.

Q. How, and by what means has Christ made satisfaction to the justice of God
for us?

A. By his voluntary obedience, both active, and passive: Christ our Surety
has paid all our debts for us, both the principal, and the forfeiture, that
so we might be freely, and fully discharged.

Q. What are we to understand by the active obedience of Christ?

A. The obedienee of his life, performed to the whole Law of God for us: When
Christ lived upon earth, he fulfilled all righteousness, which we were to
fulfill: he kept every Commandment exactly, in thought, word, and deed; he
perfectly performed the perfect Law of God, in our stead: and this is called
his active obedience. Matt: 3.15. and 5.17. Gal: 4.4, 5. Rom: 5.19. and 10.4.

Q. What are we to understand by his passive obedience?

A. By the passive obedience of Christ, we are to understand his whole Passion,
which ended in his Death upon the Cross. Phil: 2.8. 1 Pet. 2.24.

Q. What manner of death was that, which Christ suffered upon the Cross?

A. A cursed death; and a meritorious death.

Q. Why do you call it a cursed death?

A. Because it was not only ignominious, and shameful before men; but also
accursed before God: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a
tree. Deuteronomy: 21.23. Gal: 3.13.

Q. Why did Christ suffer this kind of death, rather then any other?

A. To declare that he was made a Curse for us, to the end that he might
redeem us from the Curse of the Law.

Q. Why do you call the death, that Christ suffered upon the Cross, a
meritorious death.

A. Because it was the price of our Redemption. The death of an Ordinary man is
a duty, and a debt; but the death of Christ was a satisfactorie oblation, and a
full price of Redemption. Ephesians: 5.2. Mat: 20.28. 1 Timothy 2.6.

Q. What made the death of Christ thus meritorious?

A. The infinite dignity of his person. Christ who willingly suffered death,
was not a mere man but God and man in one person: and therefore it is said,
that God purchased his Church with his own blood. Hence it is that the death of
Christ is of infinite value and merit, a price sufficient for the ransom of
the whole world: for in that the natural and eternal Son of God suffered
death it is more, then if all men in the world had suffered for ever. 1 Cor:
2.8. Tit. 2.13.14. Act. 20.28.

Q. Did Christ suffer for us the first death only?

A. The whole curse of the Law due to our sins, was laid upon Christ our
Surety; and therefore as Christ suffered the first death for us; so he tasted
of the second death also, he did drink up the bitter cup of his Fathers wrath
even the torments of Hell, which made him cry out My God my God why have thou
forsaken me. Mat. 27.46. Isa. 53.5. Heb. 2.9. Mat. 26.38, 39.42. Luke 22.44.
Isa. 63.3.

Q. What are the fruits and effects of Christ's death?

A. By the death of Christ the wrath of God is appeased, the sins of the
redeemed are remitted, Satan, Death and Hell are vanquished; and consequently,
those that were miserable captives, are graciously and powerfully delivered out
of the hands of all their spiritual Enemies. Now those who are thus delivered
from the captivity of Sin, and Satan here, shall have perfect deliverance
from all sin, corruption, wrath, and misery hereafter. Christ has merited
perfect and eternal Redemption for us: and therefore we expect a day of full
Redemption. Ephesians. 5.2. Heb. 9.26. Col. 1.14. and Ephesians. 1.7. Isai. 53.12. Ephesians.
4.8. Col. 2.15. Heb. 2.14, 15. Luke 21.28. Romans 8.23. Heb. 9.12. Ephesians. 1.14.
and 4.30.

Q. Has Christ left any thing to those that are redeemed by him, to be done,
or suffered in way of merit, or satisfaction to the justice of God?

A. Nothing at all. Christ is a most absolute and perfect Redeemer, and
Savior: Christ alone has done and suffered all things that are needful for
the Salvation of man; and therefore the glory of that great work of Man's
Redemption, and Salvation, belongs to Christ alone. The righteousness,
obedience and sufferings of Christ are no way defective; The satisfaction that
Christ has made to the Justice of God, is absolutely perfect: now that which
is perfect is marred by adding ought unto it. Heb. 7.25. Tit. 2.14. Act. 4.12.

Q. What is required of those that are Redeemed by Christ?

A. The redeemed ought to live accoding to the will of their Redeemer. See Luc:
68.74, 75. and 1 Cor: 5.15. and 1 Pet: 2.24.

The fourth PRINCIPLE.
Q. But how may thou be made partaker of Christ, and his benefits?

A. A man of a contrite, and humble spirit, by faith alone apprehending, and
applying Christ, with all his merits to himself, is justified before God, and
sanctified.

The Exposition.
Q. What are the parts of this Principle?

A. This Principle lays down these three things: 1. The quality, and
disposition of the person, that shall attain to salvation by Christ in these
words, a man of a contrite and humble spirit. 2. What every one that would be
saved, must do: viz. by faith apprehend, and apply Christ with all his merits
to himself. 3. The fruits, and benefits, which follow upon our Union with
Christ, which are two, Justification and Sanctification.

Q. How must the sinner be qualified, that he may be made partaker of Christ.

A. He must be humbled, bruised, and broken: This Humiliation, and contrition
prepares the sinner for Christ: before the sinner be thoroughly humbled, and
kindly broken, he is altogether unfit to receive Christ. Isai: 57.15. and 66.2.
Isai: 61.1.

Q. Why must a Sinner be thus humbled, before he can be made partaker of Christ?

A. Because every man has naturally a proud, hard, and stony heart: and God
will not pour the oil of his grace, and mercy into any other, but a broken
Vessel; the sinner therefore must have his proud, and hard heart humbled, and
broken. Sinners must understand themselves to be, what they are indeed by
nature, before they will be willing to come out of their natural condition.
See Matt. 9.12, 13. Eze. 11.19. and 36.26. Zech. 7.12. Isai. 48.4. Psalm. 51.17.
and 147.3. Zeph. 3.12.

Q. Wherein does this Humiliation, whereby the sinner is prepared for Christ,
consist?

A. In such a sight of Sin, and sense of Misery, as drives a man to Gods
Mercy, and makes the sinner, seeing no means of help in himself, or the
creature, flee unto Christ. Matt. 11.28. Prove. 30.1, 2, 3. Romans 7.24, 25.

Q. How is it wrought?

A. God, by the moral Law, (which is a perfect Rule of righteousness)
discovers to the sinner his sin, and the punishment of it: and convinces the
sinner of his miserable, and wretched condition; and lets him see, that it is
impossible for him to come out of this condition, by his own strength, and
that it is in vain to expect help from the Creature. Now when a sinner is come
to a right knowledge of himself, to a true sight and sense of his vileness,
wretchedness, and spiritual wants, then lest he should be swallowed up of
despair, the Lord lets the sinner see his divine goodness, and his readiness
to forgive, and the Mercy that is laid up in Christ. Jer. 23.29. Romans 3.20. and
7.7. Rom: 4.15. and 7.9. Gal: 3.10. Job: 33.16, 19. -- 23.24. Gal: 3.22, 24.

Q. What follows hereupon?

A. When the sinner sees himself to be a bundle of sin and misery: when he
sees his sin, and the strict Justice of God, threatening death, and damnation
on the one hand, and the great Goodness of God, with the Mercy that is
revealed and offered in Christ, on the other hand: then he loathes himself,
bewailes his sin, flees unto God for mercy, being willing to take Christ
upon any terms, upon any conditions. When the heart of the sinner is thus
kindly broken, it is then a fit vessel to receive the precious oil of Gods
Mercy. Ezekiel: 36.31. Zech: 12.10. Act: 2.37. Jer: 31.18. Luc: 15.18, 19. Matt:
11.28. Isai: 61.1. Isai: 42.3. Hos: 14.3.

Q. Are there not degrees of this Humiliation?

A. Yes; but every sinner must be humbled so far as may prepare him, and make
him fit to receive Christ. Now a sinner is then prepared for Christ, when he is
convinsed of the Necessity of a Savior: when he is made sensible of sin, and
misery, and flexible, and tractable to good; when he is willing to yield, and
submit unto Christ, and disposed to take any impression from Gods hand. Act:
2.37. Act: 9.6. Act: 16.30.

Q. When a sinner is thus humbled, what must he do, that he may be saved?

A. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Act. 16.30, 31. Faith in Christ is the
only way to life, and salvation. Mar: 16.16. Joh: 3.14, 15, 16. Joh: 6.47. and
20.31. Rom: 1.17. and. 10.9, 10.

Q. How does Faith save us?

A. As an Instrument applying Christ. When we say, that Faith saves us, the
meaning is, that Christ apprehended by faith, does save us. As the hand may be
said to feed, and nourish the Body: so Faith may be said to save the Soul.
Christ is the Savior of sinners; and Faith is the hand of the Soul, that
lays hold on Christ, and cleaves to this Savior. Christ is the Treasure,
that does make us rich; and Faith is the hand wherewith we receive this
Treasure. Act: 3.16. Rom: 3.24, 25. Joh: 1.12.

Q. Is it Faith alone that saves the Believer?

A. True Faith never goes alone, without other graces, and fruits of the
sanctifying Spirit: but yet Faith only is it, which as an hand, or instrument
applying Christ does save us. Galat: 5.22. Mark: 5.36. Rom: 3.28.

Q. Have all those true faith, who profess to believe in Christ?

A. No: faith is in the mouths of many, but in the hearts of few. An
historical faith may be found in many: but a Justifying, saving Faith, is
proper to the elect children of God; and therefore it is styled the Faith of
Gods elect. 2 These: 3.2. Joh: 10.26. Act: 13.48. Tit. 1.1.

Q. How may this precious grace be described, what is Faith?

A. Faith is a special gift of God, whereby the Believer being convinced of
the truth, and goodness of the doctrine of the Gospel, embraces the promise
of special mercy in Christ, and applies Christ with all his merits to
himself. Ephe. 2.8. Phil. 1.29. 1 Timothy 1.15. Gal. 3.26, 27.

It is a special gift of God, whereby the Believer appropriateth, and applies
the general promise of grace, and mercy in Christ, to himself in particular,
resting wholly upon Christ for life, and salvation. Gal. 2.20. Cant: 8.5. Act.
15.11.

Q. What is the Object of Faith?

A. The general, and complete Object of Christian Faith, is the written word,
the whole will of God, revealed unto us in his Word. Act: 24.14. Joh: 20.31.

The special, and principal Object of a Justifying Faith, is Christ
crucified, Christ promised, and offered in the Gospel; or the Promise of
special grace, and mercy in Christ. 1 Cor: 2. verse. 2. Rom: 10. verse. 9. Gal:
2. verse. 16. and 3. verse. 26. Mar: 1. verse. 15. Joh: 1. verse. 12.

Q. What is the proper Subject, or Seat of Faith?

A. The whole Heart, and Soul. The understanding being enlightened does see the
promise of grace revealed in the Gospel, and does acknowledge it to be true.
The will being effectually inclined by the Spirit of God, gladly receives, and
embraces the promise of grace as sweet, and good. Act: 8.37. Rom: 10.10. Ephesians
1.17, 18. 1 Cor: 2.12. Act. 16.14. 1 Timothy: 1.15.

Q. What are the parts of Faith?

A. They are three. Heb: 11.13.

Q What is the first of them?

A. Knowledge. The understanding cannot yield assent to that divine truth,
which it knows not: Faith therefore does presuppose a distinct knowledge of
what is propounded to be believed. Although knowledge may be where Faith is
not; yet Faith can never be, where knowledge goes not before. Joh: 6.40. and 1 John: 4.16. Act: 16.18.

Q. What is the second?

A. Assent. the Believer in his understanding gives firm, and full Assent to
whatsoever is revealed, and promised in the Gospel. Rom: 4.20.21. Heb: 11.13.

Q What is the third?

A. Affiance. The Believer with his heart embraces the Promise of grace as his
own, and casts himself wholly upon Christ, cleaving to him, trusting in him,
and depending upon him for remission of sins, and eternal happiness. Cant:
6.3. Heb: 11.13. Job: 19.25. 2 Timothy: 1.12.

Q What is the principal Act of a Justifying Faith? wherein does it chiefly
consist?

A. It consists chiefly in the particular Application of the general Promise
of grace: or in Affiance, and Reliance upon Christ, when the Soul depends
wholly, and only upon Christ, looking after no other help. Gal: 2.20. Joh:
20.28. Psalm: 22.1. and 25.2. Hab: 1.12. Cant: 8.5.

Q. Seeing that Faith unites the Believer to Christ, tell me therefore, what
are the fruits, that follow upon this Union? what are the chief benefits that
every Believer receives from Christ?

A. Justification, and Sanctification here: and this Salvation which is begun
here, shall be perfected in unspeakable happiness, and eternal Glory
hereafter. 1 Cor: 1.30.

Q. What is Justification?

A. By the Justification of a Sinner, we are to understand that Action of God,
whereby God (beholding the sinner in Christ) absolves, and acquits him from all
his sins, pronounces him righteous, and consequently accepts him to life
everlasting. Rom: 3.30. and 8.33. Act: 13.39. Rom: 2.13.

Q. Is not a man justified before God, by that righteousness, that is inherent
in himself?

A. No: we are justified in Gods sight, not by my righteousness inherent in
us, but by the righteousness, and obedience of Christ imputed unto us; and
therefore Christ is styled, the Lord our righteousness. As our sins were
imputed to Christ; so Christ's righteousness is imputed to us: as the sin,
for which Christ suffered, is inherent in us, not in Christ; so the
righteousness, whereby we are justified, is inherent in Christ, not in us. 2
Cor: 5.21. Rom: 4.6. Jer: 23.6. 2 Cor: 5.21. Rom: 10.4.

Q. But this seems to be an absurd Doctrine, that a man should be made
righteous by the righteousness of another. We know a man cannot be wise with
another man's wisdom, a man cannot be warm with the clothes another wears;
and therefore how can, we be made righteous, how can we be justified in Gods
sight by that righteousness, which is resident in the Person of Christ and not
in our selves?

A. Although the righteousness, whereby we are justified, be inherent in the
Person of Christ, and not in us, yet it is not Christ's alone, but, as it is
his, so it is ours also. Look how the sin, and Transgression of Adam is made
our sin, in like manner the righteousness of Christ is ours. As the sin of
Adam was of force to condemn us, because we were in his loins, so the
righteousness, and obedience of Christ our Surety, is much more availeable to
justify us. Rom: 5.12, 19.

Q. In what sense, is the righteousness of our Savior Christ, ours?

A. As this righteousness (whereby we are justified before God) is Christ's
properly, and inherently; so it is ours truly, and really: both in regard of
our right, and interest to it; and in regard of the use, and fruit of it. See
Gen: 27.15. and 27.

Q. When is this righteousness made ours?

A. At what time we are effectually called, and spiritually united to Christ,
and made members of his mystical Body. For being truly, and really united to
Christ, the righteousness of Christ our Head is truly, and really made ours.
Rom: 8.1.

Q. How is this righteousness of Christ made ours?

A. By the free gift, and gracious Imputation of God; and by the Application of
Faith, 1 Cor. 1.30. Romans 4.6.11. Romans 3.22. and 4.13. Phil. 3.9. Heb. 11.7.

Q. What are the parts of Justification?

A They are two: Absolution from sin; and Acceptance to life eternal; both
which presuppose the imputation of the merits and righteousness of Christ. The
forgiveness of our sins, Christ merited by his passive Obedience our
gracious Acceptance and Admittance to eternal life, Christ merited by his
active obedience. Romans 4.6, 7, 8. Romans 5.18. 2 Cor: 5.19. Col. 1.21, 22. Rom:
5.18, 19.

Q. Hitherto of Justification: tell me now what is sanctification?

A. Sanctification is the Conformity of our nature to the pure nature of God.
When of unholy, we are renewed by the holy Spirit to the Image of our Heavenly
Father, and made holy when all vicious qualities are purged out of our hearts
in some good measure, and all gracious habits (which are the seeds of a
virtuous life) are planted in us, then we are said to be sanctified. 2 Pet.
1.4. Ephesians. 4.22, 23, 24. 2 Cor. 7.1. Gal. 5.22.

Q. Is the Sanctification of a Christian perfect in this life?

A. No; although Sanctification be of the whole man; yet the whole man is not
fully, and perfectly sanctified. The justification of a true Believer is
perfect, but his sanctification is imperfect in this life. Here we receive but
the first fruits of the Spirit: and this Sanctification of the Spirit (begun
here) increases daily until it be fully perfected in the life to come. Romans
8.23. 2 These. 2.13. and 1 Pet. 1.2. Rev. 22.11.

Q. What are the parts of Sanctification?

A. They are two: Mortification and Vivification.

Q. What is Mortification?

A: Mortification is the first part of Sanctification, wherein the old man by
the applycation of Christ his death, and Burial, is crucified, and buried in a
Christian. Rom: 6.3, 4, 6. 1 Pet: 4.1. Gal: 5.24.

Q. What is Vivification?

A. Vivification is the quickening of one that was dead in sin: or a daily
rising to newness of life, by the power and virtue of Christ his Resurrection.
Ephesians. 2.5. Romans 6.4, 5. Phil. 3. verse. 10.

Q. What shall such as are truly sanctified find in themselves?

A: A spiritual battle a continual conflict between corruption dying, and
Righteousness rising, and growing in them. Romans 7 Gal: 5.17.

Q. Do not the good works of the Children of God that are truly sanctified
merit at Gods hand eternal life and Salvation?

A: No verily: the best works, which the children of God perform are no more
then due debt; they are no way beneficial to God; they are no way comparable
to the glory that shall be revealed; and therefore they cannot Heaven: yea the
good works of the holiest men are stained with many imperfections, and
therefore the children of God have more cause to condemn themselves for their
good works, then to expect to be justified before God, and to be saved by
them. Luk: 17.10. Psalm: 16.2. Job: 22.2. and 35.7. Rom: 8.18. 2 Cor: 4.17. Is.
64.6. Psalm: 143.2. Job: 9.15.

Q: But are not good works necessary then to Salvation?

A: Although good works cannot merit heaven, though they cannot justify us is
Gods fight: yet they are in their kind, and order necessary, I say in their
kind and order; namely, good works are necessary, not as causes of salvation,
but as fruits, and inseparable companions of true faith, and as marks in the
way to Heaven. Yea good works are as the way, that will lead us to the
Kingdom of Heaven. Ephesians. 2.10.

Q Seeing the good works of the best children of God are stained with
imperfections; and seeing good works are not meritorious tell me therefore
what encouragement has a Christian to be fruitful in good works?

A. Although corruption cleaves to the best of our good works, yet seeing
this pollution is taken away by the Intercession of Christ, and so our good
works become acceptable to God in Christ Jesus; the consideration hereof
should make us zealous of good works, Exodus 28.36, 37, 38. 1 Pet. 3. verse. 5.
Titus 2. verse. 14.

Again, although good works be not meritorious, yet there are many good ends,
and necessary uses of good works which should excite Christians to bring
forth the fruits of holiness and righteousness, in abundance. Tit. 3.14.

Q: What are the necessary uses of good works? What are the ends a Christian
may aim at, in doing good works?

A. We must abound in good works;

1. That we may glorify God our Heavenly Father. Mat: 5.16. Joh: 15.8. Phil:
1.11.

2. That we may adorn the Gospel of Christ our Lord and Savior. Phil. 1.27.
Ephesians. 4.1. Col. 1.10. 1 These. 2.12.

3. That we may testify our thankfulness to God and to Christ, Rom: 12.1. 2
Cor. 7.1.

4. That we may testify, and manifest the truth, and sincerity of our faith,
Mat. 7.16, 17. Jam: 2.20.

5. That we may make our effectual calling, and election sure. 2 Pet. 1.5.10.
2 Timothy 2.21.

6. That we may confirm our weak brethren. Rom: 14.19.

7. That we may be patterns to others, and excite them to imitate our example.
2 Cor. 9.2.

8. That we may win such as are yet unconverted and even provoke them to
embrace the truth. 1 Pet. 3.1.

9. That we may at least stop the mouths of such persons as cannot be won. 1
Pet: 2.15.

The fifth PRINCIPLE.
Q. WHat are the ordinary and usual means for obtaining of Faith?

A. Faith comes only by preaching of the Word, and increases daily by it, as
also by the administration of the Sacraments and Prayer.

The Exposition.
Q. What are the parts of this principle?

A. This Principle lays down two things.

First the mean or the instrument of getting Faith, viz. The Word preached.

Secondly the Means, whereby faith being once bred in us is nourished
strengthened and increased, which are these 4. the same Word preached, the
Sacraments and Prayer.

Q. Is the Word preached the mean or instrument both of begetting and
increasing faith?

A. Yes, the Word is both the seed that breeds and the milk that feeds
Faith in us. See 1 Pet. 1.23. and 2.2. Romans 10.8.14.7. Jam. 1.18. Act. 20.32.
Romans 1.17.

Q. Is it in the power of the Word being faithfully preached, to work faith?

A. The word is not able of it self to work Faith in the hears of it. The
Word is not the principal worker of Faith, but a powerful Instrument, whereby
the Lord works faith in the hearts of his children. The same almighty
power, which raised up Christ from the dead, does create this grace in the
soul. Hence it is, that although many hear the Word faithfully preached, yet
but a few, even the Elect only believe. Se Act: 13.48. and Tit. 1.1. Rom:
10.16. Joh: 12.37, 38. Isa: 53.1. Rom: 1.16. Ephesians. 2.8. Isa. 57.19. Ephesians. 1.19
20. Mat: 13.11.

Q. Seeing the Lord is the principal worker of Faith, may not a man expect to
have saving faith wrought in his heart, without attending upon the Word
preached?

A. No, for the Lord delights to work by his own Means: as the Word cannot
work Faith without God, so God will not work Faith without it. Luke 16.21.

Q. Seeing the word is both the Seed, and the Food of Faith, tell me therefore
how ought we to hear the word preached, that we may profit by it?

A. Before we come to the public Ordinance, we must prepare our selves to go
to the place of Gods presence. When we are come to the house of God, we must
remember we are in Gods presence, and behave our selves as before him. After we
have heard the Word, we must meditate of that which we have heard, we must hide
it and lay it up in our hearts and endeavor to practice it. Luke 11.28. Joh.
13.17. Jam: 1.22. Exodus: 3.5. Josh. 5.15. Exodus 19.10, 11. Eccl: 5.1. Act:
10.33. Act. 17.10, 11. Job: 22.22. Psalm: 119.11. Luk: 2.19. and 51. Heb: 2.1.

Q. How are we to prepare our selves, before we come to the public Ordinance?

A. 1. We must lay aside whatsoever may binder the profitable hearing of the
Word. See Jam: 1.21. and 1 Pet: 2.1, 2. Jer: 4.3. Ezekiel: 33.31.

2. We must consider what our spiritual wants be and how necessary and
profitable the Word of God is for the relieving of these our wants, that so we
may get a spiritual appetite to this spiritual food of our souls: like newborn babes we must cry after this milk that we may grow by it. Jam: 1.19. 1
Pet. 2.2.

3. We must entreat the Lord to bless this holy ordinance unto us, and to
accompany the outward Ministry of the Word with the inward opperation of the
Spirit, that so the Word may be effectual to save our souls. Psalm: 119. Isa.
59.21. Act. 16.14.

Q. How are we to behave our selves when we are come to the House of God?

A. We must acknowledge the Minister to be Gods Messenger, and Ambassador, and
therefore we must here and receive the Word preached, not as the word of man
but as the word of God, even as that word, which one day shall judge us. Job.
33.23. Mal. 2.7. 2 Cor. 5.20, 1 These. 13. 1 Pet. 4.11. Joh. 12.48.

More particularly we must hear the word preached,

1. Not with drowzie and dull ears, but with diligent attention, to the end we
may understand what we hear and be affected with it. Isai. 6.10. Prove. 2.2.
and 4.20. Luke 4.20. Act. 2.14. and 8.16.

2. With due reverence, yea with fear and trembling. Isa. 66.5, 6. Ezra. 9.4.
and 10.3.

3. With meekness and absolute subjection of spirit, Jam. 1.21.

4. With alacrity and constancy not departing before the public exercise be
ended. Prove. 8.34. Ezekiel. 46.10.

5. With an earnest desire to attain and keep the good seed of the Word in our
hearts: and with a firm purpose to bring forth the fruit of it in our lives.
Luke 8.15. Pro. 4.21. Deuteronomy. 5.27. Exodus 19.8. Isai. 42.23.

Q. What other means are there which serve to the further increasing of our
Faith.

A. The Sacraments and Prayer.

Q. What is a Sacrament?

A. It is a seal annexed by Gods own hand to the Covenant of Grace. Genesis
17.7.10, 11. Rom: 4.11.

Q: What is the Covenant of Grace?

A. That eternal Covenant and contract, laid down in the Word, wherein God
has promised remission of sins, and everlasting life to all that believe in
Christ Jesus. Genesis 3.15. and 17.7, 8. Act. 10.43. and 13.38.39. Joh: 15, 16.
Mar. 16.16. Act: 16.30, 31.

Q. How many parts be there in a Sacrament?

A. Two: the outward and visible Sign; and the inward and invisible Grace,
Mat. 3.11. and 26.26. 1 Cor. 10.16.

Q. Of what use are the Sacraments, and to what end were they ordained?

A. The Sacraments were ordained,

1. To be holy Signs and Seals, to ratify the Covenant, which the Lord has
made with us to confirm our weak Faith in all the gracious promises of the
same. Genesis 17.11. Rom: 14.11.

2. To be (as it were) badges of our profession, whereby we may be known to be
the Servants of Christ. Mat. 28.19. 1 Cor. 10.16, 17.21.

3. To be monuments to put us often in mind and remembrance of Christ and (as
it were) glasses wherein we may see Christ crucified before our eyes: and
therefore the Sacraments are truly called a visible word. Lu: 22.19. Gal. 3.1.

Q. How many Sacraments are there?

A. Two, the one representing our Nativitie or new birth; the other
representing our spiritual Education, and growth in Christ 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3,
4.

Q. Have these sacraments been always the same?

A. The inward and spiritual part which is Christ with all his benefits, has
been always the same both under the Law, and under the Gospel. But the
outward, and sensible signs have been diverse according to the times of Christ.
Before Christ was exhibited in the flesh, there were but two fixed and
ordinary Sacraments: and since Christ's coming in the flesh there are likewise
two Sacraments and no more. 1 Cor. 5.7. and 10.4. Gal. 3.27. Heb. 13.8.

Q. What were the ordinary Sacraments of the old Testament?

A. Circumcision and the Passover. Genesis 17. Exodus 12.17.

Q. What are the Sacraments instituted by Christ in the New Testament?

A. Baptism, and the Lords Supper. Now these are answerable to the Sacraments
of the Old Tastament; for Baptism is come instead of Circumcision; and the
Lords Supper instead of the Passover. Mat. 28.19. Mat. 26.26. Col. 2.11, 12.
Lu. 12.13, 14, 15, 19, 20. 1 Cor. 10.

Q. How do these two Sacraments of the New Testament differ?

A. Baptism is the Sacrament of our Regeneration, and ingrafting into Christ.
The Lords Supper is the Sacrament of our spiritual nourishment, and growing up
with Christ, And therefore Baptism is but once used of us; but the Lords
Supper is often to be celebrated. Act. 2.42. 1 Cor. 11.26.

Q. Tell me more particularly what is Baptism?

A. Baptism is the first Sacrament of the new Testament wherein, by the
washing, or sprinkling of our bodies with water in the Name of the Father, the
Son, and the holy Ghost, our Regeneration, or new birth is represented and
our entrance into Christianity sealed unto us. Mat. 28.19. Joh. 3.5. Tit. 3.5.
Gal. 3.27. Act. 8.36, 37, 38.

Q. What is the outward and visible sign in Baptism?

A. Water, wherewith the party baptized is washed or sprinkled. Mat. 3.11, 16.
Act. 8.36, 38.

Q. What does this water represent and signify?

A. The Spirit and the blood of Christ. Mat. 3.11. Joh: 3.5. 1 Ioh. 1.7.

Q. What does the covering or sprinkling, and washing with water signify?

A. Our new birth renovation, and putting on of Christ: the washing of our
souls with the blood of Christ applied by his Spirit. The covering of our
sins and remission of them, through the imputation of the sufferings, and
death of Christ: and the presenting of us holy, clean, and without spot in the
sight of God, through the imputation of Christ's obedience, and righteousness.
Ioh. 3.5. Tit. 3.5. Gal. 3.27. 1 Cor. 12.13. 1 Pet. 1.2. Act. 2.38. and 22.16.
Romans 6.3, 4. Col. 2.12, 13. Ephesians. 5.26, 27.

Q. Why are we baptized in the name (or into the Name) of the Father and of the
Son, and of the holy Ghost? Mat. 28.29.

A. Hereby is signified that by baptism we are consecrated to the worship and
service of the only true God, who being one divine Essence, is distinguished
into three Persons, the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost. In Baptism our
Adoption in Christ by the Holy Ghost is sealed unto us, and ratifyed, and so we
are consecrated to God the Father. Thus by this Sacrament we are (as it were)
enroled amongst those of the Household of God. Act: 2.38. and 19.5. 1 Cor: 12,
13, 14, 15. Gen: 48.16. Ephesians: 2.19. and 3.15.

Q: What persons are to be admitted to this Sacrament?

A. All such as by the Laws of Charity are to be esteemed within the Covenant
of Grace of what Nation, Sex or age soever they be. Mat. 3. verse. 5, 6. and
28.19. Act. 2.41. and 8.27, 36, 37. Act. 10.47. Act. 16.15.33. 1 Cor. 1.16.
Genesis 17.12. compared with Col. 2. verse. 1.

Q. When do such as are baptized in their Insancie reap the fruit, and feel
the effect of their Baptism?

A. So many of them as live till they come to years of discretion, when they
actually believe in Christ, and repent of their sins. Mark. 1. verse. 4, 5,
and 15. and 16.16. Act. 2. verse. 38. and 8.30, 31. 1 Pet. 3. verse. 21.

Q. What is the Lords Supper?

A. The Lords Supper is the other Sacrament of the new Testament wherein by the
use of bread, and wine administered, and received according to Christ his
institution, our spiritual nourishment by Christ is represented, and our
continuance, and growth in Christianity sealed unto us. Mat. 26.26, 27, 28. 1
Cor. 11.23, 24. etc. 1 Cor. 12.13.

Q. What are the outward signs of this Sacrament of the Lords Supper?

A. Bread and Wine both which Christ has expressly commanded to be received of
all Communicants, and the Sacramental actions about these elements of Bread
and Wine. Mat. 26.26, 27. Mar. 14.22, 23. Luke 22.19.20.

Q. What do these elements of Bread and Wine signify?

A. The Body and Blood of Christ which are exhibited and given to the
faithful, and received of them after a spiritual and visible manner, yet
verily and truly. Mat: 26.26, 28. 1 Cor. 10.16, 17. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25. Joh:
6.27, 28, 51. etc.

Q. Tell me more plainly and distinctly, How does the worthy Communicant
receive the Body, and Blood of Christ in this Sacrament?

A. As with the hand of the body we receive the Creatures of bread, and Wine,
which refresh and strengthen our bodies: so Faith is that hand of the Soul,
whereby we receive the Body, and Blood of Christ. The worthy Communicant by
the exercise of his Faith, feeds (as it were) upon Christ, and his merits to
the spiritual refection, and nourishment of his Soul. Psalm. 104.15. Joh.
1.12. Joh. 6.35. and 50, 51, 54, 55, 56, and 63.

Q. What are the Sacramental Actions about these Elements of Bread and Wine.

A. The Sacramental Actions of the Minister are chiesly three.

Q. What is the first of them?

A. The Sanctification, or Consecration of the Bread and Wine.

Q. Wherein does this Consecration of the Bread and Wine consist?

A. The Minister recites the Ordination and Institution of Christ, that so our
faith may have what to lay hold of: he sanctifies and blesses these creatures
of Bread, and Wine by solemn Prayer, and Thanksgiving unto God: and these
Elements being thus separated to an holy use, and being administered, and
received according to Christ his Institution, become effectual Signs and
Seals of the true, and natural body and Blood of Christ. Thus the Bread, and
Wine are consecrated. 1 Cor. 11.23, 24 etc. Mat. 26.26, 27. Mar. 14.22, 23.
Luke 22.19.

Q. Are not the Bread and Wine by this Consecration changed into the Substance
of the natural body and blood of Christ?

A. No truly: after the Consecration of the Bread and Wine, these Elements are
not changed in Substance but in their use only: they are set a part to an holy
use, they are now lively Signs and effectual seals, of the Body and Blood
of Christ; but yet they continue in nature and substance Bread and Wine still.
Mat. 26.29. 1 Cor. 10.16. 1 Cor. 11.26, 27, 28.

Q. What is the second Sacramental Action?

A. The breaking of the bread and pouring out of the wine. Mat. 26.26. Mark.
14.22. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25.

Q. What is signified hereby?

A. The crucifying of Christ upon the Cross: that the body of Christ was
broken, that the blood of Christ was shed for us. 1 Cor. 11.24. Gal. 3.1. Mat.
26.28. Mar: 14.24. Luke 22.20.

Q. But it is written, A bone of him shall not be broken: How therefore can the
breaking of the bread signify that the body of Christ was broken for us? Joh.
19.26. Exodus: 12.46.

A. Although the legs of Christ were not broken, yet the body of Christ was
bruised, and even broken with those torments which he suffered upon the Cross,
when Christ yielded up his spirit upon the cross he was (as it were) rent into
two pieces according to his humane nature. Joh. 19.32, 33. etc. Isa. 53.5. Mat.
27.50. Mar. 15.37. Lu. 23.46. Joh: 19.30.

Q. What is the third Sacramental Action of the Minister?

A. The distribution and delivering of the Bread and Wine, Mat. 26.26, 27. Mar:
14.22.23. Lu. 22.19.

Q. What is signified hereby?

A. That Christ offers himself and his merits to all: that Christ is given
and exhibited to as many as have faith to receive him Mat. 26, 27, 28. Mar:
14.23, 24. Luke 22.19, 20.

Q. What are the Sacramental Actions of the Communicants?

A. With reverence to take the Bread at the Ministers hand, and to eat it:
with reverence to take the Cup at the Ministers hand and to drink of it. Mat.
26.26, 27. Mar. 14.23.

Q What is signified thereby?

A. The particular Application of Christ, and his merits; the feeding (as it
were) upon the Body and Blood of Christ by the exercise of a lively faith, to
the spiritual refreshing, and strengthening of our inward man. 1 Cor. 10.16. 1
Cor. 12.13.

Q. What Persons may safely come to the Lords Table, and partake of this
heavenly banquet?

A. All such as have right and title to this Sacrament; and have in some good
measure prepared themselves to partake of so holy an Ordinance. 1 Cor. 11.27,
28.

Q. What Persons have right, and title to this Sacrament?

A. All the true Children of God, and Members of Christ, that have been
baptized, and (being come to years of discretion) are also to examine
themselves, and to try their fitness for this Sacrament. 1 Cor. 11.12.

Q. How may a Christian try his fitness for this Sacrament?

A. A man must search and try, whether he can find in himself those
Sacramental graces which are necessarily required in every worthy Communicant.

Q. What are they?

A. They are chiefly these: Repentance, Knowledge, Faith, and Love.

Q. Why is Repentance required in every worthy Communicant?

A. No man may presume to come to the Lords Table with defiled hands, and
polluted feet; now every sin defiles, and pollutes the soul in Gods sight;
and therefore whenever we come to the Lords Table, we must remove our sins
by a solemn renewing of our Repentance. Number. 9. verse. 6. Eccles. 5. verse. 1.
Jam. 1.27. Jude verse. 23. Isa. 1.16. Jam. 4.8.

Q. How may this be done?

A. That we may remove our sins by a solemn renewing of our Repentance,
four things are requisite.

Q. What is the first of them?

A. We must search, and examine our hearts, and lives thoroughly by the Law of
God, to the end we may come to a true sight of our sins. Lam: 3.40. Psalm:
119.59. Rom: 3.20. and 7.7. Jam: 1.23.

Q. What is the second?

A. When we have found out our sins, we must get mournful spirits, broken,
and contrite hearts for them: we must mourn for them with a godly sorrow. See
2 Cor: 7.9, 10, 11. Jam: 4.8, 9. Joel: 2.13. Zech: 12.10. Psalm: 51.16, 17. Jer:
31.18. Mar: 14.72. Luck: 7.38.

Q What is the third?

A. When we are truly humbled for our sins, we must make an ingenuous, and
particular Confession of them to God our Father; we must Judge our selves for
them; we must flee to the Throne of Grace, and implore merey and forgiveness.
Prove: 28.13. and 1 John: 1.9. Psalm: 32.3, 4, 5. and 51.14. Ezr: 9.6, 14. and
Neh: 1.6, 7. 1 Cor: 11.31. Psalm: 51.1. and Psalm. 130.3, 4.

Q. What is the fourth?

A. We must promise, and covenant to forsake our sins, and firmly resolve to
reform our ways for the time to come. Prove: 28.13. Isai: 1.15, 17. and 55.7.
Psalm: 51.13. and 119.116.

Q. But every one is ready to say, that he repents of his sins: tell me
therefore, how may a Christian know, whether his repentance be sound, and
hearty, or no?

A. Sound Repentance consists in an inward change of the heart, and
affections; and an outward change of the life, and actions; and therefore, if
we find this double change in our selves; if we find in our selves, a true
hatred of all sin, and an unfeigned love of God, and goodness, with an
earnest desire of universal Reformation; if we have renounced the practice of
every gross sin, and allow not the least infirmity we see in our selves;
then we may conclude our Repentance to be sound, and hearty, Psalm. 101.3. and
119.97, 113. Psalm. 40.8. Romans 7.22. Psalm. 119.5, 6, 101, 112. Heb. 13.18. Act.
19.18, 19. Luke 19.8. Romans 7.15, 16, 19.

Q Why is Knowledge required in every worthy Communicant?

A. First, because the other Sacramental graces presuppose Knowledge.

Secondly, because the Administration, and Receiving of this Sacrament, is a
public, and solemn part of Gods worship, wherein many sacred duties are
joined together; now knowledge is a grace that is needful to guide a Christian
in the performance of every Christian duty; and therefore this that is so
great, and weighty a Duty can never be performed aright, without a good measure
of knowledge.

Q. What knowledge is required in every worthy Communicant?

A. That a Christian may be fit to receive this Sacrament,

1. He must have a competent knowledge of the common grounds, and principles of
Christian Religion. 1 John 2.20.

2. He must understand the doctrine of the Sacraments in general; and have a
distinct knowledge of this Sacrament of the Lords Supper.

Q. Why is Faith required in every worthy communicant?

A. 1. Because this Sacrament was ordained to be a spiritual means to
confirm and strengthen our weak faith. Romans 4.11.

2. Because Christ and his saving benefits cannot be received without Faith,
whosoever presumes to come to this Sacrament without Christ. Joh 1.12. Ephos.
3.17.

Q. What kind of Faith is required in a worthy receiver?

A. That kind of Faith which makes a true Believer, will also make a worthy
Communicant: now that is, not an Hystoricall but Justifying a particular Faith;
such a faith as gives firm and particular assent to the truth of this
Proposition Christ loved me and gave himself for me, Gal. 2.20. Joh: 20.28.
Psalm. 20.1. Isai. 25.1.

Q. What is the office of Faith in this Sacrament?

A. To behold and to receive Christ, and to feed upon the Body and Blood of
Christ. For Faith is that spiritual eye, whereby the true Believer sees
Christ and discerns the Lords Body and that hand of the soul, whereby the
true Believer receives Christ: and that mouth of the soul whereby the true
Believer feeds upon the Body and Blood of Christ in this Sacrament. Joh.
8.56. Heb. 11.1.27. 1 Cor. 11.29. Gal. 3.1. Joh: 1.12. Joh: 6.35.

Q. Why is love required in every worthy Communicant?

A. 1. Because Christ provided this Heavenly banquet not for strangers but for
those of his own Family, for his own Disciples. Now mutual love, and Charity
is the Cognizance of a true Disciple, Joh. 13.35. 1 John: 3.14. and 4.7.

2. Because we cannot upon good ground expect to have the forgiveness of all
our sins sealed up unto us in this Sacrament except we bring Christian
Charity in our hearts, Mat. 6.14, 15. and 18.35. Mar: 11.25.26. Luke 6. verse.
37.

3. Because this Sacrament was ordained to be a seal, as of our union with
Christ our head, so of our Communion with all the true Members of Christ. 1
Cor. 10.16, 17. 1 Cor. 12.12, 13.

4. Because Charity is the Rule of all gracious actions. 1 Cor. 16.14.

Q. What rules of love are we to observe when we intend to come to the Lords
Table?

A. These two Rules (prescribed by Christ) are diligently to be observed, viz.

1. If he has ought against thy neighbor, if thy neibour have offended, and
wronged thee, forgive him. Mar. 15.25. Mat: 5.44. Luk: 6.27, 28. Mat. 18.21.22.

2. If thy brother has ought against thee, if thou have any way offended,
grieved or wronged thy brother, go and reconcile thy self unto him and then
come to the Lords Table. Mat. 5.23, 24. Romans 12.21.

Q. Hitherto of the Sacraments; tell me now, what is Prayer?

A. Prayer is a pious Colloquy, and humble Discourse with God; wherein we lift
up our souls, and express the desires of our hearts unto God, as to our
heavenly Father. 1 Samuel 1.13.15. Psalm. 25.1. and 62.8. Mat. 6.6, 9.

Q. How may we express the desires of our hearts unto God?

A. The Lord understands the language of the heart, as well as of the tongue;
and therefore we may express the wishes and desires of our hearts, both by
vocal, and by mental Prayer. Romans 8.27. Mat. 6.8.

Q. What is mental Prayer?

A. It is the expression of the mind by secret ejaculations, by sighs, and
groans. See Ex. 14.15. Neh. 2.4. Ps. 79.11. Romans 8.26. 1 Samuel 1.13.

Q. What is a vocal Prayer?

A. It is the expression of the mind in words; when our tongues are the true
interpreters of our hearts, opening and uttering our inward defires unto the
Lord. 1 Kings 8: 22, 23. Joh: 17.1.

Q. Is there any Rule left us, by which we ought to frame our Prayers?

A. Yes; the Prayer, which Christ taught his Disciples, commonly called, the
Lords prayer, is both an absolute Prayer in it self, which we may, and ought
to use; and also a perfect Platform of Prayer. All our Prayers are to be
framed according to this Pattern. Luk: 11.1, 2, 3, 4. Mat. 6.9. etc.

Q. What are we generally to consider, for the right performance of this duty
in Prayer?

A. That we may rightly perform this holy, and heavenly duty, these four
things are to be considered, 1. To whom we are to pray. 2. In whose Name. 3. In
what manner. 4. For what persons.


Q. To whom are we to pray?

A. To God alone. Psalm: 38.9. and 50.15. and 65.2. Isai: 42.8. and 48.11. Phil:
4.6.

Q. Why are we to pray to God alone?

A. 1. Because God only knows the hearts of all the children of men. 1 Kings
8.30. and 3 Chron: 6.30. Psalm: 44.21. Jer: 17.10. Act: 1.24.

2. Because God only is every where present, and therefore able to hear the
Prayers of all persons, in all places. Jer: 23.23, 24. Ps: 139.7. -- 12.

3. Because God only is Almighty, and therefore able to give us, whatsoever we
ask. And as he is Almighty, so he is most merciful, and therefore most ready
to grant our requests. Job: 42.2. Jer: 32.17. Gen: 18.14. Luk: 1.37. Isai:
63.16.

4. Because we cannot call upon any religiously, in whom we may not believe,
Rom: 10.14. Now we are to believe only in God. Whosoever does place his faith,
and confidence in any Creature, is accursed. Jer: 17.5.

5. Because no part of divine worship is to be communicated to any creature.
But Prayer is such a principal part of divine worship, that it is often put
for the whole Service of God. Matt: 4.10. Isai: 42.8. Jer: 10.25. Joel: 2.32.
Act: 9.14.

6. Because Christ has taught us to direct all our Prayers to our heavenly
Father: Now there is none, which is our Father in heaven, but God alone. Matt:
6.9.

Q. In whose name are we to pray?

A. In the Name of Christ alone. Prayer is a calling upon God the Father, in
the Name of the Son, through the assistance of the Holy Ghost. Joh: 16.23, 26.
Heb: 4.14, 16. Zech: 12.10. Rom: 8.26. Ephesians: 6.18. Jude v. 20.

Q. Why are we to pray in the name of Christ alone?

A. 1 Because as there is but one God, so there is but one Mediator between God
and men, the man Christ Jesus, 1 Timothy 2.5. Christ is the only Mediator, as of
Redemption so also of Intercession. Act. 4.12. Rev. 8.3.4.

2. Because, we are taught to direct all our Prayers to our heavenly Father.
Now God is our Father in Christ alone: and therefore to come to God in any
other name is abominable.

Q. May we direct our prayers to the Son or to the holy Ghost by Name?

A. Yes prayer may be directed to the (a) Father, or to (b) Christ his Son,
or to the (c) holy Spirit. But when we direct our Prayer particularly to one
person of the three, this must be done with due care of worshipping all in one.
We must pray to all though we name but one: when we mention but one with our
mouths, in our minds, and hearts we must conjoyne all the three persons, as
those which cannot be severed, in will, in counsel, or in outward actions
because they are one in nature and Essence. (a) Mat. 26.39. Ephesians. 3. verse. 14,
16. (b) Act: 7.59. and chap. 9. verse. 10.14. 1 Cor. 1. verse. 2. (c) Mat. 28.19.
2 Cor. 13.14.

Q. In what manner are we to pray?

A. We must not come rashly but with prepared hearts to the performance of this
heavenly duty. And our hearts being prepared. Psalm. 57.7.108. 1. Eccles. 5.1,
2. We must pray,

1. With heedfull attention, keeping our hearts from vain and wandering
cogitations. Prove. 4.23.

2. With humility of spirit in regard of our own baseness and unworthiness
Gen: 18 27. and 32.10. Isai. 66.2. Lu. 18.13. 2 Samuel 7.18, 19. Ezra. 9.5, 6.

3. With reverence toward the glorious Majesty of that God, to whom we speak
in prayer. Psalm. 95.3, 6. Eccles. 5.2. Luk: 22.41. Mat. 26.39. Ephesians. 3.14.

4. With Faith that is with persuasion, that our persons are accepted of God in
Christ, and that our Prayers shall be heard, Heb: 10.22. Jam. 5.15. 1 John 5.14.

5. With a sincere purpose to forsake those sins which we confess unto the
Lord and pray against. Psalm. 66.18. Prove. 15.8. Isai. 1.^^. 2 Timothy 2.22. and 1 John 3.22.

6. With Charity in our hearts. We must lift up holy hands without wrath and
without doubting. 1 Timothy 2.8. Mat. 5.23, 24. Mar. 11.25.

7. With perseverance without fainting, patiently expecting a gracious answer
from the Lord. Luke 18.2. etc. Psalm. 27.14. Genesis 32.24. Hos. 12.4. Ephesians. 6.18.
Col. 4.2.

Q For what persons are we to pray?

A. For our selves and others. For the whole Church of God: for all sorts and
degrees of men; for (a) Magistrates, (b) Ministers, and the afflicted (c)
Members of Christ. Yea we are to pray for all men living, even our very (d)
Enemies who hate and persecute us. Mat. 6.11, 12, 13. Iam. 5.16. Psalm. 122.6.7,
8. Ioh: 17.6, 11, 20. (a) 1 Timothy 2.1, 2. Psalm. 72.1. (b) Ephesians. 6.19. Col. 4.3. 2
These. 3.1. Heb. 13.18, 19. (c) Psalm. 25.22. and 44.4. (d) Mat. 5.44. Luk:
23.34. Act. 7.60. Romans 12.14.

Q Are none living on earth excepted?

A. None but those who have committed the unpardonable finne against the holy
Ghost, and are apparently rejected of God. Se 1 John 15.16. 1 Samuel 16.1.

Q. But although all men are to be commended to God in our Prayers, yet are not
some to be preferred before others?

A. Yes; Prayer is one of the most principal effects of love; and therefore
those, whom we may and ought to prefer before others in our Love, we may; and
ought to prefer before others in our Prayers. See Ioh. 17.9. Ephesians: 6.18. 2 Timothy: 1.16, 19. 1 Samuel: 12.23.

Q. What are the parts, or several kinds of Prayer?

A. Petition, and Thanksgiving. Now these two are to be joined together in use:
and to these * Confession of sins is to be annexed, that we may be the better
prepared both to make Petition and to give thanks, * Neh. 1.6, 7, 8, 9. and
9.32, 33, 34, 35. Psalm. 143.2. Dan: 9.8, 9. Phil. 4.6. Col: 4.2. 1 Thessalonians.
5.17.18. Gen: 32.9, 11. Rom: 1.8, 10. Ephesians. 1.16. Phil: 1.3, 4. Col: 1.3. 1
These: 1.2.

Q. What is Petition?

A. That part of prayer, wherein we request and ask something of God according
to his will, revealed in his word. Romans 8.27. 1 Ioh. 5.14.

Q. With what mind, and affections are we to make our petitions and requests
known to God?

A. 1. With a true sense and feeling of our wants. 1 King: 8.38. 1 Samuel 1.10.
Psalm. 63.1. Iam. 1.5.

2. With fervencie of spirit, and an earnest desire to have our wants supplied.
Psalm. 130.1. and 143.6. Lam. 2.19. Rom: 8.26. and 15.30. Jam. 5.16.

3. With special faith in those Promises which concern our particular wants.
Mar. 11.24. Iam: 1.6. and 5.15. 1 Ioh. 5.14.15.

Q. For what things may we make request unto God?

A. For such good things as the Lord has promised our faith must rest upon the
promise of God: and therefore every petition must have respect to some promise.
Now as things are promised so they must be praid for; things absolutely
promised may be absolutely prayed for: but where God has put conditions, and
exceptions to his promise, here our prayers must have respect not only to the
blessing promised: but also to the condition annexed: and therefore things
conditionally promised, must be asked with this (or the like) exception, if it
seem good unto his Majesty. 2 Samuel 7.27, 28, 29. 2 Chronicles: 20.7, 8, 9, etc. Neh:
1.8, 9, 11. Exodus: 32.10, 11, 12, 13. Luk: 11.13. Mat: 26.39. Mat. 8.2. Rom:
1.10. 2 Samuel: 15.25, 26.

Q. Tell me more particvlarly, what things may lawfully be asked of God in
prayer?

A. Christ in that perfect pattern of prayer which he has left us, has made
a brief collection of all such things as are good and lawful to be asked in
Prayer, and comprised them in six Petitions: of which the three first respects
Gods glory; the three last our own good. Mat. 6. Luk: 11.

Q. How are these three petitions which respect Gods glory distinguished?

A. The first petition concerns Gods glory it self in these words, Hallowed be
thy Name. Mat. 6.9.

The second concerns the means of his glory in these words Thy Kingdom come,
verse. 10.

The third concerns the manifestation of it in these words, Thy will be done
in earth as it is in Heaven, verse: 10.

Q. How are the other three which respect our own good distinguished?

A. The fourth petition concerns our bodily life, in these words, Give us this
day our daily bread. Mat: 6.11.

The other two concern our spiritual life, The fifth our Justification in
these words, Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors v: 12.

The sixth our Sanctification in these words, Lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil. verse: 13.

Q: What is Thanksgiving?

A: An humble and hearty acknowledgement of Gods mercies bestowed on us, and
of those particular benefits which we have received from his bountiful hands;
rendering unto the Lord due praise and ascribing unto him Kingdom, Power and
glory for ever. 1 Cor. 20.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Psalm: 9.1. and 29.2. Psalm: 66.1,
2, 3, 8. and 96.7, 8. Psalm. 103.1, 2. and 111.1. Ephesians: 1.5. and 5.20, Col. 3.17.
2 These: 5.18. 1 Timothy: 2.1, Mat: 6.13.

Q: Having distinguished prayer according to the matter thereof; Tell me now
what other Distinctions are there of prayer?

A: Prayer is Public, or Private: Ordinary or Extraordinary.

Q: What is public Prayer?

A: Public prayer, is a solemn calling upon God, in a publik place, at a
public meeting of the Congregation, where the Pastor speaks, and the rest of
the Congregation going with him in mind, at the Conclusion say, Amen to
testify their Consent. 1 King: 8.22, 23.55. etc. Joel: 2.16, 17. 1 Cor: 14.15,
16, 19. Deu. 27.14, 15. etc. Neh: 8.1, 6.

Q: What is private Prayer?

A. Private prayer is that, which is made in any private place at any time: as
the private prayers of Families: and the * secret prayers of particular
persons. 1 Timothy: 2.8. Luk: 9.28. Zech: 12.12.13, 14. Act: 10.30. and 1 Pet: 3.7.
* Mat: 6.6. Mark: 1.35. Gen: 25.21.

Q: What is ordinary prayer?

A: Ordinary prayer is that, which is made daily upon ordinary occasions.
Gen: 24.63. Dan: 6.10. Psalm: 55.17. and 145.2. Act: 10.2. Romans 1.9.

Q. What is extraordinary prayer?

A: Extraordinary prayer is that, which is made with more then ordinary
fervencie upon some special and extraordinary occasion. Unto this kind of
Prayer the holy exercise of * Fasting is often annexed. Gen: 32.34. Hos. 12.4.
Ex. 32.32. Act: 12.5. Lu: 22.44. Heb: 5.7. * Neh: 1.4, 5, 6. Esth. 4.16. Joel:
1.14. Jon. 3.7, 8. Lu: 2.37. Act. 10.30, 31.

Q: What motives are there to excite and provoke a Christian to the frequent,
and daily performance of this duty of Prayer?

A. These considerations following may be so many motives to prayer.

1. Christ has taught his Disciples, how to pray: and the Lord often calls
and inviteth his children to the performance of this duty: yea God has
commanded that we should perform his service to him continually, that is
frequently, daily at set times without intermission 1 These. 5.17. Luke 11.1, 2.
Mat: 6.9. Psalm: 50.15. Can. 2.14. Isa. 55.6. Mat: 7.7. Luk: 18.1. Ephesians: 6.18.
Phil. 4.6. 1 Timothy: 2.1.8. Jam: 5.13.

2. The Lord has made many large, and gracious promises to those that call
upon his Name. See Psalm. 81.10. and 65.24. Joel. 2.32. Romans 10.12, 13. Mat.
7.8. Ioh. 16.24.

3. As the most compendious way for children to get any thing is to go to
their Parents, and beg it of them; so the ready way to obtain any blessing,
temporal, or spiritual, is to go to our Heavenly Father, and by humble
prayer to beg it, of him. Prayer is the key to open the storehouse of all
Gods treasures; and (as it were) the only hook whereby we reach all the
blessings of God, which otherwise would be out of our reach. Mat. 7.7. Luke
11.9.10, 13. Psalm. 34.17. Psalm. 145.18, 19. Ioh. 16.23.

4. There is no exercise a Christian can perform on earth so heavenly as
prayer. It is no small privilege that God in his Word vouchsafes to speak to
man. But this is a greater privilege, that the Saints by prayer have free
access to the Throne of grace, and talk with God (as it were) face to face;
Hence prayer is said to be a familiar conference with God. Heb. 4.16. Eccl. 5.2.

5. Prayer does sanctifye all Gods creatures to our use: and without prayer the
use and enjoying of all things we have is unlawful: to lay our hands upon any
thing that is Gods (whose all things are) without asking them at his hand is a
spiritual kind of felony. 1 Timothy: 4.4, 5. Mat: 14.19. and 15.36.

6. The neglect of this duty does expose a man to the judgments of God and to
the temptations of Satan daily. The Saints by faithful prayer run unto God as
strong Tower, and commit themselves to his protection: and so the Lord is an
hiding place unto them. Without prayer, a Christian Soldier is not able to
wield, and use that spiritual armor aright, which we are commanded to put on
for our safeguard and defense against the spiritual assaults of our spiritual
enemies. Se Ephesians. 6.11, 12, 13, 18. Psalm. 79.6. Jer: 10.25. Mat. 26.41. Prove.
18.10. Psalm. 50.15. Psalm: 18.2, 3, 6. and 27.5. Psalm. 91.1, 2, 4. Isa. 25.4.

The sixth PRINCIPLE.
Q. WHat is the estate of all men after death?

A. All men shall rise again with their own bodies to the last judgment:
which being ended, the Godly shall possess the Kingdom of heaven: but
unbeliever; and reprobates shall be in hell, tormented with the devil and his
Angels for ever.

The Exposition.
Q. What are the Parts of this Principle?

A. In this Principle three things are laid down, which every Christian ought
to believe:

First, the general Resurrection of our bodies at the last day. Joh: 11.24.
Act: 24.15.

Secondly the end of this general resurrection; that all men may come to
judgment. 2 Cor: 5.10.

Thirdly what shall fall after the general Resurrection; and the general
Judgment; viz. the definitive Sentence of Christ, both touching the
everlasting Salvation of the Godly, and the eternal Damnation of the wicked,
shall be executed upon them. Mat: 25.

Q. When the souls of the Godly are separated from their bodies by death: what
estate shall they be in, till the Resurrection at the last day?

A. When the godly die their souls are carried immediately by the Angels into
Abraham's bofome: and their bodies shall rest in their graves, as perfumed
Beds, till the last day Lu: 16.22. Isa. 57.2. Act: 7.60. 1 These. 4.13, 14.

Q: When the souls of the wicked are separated from their bodies by death,
what estate shall they be in, till the resurection at the last day?

A. When the wicked die, their Souls are sent immediately to Hell; and their
Bodies are carried to the dark Dungeon of the Grave, where they shall be
reserved unto the Judgment of the great day. Luk: 16.22, 23. Psalm: 49.14.

Q. Is it not a thing incredible, that those bodies, which have been dead many
hundred years, should be raised out of the dust, and live again?

A. Why is it not as credible to think that God can raise up and bring again
all those bodies that have been, as to be persuaded, that he can create new
bodies, that never, yet had being? The same Almighty God who gave life to all
living creatures, who gave being to all things out of nothing, is likewise able
to restore life: the same God who formed man's body of the dust of the ground,
is able to quicken our dead bodies though returned to dust, and to make them
live again. God has spoken it that the dead shall be raised out of the dust;
and his power can subdue all things to it self: Now these two are the props of
our Christian faith in this point Act: 26.8. Gen: 2.7. and 3.19. Dan: 12.2.
Mat. 22.31, 32. 1 Cor: 15. Romans 4.17. Mat. 22.23, 29.

Q. When shall the general resurrection be?

A. At the Glorious coming of Christ to Judgment: when the world shall be
desolved and destroyed with fire; and the heavens and the earth shall be
renewed, 1 These: 4.16. Mat. 24.30. 2 Pet: 3.7, 10, 12, 13.

Q. How shall the dead be raised up and gathered together?

A. By the mighty voice of Christ: and by the ministry of Angels, Christ shall
send his Angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together
the elect, from one end of Heaven to the other: At the sound of the Trumpet the
dead shall rise again, every one with his own body: and as many as shall
then be living, shall be changed suddenly in the twinkling of an eye. Joh.
5.28, 29. Mat. 13.49. and 24.31. 1 Cor: 15.51.52. Job. 19.25, 26, 27. 1 These.
4.15, 16.

Q. But shall all men rise again, both good, and bad?

A. Yes; all both good and bad shall rise again at the last day, but not by
the same Cause; nor to the same End: For the godly shall rise by the virtue of
Christ's resurrection, to receive eternal life. But the wicked shall rise by
the power of Christ to be judged and condemned. Act: 24.15. Dan. 12.2, 3. Heb.
11.35. Joh. 5.28, 29.

Q. Express this more particularly. What is the true cause of the Resurrection
of the godly?

A. The godly shall be raised up by Christ as their head and Savior. In the
day of Resurrection, by reason of that mystical conjunction which is between
Christ and the faithful, divine, and quickening virtue shall flow from Christ
to the Elect and cause them to rise again from the grave. That Union which is
between Christ, and all true believers, shall even force the grave to render up
the bodies of the Saints: for the Head, will not be without the Members. Joh:
15.24. Col. 1.18. Joh. 11.25. 1 Cor. 15.20, 21, 22, 23, 45. Mat. 27.52, 53. 1
These. 4.14.

Q. To what end shall the bodies of the Saints be raised out of the dust?

A. That the Saints may be glorified in their Bodies as well as in their
Souls. As the Souls, and Bodies of the Saints have been Companions in
well-doing here; so they shall be Companions in glory hereafter. Phil. 3.21.
Mat. 13.43. 1 Cor: 15.42, 43, 44, 49. 2 Cor. 5.10.

Q. What is the true cause of the Resurrection of the wicked?

A. The wicked shall be raised up by the powerful voice and command of Christ
the Judge of all flesh; and by virtue of that Curse wherein God threatened
eternal death to our first Parents and to their posterity) upon their
disobedience; which curse shall certainly be executed upon all unbelievers, and
impenitent Sinners that have noe part in Christ, Ioh: 5.28. Gen: 2.17.

Q. To what end shall the bodies of the wicked be raised out of the dust?

A. That their bodies may partake with their souls in the punishment of sin.
As the souls, and bodies of the wicked have been partners, and companions in
evil doing; so they shall be companions in Judgment, and torment: as they
have sinned together here, so they shall suffer together everlastingly
hereafter, Joh: 5.29. 2 Cor: 5.10. Mat. 10.28.

Q: Seeing the end of the general Resurrection, is that all men may come to
Judgment, tell me therefore, who shall he the Judge?

A. Jesus Christ is appointed of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. Act.
10.12. Ioh. 5.29. Act: 17.31. Rom: 2.16. and 14.10. 2 Timothy 4. verse: 1.

Q: How and in what manner shall Christ come to Judgment?

A. As the first coming of Christ was in meekness and humility; so his
second coming shall be in Majesty and glory. He shall come in the clouds of
Heaven with power, and great glory; armed with flaming fire; attended with an
innumerable company of mightite Angels: by whose ministry (as the dead shall
be raised, so) all men shall be cited, and summoned to appear before the
Judgment Seat of Christ. Mat: 12.18, 19, 20. Phil: 2.7. Mat: 24.30. and
25.31. Act. 1.9, 11. Rev. 1.7. 2 These. 1.7, 8. Dan. 7.9.10. Jude 14.15. 1 These.
4.16.

Q. When the dead are raised, and all men summoned to appear before Christ,
the supreme Judge, then how shall they be ranged and sorted?

A. As the Shepherd when the Evening comes gathers his flocks, and
separateth the sheep from the Goats: so in the Evening of the World, Christ
the good, Shepherd shall divide the whole world into two flocks, shall
separate the good from the bad: the sheep, that is the Godly he shall set on
his right hand; but the goats that is, the wicked on the left. Mat. 25.32, 33.

Q. When the whole world shall be arraigned before the Tribunal of Christ,
then how shall every man be tried and jndged?

A. All men shall be judged according to their works, as the plainest proofs
and most evident signs of Faith, or infidelity. Every one shall receive the
things done in his body, according to that he has done whether it be good or
bad. 2 Cor. 5, 10. Mat. 16.27. Mat. 25.35, 36. and verse. 42.43. Romans 2.6. Rev.
11.18. and 22.12.

Q. How shall all men be examined, and their works made manifest?

A. By the Books that shall be opened. Rev. 20.12. Dan: 7.10.

Q. What books are they that shall be opened?

A. The book of Gods remembrance; and the book of every man's conscience. Christ
the supreme Judge, who searches the hearts of all men, will then bring to
light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of
the hearts: out of the Book of Gods remembrance, the Lord will declare the good
deeds of the godly, and the sins of the wicked. Every man's conscience shall
be made either to accuse him or to excuse him. Now the wicked man's conscience
is like a closed or sealed book, but then it shall be so touched and (as it
were) opened, that he shall remember all his particular offenses, wheresoever,
and whenever committed; and the conscience of every wicked man shall be as
good as a thousand witnesses to accuse him, and to condeme him. By these two
books all men shall be examined, and the wicked shall be convicted. Rev. 2.23.
Joh. 21.17. 1 Cor. 4.5. Mal. 3.16. Hos. 7.2. Romans 2.15, 16.

Q. Is there any other book that shall be opened?

A. Yes, the Book of life (wherein the names of all the Elect are written)
shall be opened; that is, it shall then be declared before all the World, who
are Elect and who are Reprobates, by the exact separation of the one from the
other, and by the definitive Sentence, which shall accordingly be executed.
Rev. 20.12 Luk: 10.20. Phil. 4.3. Rev. 3.5. and 13.8. and 17.8.

Q. How are we to conceive of the definitive Sentence of the Judge? and in what
order will Christ give sentence?

A. The definitive Sentence which Christ will give is twofold, one for the
Godly; another against the wicked. The Elect, and godly shall first receive the
Sentence of Absolution, and Salvation: and then Unbelievers and Reprobates
shall receive the Sentence of condemnation. Mat: 25.

Q. Why shall the godly be acquitted and absolved, before the wicked be
condemned?

A. That the godly may be Assessors with Christ in the Judgment to be
pronounced, and executed upon the ungodly. The Godly being cleared, shall have
the dignity to sit with Christ the Judge of all flesh, and shall approve and
applaud his most righteous judgment upon the wicked; and so after a sort shall
judge the world with Christ. Mat. 19.28. 1 Cor: 6.^, 3.

Q. What is the Sentence of absolution and Salvation which the Godly shall
receive?

A. Christ shall say to the Godly, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the
Kingdom prepared for you before the foundation of the world, Mat. 25.34.

Q. What is the Sentence of Condemnation, which the wicked shall receive?

A. Christ shall say to the wicked, Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting
fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels. Mat. 25.41.

Q. When this double sentence is pronounced, what shall follow?

A. The definitive sentence being pronounced shall be executed immediately. The
wicked shall presently be bound and cast into Hell, where they shall suffer
eternal death and endless misery. And then the godly shall go into Heaven
where they shall live in eternal glory, and enjoy perfect felicity. Mat:
13.41, 42. and v. 49, 50. Mat. 25.46. Dan. 12.2, 3.

Q. What shall be the estate of the wicked in Hell? How may we conceive of
their future Misery?

A. 1. The wicked shall be excluded, and shut out of Heaven, and banished from
the glorious presence of God for ever. Luke 13.28. 2 These. 1.9.

2. They shall be cast into utter darkness, where shall be nothing but
horror, and confusion, sin and torment: they shall have their portion with
the Divill, and his Angels, in a lake of fire, and brimstone, invented by the
infinite wisdom of God, and kindled by the Justice and wrath of God: where
eternity shall be added to the extremity of their torments; where they shall
live a dying life; and die a living everlasting death. Mat: 8.12. and 22.13.
Mat. 25.30. Mat: 13.42: 50. Mat. 25.41. Isa. 30.33. Rev. 14.10.11. and 21.8.
Is. 66: 24. Mat. 3.12. Mark; 9.43, 44. and 48.

Q. What shall be the estate of the godly in heaven? how are we to conceive of
their future happiness?

1. The godly shall be perfectly free from all sin, and Misery, and from all
society with the wicked. Rev. 21.4. and 32.3, 5. Psalm. 9.17. Mat: 13.41.

2. They shall enjoy the society and fellowship of all the glorious Saints,
and Angels: They shall be made like unto Christ their head in holiness and
happiness: they shall behold even with their bodily eyes, the glory of Christ
their Lord and Savior; and with the eyes of their souls, the Father also and
the holy Ghost; yea they shall have that perfect communion with the blessed
Trinity, wherein consists perfect felicity. Mat: 8.11. Heb. 12.22.23. 1 John: 3.2. 1 Cor: 13.10, 11. Joh. 17.24. Phil. 1.23. 1 These. 4.17. Psalm: 36.9. 1 John 3.2. Rev. 1.22, 23. Rev. 22.4.

3. Security and perpetuity shall be added to the perfection of their
happiness: In Heaven shall be happy security and secure happiness: happy
eternity and eternal felicity. Rev. 21.25. Psalm. 16.11. and 17.15. Isa 66.23.
1 These. 4.17. Rev. 22.9.

Q. Seeing such shall be the Misery of the wicked and such shall be the
happiness of the godly, after the last Judgment, tell me now for conclusion;
how may we escape this eternal Misery? How may we attain to this eternal
happiness?

A. We must learn to know the only true God as he has revealed himself in
his Word.

2. We must learn to know our selves, that we are sinful and miserable by
nature.

3. We must learn to know Christ, his person, his natures, his offices, his
saving benefits.

4. We must be humbled by the Law, that we may be willing to come out of our
natural condition, and may be fit to receive Christ tendered unto us in the
Gospel. We must make sure our Union with Christ: we must by a true and lively
Faith depend, and rest wholly upon the Mercy of God, and Merits of Christ for
the remission of our sins, and the salvation of our souls.

5. When we are united to Christ by a justifying faith, and have the seed of
regeneration sown in our hearts, then we must wait upon God in a conscionable
use of his holy Ordinances, whereby faith and all other graces of the
sanctifying spirit may be confirmed strengthened and increased in us daily.

Finally, Grace is the seed, and infancy of Glory: and therefore we must be
infants in Grace, before we can be Heirs in Glory: If we have part in the
first Resurrection, if our souls be raised to a spiritual life here: then
certainly we shall be sharers in the glorious resurrection of the just
hereafter. Rev. 20.6.

There are two degrees of spiritual life; the life of Grace and the life of
Glory. If we do not attain to the first of these, we cannot attain to the
Second. We must therefore live the life of Grace here, if we defire to live the
life of Glory hereafter.

AN APPENDIX Wherein these four Doctrines (appertaining to the first Principle)
are more fully expounded viz.
The Doctrine of The Attributes of God. The Blessed Trinity. The Creation of
the World. Divine Providence.


DOCT. I. The larger Exposition of the Attributes of God.
WHat are the Attributes of God?

A. They are those essential Properties, which are attributed to God in
Scripture, that we may thereby the better conceive of his incomprehensible
Essence.

Q. How may sorts are there of these divine Properties?

A. Two, the Attributes of God are either Principal and incommunicable; or
Secondarie, and communicable.

Q. What are the principal Attributes of God?

A. They are these; absolute perfection, infiniteness and Immutabilitie.

Q. Why are these Attributes styled incommunicable?

A. First because they are so proper to God, that they are not communicable to
any Creature.

Secondly because they are not only incommunicable themselves but make all the
other Attributes of God incomunicable also.

Q. How are we to co nceive of Gods Perfection?

A. 1. God has all excellencies in him in the highest degree and whatsoever
faculty, Virtue, or property is attributed to God, is absolutely perfect.
Genes. 17.1. Mat. 5.48. Mark. 10. verse. 18.

2. Whatsoever excellencies are attributed to God, are in him not by
participation, but originally and from himself, Iam. 1.17.

3. God is so good, and perfect of himself, that he has all fulness of
delight and contentment in himself, and needs nothing out of himself to
make him blessed, and happy: and therefore he is styled the Blessed God. Mark:
14.61. and 1 Timothy I. 11.

Q. How are we to conceive of Gods infiniteness?

A. God is infinite in Essence. God has neither Matter nor form, which are
the propper limits of Essence; and therefore his Essence is unlimited, and
infinite.

2. God is infinite in Quantity and greatness: Here Immensitie and Ubiquitie
are attributed to God.

3. God is infinite in Time: and this is called his Eternity.

Q. What is Gods Immensitie?

A. It is a divine Attribute, whereby is noted, that God is without all
dimensions. God measures all things, but cannot himself be measured by any
thing: He is higher then heaven, deeper then hell, longer then the earth;
broader then the Sea. Is. 40.12. Jhb: 11.8, 9.

And from this Immensitie of God flows his Ubiquitie.

Q. What is Gods Vbiquitie?

A. It is a divine Attribute, whereby is noted that God is without and within
all places; no where excluded, no where included. God fills heaven, and earth
with his presence, and the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him: God is
contained only in himself. Psalm. 139.7, 8, 9, 10. Isai. 66.1 Jer: 23.24.

Q. What is Gods Eternity?

A. It is a divine Attribute, whereby is noted, that God is before, and after
all times: He is the first and the last without beginning, and without end. God
is at all times yet without respect of time; for one day is with the Lord as a
thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 2 Pet. 3.8. 1 Timothy 1.17.
Isa. 40.28. and chap. 44.6. Rev. 1.8, 11. Job. 66. verse. 26. Psalm. 90. verse.
2, 4.

Q: What follows upon Gods Infiniteness?

A. His immutabilitie; God is therefore immutable because he is infinite.

Q. What is Gods immutabilitie?

A. It is a divine Attribute whereby is noted that God is in no sort mutable,
or changeable, but continues always one, and the same without any manner of
mutation, alteration, or change whatsoever. Mal. 3.6. Psalm. 102.26, 27. Jam.
1.17.

Q: What are the other Attributes of God, which you called Secondarie, and
communicable?

A. They are these: Life, Understanding, Will, Power, Holiness, Justice,
Mercy, Truth, and Fidelity, with many the like.

Q: Why are these Attributes styled communicable?

A. Because we may see some shadows, and glimpses of them in men and Angels.

Q. What is the life of God?

A. It is that divine Faculty, whereby God after an incomprehensible manner
lives of himself moves himself to his proper works, and communicates life
to others. Deu. 5.26. Josh. 3.10. Jer: 10.10. Dan. 6.26. Act: 14.15. 1 These.
1.9. Joh. 5.26. Dent: 30.20. Psalm. 36. v. 9.

Q. What is the understanding of God?

A. Gods understanding is the same with his Knowledge, and wisdom: it may
thus be described: It is that divine Faculty, whereby God knows and
comprehends himself, and all things else after a perfect, and divine manner.
Romans 11.33. Psalm. 147.5. Mat. 11.27. 1 Cor. 2.11. Psalm. 139.2, 3, 4. 1 King.
8.39. Heb. 4.15.

Q: Tell me more plainly in what manner does God understand all things?

A. God does not understand all things successively or by discourse, collecting
one thing from another, but he knows and comprehends all things by one
simple, and eternal act; so that all things both past, and to come, are
present before him.

Q: What is the will of God?

A. It is that divine Faculty, whereby God most freely approves, or
disapproveth whatsoever he knows; and wills whatsoever may make for his
own glory. And this will of God is the first, and highest cause of all things:
See Psalm. 115.3. Ephesians. 1.11. Exodus 33.19. Mat. 11.25, 26. 1 Cor. 10.5.

Q. Does not God therefore will a thing, because it is good?

A. No, Gods will is the rule of all Goodness, and Justice: because God wills
this, or that, therefore the thing is good, and just; not because it is good,
and just, therefore he wills it. Dan. 4.35. Mat. 20.15. Romans 9.18.

Q. How are we to conceive of the power of God Almighty?

A. Gods Power, or Omnipotency, is (as it were) the Instrument of his will; it
is that divine property, whereby God is able to do whatsoever he will, yea
whatsoever is simply possible for so perfect an Essence. As for those things
which imply, and argue imperfection of nature, or imperfection of Grace, it
were dishonorable for God to do them; and therefore he cannot do them. God
cannot lie; God cannot deny himself; God cannot die etc. not out of impotency
or weakness: but because these contradict the perfection of his divine nature.
Job. 42.2. Psalm. 115.3. and 135.6. Mat. 19.26. Luke 1.37. Tit. 1.2.2 Tim: 2.13.
Jam. 1.13.

Q. What is Gods holiness?

A. It is an Attribute, generally noting the virtues of God, and the purity of
his divine Nature. God is so perfectly pure from sin in himself, that he
cannot endure any sin in his Creatures. And this Holiness of God does
appear in his Justice, Mercy, Truth and other Virtues. Isa. 6.3. Heb. 1.13
Psalm. 5.4.

Q. What is his Justice?

A. It is that divine Attribute whereby God is most just and Righteous in
himself, and exercises justice toward his Creatures, as in rewarding and
blessing them that do well; so in punishing them that do evil. Deuteronomy: 32.4.
Psalm. 119.137. and 145.17. Exodus 20.5.9. and 34.7. Romans 2.6, 7, 8, 10. 2 These.
1.6, 7.

Q. What is Gods Mercy?

A. It is that divine Property whereby God has compassion on them that are in
misery, though they have offended him, and ready of himself to pardon their
offenses, and to help them. This Mercy of God appears abundantly in his (a)
Patience (b) Longsuffering, and (c) Bountifullnesse toward Sinners. Jud:
10.16. Exodus: 34.6, 7. Psalm. 103.8, 9. etc. Psalm. 145.8. Mic: 7.18. See Romans
2.4. (a) Isa. 1.24. Psalm: 50.21. Act: 17.30. Rom: 3.25. (b) Lam. 3.22. Joel:
2.13. and 2 Pet. 3.9. (c) Mal. 5.45. Act. 14. verse. 16, 17.

Q. How are we to conceive of Gods Truth, and Faithfulness?

A. God has revealed his will unto us, as it is indeed, and therefore he is
styled a God of Truth; and his Word is the Word of Truth. And as the God of
Truth cannot lie, so he cannot deny himself, but will certainly perform
whatsoever he has decreed, and purposed; and this is properly called his
Faithfulness. This Truth and Faithfulness of God appears in the constant
performance of all his Promises and Threatenings. Deuteronomy. 32. verse. 4. Psalm. 31.1.
Psalm. 119.43.142. Ephesians. 1.13. Joh: 17.17. Tit. 1.1, 2. 2 Timothy: 2.13. 1 John 1.9.
Rev. 22.6.

Q: Is there any thing else to be observed, for the right understanding of
these divine Attributes?

A. Yes, That we may conceive aright of them, these general Conclusions are
further to be observed.

1. These divine properties are attributed to God Essentially. God is Holy,
Just, and Good without Quality; great without Quantity; everlasting without
Time; Merciful without Passion: Gods Wisdom and Power; Justice and Mercy
are Himself. God is a most pure and simple Essence; and therefore whatsoever
is in God is God himself. Hence it is that God is styled not only just, but
Justice it self; not only merciful, but mercy it self, not only the living
god but life it self; etc. Ioh. 11.25. and 14.6. 1 John 4.8. and 5.20.

2. The former properties which are styled incommunicable, may be attributed to
the latter which are called communicable: as the wisdom of God is absolutely
perfect, infinite, eternal and immutable; so is his holiness; so is his
Justice etc. Psalm. 147.5.

3. Seeing these Attributes of God are his Essence; and seeing they are
absolutely perfect and infinite, therefore it necessarily follows, that all
those divine properties are equal in God, though they appear not always
equally to us. Psalm. 145.9.

DOCT. II. A larger exposition of the Doctrine of the Blessed Trinity.
Q. SEeing the Doctrine of the blessed Trinity, is a deep and incomprehensible
Mystery, is this Doctrine necessary to be known, and believed of all
Christians?

A. Yes, we profess to believe in God the Father, the Son and the Holy
Ghost; and therefore every Christian ought to believe the only true God to be,
One most pure essence, subsisting in three distinct Persons.

Q: What is a Person in the blessed Trinity?

A: It is a distinct Substance having the whole divine Essence in it. The most
pure divine Essence considered as it subsists, with his relative and
incommunicable property, is called a Person.

Q. How may this Mystery of a Trinity of Persons subsisting in the unity of
the Godhead, be proved?

A. Not by humane reason; but by divine Authority. The Scripture in diverse
places makes express mention of three Persons in the Deity; as 1 Ioh. 5.7.
There are three that bear record in heaven the Father the Word and the Holy
Ghost. Mat. 28.19. Go and teach all Nations baptizing them in the Name of the
Father and of the Son and of the holy Ghost.

When Christ was baptized of John in Jordan, the Father spoke from heaven, and
testified of his Son who had then taken upon him the form of a Servant, and
the Holy Ghost appeared in the likeness of a Dove. This is faithfully recorded
in the four Evangelists. See Mat. 3.16, 17. Mar. 1.10, 11. Luk: 3.22. Ioh
1.33, 34. By these and the like testimonies, it is evident that there is a
Trinity of Persons. in the Deity. Read Joh. 14.26. 2 Cor. 13, 14. Gal. 4.6.
Ephesians. 2.18.

Q. What are the proper names of these three Persons, or Subsistencies?

A. Their proper names are expressed in those places of Scripture that have
been cited.

The first person is called the Father.

The second Person is called the Son, and the Word.

The third Person is called the Holy Ghost, or Spirit.

Q. Why is the first Person called the Father?

A. Because he has the Relation and respect of a Father to the second Person.

Q. Why is the second Person called the Son?

A. Because he has the proper Relation of a Son to the first Person.

Q. Why is the Son, and second Person called the Word?

A. First because as speech is conceived, and begotten of the Mind without any
passion: in like manner the Son is begotten of God the Father. Secondly
because he is so often spoken of and promised in the Scriptures, and is (in a
manner) the whole subject of the Scripture. Thirdly because he brings glad
tidings from the bosom of the Father: As man does make known his will to man
by his Word, so God has made known, and revealed his will to us by his Son.
Joh. 1.18.

Q: Why is the third Person called the Spirit?

A. Although the Father be a Spirit, and the Son be a Spirit as well as the
third Person, yet this title Spirit is peculiarly attributed to the third
person, because he is (as it were) spired or breathed both from the Father, and
the Son, that is to say, He proceeds from them both.

Q. Why is the title of holy peculiarly attributed to the third Person?

A. Although the Father and the Son be equally holy with the third Person,
yet the title of Holy is peculiarly attributed to the Spirit; because it is his
office to sanctify the children of God, and to make them holy: which he does
in a special and peculiar manner. The Father and the Son sanctify
immediately by the Spirit: but the Spirit sanctifies from the Father, and from
the Son, by himself immediately; and therefore he is called the Holy Ghost,
Tit. 3.5. 2 Thessalonians. 2.13. 1 Pet. 1.2.

Q. What is the Father?

A. The Father is the first Person in the Trinity, who by a divine generation
has eternally begotten his beloved Son of himself. Mat. 28.19. Prove.
8.22.25. Joh. 1.1. Mat: 3.17. Heb. 7.3.

Q. What is the Son?

A. The Son is the second person begotten of the Father from all eternity.
Mat. 28.19. Heb. 1.6. Joh. 1.14.18.

Q. What is the holy Ghost?

A. The holy Ghost is the third person proceeding from the Father and the Son.
Mat. 28.19. 1 John 5.7. Joh. 14.26, and 15.26. Romans 8.11. Gal. 4.6.

Q. How are we to conceive of the Unity of these three persons?

A. They are one in Being and Essence: the Essence of the Father is the Essence
of the Son, and the Essence of the holy Ghost. Although we may say Personally;
the Father is one Subsistence, the Son is another Subsistence; and the holy
Ghost another Subsistence: yet we cannot say Essentially; The Father is one
God; the Son is another God; and the holy Ghost another God: for they are
Coessentiall, that is they have the same essence together. Although the entire
Godhead, the whole divine Essence be in each Person; yet the three persons are
most singularly one and the same God. Joh. 10.30, 38. Joh. 14.9, 10, 11. Joh.
1.12. Joh: 5.32, 37. Heb. 1.3. Joh. 14.16. 1 Cor: 12.4, 5, 6. Deuteronomy: 6.4. Mar:
12.32. 1 Cor. 8.4, 5, 6.

And from this Unity of Essence necessarily follows the Cooperation of these
three Persons: as they have one and the same Essence; so they work one and the
same thing inseparably. Genesis 1.1, 26. Joh. 1.3. Joh: 5.17, 19, 21.

Q. How may this truth be confirmed, that these three Persons have one and the
same divine Essence?

A. By these Arguments.

First because the divine Essence being most simple, and infinite, is not
subject to multiplication, or division; the divine Essence cannot be multiplied
with the Persons nor divided between them.

Secondly, because the same divine Names are are given to each person. As the
(a) Father is God, so the (b) Son is God, and the (c) Holy Ghost is God. As the
(d) Father is Jehovah [or Lord] so the (e) Son is Jehova, and the (f) Holy
Ghost is Jehova. (a) Joh: 17.3. Heb. 1.1, 2. (b) Isa. 9.6. Joh. 1.1. Act:
20.28. Rom: 9.5. (c) Act: 5.34. 1 Cor. 3.16. (d) Psalm. Psalm. 110.1. Genesis 19.24.
(e) Jer. 23.6. Isa. 25.9. Zech: 2.10, 11. (f) Act. 28.25. compared with Isa.
6.3, 5, 9.

Thirdly, because the same essential Attributes, and properties are given to
each person. As the Father is eternal, So the (a) Son is eternal, and the
(b) Holy Ghost eternal. As the Father is omnipotent, so the (c) Son is
omnipotent, and the (d) Holy Ghost omnipotent etc. (a) Joh. 1.1. and 17.5. Mic.
5.2. Rev. 1.17. (b) Gen: 1.2. Heb. 9.14. (c) Joh: 3.31. Phil. 3.21. Rev. 1.8.
(d) 1 Cor: 12.8, 9, 10, 11. Luke 11.20. Mat. 12.28.

Q. How are we to conceive of the Distinction of these three Persons?

A. Although these three Persons have one, and the same Essence, yet they
differ really one from another; so that one is not, one cannot be the other.
The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God: but the Father is
not the Son; neither is the Holy Ghost, either Father or Son.

Q. Tell me more particularly wherein do these three Persons differ?

A. They differ not in degree or dignity: as they are coessentiall, so they
are coequall. But these three persons are distinct. Joh: 5.17, 18. Phil. 2.6.
Col. 2.9.

1. In Order and manner of subsisting.

2. In their Relative properties.

3. In manner of working.

Q. Seeing these three Persons differ not in dignity, why is one set before
another?

A. Although these three persons be equal, yet one is in order before another,
according to their manner of subsisting: As the Father before the Son, and
both of them before the Holy Ghost. Math. chap. 28. verse. 19. 1 John 5. verse. 7.

The Father is the Person without beginning, and therefore the first in order.

The Son is of the Father alone, and therefore the second Person in order.

The holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son, and therefore the third
Person in order.

Q. Seeing these three Persons are distinguished by their Relative Properties;
tell me therefore, what kind of Properties are these?

A. They are individual, and incommunicable.

Q. What may be observed from hence?

A. That these three subsistencies, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, are not
improperly called Persons, because they are distinguished one from another by
incommunicable individual and personal properties?

Q. What is the Fathers relative, and personal property?

A. To be unbegotten, and to beget. Psalm. 2.7. Heb. 1.5.

Q. What is the Sons personal Property?

A. To be begotten. Joh. 1.14.18. and 3.16. 1 John 4.9.

Q. What is the Holy Ghosts Personal property?

A. To proceed. Joh. 15.16.

Q. Seeing these three Persons although they work one and the same thing, yet
not after the same manner, tell me therefore how are we to conceive of this
third difference?

A. Each Person works according to the manner of his subsisting. As
Cooperation flows from the Unity of these three persons in Essence; so this
distinct manner of working flows from the distinct manner of their subsisting.

Q. What is the Fathers manner of working?

A. As the Father is first in subsisting, so he is first in working. The Father
works of himself, by the Son, and the Holy Ghost: and therefore the Original
and beginning of all things is given to the Father.

Q. What is the Sons manner of working?

A. As the Son is from the Father, so he works from the Father, by the Holy
Ghost: and therefore the dispensation of all things is given to the Son. Joh.
5.19. Joh. 16.15.

Q. What is the Spirits manner of working?

A. As the Spirit is both from the Father and the Son, so he works from
them both. And because he works from the Father and the Son therefore the
Consummation and finishing of all things is given to the Holy Ghost Joh: 16.13,
14, 15.

DOCT. III. Of the Creation of the World.
Q. WHat works are attributed to God the Father?

A. Creation and Providence. We profess to believe in God the Father, maker of
Heaven and earth: a faithful Creator, in which words we acknowledge God the
Father to have created the world once; and to preserve and govern it always. 1
Pet. 4.19.

Q. Was Creation the first work of God?

A. Creation was the first outward work of God; but not simply the first
Action of God. For Gods Decree is the Foundation of all his outward works: God
works according to his wise Counsel and eternal Decree. Whatsoever God has
done in time, he purposed, and decreed to do before all time. Ephesians. 1. verse.
11.

Q. What is Gods Purpose or decree?

A. It is an eternal action of Gods will, whereby he has freely and immutably
determined of all things that ever have been or shall be. Ephesians. 1.11. Act:
2.23. and 4.28. Isai. 14.24. Act. 17.3.

And this eternal decree God executes in the Creation and Government of all
things.

Q: What is Creation?

A: Creation is the first part of the execution of Gods decree. whereby he made
the world of nothing. Gen: 1.1. Heb: 11.3. Rom: 4. verse. 17.

Q. Why is Creation especially ascribed to God the Father?

A. Because the Fathers manner of working (to whom the Original of all things
is given) does here principally appear: for all things had their original and
beginning here, before God begun this work, there was not any thing but God
the Creator.

Now when creation is attributed to the Father, the Son and the holy Ghost
are not excluded: for Creation, being an outward action, is common to the three
persons, the Father, the Son and the holy Ghost, did work together in the
Creation of the world. See Genesis 1.1, 2, 26. Joh. 1.3. Col. 1.16. Job. 33.4.

Q. By what means, with what Instruments, did God make the world?

A. God used no other instrument but his powerful word, God made all things by
his word, that is, by his inward will, and effectual command. Genesis 1.3, 6, 9.
Psalm. 33.6, 9. Psalm. 148.5.

Q What was the general condition, and disposition of all things, that were
made?

A. Every thing, that God made was good in his kind: and the whole work was
excellent, and beautiful, Genesis 1.31.

Q When did God begin this work?

A. In the Beginning of time. Genesis 1.1. Mark. 13.19.

Q. How long did God continue working before the whole work was finished?

A. Six days: in the space of six times 24. hours God finished this great
work.

Q. Could not God have perfected the whole work in a moment?

A. Yes; but it seemed good to his wisdom to take some days for the
finishing of it, that we might more easily conceive, that the world was not
made by chance, but by counsel: and might more distinctly consider the parts
of the world and every days work.

Q. To what end did God make the world?

A. For the communication of his goodness, and the manifestation of his Glory.
Psalm. 115.16. Prove. 16.4. Rev. 4.11.

Q. Hitherto of the Creation of the World in general: tell me now, what are
the parts of the World?

A. They are two The Habitations. The Furniture, and Inhabitants.


Q. What are the Habitations?

A. They are either the higher habitations, the Heavens: or the lower, the
earth and the Sea. Genesis 2.1. Exodus 20.11. Neh. 9.6. Psalm. 146.6. Act. 14.15.

Q. How many Heavens are there?

A. There are three Heavens: the third and highest Heaven; the upper Firmament
where the Sun, Moon, and Stars are set, and the lower Firmament, or Air,
wherein we breath and the birds fly. 2 Cor. 12.2. Genesis 1.16, 17.17. Genesis 1.20.

Q. What manner of Creature is the highest Heaven?

A. The highest Heaven is a most glorious, immovable, and unchangeable place,
created in the first moment of time, where God is to be seen face to face, and
therefore it is called the Habitation of his holiness. 2 Chronicles. 30.27. 1 Timothy
6.16. Heb. 11.10. Luke 16.9. Genesis 1.1. Mat. 18.10. Joh. 14.2. 1 King. 8.30.

Q. Whereof was the third Heaven made?

A. Immediately of nothing, Genesis 1.1.

Q. What Creature is next unto the highest Heaven?

A. The upper Firmament or Element of fire.

Q. How are we to conceive of this Element of fire?

A, The fire is the highest of the Elements, most hot and lightsome. God said
let there be light. Gen: 1.3. Here by light (which is the most sensible
quality of fire) we are to understand fire also which has that quality.

Q. How are we to conceive of the lower firmament or Element of Air?

A. God has made the Air equally capable of light and darkness, and placed
it next under the fire, as being nearest of nature unto it: he has stretched
forth the Air like a curtain, to make a separation between the waters above,
(which are bound up in the Clouds) and the waters beneath. Genesis 1.7. Hence this
lower firmament or Element of Air is divided into three parts, or Regions, the
highest above the Clouds; the middle where the Clouds hang, and move; and the
lowest under the Clouds Psalm. 104.2. Psalm. 148.4.

Q. What other elements are there?

A. Water and earth which are the lower Habitations. And because these two
lower Elements make but one globe, therefore in Scripture they are often
comprehended, under this one term Earth. See Genesis 2.1. Col. 1.16. Psalm. 134.3.
Act: 17.24.

Q. How are we to conceive of the Element of water and of the creation of it?

A. The water is a cold and moist element, whose proper place is to succeed the
Air, and cover the Earth; but by Gods special appointment, part of it is
raised and lifted up above his natural place, into the middle Region of the
Air; and that part of it which is below, is so gathered together that it
divides the Earth, and is called seas. Genesis 1.9, 10. Psalm. 104.6.9. Psalm.
135.7. and 148.4. Job. 26.8. and 38.37. Psalm. 33.7. and 104.8.

Q. How are we to conceive of the Element of Earth and of the Creation of it?

A. The Earth is the dryest and heaviest of all the Elements which he has
founded upon nothing: and although it hangs upon nothing, yet it stands
firm, and immovable. This Element the Lord made to appear from under the
waters, (which stood above the high mountains, Pal. 14.6.) that it might be
fit for habitation. Genesis 1.9. Job. 26.7. Psalm. 24.2. Psalm. 104.5. and 119.90.

Q. Whereof were these Elements of Fire, Air, Water and Earth, made?

A. These Elements were made of that huge lump, or Mass, which is described,
Gen: 1.2. The Earth was without form, and void, and darkness was upon the
face of the deep?

Q. Seeing this Mass or Chaos was without form and void, how was it
sustained?

A. It was sustained preserved and cherished for a time by the comfortable and
powerful motion of the holy Ghost; for it is said the spirit of God moved upon
the face of the waters. Genesis 1.2. Compare Genesis 1.2. with Deuteronomy: 32.11.

Q. Whereof was this huge Mass made?

A. Immediately of nothing. Genesis 11.1.

Q. Having spoken of one part of the world, the Habitations, it follows to
speak of the other part of the world, namely, the Furniture and Inhabitants:
tell me therefore, what are the Inhabitants of the third and highest Heaven?

A. The glorious Angels. Mat: 18.10. and 24.36. Mark. 12.25.

Q. How are we to conceive of those glorious Angels and of the Creation of
them?

A. The Angels are spirits created immediately of nothing, whose office is to
minister unto God, to praise and celebrate his name, and to execute his
commands: and therefore they are styled Ministering spirits; and are said to
stand, before God as his immediate Ministers, and Messengers always ready to
do his pleasure. Heb. 1.7.14. Dan. 7.10. Ps: 103.20. Is: 6.2, 3. Heb. 1.14.
Dan. 7.10. Lu: 1.19, Psalm. 103.21.

Q. Seeing the Angels are ministering Spirits, how has God fitted them for
their Ministry?

A. God has furnished them with excellent properties: as namely, with
perspicuitie of reason and liberty of will; with admirable strength, and
agilitie. 2 Samuel: 14.17. Mat: 24.36. 2 King: 10.35. Psalm. 103.20. 2 These: 1.7.
Isa. 6.2, 6. Dan: 9.21.

Q. What is the Furniture of the second Heaven, or upper Firmament?

A. The Lights; the Sun, the Moon and the Stars, which are all Organs, and
Receptacles of light and have power to cast down their light upon the Earth. To
these lightsome bodies God has given a motive faculty whereby they move round
about the Earth, that they might the better obtain the ends for which they
were created Job. 26. verse. 13. Deuteronomy. 4. verse. 19.

Q. What are the ends and uses of those Heavenly bodies?

A. First to give light and heat to the Inhabitants of the Earth. Genesis 1.15,
17. Ps. 19.6.

Secondly to distinguish the night from the day: The Sun was made to rule the
day, the Moon and the Stars to rule the night: and to distinguish the day
from the Month, and the Month from the year. Genesis 1.14, 16. Psalm. 136.8, 9.
Psalm. 104.19.

Thirdly God made them for signs and for seasons Genesis 1.14. to distinguish the
set times or Seasons of the year as Spring, Summer, Autumn, and winter: and
to be natural signs and Instruments of those natural events, which happen in
these Seasons, as of storms, tempests, fair weather, fruitfullnesse, etc. Gen:
8.22. Job. 9.9. Deuteronomy: 33.14. Job. 38.31, 32. Genesis 1.16. Psalm. 136.7.

Q. Why are the Sun and Moon called the greatest lights?

A. Because they are greatest in their use: for they cast down the greatest
portion of light, they give us more light then all the Stars besides; they
exercise most virtue upon these terrestiall bodies. See Deuteronomy. 33.14.

Q. How has God replenished the lower Firmament, or Element of Air?

A. With Birds; with Clouds, Winds, and other Meteors. Genesis 1.20. Psalm. 8.8.
Dan. 7.2, 13. Psalm. 148.8.

Q. How are the waters replenished?

A. With swimming Fishes, which God caused the waters to bring forth in
abundance. Genesis 1.20.21. Psalm. 104.25. Psalm. 88.

Q. How has God adorned and replenished the Earth?

A. The Earth is adorned within and without. The Creatures which adorn the
bowels of the earth are the Mineralls, both Mettalls and Stones. The Creatures
which adorn the face of the earth are the plants, both the lesser, and the
greater, the lesser as grass herbs, flowers, Corn; and the greater Trees.
The Earth, being thus adorned, was replenished with inhabitants. The
Inhabitants of the Earth, are these: Birds, which God made to fly in the Air;
and commanded to multiply upon the Earth; and therefore they have a double
place they move in the Air, and rest on the Earth. Genesis 1.20, 22.

Beasts, both tame, and wild, going, and creeping. Genesis 1.24, 25.

The chiefest Inhabitant is Man.

Q. What may be observed generally concerning these Creatures which fill Heaven
and Earth?

A. All these Creatures are called Gods Hosts, and Servants they stand all in
order like an Army set in Battle array, and are always ready to obey the
command of God their Creator; who is therefore styled the Lord of hosts. Genesis
2.1. Psalm, 119.91. Deu. 4.19. Jud. ^.20. Isa. 45.12. 1 King. 22.19. Luke 2 v.
13.15.

Q. Seeing Creation was a work of six days, tell me therefore, what was
created the first day?

A. The third Heaven; the glorious Angels; that huge Mass which was the first
Matter of all inconstant, and corruptible things; and the Element of Fire. Genesis
1.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Although the Angels be not expressly mentioned by Moses in the history of the
Creation, yet it may be gathered out of Scripture, that they were created
before the third day. These Sons of God did sing and shoot when God laid the
foundations of the earth, Job. 38.4, 6, 7. and therefore it is most probable
they were created the first day together with the highest Heaven which is their
proper habitation, Psalm. 148.2.5. Col. 1.16.

Q. What was made the second day?

A. The Element of Air. Gen: 1.6, 7, 8.

Q. What was made the third day?

A. The water and the Earth which make but one globe: The plants and the
Mineralls. Genesis 1.9, 10, 13.

Q. What was made the fourth day?

A. Those Heavenly bodies, the Sun, the Moon and the Stars which garnish
the upper firmament, Genesis 1.14.19.

Q. What was made the fifth day?

A. The fishes of the Sea, and the Fowls of the Air Gen: 1.20.23.

Q: What was the work of the sixth night and day?

A. In the night thereof (as is probable) God made the Beasts of the Earth, and
in the day thereof God made man in both sexes, that is both man and woman. Psalm
104.20, 22, 23. Gen: 1.24, 25, 26, 27.

Q. What divine Attributes has God manifested in the Creation of the world?

A. Chiefly these three; his Power, Wisdom and Goodness. In this great work
of Creation, we may plainly see the footsteps of Gods infinite and eternal
power; of his admirable wisdom; and his incomparable Goodness. Psalm. 19.1.
Romans 1.20. Psalm. 104.24.

Q. What argument of Gods Omnipotency may be observed from his work of
Creation?

A. These that follow:

1. That all things were made of nothing. Heb. 11.3.

2. That God made the World, and all things therein, by his word, that is, by
his inward will, and powerful Commands. Heb. 11.3. Romans 4.17. Psalm. 33.6, 9.
Psalm. 148.5.

3. That God made the huge earth, the heaviest of all the Elements, to hang
immovable in the midst of the Air without any pillar to support it. Job.
26.7. Jerem. 10.12. and chap. 51.15.

4. The multitude of the Creatures which fill Heaven and earth; these Hosts,
and Armies of God are innumerable. Hebr: 12. verse. 22. Genes. 15.5. Jerem.
33.22. Psalm 104.24, 25.

5. The strength God has given to many Creatures: as to Angels, to the Sun;
to the Winds; to the Leviathan: and to diverse Beasts. See Job. 39, verse. 40.
and chap. 41. v. 2. 2 King. 19.35. Psalm. 19.5, 6. Job. 1.19. Exodus 14.21.

6. That God made the earth fruitful, before he made the second, and ordinary
causes, which do naturally produce this Effect. God made the earth to bring
forth grass and corn, and trees, before the rain descended upon it, and
before there was a man to till the ground; yea before those Heavenly bodies the
Sun, the Moon and the Stars were created to send down their influences
upon the earth. Genes. chap. 2. verse. 5.

7. That God has given power, and virtue to living Creatures to bring forth
the like unto themselves, for the continuance of their several kinds: Herein
appears as the Wisdom, so the Power of God.

Q. What Argument of Gods Wisdom may be observed from this work of Creation.

A. These that follow.

1. The beauty of the Heavens with their ornaments. Psalm. 136.5. Job. 26.13.
Jer. 10.12. and 51.15.

2. The Infinite variety of visible Creatures: the manifold wisdom of God
appears, in creating so may diverse kinds of birds, of beasts, of fishes, of
trees, of herbs, of Metalls of stones etc. yea the wisdom of God appears in
the exquisite frame of the smallest living creature.

3. The fitness of every Creature for his proper end: the fitness of the
Habitations for their several Inhabitants.

4. The subordination of the Creatures: God has set the Creatures in such
excellent order that they keep their several stations, and are serviceable,
and useful one to another. Psalm. 119.91.

5. The natural prudence, and providence which God has given to many
unreasonable Creatures. Jer: 8.7. Job. 39.17. Prove. 6.6, 7, 8. Prove. 30.24, 28.

Q. What other Argument of Gods Wisdom may be observed from this work of
Creation?

A. The Order, which God observed in this work of creation is another Argument
of his wisdom. For the Elements which are simple bodies, were first created,
and then mixed bodies which are compounded of these Elements: And here God
proceeded from the things that are less perfect to those that are more
perfect, until he came to the perfectest: as from plants which have a single
life, namely, a growing life to fish, and fowls, and beasts, which have a
compound life, and from them to Man, which has (besides vegetation, and sense)
a Reasonable soul, whereby he lives a reasonable life.

Q. What Argument of Gods perfection, and Goodness may be observed from this
work of Creation?

A. These that follow.

1. The goodness, and Perfection of every Creature in his kind. Genesis 1.31.

2. The Excellency; and perfection of the whole work; for the world was
created so good and perfect that it could not be better: Not that Gods power is
limited but the creature is limited. the creature was not capable of more
perfection.

3. Although God has made the world so good, and perfect yet there is an
infinite distance between that perfection, of the Creature, and the Perfection
of the Creator; for the perfection of the Creature; (even of the whole world)
is finite, but the perfection of God is infinite.

Finally, the Goodness and bountifullnesse of God appears in the large
provision he has made for the necessities of every one of his Creatures Psalm.
140.24.

Q. Why was man made last of all the Creatures?

A. First because man was the Noblest of all visible Creatures.

Secondly because he would have man bountifully provided for, before he brought
him into the world, to the end he might be stirred up to glorify God for all
those creatures which are made for his use.

Thirdly because man was an Epitome of the whole work: and is therefore not
unfitly styled, A little world (...).

Q. What things are most remarkable in the Creation of Man?

A. In the History of Man's Creation, these things are remarkable:

1. That the holy Trinity is brought in as it were deliberating, and
consulting about the making of this excellent Creature, Genesis 1.26. Let us make
man. Where as other Creatures were were made by a simple Command; Man was not
made without a divine Consultation.

2. That man was made in the Image and liknesse of God. Genesis 1.27.

3. That man was made part after part; first his body then his Soul. Genesis 2.7.

4. Whereas in the Creation of other Creatures, male and Female were made
together, it was not so here but first the Man was created, and then the Woman.
Genesis 2.

Q. Seeing man was created in the Image of God, tell me wherein did this Image
consist?

A. In the purity and perfection of Man's nature, and the excellency of those
endowments, which God bestowed upon him, whereby man was able in a special
manner to resemble God his Creator. Ecles. 7.29. Jam. 3.9.

Q. What was the subject of the Image?

A. The whole Person consisting of body and Soul. See Genesis 9.6. 1 These. 5.23.

Q. Tell me more particularly, how or wherein did Man resemble God his Creator?

A. 1. In those noble Faculties of understanding, and will, wherewith the Soul
of man was endowed.

2. In Knowledge, and wisdom; in Holiness and Righteousness which did
perfect these faculties. Man was endued with admirable Wisdom and Knowledge;
as appears by his naming of the Creatures, when they came before him,
according to their several natures and dispositions. Man was endowed with such
holiness, and Righteousness that he was able in all his actions to resemble
the holiness, and righteousness of God his Creator. Now in these excellent
gifts, and habits of Wisdom, Holiness and Righteousness, did the Image of
God principally consist. Col. 3.10. Ephesians. 4.24. Genesis 2.19, 20. and 22, 23.

Q. Was the Image of God stamped upon man's body also?

A. Yes, some sparks of Gods image were to be seen even in man's body,
considered as united to the soul, and making one person with it: for the body
was made a most fit instrument for the soul, being so composed that the soul
might conveniently use it for all works of holiness, and righteousness. As a
bright candle shines through a clear Lantern; so those excellent qualities
which were in the Soul of Man did shine through his body. And Man's body
should have been immortal (if he had continued in his integrity) together
with his soul. Moreover there was such a grace and majesty in the person,
especially in the face of man; that the other creatures could not look upon him
without fear and reverence. Romans 5:12.

Q. Is there any thing also wherein man did resemble God his Creator?

A. Yes, in his dominion, and rule over the Creatures. As God is absolute Lord
over all Creatures, so he made man his Lord deputy under him: and therefore
the Creatures were brought unto him as to their Lord, to see how he would name
them. 1 Cor. 11.7. Genesis 1.26. Psalm. 8.6, 7, 8. Genesis 2.19.

Q. Wherein did that dominion which God gave man over the creatures consist?

A. In a most free use of the Creature for Gods glory for his own necessity and
lawful delight. Genesis 1.28, 29.

Q. Seeing man consists of a body and of a soul, tell me therefore, whereof
was man's body made?

A. Of the dust of the Earth, with the rest of the Elements. Genesis 2.7. and
3.19. Job. 4.19. Eccles. 12.7.

Q. What manner of Body was it made?

A. God formed and fashioned the Body of Man after a fingular manner, above the
bodies of other Creatures, that it might be a fit habitation for his reasonable
soul. It was made of an exquisite temper; of an erect and straight figure; and
furnished with all such Organs, as were necessary for comeliness or use. Genesis
2.7.

Q. How was the soul of man made?

A. It was made of nothing by the insufflation or inspiration of God: God
immediately breathed it into the body. It was not first created and then
inspired; but created, and inspired together. Zech. 12.1. Genes. 2.7. Eccles.
12.7.

Q. What manner of soul was it made?

A. A Reasonable soul, endowed with diverse excellent faculties, and of that
nature that it is able to subsist, and live of it self, and to give life unto
the Body; and therefore being joined to the body, which God had formed. man
became a living and Reasonable Creature Gen: 2.7.

Q. How are we to conceive of the creation of the woman?

A. The Woman's body was not made immediately of the four Elements but of one
of Adams ribs, man being cast into a deep sleep. The Soul of the Woman was not
produced from Adams soul, as her body from his body, but created of God and
inspired into the body which God had builded. As the soul of the man was
created immediately of nothing; in like manner was the soul of the Woman. Genesis
2.21, 2. Genesis 2.23.

Q. Why did God make the Woman?

A. Because God saw it was not convenient and comfortable for man to live
alone, and amongst the rest of the Creatures there was not one fit to be his
Companion. Genesis 2.18, 20.

Q. How was the woman fitted for the Man?

A. The Woman was made an help meet for man, in regard she was made every way
like unto him namely,

First, in kind, and nature; such as were the Body, and soul of the Man, such
also were the body and soul of the Woman.

Secondly, faculties gifts and endowment, even the whole image of God. Genesis
1.27. Eccl. 7.29.

Thirdly in state and condition.

DOCT. IIII. A larger Exposition of Divine Providence?
Q. HItherto of the work of Creation: tell me now, What is Divine Providence?

A. Providence is the second part of the execution of Gods Decree, whereby he
preserves, and governs all the Creatures which he has made, and provideth
for every one of them. Neh. 9.6. Psalm. 36.6. Pfal. 136.25. and 145.15, 16. 1
Pet. 4.19. and 5.7.

A. What are the several Acts and operations of Gods general Providence?

A. They are chiefly five.

Q. What is the first of them?

A. God foreseeth the wants and necessities of his creatures; whatsoever is
needful for the preservation of any creature. Math. 6.32. Act: 15.18.

Q. What is the second?

A. God prepares for his Creatures, and bestows upon them whatsoever he
knows to be needful for their preservation. For the preserving of their
several kinds he has given unto plants the power of propagation: and to
sensitive Creatures the power of Generation, with a strong desire of
posterity. And for the preserving of Singulars he gives them food and
nourishment and shelter also, to keep them from outward violence. Act. 17.25.
Jon. 1.17. Psalm. 145, 15, 16. Psalm. 147.9. Mat. 6.26. Psalm. 104.10, 11, 12, 14,
16, 17, 18, 21, 27, 28.

Q. What is the third?

A. God sustaineth all his creatures; as their essence and being: so those
powers faculties and qualities which he has bestowed upon them. Act: 17.28.
Heb. 1.3.

Q. What is the fourth?

A. God moves and works in, and with the Creature: God is an universal, and
efficient cause of all motions in the creature. 1 Cor. 12.6. Ephesians. 1.11.

Q. What is the fifth?

A. God does order the Creature to an End; and diverts every Creature to his
proper end. As God has made every Creature for an end, so he preserves the
Creature for it and guids the Creature to it. Psalm. 104.19. Prove. 30 25.

Q. What are the general ends of divine providence?

A. The good of the Creature: and the glory of the Creator and Governor. Romans
11.36.

Q. How is the divine providence distinguished?

A. It is either ordinary or extraordinary

Q. What is Gods ordinary Providence?

A. Gods ordinary providence is that whereby he provideth for his Creatures,
by ordinary means. Now seeing this is Gods usual, and ordinary manner of
working, both in works of Nature, and in works of Grace; therefore to depend
upon Gods Extraordinary Providence without using the ordinary means when the
Lord does afford them, is to tempt God. Psalm. 147.8, 9. Hos. 2.21, 22. Act:
14.17. Rom: 10.13, 14, 15. Mat. 4.5, 6, 7.

Q. What is Gods extraordinary providence?

A. Gods extraordinary Providence is that whereby he provideth for his
Creatures extraordinarily, and by miracle. Sometimes God leaps over the second
causes and works the end without the Means: and this is called Gods immediate
Providence. Thus God sustained Moses and Elias 40. days together without meat
or drink. Sometimes God works above natural means, and by miracle. Thus the
Israelites were sustained forty years together in the wilderness, by Gods
extraordinary providence. Thus God preserved Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
in the midst of the burning fiery furnace miraculously. Exodus 14.21, 22. Josh.
3. verse. 15.16. 1 King. 17.4, 6. Exodus 34.28. 1 King. 19.8. Deuteronomy. 8.3, 4. and
29.5. Neh. 9.20, 21. Dan. 3.

Q. What is a Miracle?

A. A Miracle is an extraordinary work, exceeding the ability of all second
causes, as to make the Sun stand still, to make the Sun go back to raise
the dead, and the like. Now this is proper to God to work true miracles See
Psalm: 72.18. and 86.10. Josh. 10.12, 13. Isa. 38.8., Joh. 11.43, 44. Joh. 9.16.

Q. What is the Object of divine providence?

A. The providence of God extends to all things whatsoever not one sparrow is
forgotten of God, the very hairs of our heads are all numbered. There is not
any Creature either in Heaven or in Earth, there is not any thing belonging to
any Creature but the Providence of God extends unto it. As the glorious
Angels, the proper inhabitants of the highest heaven, are under the hand of
Gods Government; so the basest worms that creep upon the earth, are under the
eye of God providence. Luke 12.6. Mat. 10.29, 30. Jon. 4.7.

Q. Does the providence, of God extend to those things which come to pass by
casualtie?

A. Yes; as the providence of God extends to all things great and small; so
to all events necessary and contingent, or casual. The lot is cast into the
lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord. Prove. 16.33 Deuteron. 19.
verse. 5. compared with Exodus 21.13. Jon. 1. verse. 7.

Q. But does any thing come to pass by chance?

A. Nothing comes to pass by mere chance. Indeed those Events which were not
foreseen, or intended by us, the second causes whereof we are ignorant of, are
called casual and such things are said to fall out casually, or by chance. But
no event is simply casual, that is so casual as that the providence of God
should not extend to it. For divine Providence has an hand in governing those
events, which seem casual to us, that are ignorant of the second causes of
them. We must not therefore ascribe that to Fortune which is to be attributed
to divine providence, What comes to us by chance, we must make account, it is
of Gods sending. See Mark. chap. 14.13, 16. 1 Samuel 9. verse. 16.

Q. May Christians use these terms of chance, and Fortune?

A. Religion does not absolutely forbid us to use the term chance or fortune;
but these are Heathenish words and therefore Christians must use them warily
and sparingly. Luke 10.31. Deu. 22.6.

Q. What other particulars are comprehended under the general object of divine
Providence?

A. As the providence of God extends to all things great and small;
necessary and casual; so it extends to all Actions, and to all Events, good
and evil, Proverb. 15. verse. 3.

Q. How does the Providence of God extend to evil and sinful actions? Is God
the Author of any sin?

A. Far be it from us to think that God is the Author of that sin, whereof
he is the Avenger, the Lord hates, forbids, condemns, and punishes all
sin, and therefore he is not the Author of any sin. We may rather accuse
the Sun which is the Fountain of light, to be the cause of darkness then
accuse God who is goodness it self to be the cause and Author of sin. Yea
God is so far from being the Author of sin, that he would never suffer it,
were it not for the good that he can draw out of it. Deuteronomy. 32.4. Psalm. 5.5.
and 92.15. Romans 3.5, 6. Jam. 1.13.

Q. How then does the Providence of God extend to evil and sinful actions.

A. God is neither the Author nor Actor of any Sin; nor yet an idle spectator
of sinners; but he acts the part of a Judge, and of a Governor. The Lord
has a powerful hand in governing the transgressions of all sinners; yet so as
he is most free from all stain of sin and unrighteousness. Read and
consider these testimonies of Scripture. Genesis 45.5, 7, 8. Exodus 1.9, 10, 11.
compared with Psalm. 105.25. Exodus 4.21. and 5.1, 2. and 9.34. 2 Samuel 12.11, 12.
and 16.10, 11. 2 Chronicles. 10.15. 1 King. 22.19, 20, 23. Act: 2.23. and 4.27, 28.
Romans 1.24, 25, 26, 28. and 2 Thessalonians. 2.11.

Q. But how can the Lord so powerfully, and effectually govern sinners, and
yet be free from all stain of sin?

A. As a man that ringeth a cracked bell is the cause of the motion of the Bell
but not of the jarring of it: and as a man that rides upon a lame horse, when
he puts him forward is the cause of the horse his going but not of his
haulting: so here God is the universal cause and Author of every action, and
motion of the Sinner, (for all Actions naturally, and simply considered, are
good) but the Devil, and Man's Concupiscence, and corrupt will are the proper
Authors of that evil, or faultiness, which cleaves to the action. Act: 17.28.

Q. How may this be further cleared?

A. As a skillful workman can use an ill tool well, and work artificially with
it: in like manner, the Lord can use those wicked, and foolish men, which are
the Instruments of his providence, well and wisely. The Instrument we know is
wholly subject to the principal Agent, without infusing any quality into it.
That therefore which wicked men being the instruments of Gods providence, do
wickedly and sinfully; the Lord does justly and righteously. For the will and
purpose of Sinners which are Gods Instruments, differ from the will and purpose
of that righteous God, which over-ruleth and governs these instruments.

Q. Can you make this more plain by an example?

A. This may plainly be seen in the crucifying of Christ. As Judas, the Jews
and Pilate delivered up Christ to death; so God the Father also is said to have
done the same: but Judas did it out of coffeehouse, and covetousness to the
end he might obtain the money he desired. The Jews of malice and ignorance, to
the end that Christ should not reign over them; Pilate out of ambition and
fear, to the end he might please the people, and keep his place, whereas God
delivered up Christ to death out of love to his Church, and for the salvation
of his people. Act. 3.13. Joh. 19.16. Act: 2.23. and 4.8. Romans 8.32. Mat.
27.18, 20. Act. 3.17. Joh: 11.48. John 19.12, 13, 15, 16.

Q. What follows from hence?

A. Seeing that wicked men are the proper Actors of their own sins; though
they be as Instruments in Gods hand, yet they are active Instruments which
understand and will what they do; and seeing that which sinners do wickedly,
the Lord who governs all sinners does righteously: therefore God may justly
punish sinners for doing that, wherein they have been the Instruments of his
Providence. Isa. 10.5, 6, 12.

Q. How does the providence of God extend to good and evil events?

A. God is the Author of all Events, good and evil. As all blessings, so all
Afflictions, and Judgments come from the Lords hand, and by his special
appointment: Whosoever be the Instrument, or Messenger to convey any blessing
unto us, God is the Giver of it. Whosoever be the bringer of any Afliction, God
is the sender of it. Jam. 1.17. Amos 3.6. Isa. 45.7. Lam. 3.38. Jer: 25.15.17.

Q. When the wicked prosper and flourish in the world, when the Godly groan
under many pressures, afflictions, and crosses, is God the dispenser both of
the prosperity of the one, and of the adversity of the other?

A. Yes, all Calamities and Judgments, as war, sickness, famine, etc. are
the Arrows of the almighty, wheresoever they light, and all outward Blessings,
as peace, health, plenty, all come from Gods bountiful hand, even when they
are bestowed upon wicked men. Deuteronomy. 32.23. Joh. 6.4. Psalm. 38.2. Psalm. 91.5.
Ezekiel. 5.16. Ezekiel. 16.17, 19. Hos. 2.8. Mat. 5.45. Act: 14.17.

Q. How can the afflicted estate of the Godly, and the prosperity of the
wicked, stand with the just and wise providence of God?

A. If we desire to see and discern the Wisdom and Justice of divine
providence, we must look upon these works of God, not by the light of our
natural Reason, but by the light of Gods Word. We cannot judge aright of the
whole providence of God by a little part of it. We see but a little part of
divine providence here in this world; an other part of it follows immediately
after death; and the last (which is the greatest) part of it at the last
Judgment. Now if we lay all the parts of Gods providence together, if we go
into the Sanctuary of God, and weigh all things in the Balance of the
Sanctuary, then we shall see the Wisdom and Justice of divine Providence.
Psalm. 73.16. and 73.17. Jer. 12.1.

Q: But does not God oftentimes deal better with the wicked, then with the
righteous in this world? is not the prosperity of the wicked, rather to be
desired then the afflicted estate of the righteous?

A. No: although the Lord be kind and bountiful to the wicked here, yet he
does manifest his grace and mercy, and goodness much more to the godly, then
to the wicked. For the godly, notwithstanding the many Afflictions that befall
them here, are in a blessed condition: whereas the wicked notwithstanding their
outward prosperity (which is glorious in the eye of the World) are miserable
and cursed. Luc. 6.35. Psalm. 31.19. Psalm. 94.12. Jam. 1.12. Mat. 5.10, 11. Isa.
65.20.

Q. How may it appear that the godly, notwithstanding the many afflictions
that befall them here are in a blessed condition?

A. By these Considerations following viz.

1. The Godly though they live under the cross yet are adorned with heavenly
virtues and blessed with all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus. All their
sins are remitted, and all graces necessary to salvation, are bestowed upon
them. Ephesians. 1.3. Joh: 16.33. Romans 8.33, 34. Psalm. 32.1. 2 Cor. 4.16.

2. The bitter Cup of Affliction is sweetened unto them. As their afflictions
abound, so their Consolations abound also: the Lord gives them strength, and
comfort proportionable to that Burden of Affliction which he lays upon them.
2 Cor. 1.5. 1 Cor. 10.13. 2 Cor. 12.9.

3. Their Afflictions being sanctified bring forth excellent fruits and so
become matter of rejoicing unto them. The Lord by afflictions repaireth his
glorious image in the Souls of his Children, and so fits them for his
Kingdom. Psalm. 119.71. Romans 8.28. Romans 5.3. Jam. 1, 2, 3. Heb. 12.10 11.

4. The Lord upholds them in their greatest pressures with the certain hope of
future happiness; and gives them a Joyful deliverance in his good time. Job.
19.25. 2 Cor. 4.17, 18. Romans 8.35.37. Psalm. 34.19. and 37.37. Jam. 5.11. Job.
42.12.

Q. How may it appear, that the wicked notwithstandeng their outward
prosperity, which is glorious in the eye of the world, are miserable, and
cursed?

A. By these considerations following.

1. The wicked though they flourish in the world yet in Gods sight are
condemned persons and abominable. Joh. 3. verse. 18. Tit. 1.16.

2. When the wicked man holds a full cup of pleasure in one hand, he holds a
cup of spiritual Judgment in the other hand and drinks deep of it: for God
gives him over to blindness of mind, to hardness of heart, etc. Now of all
plagues, and Judgments, which are inflicted upon sinners, these spiritual
Judgments though they be secret and insensible, yet are most fearful. Deuteronomy.
28.28. Romans 1.28.

3. The wicked have many stinges and terrors of Conscience that the world takes
noe notice of, which makes their earthly delights, and pleasures bitter unto
them Prove. 14.13.

4. Whereas the goodness of God should lead and allure ungodly men to
repentance, because it has not this effect in them, therefore it deprives them
of excuse. Romans 2.4.

5. The prosperity of the wicked is short and uncertain: but their ruin and
destruction is certain and inevitable: Joh. 20.5, 8. and 21.17. Pfal. 73.18,
19, 20. and 129.6. Pov. 10.25. Eccles. 8.12, 13. 2 These. 5.3.

6. The present prosperity of ungodly men makes way to their heavier
Judgment; and damnation: the longer they are spared the nearer is the cup both
of temporal and eternal Judgment unto them, and the deeper shall they drink
of it. Romans 2.5. Jam. 1.2, 3. Deuteronomy. 32.35. and Psalm. 7.11, 12, 13.

Q. How are we to conceive of that part of divine providence which begins
when this life is ended? how will God deal with the Godly and with the wicked
in the world to come?

A. In the world to come God will manifest his exact Justice in punishing the
wicked, and his mercy and fidelity in rewarding the righteous: partly at
death; and partly at the last Judgment. The Scripture teaches, that the Lord
has made the wicked for the day of evil. Now both the day of death and the
day of Judgment, are evil days to the wicked, but good and joyful days to
the godly. Romans 2.6. Psalm. 62.12. Psalm. 58.11. Prove. 16.4.

Q. Tell me more particularly how does God deal with the godly at death?

A. The godly when they go out of this world shall carry none of their
Calamities, and Miseries with them, but they shall rest from all their
afflictions sorrows and labors: and their good works shall follow them. When
the righteous die, their Souls are carried immediately by the Angels into
Abrams bosom; and their bodies shall rest in their Graves as in perfumed Beds
till the last day; Rev. 14.13. Luke 16.22. and 23.43. Isa. 57.2.

Q. What shall be the estate of the wicked (which prosper here) at Death?

A. The wicked, when they go out of this world, shall carry none of their
Riches, Honors and pleasures with them; but instead of these, they shall carry
a Bundle of their Sins; their Transgressions shall follow them. The wicked that
prosper and flourish here, are like unto Sheep or Kine, that are put into fat
pastures to be prepared for the shambles: for when they die their Souls are
sent immediately to Hell; and their bodies are carried to the dark dungeon of
the Grave: and their Souls, and bodies being thus separated, Death shall feed
upon their Bodies, and the Worm that never dies shall feed upon their Souls.
Psalm. 49.17. Jer. 12.3. Luk: 16.22, 23. P. 49.14. Mar. 9.44.

Q. How are we to conceive of the third, and last (which is not the least) part
of divine providence? how will God deal with the Godly and with the wicked at
the great day of Judgment?

A. The great day of Judgment, will be a day of triumph, and of perfect
redemption to the godly; but a day of wrath, and of eternal perdition to the
wicked. Now the Justice of God seems to be observed in the present prosperity
of the wicked, and the many pressures of the righteous: but then the exact
Justice of God shall be declared, and manifested to all the world. Now many
particular Judgments of God are so secret and hidden, that we are not able to
give a sufficient reason of them: but then the wisdom and Justice of
secretest dispensations shall appear to men and Angels. Now the godly are
counted miserable, but then their happiness will appear to all the world,
when they shall hear that sweet Sentence Come ye blessed of my Father inherit
the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. Now the wicked
are counted and called happy; but then the miserable cursed condition of the
wicked shall appear to all the world, when they shall hear that dreadful
Sentence, Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the
Devil and his Angels, Luke 21.28. Job. 21.30. 2 Pet. 3.7. 2 These. 1.4, 5, 6.
Romans 2.5. Psalm. 36.6. Romans 2.5. Psalm. 36.6. Rom: 11.33. Mat. 25.34. Mal.
3.15.18. Mat. 25.41.
