Certain Observations ON THAT LETTER WRITTEN TO THE TWO HOUSES FROM THE ARMY.

Dated at Reading the 8 th. of July, 1647.

Written for the satisfaction of a private Friend, and may serve for the whole
KINGDOM.

Whereunto is added the Letter upon which these Observations were made.

Printed in the Year, 1647.

Sir,
IT was your desire that I should render you my observations upon that Letter
which was written in the name of the Army, Signed by St. Thomas Fairfax,
bearing date from Reading the 8th. of July. 1647 I must confess I have very
much heretofore justified the proceeding, of the Army, and it was my opinion
that they had very clear intentions for the good of the King and the Kingdom.

But I now fear I was mistaken; for although I yet retain a very charitable
opinion of the Army in general, yet considering the dilatory and intricate
proceedings of those chief Officers, who now act and negotiate with the
Parliament in what concerns the Kingdom, I do not conceive them men of such
unspotted integrity as I supposed they were. For either they are selfe-seekers,
or have selfe-interests in the managing and transacting of affairs; else why
do they not deal clearly and plainly to the open understanding of all men who
are concerned in the peace and settlement of the Kingdom?

It is evident that there is but one truth, and that is, or ought to be
manifest, and needs not put on any veil or disguise to obscure or shadow it;
but the more open and naked it is, the more natural and lovely it appears.

If the Army believe that they owe Allegiance and obedience to his Majesty, as
their lawful King, why should they not pay him that, duty and respect they
owe Him as Subjects, and not endeavor to make the world believe, as they seem
to do in this Letter, that the civility they pay him is matter of Courtesy,
and not duty?

The Army pretends to maintain the Law of the Land, Let them in the first
place, if they really intend as they speak, and as they write, restore his
Majesty to his Crown and Dignity, who is the fountain and life of the Law.
Let them not court the two Houses with arguments of convenience, and offering
of humble advises to persuade them to suffer his Majesty to see his Children,
which is a thing so agreeable to nature, and so consonant to reason and
religion, that they may justify to all the world the using of violence to
compel so just an act, and declaring those unnatural Rebels and traitors who
detain his Majesty's Children from waiting on Him.

Why should the Army excuse themselves, as if it were a fault to treat with his
Majesty, and to make conditions with him for their own peace and safety, or to
obtain from him an assurance that they shall enjoy that liberty of conscience
they desire? For I believe Judge Jenkins has instructed them sufficiently,
from whom they must receive their pardon. It must be an Act of his Majesty's
grace and savor that must secure them, no Ordidinance of the Houses.

And for my part, I believe it to be ill Logique, and worse Law to dispose the
settling of his Majesty's rights in the second place; for if h^s Majesty be
not first restored, and in a condition of being absolute in himself, that so
without constraint, he may freely act what is desired for the good and liberty
of the Subject, I believe his preceding acts will not be so obliging and valid,
as otherways they would be.

I am sorry to understand in this Letter, that His Majesty is avowed by the
Army to be a Prisoner, which is contrary to what they formerly professed; for
their phrase in this Letter is, That his Majesty should find all personal
Civilities and respects from us, with all reasonable freedom that might stand
with safety, and with the trust and charge lying upon us concerning his person.
Now if they pretend but to allow his Majesty all reasonable freedom that
might stand with safety, etc. Then I am sure that they deny him absolute
freedom: for the word reasonable, does limit and restrain him: and for the
rest of the phrase, expressing the trust and charge lying upon them, etc. I do
profess my ignorance, that I do not understand what is meant thereby, or
whence they derive that trust; and I believe it is the intention of the Army,
although it be not so expressed by their Penman, that what they write in this
kind, is written to inform the People, and should be easy to be understood by
all that read it.

For that which follows, I believe it not agreeable to reason, justice,
honesty, or conscience, so to behave themselves, toward his Majesty, as not
to render unto his Majesty in all things that duty they owe him by the law of
God and the Land.

I could wish the Army had dealt clearly, and told us who are the Kingdoms
best friends: for fear of offending of whom, they had reluctance when they
admitted the Duke of Richmond and two Chaplains to wait on his Majesty. And I
wonder the Army, or those who penned that letter should mention, that they
permitted his Majesty to use a continued importunity to procure leave for two
of his Chaplains to wait on him, it being contrary to the duty of loyal
Subjects, and to the Principles of the Independent Party, and repugnant to the
Armies profession, when they took away the King from Holmby; For they then
pretended to desire their own liberty of Conscience, and did wonder it should
be thought, that what they themselves desired, they should refuse to their King.

The Army professes in this Letter that they avoid harshnes, and afford kind
usage to his Majesty, as the most Christian, honorable, and prudentiall way
wherewith they think it fit to use his Majesty; but they do not acknowledge
that they pay him any respect as in duty they ought, he being their King, and
they his Subjects.

These things I would gladly see reconciled, and be satisfied in, and if it be
the sense of the whole Army, that they do with reluctance afford his Majesty
liberty of Conscience, I am sorry I was so mistaken in their tenants and
professions; for I did believe otherwise of them.

And I am of opinion, that as the two Houses have lost the affections of the
people, because they have robbed his Majesty of his ju^t Rights, and deprived
the Subjects of their Laws and Liberties, so the Army has gotten, and does now
retain the good opinion of all the Kingdom, because they pretend to restore
his Majesty to his just Rights, and the Subjects to their Liberties, which are
both effected by the restitution of our Laws; and when they fail to perform
this, they will be despised as now the two Houses are.

And for the complement which this Letter seems to put upon his Majesty's
friends, I am persuaded they will content themselves by being made capable to
enjoy what the Law affords them, and for this favor I am confident upon the
Armies Declaration to restore the King and the Laws, they will all rise as one
man to join with them for the accomplishing of so pious a work; which if the
Army having so fair an opportunity shall omit, I am confident God will do his
own work without them; and raise up some other forces for that purpose, with
whom undoubtedly the whole Kingdom will join, and they who might have been
glorious instruments for the good of the Kingdom, will be buried in the ruin
of their country, without any mention but of infamy and dishonor.

Mr. Speaker,
I Was sent unto by the King on Friday last, to desire the Parliament to give
way to him to see his Children; and that they might for that purpose be sent to
Him: If I may be bold humbly to offer my Opinion, I think the allowance of
such a thing may be without the least prejudice to the Kingdom, and yet gain
more upon His Majesty then denying it; and if it be in the prayers of every
good man, That His heart may be gained, the performance of such civilities to
Him is very suitable to those desires, and will hear well withal men, who (if
they can imagine it to be their own case) cannot but be sorry, if his
Majesty's natural affections to his Children, in so small a thing should not be
complied with; and if any question should be concerning the assurance of their
return, I shall engage for their return within what time the Parliament shall
limit.

Upon this occasion give me leave, I beseech you, to take notice of some
Reports spread abroad, as if my self and the Officers of the Army were upon
some underhand Contract or Bargain with the King; and from thence occasion is
taken to slander our Integrities, and endeavor a misunderstanding betwixt the
Parliament and their Army, the fidelity of which to the Parliament and Kingdom,
and their affection to it, are the great objects of many men's Envies, because
they see nothing so likely to settle Right and Freedom, with Truth and Peace to
us and Posterity, and to hinder their Designs against the same, as an Harmony
or good accord between the Parliament and Army, which is the joy of good men,
and it shall be our study to preserve against all Designs and Designers to the
contrary.

To prevent therefore all mis-understandings of that kind, I thought fit with
all clearenesse to declare unto you, That we have done nothing, nor shall do
any thing which we desire to hide from you or the world, or shall not avow to
the faces of our greatest Adversaries.

Our Desires concerning a just consideration and settlement of the Kings Rights
(His Majesty first giving His concurrence to settle and secure the Rights and
Liberties of the Kingdom) We have already publicly declared in our
Representation and Remonstrance. Since the first of those Papers sent to the
Parliament, there have been several Officers of the Army upon several
occasions sent to his Majesty, the first to present to him a copy of the
Representation, and after that some others to tender Him a copy of the
Remonstrance; upon both which, the Officers sent were appointed to clear the
sense and intention of any thing in either Paper, whereupon His Majesty might
make any question. Since then, there have also been some Officers at several
times sent to His Majesty about His remove from Hatfield, to dissuade (if
possibly) from Windsor or any place so near London, to some place of further
distance, answerable to what we had desired of the Parliament.

In all which addresses to His Majesty, We care not who knows what has been
said or done; for as we have nothing to bargain for or to ask, either from His
Majesty or the Parliament, for advantage to our selves, or any particular party
or interest of our own; so in all those Addresses to His Majesty We have
utterly disclaimed and disavowed any such thing, or any Overtures or Thoughts
tending that way; But the only intent and effect of those our Addresses has
been, to desire and endeavor His Majesty's free concurrence with the
Parliament, for establishing and securing the common Rights and Liberties, and
settling the peace of the Kingdom; and to assure Him, That (the Public being
so provided for, with such His Majesty's concurrence) it is fully agreeable to
our Principles, and should be our desires and endeavor, That (with, and in
such settling of the Public) the Rights of His Majesty's Royal Family should
be also provided for, so as a lasting Peace and Agreement might be settled in
this Nation: And that, as We had publicly declared for the same in general
terms, so (if things came to a way of settlement) We should not be wanting (in
our spheres) to own that general Desire, in any particulars of natural or civil
right to His Majesty's Person or Family, which might not prejudice or again
endanger the Public: and in the mean time, That His Majesty should find all
personal civilities and respects from us, with all reasonable freedom that
might stand with safety, and with the trust or charge lying upon us concerning
His Person.

You have here the utmost sum of what has passed from us to His Majesty; and
We could wish all men did rightly understand (without misrepresentations) every
particular, wherein (as We know nothing not agreeable to Reason, Justice,
Honesty or Conscience, so) We thought our selves concerned the rather to say
and do, as We have, toward His Majesty since He came within our quarters,
because of those common prejudices suggested against us, as if We were utter
Enemies to Monarchy, and all Civil Order or Government.

And for that particular of the Duke of Richmond and the Two Chaplains lately
permitted to attend his Majesty, It was not done without much reluctance,
because therein We doubted We might be misunderstood by the Kingdoms best
friends.

But upon his Majesty's continuing importunity for it, as a thing very nearly
concerning His present inward and outward contentment; and conceiving those
persons such (as we hoped) would not do ill offices to prejudice the Peace of
the Kingdom, We did give way to it, and the persons (before they came) had
notice of the permission: And as we then thought, so we still do think, That to
allow him some such company of persons least dangerous, whom former
acquaintance may make him take pleasure in; and the allowance of some such
Chaplains of his own, are things both reasonable and just; and the debarring of
that liberty in the latter (We doubt) will but make Him more prejudiced against
other Ministers

In general, we humbly conceive, that to avoid all harshnesse, and afford all
kind usage to his Majesty's Person, in things consisting with the Peace and
Safety of the Kingdom, is the most Christian, Honorable and Prudent way: And
in all things (as the Representation and Remonstrance of the Army does
express) We think that tender, equitable and moderate dealing, both toward
his Majesty, his Royal Family, and his late party (so far as may stand with
safety to the Kingdom, and security to our common Rights and Liberties) is the
most hopeful course to take away the seeds of War or future Feuds amongst us
for posterity, and to procure a lasting Peace and Agreement in this now
distracted Nation; To the effecting and settling whereof (with a secure
provision first to be made for the common Rights and Liberties of the Kingdom,
and a due care to preserve and propagate the Gospel of Truth and Peace amongst
us) we shall hope that neither the Parliament nor his Majesty will be wanting:
And if God shall see it good to make us any way instrumental thereunto, or that
we may otherwise see the same accomplished, we shall then think our selves
indeed discharged from the public engagements we have been called out unto,
more clearly and effectually then (before such things were settled) we could
have thought our selves to be, and (to demonstrate our clearness from seeking
self-advantages in what we did) we shall thenceforth account it our greatest
happiness and Honor (if God see it good) to be disingaged and dismissed, not
only from our Military charges, but from all other matters of Power or
public employment whatsoever.

I have in these things spoke, not in my own Name alone, but in the Name
(because I find it to be the clear sense of the generality, or at least of the
most considerable part) of the Army, and I am confident you and the Kingdom will
never find it otherwise: I shall leave it to your favorable construction, and
commit all to the goodness of God for an happy issue. I remain

Reading, July 8. 1647. Your most humble Servant, T. Fairfax

For the Right Honorable, the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament.
FINIS.
