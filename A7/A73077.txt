Rock the Babie Joane:
OR, John his Petition to his loving Wife Ioane,
To suckle the Babe that was none of her own.

To the Tune of, Under and over.
O Ione




A Young man in our Parish,
His wife was somewhat currish.
For she refused to nourish
a child which he brought home:
He got it on an other,
And death had taken the mother,
The truth he could not smother,
all out at last did come:
Suckle the Baby,
huggle the Baby,
Rock the Baby Ione.
I scorn to suckle the Baby,
Unless it were mine own.
His wife cried out on one day,
I think it was on Sunday,
The next day being Monday,
his Wench in sunder fell:
The Dad on it she descryed,
Which having done, she dyed,
This could not be denied,
alas he knew't too well.
Suckle the Baby, etc.
The Parish him enforced
To see the Infant nursed,
He being but lightly pursed,
desired to save that charge:
He brought it to his own wife,
Whom he loved as his own life:
To her the case was known rife,
he told her all at large.
Suckle the Baby, etc.
Quoth he my Ione my dearest,
Thy love to me is nearest,
Thy virtue will shine clearest,
in doing this good deed:
This Infant young is left here,
Unable to make shift here,
Twill be of life bereft here,
unless thou do it feed.
Suckle the Baby, etc.
Away thou false Deceiuer,
Quoth she farewell for ever,
I am resolved never
To love thee as I did:
Alas quoth he my honny,
I would not for any money,
By thee my sweetest conny,
to be so shrewdly chid.
Suckle the Baby, etc.
Although I loved his mother,
I Will vow to love none other,
What needst thou keep this pother,
since she (poor wretch) is dead:
No more she can thee trouble,
And 'twould be charges double,
If every month a Noble
I pay for milk and bread.
Suckle the Baby,
Huggle the Baby,
Rock the Babie Ione.
I scorn to suckle the Baby,
Unless it were mine own.
The second part.
To the same tune.
To thee I make my moan,
O rock the cradle Ione.

So I may have my will,
I Will love thy Baby still.



T^^ sold be to my discredit,
Should I both board and bed it,
For never woman did it
to a Bastard in this kind.
O (...) leave off this fashion,
Twill be thy commendation
To take commiseration,
let not the child be pind.
Suckle the Baby, etc.
What if the brat be starued?
Experience has observed
It should not be preserved
by her that is thy wife.
Thy patience will appear more,
O take it Iuggie therefore.
Bear with my fault, for wherefore
should we continue strife?
Suckle the Baby, etc.
I doubt I shall be forced,
From thee to be divorced,
Thy brood shall nere be nursed,
by me nor by my cost.
O wife be not so cruel,
Thou know thou art my Jewel,
Be certain if thou do well,
thy labor is not lost.
Suckle the Baby, etc.
My neighbors will deride me,
And none that dwell beside me
Will evermore abide me
for such a President.
No Ione thou art mistaken,
Twill other wives awaken,
Then let some course be taken
for the child's nourishment.
Suckle the Baby, etc.
Let patient Grissels story,
Be still in thy memory,
Who won a lasting glory,
through patience in like sort:
Although it touch thee nearly,
This Barn that looks so cheerely,
Shall bind me still more dearly,
to love thee better for it.
Suckle the Baby, etc.
Well John thy intercession
Has changed my disposition,
And now upon condition
thou wilt go no more astray:
I Will entertain thy Baby,
And love it as well as may be.
Do so (sweet Judge) I pray thee,
then this is a joyful day.
Suckle the Baby,
Huggle the Baby,
Rock the Baby Ione:
I prithee Judge love my Baby,
And count it to be thine own.
I have a Girl, I bore it
But just a day before it,
Although we be but poor yet,
these two we will maintain:
I Will suckle it, and dandle it,
And very choycely handle it,
And thou shall soap and candle get:
and thus between us twain,
We Will suckle the Baby,
And huggle the Baby.
Gramercy honest Ione.
O John I Will rock thy Baby,
As well as 'twere mine own.
FINIS.
