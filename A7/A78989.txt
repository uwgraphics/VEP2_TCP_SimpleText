By the King.
A Proclamation for a general fast thorowout this Realm of England.
HIs Majesty taking into His Princely and Pious consideration the lamentable
and distressed estate of His good Subjects in His Majesty's Kingdom of Ireland,
and conceiving it to be a just and great occasion calling upon Him, and His
people of this His Kingdom of England for a general humiliation of all estates
of this Kingdom before Almighty God, in Prayer and Fasting, for drawing down
His Mercy and Blessing upon that Kingdom: His Majesty does therefore by this
His Proclamation straightly charge and command, that a General, Public, and
Solemn Fast be kept, and holden, as well by abstinence from Food, as by public
Prayers, Preaching, and Hearing of the Word of God, and other Sacred duties, in
all Cathedral, Collegiate, and Parish Churches and Chapels within this His
Majesty's Kingdom of England, and Dominion of Wales (His Majesty's Cities of
London and Westminster only excepted, where it has already been observed) on
the twentieth day of this present month of January.

And His Majesty does further by this His Proclamation straightly charge and
command, that a General, Public, and Solemn Fast be kept and holden, as well
by abstinence from Food, as by public Prayers, Preaching, and Hearing of the
Word of God, and other sacred Duties, in all Cathedral, Collegiate, and Parish
Churches and Chapels within this Kingdom of England and Dominion of Wales
(without any exception) on the last Wednesday of the month of February next
following the date hereof, and from thenceforth to continue on the last
Wednesday of every month during the Troubles in the said Kingdom of Ireland.
All which His Majesty does expressly charge and command shall be reverently and
devoutly performed by all His loving Subjects, as they tender the favor of
Almighty God, and would avoid His just indignation against this Land, and upon
pain of such punishments as His Majesty can justly inflict upon all such as
shall contemn or neglect so religious a Work.

Given at the Court at White Hall the eighth day of January, in the seventeenth
year of His Majesty's Reign of great Britain, France, and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill. 1641.
