A Proclamation for putting the Laws against Popish Recusants in due execution.
THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, having been formerly moved by His
Parliament, for putting the Laws in execution against Papists, whereto He has
from time to time still given His gracious Answers, expressing His willingness
thereunto: But now finding, that no such proceedings against them have been yet
had, as might answer His Majesty's expectation: His Majesty therefore, out of
His Princely and pious care, as well for maintaining the true Protestant
Religion established in this Kingdom, as for suppressing by lawful ways, all
increase and growth of Popery; Has thought fit to publish His Royal Pleasure
therein; Wherefore His Majesty does hereby straightly charge and command, all
and every His Judges and Justices of Assize, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, and
other His Officers and Ministers whatsoever, whom it does any way concern, That
they, and every of them, according to the duties of their several Offices and
places, do forthwith, and without further delay, put in due and effectual
execution the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, provided and made against Popish
Recusants, and that without favor or connivence; As they tender His Majesty's
just and Royal Commands, the good of this Church and Kingdom, and will answer
for neglect of their duties herein.

Given at His Majesty's Court at Stanford the sixteenth day of March, in the
seventeenth year of His Reign.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barket, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill. 1641.
