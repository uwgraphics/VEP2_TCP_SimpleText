C. R. In a Cloud.
IT is no strange thing
To hear that the King
Has made his escapes;
For Jove did the same,
And got him a name
(For shifting and Rapes.)
What he did for Lust
(For Jupiter must
With a fair one sport.)
King Charles did not do,
His Juno's no shrew,
He Is not gone to Court.
No Danaes Power
In a Brazen Tower
Has made him turn shower,
You know well of old
That he had no Gold,
C. R. was too poor.
Nor ever did low
For Europa-Cow,
And feed among Beasts,
Nor deceived the Herds
In a Goatish Beard,
So quaint he was dressed.
But he is retired,
As he was desired,
For sweet Liberty.
When every man claims,
And makes her his aims,
Will Not you have Princes free?
Away with such Knaves,
Who Liberty craves,
For their own pure trains
Yet would inviron
Their King, and in Iron
Bind him, and in chains.
We have heard in a manner
Of the King and Tanner,
But the King was first:
But these Translators
Of the State-matters,
Make the King the worst.
Instead of a Crown,
They Will pull him down,
As not fit for trust;
Instead of God save,
His life they will have,
And's Honourith'dust.
Salt Peter's, and Dell,
You have preached well
To your Auditory:
This Doctrine you may
Read in Loyola;
Here Is a fine story.
Would any man think,
The Agitators drink
Of the waters of Tiber?
Or that Babylons whore
Were Peter's Paramour,
Or Dells next Neighbor?
Protestant God night,
Welcome Jesuit,
Welcome pretty Nuns,
Our Daughters shall be
Whores of Piety,
And Rebels our Sons.
Charles keep in thy Cloud,
And there safe thee shrewd,
Nor break, but as Day.
The mid Region be
Thy Artillery,
Where Clouds bear the sway.
Peep a little from thence,
And list to what sense
We make of thy Letters,
Every one does think
That great Caesar's Ink,
Never wrote better.
And as for the matter,
We cannot here flatter,
The Royal Inditer,
But say, as true it is,
Thy Pen (as was his)
Is of a ready Writer.
We Are sorry to see,
That such Treachery
Should be in our Land;
Or that any thing
Should force our good King
To his running hand,
His Letters he throws,
Like Parthian Arrows,
And Conquers flying.
Ten thousand are sold,
They 'll never be old.
New, new news they are crying.
D' you see, do you see,
How the Presbytery
Joy their f^^^t named,
The Assembly men prinke
Up their Ears; I think
They were near maimed.
But be not too cranke
In the second rank,
The Independents
Will look to your waters,
And then follow after
The Army their defendents.
Satisfaction's next,
To his party perplexed,
And gone to the Pot,
'Cause the have adhered,
And are to be feared,
And even the Scot.
Now mark his Len voy,
And cry Vive-le-Roy;
Can any think so,
God will bless those Peers
Who refuse to hear
Their King? Surely no.
As he is Royal to all,
So he Personal
Is honest, and just,
In his care you see
For deliverie
Of his Pictures in trust.
There Is none but a King,
Could do such a thing,
Who is Princely bent,
Truly to restore,
(Who can do any more?
What the Ladies lend.
O most gallant Prince,
Whose free Conscience,
No evil shall clog,
He does Whaly beseech,
To send home the Grew Bitch,
Before he will jog.
And his deportment
Shows before he went,
Him a Gentleman much;
Who would not neglect
His civil respects
To Whaly and such.
So did he think fit,
Mountague to greet.
And's fellows, whose fames
Were good, and discourses
And so were the horses,
He sent his son James.
His Letters all done,
Away he is gone,
And leaves these Papers.
To be read in the night,
(But not without light,)
For by them was Tapers.
Or if so before,
They broke up the door,
To look for C. R.
The Tapers went out,
In his Cloak without doubt.
There was a bright star.
What wonders are here?
Yet we do not fear,
High-minded and proud;
Nor our sins revoke,
Yet see Stars in a Cloak,
And Kings in a Cloud.
Now we are all at a gaze,
To discover which ways
This Angel was gone,
Where more him attend,
God did his Guards send,
And ease those at Hampton.
God keep our C. R.
From Martin-King-marre,
And such evil sprights,
Who have late brought in
That cursed Doctrine,
With their newfound lights,
But thou blessed Isle,
That preservest a while
Thy King, be thou wise,
Do not thou betray,
Nor open thy Bay,
Nor suffer surprise.
Our Isles shall be glad.
The Isle of Wight had
The keeping our Pan;
And England will be
In Unanimity.
As the Isle of one Man.
FINIS.
