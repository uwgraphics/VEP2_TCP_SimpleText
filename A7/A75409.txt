An ANSWER to a Pamphlet, entit'led, [A DECLARATION of the Commons of England
in Parliament assembled, expressing their Reasons and Grounds of passing the
late Resolutions touching no farther Address or Application to be made to the
KING.]
I Believe that it was never heard of until now, that heavy Imputations were
laid on any Man (I speak not, now, of KINGS, which I confess makes the Case,
yet, more strange and unjust) and He not permitted to see, much less to Answer
them: but so it is now with the KING: which does (though silently) yet subject
Him to as great an Imputation, as there is any in the said Declaration; for
those who know no better, may think that He cannot, because He does not, Answer
it: Wherefore I hold it my Duty (knowing these things better then every
ordinary Man) to do my best, that the KING should not be injured, by the
ignorance of His People; and albeit, I (lying under Persecution, for my
Conscience, and Love to Regal Authority) have not the means, in every thing,
to make full Probations; yet, I am confident, in all the most material Points,
so to make the Truth, of the KINGS Innocence, appear; that I shall satisfy any
Impartial judicious Reader.

What the Issue of former Addresses to the KING has been, is most certainly
known to all the World; but, where the Fault rests, whereby Peace has not
ensued, bare Asseverations, without Proofs, cannot, I am sure, satisfy any
Judicious Reader. And indeed, it seems to me, that the Penner of this, seeks
more to take the Ears of the Ignorant Multitude, with big Words, and bold
Assertions, then to satisfy Rational Men with real Proofs or true Arguments.
For, at the very first, he begs the Question; tak^ng it for granted, that the
KING could ease the Sighs and Groans, dry the Tears, and stanch the Blood of
His distressed Subjects: Alas! Is it He, that keeps Armies on foot, when there
is none to oppose? Is it He, that will not lay down Excise, Taxation, and
free-Quarterings? But, it is He indeed, who was so far from Power, even at that
time, (being far worse since) that, in most things, He wanted the Liberty of
any freeborn Man: It is He, who never refused to ease His People of their
Grievances; witness more Acts of Grace passed in His Reign, then (to speak
within my compass) in any five Kings or Queens Times, that ever were before
Him: Moreover, It is He, who, to settle the present unhappy Distractions, and
(as the best means to it) to obtain a Personal Treaty, has offered so much;
that (to say Truth) during His own Time, He has left Himself little more then
the Title of a KING; as it plainly appears by His Message from the Isle of
Wight, concerning the Militia, and choosing the Officers of State, and
Privy-Counsellours; besides other points of Compliance, which is needless here
to mention.

Good God! are these Offers, unfit for them to receive? have they tendered such
Propositions, that might occasion the World to judge that they have yielded up,
not only their Wills and Affections, but their Reasons also, and Judgments,
for obtaining a true Peace or good Accommodation? It is true, that if they can
show, what, Reasonably, they could have asked more; or, wherein the KING'S
Offers were deficient (either in Point of Security, or, by withholding, from
any of His Subjects, a jot of their just Privileges) then, they said somewhat,
to challenge Belief: But, bare Asseverations, even against what a Man sees,
will not get credit with any, but such who abandon their Judgments to an
Implicit Faith: Nor can the Determinations of all the Parlaments in the World,
make a thing Just or Necessary, if it be not so of it self: And can it be
imagined, that any, who were ever acquainted with the Passages at the Treaties,
of Oxford and Uxbridge, will believe (though it be said) That the Propositions
tendered at Newcastle, were the same in effect, which had been presented to the
King before, in the midst of all His Strength and Forces? Indeed methinks such
gross slips as these, should, at least, make a Man be wary, how to believe
such things, for which he sees no Proofs; And yet it should seem, that a Man
must either take their Words, for good Payment, or remain unsatisfied; for a
little after, it is said, That the Kings strange, unexpected, and conditional
Answers or Denials might justly have made them consider some other course for
Settling the Kingdom in Peace and Safety, without any farther Application; but
never shows, wherein the strangeness of His Answers or Denials consists: And
I should think, that those Reasons, upon which the laying by of a Kings
Authority is grounded (for it is no less) ought to be particularly mentioned,
for the Worlds satisfaction, and not involved in general big Words: for it
thereby seems, that it is their Force of Arms, more then that of Reason, which
they trust to, for procuring of Obedience to their Determinations, or Belief to
what they say: Otherwise, can it be imagined, that their saying, That their
last Propositions were to be qualified, that (where it might stand with the
Public safety) the wonted Scruples and Objections were prevented or removed,
can give satisfaction to any Rational Man, who has seen all their former
Propositions? for, it is most evident, that their Demands have always
increased with their good Fortune.

And for their great Condescension to a Personal Treaty (which, under favor,
can scarcely be called so; for the KING, though He had granted what was
desired, was not to come, neither to nor near London, but to stay in the Isle
of Wight, and there to Treat with Commissioners) upon Signing the Four Bills;
Surely, they incurred therein, but little danger; for it is most evident, that
they contain the very substance of the most essential parts of their Demands;
which being once granted, the KING would neither have had Power to Deny, nor
any thing left worth the refusing; for after He had confessed, that He had
taken up Arms, to invade the liberty of his People, (whereas it was only for
the Defense of His own Rights) and had likewise Condemned all those, who had
faithfully served Him, of Rebellion; and that He had totally divested Himself,
his Heirs, and Successors for ever, of the Power of the Sword; whereby the
Protection of His Subjects (which is one of the most essential and necessary
Rights belonging to Regal Authority) is totally torn away from the Crown: and
that by a silent Confession, He had done Himself and Successors, an
irrepairable prejudice concerning the Great Seal (I speak not of the other two
Bills, neither of which are of little importance) what was there more for Him
to grant (worth the insisting upon) after such Concessions? or, indeed, what
Power was left Him to deny any thing? So that the KING'S necessity of giving
the Answer He did (for it was no absolute Refusal) is most evident; unless,
He had resolved to have lived in quiet, without Honor; and to have given His
People Peace, without Safety; by Abandoning them to an Arbitrary and unlimited
Power of the Two Houses, for ever, concerning the Levying of Land or Sea
Forces, without stinting of Numbers, or distinction of Persons; and for
Payments, to levy such sums of Moneys, in such sort, and by such ways and
means, as they shall think fit and appoint. And now, I cannot but ask; Is this
the Militia, that the KING contends for? or, did ever any King of England
pretend to, or seek for, such a Power? surely no: But, this is a new Militia,
and take heed, lest this should prove like the Roman Praetorian Cohorts, that
what they did in choosing and changing Emperors, these do not to this
Government; by moulding and altering it according to their Fancies. Now, my
eagerness to clear this Point concerning the four Bills, had almost made me
forget, a most material Question: I wonder much wherein the Danger consists of
a Personal Treaty with the KING, ever since He was last at Newcastle? Surely
He cannot bring Forces along with Him, to awe His Two Houses of Parliament: and
it is as well known that He has not Money to raise an Army: and truly, there is
as little fear, that the Eloquence of His Tongue should work Miracles; but on
the Contrary, if He were so ill a Man, as you describe Him to be, whatsoever He
shall say or write, must more prejudice Him then You: for let Him never flatter
Himself; it must be clear, not doubtful, Reason, that can prevail against
that great visible prevailing Power, which now opposes Him: nor do I say, it
will; but certainly, less cannot do it: Where is then, the Danger? Believe
it, Reason will hardly maintain those who are afraid of her.

After this, it is said, That they had Cause enough to remember, that the KING
sometimes denied to receive their humble Petitions: but, they neither tell,
where, nor when; which, I am most confident, they cannot: but I am certain,
that the KING has sent diverse Messages of Peace to them, unto which, He has
yet, had no Answer; namely, His last from Oxford of the 15. Jan. 1645. and all
the rest since: As for the Fight at Brainceford, whosoever will read the
Collection of the Declarations in Print, upon that subject, will clearly find,
that the KING has more Reason to complain, that they under color of Treaty,
sought to environ Him with their Forces; then they, for what He then did; and
His Retreat was neither for Fear, nor with Shame; for the appearing of the
Enemy made Him retard, not hasten His Orders for retiring, which diverse hours
(before their appearing) He had given: which He did without any loss at all,
but (on the contrary) Retreated with more Arms, Eleven Colors, and fifteen
pieces of Ordnance (beside good store of Ammunition) then He had before: and
for Cruelty; there was not a drop of Blood shed, but in the heat of the Fight,
for I saw above five hundred Prisoners, who (only promising, never after, to
bear Arms against the KING) were freely Released.

Again, they seem to have good Memories, saying, That the King once sent them a
specious Message of renewing a Treaty, when at the same time, His Messenger was
instructed how to manage that bloody Massacre in London, which was then
Designed by virtue of the Kings Commission, since published: And has the KING
sent but one Message, for the renewing of a Treaty? Then what was that from
Tavestock in Aug. 1644. and 5. 15. 26. 29. of December. and 15. of Jan. 1645.
five others from Oxford the next Year? But indeed this, that is here
mentioned, they knew not how to Answer (for at that time, they knew not the way
of Silence) but by this forged Accusation against the Messenger; who, I dare
say, knew nothing of that, which might have been (at that time) intended for
the KING'S service, by some who had more Zeal then Judgment: But, that there
was a Massacre intended, or, that any Commission from the KING, should
countenance such a Design, is a most notorious Slander. As for the KING'S
mentioned Letter to the QUEEN; I am confident that any judicious Reader, will
find the Gloss made upon it, very much wrested: And certainly, after-Ages will
think these Times very Barbarous, wherein private Letters betwixt Man and Wife
are published to open view: and in other Countries, there is such Respect
carried to private Letters of Princes, that (to my knowledge) the last Emperor
in the greatest heat of the Bohemian War, having intercepted a Packet,
wherein were private Letters to King JAMES of blessed Memory (who was then
known, no great Friend to the Emperor) from His only Daughter, then, avowedly
the Emperors greatest Enemy; yet He sent them to the KING, without the least
offer of violence to the Scales.

And now I come to their Determination upon the whole Matter, what Course they
have resolved to take with the KING: their words are; But notwithstanding this
and other former Tenders, we have now received such a Denial that we are in
Despair of any good by Addresses to the KING; neither must we be so injurious
to the People in further delaying their Setlement, as any more to press His
Consent to these, or any other Propositions: Besides, it is Resolved upon the
Question: That they will receive no more any Message from the King; and do
enjoyne, That no Persons do presume, to receive or bring any Message from the
King to both or either Houses of Parliament or to any other Person. Thus you
see, that the KING is laid by; but, that is not all; for, He must, neither
justify His Innocence against Calumny, nor is there any way left Him to mend
any Error, that He may have committed: Is this a Just way of proceeding? when
Truth, though offered, must not be heard; and that no way must be left to
recant an Error? And why all this Severity? Because (as I have already shown
you) the KING will not injure His Conscience or Honor, nor suffer His People
to be oppressed; to which they give the Term of such a Denial, though really
it was none. But since they thus seek to hoodwink the People; it is no great
Wonder, that they forbid the KING to repent Him of those Faults, which He never
committed: and I believe all Indifferent Men, will easily judge of the KING'S
Innocence, even by their way of Accusation: for, those who will lay such High
Crimes to His charge, as the breach of Oaths, Vows, Protestations, and
Imprecations; would not spare to bring their Proofs if they had any: But on the
Contrary it is known to all the World, that He had not suffered, as He has
done, if He would have dispensed with that part of His Coronation Oath, which
He made to the Clergy; which is no great sign that He makes slight of His
Engagements: of which it is so universally known, that He has been so
Religiously Careful, as I hold it a wrong to His Innocence, to seek to clear
Him of such Slanders, for which there are no Proofs alleged; for, Malice
being once detected, is best Answered, with Neglect and Silence: And was there
ever greater, or more apparent, Malice, then to offer to put the horrid
slander of Paricide upon Him, who was eminently known to be as obedient and
loving a Son to His blessed Father, as any History can make mention of? But
indeed the loss of Rochell does fitly follow; to show, how Malice, when it is
at the height, is ordinarily accompanied; for there are none, but ignorant or
forgetful Men, who know not that it was merely the want of Assistance, from
the Two Houses of Parliament (contrary to their Public General Engagement)
that lost Rochell: and there is nothing more clear (to any who has known
French Occurrences) then, that real Assistance, which the KING, to the
uttermost of His Power, gave to those of the Religion, at that time, made the
Cardinal of Richelieu an irreconcilable enemy to the KING; wherefore I cannot
but say, that it is a strange forgetful Boldness to charge the KING with that
which was evidently other men's faults.

There are also other things, that, to any knowing Man, will rather seem Jeers,
then Acusations; as the German Horse, and Spanish Fleet in the year 1639. But
my Affection shall not so blind me, as to say, that the KING never erred; yet,
as when a just Debt is paid, Bonds ought to be cancelled; so Grievances, be
they never so just, being once redressed, ought no more to be objected as
Errors. And it is no Paradox, to affirm; that Truths, this way told, are no
better then Slanders; and such are the Catalogue of Grievances here
enumerated; which, when they are well examined, every one of them, will not be
found such as here they are described to be.

Now as concerning those Discourses which mention the Beginnings of these
Troubles, (which are in Two several places of this Declaration) I will only
say this; that what the KING did, upon those Occasions, was merely to defend
the Rights of His Crown, which were and are evidently sought to be torn from
Him; nor can I acknowledge all those Relations to be true, such as Private
Levies, of Men; by Popish Agents; Arming of Papists in the North, Calling in of
Danish Forces, and the like: And as for the stale Slander of calling up the
Northern Army, now renewed; it is well known, that the Two Houses (even at
that time) were not so partial to the KING, as to have concealed a Practice of
that kind, if they could have got it sufficiently proved.

But, if the Irish Rebellion can be justly charged upon the KING, then I shall
not blame any for believing all the rest of the Allegations against Him; only
I protest against all Rebels Testimony, as good Proof; it being most
certain by experience; that they, who make no Conscience of Rebelling, will
make less of Lying, when it is for their Advantage. And, it is no little
wonder, that, so grave an Assembly as the House of Commons, should so slightly
examine a Business of that Great Weight, as to allege, that the Scots Great
Seal, did countenance the Irish Rebellion, when I know it can be proved, by
Witnesses without exception, that, for many Months before, until the now Lord
Chancellor had the Keeping of it, there was nothing at all Sealed by it: Nor
concerning this Great Point will I only say, that the KING is Innocent, and
bid them prove (which, to most Accusations, is a sufficient Answer) but, I can
prove, that if the KING had been obeyed in the Irish Affairs before He went
last into Scotland, there had been no Irish Rebellion; and, after it was begun,
it had, in few Months, been subpressed, if His Directions had been observed;
For if the KING had been suffered to have performed His Engagements to the
Irish Agents; and, had disposed of the discontented Irish Army, beyond Sea
(according to His Contracts with the French and Spanish Ambassadors) there is
nothing more clear, then that there could have been no Rebellion in Ireland;
because, they had wanted both Pretense and Means, to have made one: Then, when
it was broken forth, if those vigorous courses had been pursued, which the KING
proposed, (first to the Scots, then, to the English Parliament) doubtless that
Rebellion had been soon suppressed. But what He proposed took so little effect,
that in many months after, there was nothing sent into Ireland, but what the
KING Himself sent (assisted by the Duke of Richmond) before He came from
Scotland, unto Sir Rob: Steward; which, though it were little, will be found to
have done much service, as may be seen by the said Sir Roberts voluntary
Testimony, given in writing to the Parliament Commissioners then attending the
KING at Stoak. And certainly, a greater Evidence for Constancy in Religion
there cannot be, then the KING showed in His Irish Treaty; for, in the time
that He most needed Assistance, it was in His Power to have made that Kingdom
Declare unanimously for Him, and have had the whole Forces thereof employed in
His Service, if He would have granted their Demand in Points of Religion, they
not insisting in any thing of Civil Government, which His Majesty might not
have granted, without prejudice to Regal Authority; and this can be clearly
proved, by the Marquis of Ormonds Treaties with the Irish, not without very
good Evidence by some of the KING's Letters to the QUEEN, which were taken at
Naseby that are purposely concealed, lest they should too plainly discover the
KING'S detestation of that Rebellion, and His rigid firmness to the Protestant
Profession: Nor can I end this Point, without remarking with Wonder, that Men
should have so ill Memories, as again to renew that old Slander, of the King's
giving Passes, to diverse Papists, and Persons of Quality, who headed the
Rebels; of which He so cleared Himself, that He demanded Reparation for it,
but could not have it, albeit no show of Proof could be produced, for that
Allegation: as is most plainly to be seen in the first book of the Collection
of all Remonstrances, Declarations, etc. fol. 69. and 70.

Thus having given a particular Answer to the most material Points in this
Declaration, the rest are such frivolous, malicious, and many of them
groundless Calumnies, that Contempt is the Best Answer for them. Yet, one
thing more, I must observe, that they not only endeavor to make Fables pass
for current Coin, but likewise seek to blind Men's Judgments, with false
Inferences upon some Truths: for Example; It is true, that the KING has said
in some of His Speeches or Declarations; That He owes an Account of His
Actions to none but God alone; and That the Houses of Parliament joint or
separate have no Power, either to make or Declare any Law; But, that this is a
fit foundation for all Tyranny, I must utterly Deny; indeed if it had been
said, that the King, without the Two Houses of Parliament, could make or Declare
Laws, then there might be some strength in the Argument; but, before this
Parliament, it was never, so much as Pretended, that either or both Houses,
without the KING, could make or Declare any Law, and certainly HIS MAJESTY is
not the first (and I hope will not be the last) King of England, that has not
held Himself Accomptable to any Earthly Power; besides it will be found, that
this HIS MAJESTY'S Position is most agreeable to all Divine and Humane Laws;
so far it is, from being Destructive to a Kingdom, or a Foundation for
Tyranny. To conclude, I appeal to GOD, and the World, whether it can be
paralleled by example, or warranted by Justice, that any Man should be
Slandered, yet denied the sight thereof; and so far from being permitted to
Answer, that if He have erred, there is no way left Him to acknowledge or mend
it: and yet this is the KING'S present Condition; who is, at this time, laid
aside; Because He will not consent that the old Fundamental Laws of this Land
be changed, Regal Power destroyed, nor, His People submitted, to a new
Arbitrary Tyrannical Government.
