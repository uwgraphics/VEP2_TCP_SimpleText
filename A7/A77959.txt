LONDON: Printed for Giles Calvert, at the Black-spread-Eagle, near the West
end of Paul's, 1657.

THE Testimony of the Lord concerning LONDON. Witnessed forth in truth and
faithfulness, to the Consciences of all people in it, that they may return to
the Lord and repent.
O LONDON, thou art weighed in an even balance, and found too light; thou art
measured by an equal line, and found too short, and too narrow, and thy People
cannot stand in Judgment; for abundance of iniquity lodges within thee, and
thou abounds in all unrighteousness, thy sins are grown over thy head, and
with transgression thou art covered as with a garment, from the head to the
foot thou art corrupted, and there is much unsoundnesse in thee. O how does
pride abound, lightness and wantonness, and the lust of the eye, and all the
works of the flesh is increased to a large sum; Abundance of Idolatry and
vanity springs out of thee, vain fashions, foolish customs, and all manner of
evil has its abiding in thee; yea the very Seat of Satan is established
within thy walls, and works of unrighteousness does proceed out of thee into
other Nations. Abundance of deceitful Merchandise, and of oppressing
Merchants, who grind the face of the poor, does inhabit thy borders, thy ways
are evil in the sight of the Lord, and his spirit is grieved and his soul is
vexed from day to day, every moment of time.

Abundance of treachery, flattery and hypocrisy, dissimulation, and double
heartedness, posesseth thine Inhabitants, from Teachers to People, high and
low, rich and poor, you are fulfilling your own wills, and seeking your own
pleasures, and following the Counsels of your own hearts, and doing that which
is right in the sight of your own eyes; and your hearts are corrupted before
the Lord, and the very best of your works are evil, and the purest of your
ways are filthy. And all your Observations, your days of Humiliation, and
Thanksgivings, and all your worships and sacrafices, are abomination in the
sight of the Lord: For no good fruit can spring forth, for your root is not the
vine Christ Jesus, who cannot own the light, with which you are enlightened, and
that makes all your Profession vile, and not accepted, but it is wholly
unfruitful in the sight of the Lord. Much Profession there is in thee of
righteousness, and Religion, and many forms, and gatherings of people, which
are but as so many images, and likenesses of diverse sorts, which must be
overturned, and overthrown by the roots.

You are all measured with the line of true judgment, and your buildings
cannot stand, when the Lord comes to try you, and search, and try you for your
life, for though you profess much, yet you perform little, your knowledge
puffs you up, and you are not sincere hearted, but loose, and unsavory are you
in your ways and words. There Is much wisdom in thee, and many wise men whose
wisdom is devi^lish, and it does not lead to God, it must be confounded and
trodden down, for it profits you not in the sight of the Lord, but in it you
are wise to do cvill, but to do good you have no knowledge; And the Lord God
is forgotten, and his judgments are not known, vanity, vanity, has so stolen
away your hearts, and after Idols are you run, worshipping strange Gods, and
following strange lovers: Abundance of subtilty and craft lodges in thee,
vain glory excells above measure, pride, idleness; and fullness of bread
abounds in thee, even as in Sodom, unto whom thou art become equal in
transgression. Whoredom, drunkenness, wrath and envy, gluttony and excess,
spending the creation upon the lust, and all the works of the flesh which are
evil, has their full grouth in thee, and in evil art thou fully ripe.

O London! Consider, and be awakened ye Inhabitants thereof, for the Lord is
grieved day by day, and his soul is vexed every moment, the weight of thy
transgression is upon him, thou even make him to serve with thy sins; has
there been any evil committed by any Nation which is not in thee? has there
been any abomination brought forth, which is not in this day to be found in
thee? Oh what haughtiness, and stretched out necks! oh what pride, and vain
glory appears in thee, even thy Infants are nourished up in vanity, and thy old
men are overgrown with craft, and deceit; Thy young men gives their strength
to folly, and thy Maidens are trimd in wantonness: all sorts of People are
profane in their way, old and young, rich and poor, are abounding in evil,
all seeking their own things, and few the things of Gods Kingdom, the way of
truth is even despised, and they that depart from iniquity are become a prey to
the mouths of the ungodly, who are grievously profane, as though the Lord took
no notice, or as though no day of account were to come, so great is the
iniquity committed in thee, words reaches not to manifest it, what lying, what
swearing, what vain talking, and what scorning, and what double dealing
appears in thee at every corner, what pride, what wantonness, and wickedness
is manifest in all thy streets. Teachers and People are out of the way, given
to deceit, and to deceiving, oppressors, and oppressing one another, such is
the Devils power amongst you ruling, it cannot easily be overcome; and so deep
is wickedness seated in thee, that it cannot easily be plucked up; so strong
is the lust of the flesh grown in thee, that it cannot easily be removed: How
is the glorious name of the Lord continually dishonored, and polluted, through
thy wickedness, which is grown into a numberless sum. But the Lord will be
avenged on all you his enemies, and will meet you with judgments, plagues, and
vengeance, and the wicked shall not escape.

And as concerning all thy profession of God, and the Scriptures in a blind
zeal, it is but abomination to the Lord, and all thy several Sects, and
gatherings of people, and separate Congregations, who is not separated by the
Spirit of the Lord, they are but like so many molten and carved Images, which
the Lord will overthrow. All thy offerings and oblations, preaching praying,
and performances, Gods soul has no pleasure in them, but they are a burden
and weariness to him; and though thou wash thee never so clean, and make thy
self never so fair through thine own labor, yet cannot thy iniquities be
washed away, nor thy sin covered, for thy iniquities are marked before the
Lord, and thy sin is written as with a pen of iron, and as with the point of a
Diamond, all thy Steeple-house worship is naught but vanity before the Lord,
all thy public exercises, all thy Sabboath keeping, all thy set days of
humiliation, and all thy private duties, and all that ever thou performest unto
God, is not regarded of him, while the hearts of thy people is not aright in
his sight, and upright before him. So the best of thy Sacrafices are but as the
cutting off of a dogs neck, and the offering of Swines blood, for in thee is
found the great abomination, open profaneness abounds, and secret hypocrisy
super-abounds, and thou art as abominable in the eyes of the Lord in thy
hypocritical profession of righteousness, as thou art in thy open sins.

In thee is found the abomination of Israel, mercy and truth, justice and true
judgment is neglected: Do not thy Heads judge for reward? and do not thy
Priests preach for hire? and do not thy Prophets prophecy falsely? and do not
they divine for money? and do not thy People love to have these things so? Oh
how art thou deceived by thy Teachers, and led blind by the blind leaders, even
they that lead thee cause thee to err, and they that should instruct thee
teaches thee vain things. Woe unto them, the Lords wrath is against them? how
do they make a prey upon the people? how do they feed themselves, and cloth
themselves, each one of them having a quarter from which they seek their gain,
and through covetousness making Merchandise of souls; the false Prophets of
Israel was their example, and they follow in the path of unrighteo^usnesse,
having run and was never sent of God, and therefore the people are not profited
at all, nor turned to God, but from year to year, and time to time, ever
learning, but cannot come to the knowledge of the truth.

Ignorance abounds in thy old men, and rudeness, and wildness in thy youths,
and thy people are without the knowledge of God, and perishes for lack of
knowledge; thou art even as a wild untilled garden, which brings forth no
pleasant fruit, thy vines are as the vines of Sodem, and thy fruit is loathsome
to the Lords taste, wild grapes, and sour grapes is brought forth in thee,
which the Lord has no pleasure in, ye bring forth fruit unto your selves, and
not unto the Lord, ye kindle a fire, and warmes your selves with your own
sparks, ye sacrafice to your own net, and ye think to be heard for your much
babbling, and your many performances: Abundance of the first man's wisdom is
among you, it leads you, and guides you, and not the Spirit of God, and through
your own wisdom which is devilish you conform to the Saints words, and to
their practices in outward appearance, and makes your selves like the Saints,
and bows unto your own Images, and likenesses which ye make, and are grown
wise and full of knowledge, but it is not the wisdom of God, nor the knowledge
that will endure for ever, For you neglect the one thing which only needful
to eternal life. Your buildings are high, but they are not upon the true
foundation, for many of you stumbles at the corner stone; your sprinkling of
Infants is a very cheat, and all that believe therein are deceived; and your
singing of David's experiences in rhyme and meeter, is a very lie unto you; your
worship is but Idolatry, and it will not cover you in the day of the Lord,
though none be like unto thee O London in profession, nor any City hardly can
compare with thee, in respect of the Multitude of thy gathered assemblies, and
self-separates, yet all this will not avail thee, when the Lord searches thy
heart, which is found not perfect before the Lord, but full of vain glory, and
lust, and pleasures of the flesh, and dissimulation, and guile, with the wrath
of God will be revealed against; a single and an upright heart, is of greater
price with the Lord, then all the performances of selfe-righteousnesse that is
done in thee, while your hearts are given to vanity, and continue therein.

Wherefore O London, this is a Warning to thee, Let thy Inhabitants repent, the
dreadful day of the Lord is coming, I have heard the voice of war against
thee, and not of peace, the cry of howling, and bitter Lamentation, and not of
gladness, nor joy of heart, what will thou do in the day of thy visitation,
when the the Lord stretches forth his hand to smite thee, to whom will thou
flee, and where will thou be hid when the Lord shows himself thy Enemy, and
appears to take an accout of thee, what will become of all thy treasures, how
will thy vain glory become a stink, how will the days of thy mirth be turned
into grievous sorrow, in stead of thy pleasures, and delicacies, and mirth, and
wantonness, shall be sighing, and mourning, and woeful Lamentation, all thy
Gods shall not be able to deliver thee, nor all thy profession shall not
justify thee, nor all thy selfe-separating people shall not be able to stand
in the gap to stay the hand of the destroyer, none of thy carved Images shall
stay his fury, nor none of thy several Sects shall be a Mountain to hide
thee, when the Lord strips thee naked, and lays thee bare, and gives thee to
know what is in thy heart, which will come upon thee in a day not looked for.

Wherefore repent all sorts of people, and turn to the Lord if there may be
mercy found. Cease your wickedness ye wicked, and learn to live righteously.
Woe unto you drunkards. Woe unto you whoremongers. Woe unto you coveteous. Woe
unto you Liars, Swearers, and Scorners. Woe unto you dissemblers, and
deceitful dealers. Woe unto you proud, and vain glorious. Woe unto you
lustful people. The Lord will plead with you all, and give unto you the fruit
of doings, and reward according to your works; his hand shall not spare, nor
his eye shall not pity in the day that he comes to Judgment, when he takes
vengeance upon all the seed of cvill doers, and to pluck up the wild branches,
and to cast them into the fire. Sackcloath shall be put on instead of gay
Apparel, and all thy Idols shall vanish away; as for all thy profession,
where is it? all thy many Sermons, and long Prayers, what is become of them?
and all thy public and private duties, where are they? shall it be said, Ye
shall all know that there is a God that will execute judgment and justice, and
that will plead with all flesh, and in his sight shall no flesh be justified.

And all ye who thirsts for the Lord, and desires after the knowledge of his
ways, unto whom iniquity is a burden, by you desired to be freed from, who
have long sought the Lord, and have not yet found him, who have prayed, and had
no answer, and have been weary, and heavy laden, and found no rest: I say unto
you, Save your selves from this untoward generation, come ye out of these
abominations, that you may be delivered from the wrath; Fear ye the Lord, and
do not offend him in any thing, stand in awe, and transgress not, love
righteousness and truth, touch no unclean thing, and the Lord will receive you,
meddle not with their worships, nor bow not to their Images, nor sacrifice not
to their Idol gods, have no fellowship with them in their profaneness, nor yet
in their hypocrisy, but hearken ye to the voice of the Lord, that you may know
his judgments in your hearts, and his Law and Covenant established with you;
depart from all iniquity, and cast away all your Idols, and forsake all your
lovers. Give not your selves to the ways and pleasures of this world, but give
your selves to chastity, to soberness, and meekness, and above all things be
upright in heart toward God, and toward man, speak the truth one to another,
and let no guile dwell in your lips, nor a deceitful tongue in your mouth. And
cease from all vain glory, and vain customs, and fashions of the world,
which are evil.

And cease from all Men-teachers, which deceives the People by flattering
words, who cries peace when the Lord has not spoken peace, and daubes with
untempered Mortar, such has not profited you at all, but your souls are
starved under your Ministry, and leanness is upon you, though you ever learn
of them, yet you cannot come to the knowledge of the truth by them. Cease from
them all, and from all your gathered and selfe-separate Congregations, and
wait upon the Lord that you may know him to be your Teacher, who is the
Teacher of all his people, and he teaches in the perfect way of peace and
truth, and gives peace unto all that wait upon him, and causes the heart of
the upright to rejoice, he takes away sin, and removes it from his people, and
he forgiveth all their iniquities, and heals all their backslidings, and
blessed are all they that put their trust in him, for he is a God near at hand,
for he dwells in his people, and he is worshipped only in the Spirit, and in
the truth. He dwells not in Temples made with hands, neither is he worshipped
in outward observations, his soul has no pleasure among any selfe-separate
People, who cries I am holier then another, neither is he well pleased with a
Sacrafice of the proud; all their Baptismes, and Fellowships, and Meetings, is
but a weariness to the Lords soul, and he has no pleasure in any of their
works, who follows their own spirit, and are not led with the pure Spirit of
God alone, but unto every one of such will he look, who is poor in spirit, and
of a contrite heart, and of a single and upright mind, he gives regard unto
every one that fears his Name, who thirsts and hungers after him in truth and
righteousness, and this is of exceeding great prize in the sight of the Lord,
yea more then all offerings and oblations whatsoever, even more then thousands
of rames, and ten thousands of river of Oil. Therefore hearken diligently to
the voice of the Lord, and seek him with an upright heart, and thirst for him
as for your daily food, I ose not your precious time, but call upon his name
while he is near, for he is come near unto many; he stands at the door, if any
will open, he will come in, and will dwell with them for evermore.

All sorts of People be awakened, be awakened, how does the Lord wait to be
gracious unto you, he even tarries for you till you return to him, that his
soul may have pleasure in you, who has long been grieved by you. Therefore
search your own hearts, and see how you stand prepared to meet the Lord by
following of his Counsel, who has so loved you, and all man kind, that he
has given his Son into the world to be a light unto you all, and every one of
you is lightened by him, and with the light you will know your evil deeds, and
are convinced of them, and reproved for them, and with this Light Jesus Christ
calls you sinners to Repentance, to turn from your evils that you may be
restored.

If you love this Light, you love Christ, who will save you from all your sins,
and from condemnation: If you hate this Light you hate Christ, and you remain
in your sins to be everlastingly condemned. And thus is the way of life, and
the way of death set before you all: if you follow the light of Christ Jesus,
it will teach you to deny this world, and all the vanities of it, it will teach
you to deny your own wills, and the counsels of your own hearts, and
whatsoever is contrary to God in thought, word, or action, and in all things it
will teach to follow Jesus Christ, that you may be justified by him; But if you
follow not the light, then you choose your own ways to follow your own wills,
and your own lusts, and all temptations, and you deny Christ and the way of
truth, and so the wrath of God abides upon you, for you continue in unbelief,
and in hardness of heart, and are the servants of sin unto death, if you
follow not the light which Christ has enlightened you withal, who lights
every man that comes into the world, that they may believe and be saved.
Therefore take heed to the light, if you be guided by it, you shall not
transgress against God, but you will receive the power of God to overcome all
evil; all sin and iniquity will be condemned in you, and your hearts will be
made clean for the Lord to dwell in, whose dwelling is in his people, and you
must all cease from professing of what you do not posesse, and from talking of
what you do not enjoy, for that is hypocrifie, and to be judged. So all ye
Professors be awakened, Christ without you will not justify you, except ye
know Christ within you, the Profession of him will not take away sin, nor
justify in the sight of God, except you come to witness the operation of his
Spirit in you, and to teach you, from all evil, and into all good.

Therefore come to the feeling of the Spirit of Jesus in you, and the working
of it, which changes, renews, and sanctifies, and brings to witness the
same truth to be manifest in the heart, which the Scripture speaks of without;
and as you receive the same Spirit which gave forth the Scriptures, so you will
understand the Scriptures, and by no other means; For all your Preaching, and
talking of the Scriptures without the Spirit is but vain babbling, and that
mouth is to be stopped, for God is not known where the operation of his Spirit is
not felt in the heart, nor he cannot be worshipped in truth, but where his
Spirit leads and guides. Much vain Profession there is in thee O City, in which
the Lord has no delight: And this is the Testimony of the Lord which I give
concerning thee, and do yet once more call unto thee, as often I have done,
and do seal the Lords Testimony against thee, even against all thy
righteousness, and against all thy sin, which are both alike unto God, and
both to be condemned. Thou have been warned, and thy people, and the day of a
glorious Visitation has passed over thee, the Lord has reached unto many, and
striked many who have not grieved, but carelessly walked, and slighted the day
of their visitation, and have not hearkened to the Lords call, unto thousands
has the word of the Lord been declared, and the Kingdom of God preached nigh
at hand, and the very way of life and death has been set before you, for the
Lord has sent unto thee to warn thee, and to show unto thee what the Counsel
of the Lord is; and thousands have been reached with the power of God, and
convinced of the way of life and peace, who yet continues in hardness of heart,
and disobedience, following the counsel of their own heart, and the desire of
their own minds, which are wholly evil continually, and the condemnation of
such will be just in the day of the Lord, and greater then theirs to whom the
way of the Lord has not been known. And yet amongst thy thousands who are in
the way to destruction, the Lord has a remnant, a few among so many, which are
precious unto him, and whom his soul delights in, who are despised in thee,
and set at naught, and cast out of the favor of all men; yet is the Lords
presence amongst them, and his fear in their hearts, and his increase is unto
them, and his power with them, till all their enemies be vanished as a cloud,
for they are of the true seed, and of the true birth, which the Lord will
bless, though they be accounted as thy slaves, and bondmen, yet are they free
in the Lord; and this is the very fulfilling of thy wickedness, and the height
of the transgression of thy Rulers, Teachers and People, in that some of them
that fears the Lord, and walks with him are persecuted in thee, even they are
made a prey unto the wicked, to the slanderers, to the drunkards, to the
scorners, to unjust and cruel men, the people of the Lord are become a very
prey in thee, even as meat for the devourers. Oh what will thou do in the day
of thy visitation, when the righteous Judge numbers up these things against
thee? thystaffe shall fail thee, thy Physicians shall be of no value, and all
thy comforters shall be miserable at that day. I have truly considered thy
condition, and measured thy state, and I have often seriously weighed thy
wickedness, and pondered what would be the end thereof, and there is no vision
of peace unto thee, but even the day of desperate sorrow, a recompense for all
thy works from the hand of the Lord. I have often truly lamented thee, and
seriously has thy condition entered into my heart, thy iniquities have often
pressed my soul, and my Spirit has been grieved within me, when I have viewed
thy great abominations, and how thousands in thee wholly perish for lack of
knowledge, and even resists, and will not be instructed, despightfully using
such as does warn them, even loving and delighting in their abominations;
These things have often made my heart sad, who have walked in thee as a
stranger, and measured thee with the line of true judgment, and this is thy
height, and length, and depth, Iniquity lodges in thee, and Iniquity covers
thee, and Iniquity compasses thee about.

And this is a Warning to thee, from the Lord in faithfulness declared unto
thee, whether thou resist, or receive, and thus far I am clear of the Blood of
all men in thee, who seeks not any thing in thee for my self, but seeks,
and has often, to the Lord for thee, that thy people might know him, and
worship him alone, who gives unto them all good things, and has caused the
fullness of all good Creatures to abound, and has given plenty of all things,
abundance of which is spent vainly upon the lust, to the dishonor of God who
gives it; how much is vainly spent upon vanity in meats, and drinks, and
apparel? Its hard to be declared what abundance of the good creatures of God
is vainly destroyed in thee upon the lust in the excess, more then what
satisfies pure nature, your gluttony and high minds devoureth in abundance the
good creatures which God gives, and he is thereby grieved with you, who has
taken notice of this your sin, which is not the least of your transgressions,
and he will plead with you for it, even in all things great is your
wickedness, and the Lord has numbered it. And above all things that is done in
thee, thy deceitful profession and pretense of worship of God, is the Lord
most grieved with, who hates all your Meetings of gathered assemblies, which is
not gathered by his Spirit, he will confound your wisdom, and overthrow all
your buildings; Wherefore repent ye, and cease from Idols, and all Idolatry,
and cease for ever to warm your selves at your own sparks, for this shall you
have at the Lords hands, Ye shall lie down in sorrow.

A WARNING to you all sorts of People.
YE Merchants, and traders, and trafiquers, and all ye that buy and sell, be
plain and upright hearted, and lie not, swear not, dissemble not for gain
unto your selves, for that is cursed of the Lord, and the gain that is thereby
received; but speak the truth every man to his neighbor, flatter not such with
whom you deal by feigned words of guile, whilst secret overreaching lodges
in your hearts, to make a prey upon your neighbor or brother, for this is
evil in the sight of the Lord, but speak the truth in all things, and let your
yea be yea, and your nay nay, in all your common occasions, for whatsoever is
more is evil, and what is advantaged unto you through deceit, or lying, or
multitude of vain words, it shall be a curse unto you, and not a blessing unto
you, or to your children; let the truth guide you in all your dealings one with
another, and let the fear of God be in your hearts in all your enterprises at
Sea and Land. I warn you all, seek not by any evil means to enrich your
selves, neither oppress one another in any thing wherein you deal, for you
know not how long your time shall be upon earth, nor how soon the day of
account will come, wherein every word and every work shall be brought to
Judgment, yea for every idle word shall ye give an account, and all those
words are idle which are not spoken in the fear of the Lord, therefore live and
act in the fear of God, that you may be blessed in all that you do. And all ye
whom the Lord has blessed with riches and increase, see that you abuse not
that which God has blessed you withal, but in all things that it be used to
the glory of the Lord, and not wasted in excess upon the lust of your own
minds, for the creation is the Lords, and all things are given by him, and
taken away at his pleasure, and he makes rich, and he makes poor whomsoever
he will. Therefore every man be content with his own, and covet not one
another, nor defraud not one another to enrich your selves, for it is cursed
of the Lord.

And all ye handicrafts people, and laboring people, fear ye the Lord
continually, and use no deceit, nor craft, nor policy in what you do in
labor, seek not to blind men's eyes by fair outsides, neither to cozen and
cheat the simple by slighty work, but let the truth guide you, and that will
teach you to do for all men as you would they should do for you, and this is
acceptable in the sight of God; let your commodities be just and right, and let
all your labor be with a single heart, and do all things as in the sight of
the Lord, and then you cannot do evil if the fear of God be before your eyes,
and the evil in all things will be denied, and the corruption that is entered
into all callings and trades, will be judged out, and be examples one to
another of truth and righteousness and cozen not nor cheat not one another,
nor use not many words, nor vain gestures, but own the Lord to be your
Teacher, which will teach you truth to do it, and to speak it in all things.

And all ye young men, and Prentises, Learn ye the fear of the Lord, and take
heed of temptations, least ye be destroyed both soul and body by them; learn
not to dissemble, nor to defraud, nor take not instructions how to cozen and
cheat, but first seek the kingdom of God and its righteousness, and then all
outward things shall be added unto you. Give not your selves to any evil,
beware of Wine and Women, which steals away the hearts of many, give not your
selves to vanity, nor fulfill not the desire of your own minds in any thing,
covet not after riches, neither study how to be pround and vain glorious, give
not your selves to craft and humane policies, nor to deceive any people, but
fear God and keep his Commandments, and be subject to your Masters, and obey
them in all things that is good, and be dutiful to them in that which is just
and righteous, but deny them in whatsoever is evil: Learn not craft and policy
from them, neither whoredom, nor vice, nor drunkenness, nor cozenning, nor
any other thing which is evil, but rather reprove those things, then in the
least to follow them; and if you do the truth, and speak the truth in all
things, and keep your selves from whatsoever is evil, then will the Lord
bless you outwardly, and inwardly, and the knowledge of God will be your crown
in old age; and cease from all gamings, and vain sportings, and from all
wantonness, and vain pleasures, and from all the works of the flesh, for they
that follow such things shall neither prosper in this world, nor be blessed in
the world to come. Wherefore take heed unto your selves all ye that are young
in the world, be not overcome of evil, nor follow not evil devices, but stand
in awe continually, and offend not God, who gives you life, and health, and all
good things.

And all ye Masters and heads of Families, this is a Warning to you, be
examples of all good in your Families unto your children and servants, rule in
Authority in the fear of God, but not in tyranny, nor a rigorous mind, teach
and instruct in fear, and not in cruelty, give no bad example in pride, vain
glory, drunkenness, whoredom, dissimulation, nor any other thing, but stand
as a terror over all evil, and as encouragers of all good, bind not the
conscience of any under your power, curb sin only, and reprove not
righteousness; seek ye to be taught of God, and then may you instruct all
under you in his way; be pitiful toward your children, and servants, and
pass by offenses rather then punish them with cruelty, and make not a prey
upon your Servants to serve your own ends only, seeking your own good only
and not theirs, for such things are evil in the sight of God, and it is to be
condemned: Let no excess, neither let want, be in your Families, but that
which is honest and right, love that in all things, and follow it; let not your
anger and passion exceed when offense is given you, and do not correct in
cruelty, but in a good understanding, and walk in the truth, and fulfill the
will of God, and not your own, and this is of great prize and acceptable in the
sight of the Lord.

And all ye Tavern keepers, and Innkeepers, fear the Lord God, and oppress
not your guests neither feed the lust of any til they be drunk, for that is
cursed of God both in you and them, and that which he will be avenged of. Oh
great is that abomination among you, much of the good creatures is vainly and
wickedly spent, and abused in your dwellings, and your advantage stands in the
abuse of the creatures by excess, and the Lord is grieved with you because of
that.

And all sorts of People, rich and poor, high and low, Masters and Servants,
Parents and children, buyers and sellers, Trades men and laborers, Hearken to
the counsel of God, and seek to know his will to you in all things that you
may do it, in following all that which is good, and denying all that which is
evil, that your souls may live; Let not the Devil lead you, nor his
temptations overcome you in any thing, but resist him in whatsoever he would
lead you into which is against God and contrary to him.

Repent of all evil that ever you have acted, and let the Lord be your guide
that you may not utterly perish, and your City be destroyed for your sakes, the
Lords love is toward you, and he waits to be gracious unto you, and desires
your return, rather then your destruction, and would heal you if ye did wait
upon him, and would bless your City, and make you happy in it, if you do his
will, and deny your own.

I am a friend unto all your souls, and a publisher of peace, and of glad
tidings to all that thirst for the Lord, and he has given me to warn you of
all your Iniquities, and abominations to deny them, and of all that which is
good to follow it. And oh that ye knew in this your day the things which
belongs to your peace, which now ye may know, before they be totally hid from
your eyes, and there be no place for Repentance, nor time of returning, and
this day will come upon many, and they cannot escape it, who now hardens their
hearts against the way of your own peace, and even scorns to be reproved for
their transgression, and such my soul pitties who are going in the way of
destruction, and runs hastily into perdition; I have many times been made sad
by reason of such, when I have measured the condition of all people; upon my
bed, I have pondered what abomination was in thee, and what would be the end
thereof, and I have desired nothing so much, as that I might faithfully warn
thee, and free my self, and the Lord from the blood of all men; deep thoughts
have been upon me concerning what the counsel of the Lord is unto you all,
that I might manifest the truth, and discover the abominations, and I have not
spared to cry repentance unto sinners, that sinners might be converted, and
turn unto the Lord, and thus far I am clear of the blood of all men, and the
Lord is clear, and if the wicked perish, it is because of their unbelief, and
gainsaying of the Lord, and this is the Testimony that I give unto thee, and
unto all thy people, O London hearken, and consider this is the only day of
your visitation, and there is not another way to life, nor to escape
everlasting death, and destruction then that which the Lord has showed you,
Blessed is he that can receive it, and they that deny it does utterly perish
without mercy.

London the 15 of the 6 month, 1657. I am as a stranger among you, yet well
known to the Lord, and the Testimony of God concerning you shall stand for
ever; for it is true, and shall not be confounded, though the wicked reject it
to their own destruction.
FINIS.
