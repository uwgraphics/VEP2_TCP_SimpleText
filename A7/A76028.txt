ALEXEA Imperator;

HAVING, with very much regret, taken into our High and Imperial
Consideration, the sad and desperate Condition, into which the State of
Christendom is at present almost inevitably plunged, as well by the Divisions
of Princes, as by sub-Divisions and secret Discontents, which begin to break
forth between them and their Subjects; The Rebellion of England, as an
universal Contagion being become epidemicall, has poisoned and infected most
parts of Christendom: And likewise that that common Sower of all infand
wickedness, most falsely called the Parliament of England, with whom no Law of
God nor Man, Nature nor Nation escapes breaking, do at this present employ
their Agents, the Bustuaries of humane States, in all Kingdoms and Territories
of Europe; whose restless industry is to crack the bonds of Allegiance and
fealty between Subjects and their Sovereigns, by persuading the common People
(whose ears are ever greedy of novelties) of the Tirannie of Monarchy, and
insinuating delusive fancies of Liberty and Freedom, by which policy that
spurious generation (more degenerated then ever Nebuchadonoser was, not Men
into Beasts, but very Devils incarnate) hope to overwhelme the whole World
with an inundation of Blood and Confusion, to bury Monarchy in a common grave
of confused Anarchy, and establish their aepicene Government in a more fixed
orb of certain security: For prevention whereof, We have thought good to
propound such means as We judge convenient for the conservation of a general
Peace in all Christian Kingdoms, and reducing that Rebellious Nation to that
due obedience and fealty, which by undoubted Right and divine Ordination, they
owe to their Sovereign.

And now We know not whether it will more become Us to Declaime or Declare; so
monstrous is the nature of the Crime that gives present employment to Our
Royal Pen, that Our just indignation has put Us upon a strain, more bitter
then is suitable with the common Majesty of Our Imperial Style. For whereas,
about eight years since, some certain Lords and Commons that were assembled
by Royal edict in the Parliament of England, pretending (and as they then
alleged upon very good grounds) diverse fears and jealousies upon their Kings
departure from that his great Council; and refusing to hearken to their
wholesome advice, while he lent an indulgent ear to the Malignant Counsels of
diverse desperate Delinquents, whom his Majesty protected from the hand of
Justice, to the apparent hazard of the established Religion, the absolute
overthrow of the ancient and fundamental Laws of the Land; the irrecoverable
breach of the privilege of Parliament, and the final ruin of all his good
Subjects: For the defense and preservation whereof, and for no other ends, as
they then most falsely asserted, they were necessitated to take up Arms to
defend themselves from the fury of that mighty Host, which his Majesty had
raised for the accomplishment of those (as they scandalously termed them) his
destructive Designs; and they solemnly protested that they intended nothing
prejudicial to his Majesty or his Royal Issue, or the abatement of any of his
just Prerogatives: But in testimony of their Loyalty and tender affection to
him and his Issue, they published many fair and glorious Declarations, which
they confirmed by diverse Oaths, Covenants and Sacraments, that they did no
ways intend in the least to eclipse the splendour of his Majesty's Government,
but were faithfully resolved to make him the most great and glorious Prince in
Christendom; by which fair and plausible delusions they drew from the
credulous People vast and infinite sums of Money; begat a good understanding
in the opinion of Foreign Princes, and insinuated too far into the charity
of Our sacred judgment: Thus by fair and specious pretenses they deluded the
whole World, while, by policy and treachery more then valor, they had subdued
the Royal Army, overcome the whole Kingdom, and gotten the possession of his
Majesty's Person; whom, instead of making a glorious King, they reduced to the
condition of a miserable captive, hurrying him about from one prison to
another, not vouchsafing to hearken to any conditions of Peace, but such as
neither suited with the modesty of Subjects to ask, nor the Majesty of a King
to grant: And although the effects of Rebellion accompanied with prosperity
will prove strange and wonderful, even in the sense of common apprehensions;
yet beyond the imagination of man or expectation of Devils, that the souls of
mortal men instructed in the principles of Christianity should proceed to
such a gradation of wickedness as those most deperditely wicked miscreants
have lately done, who have found out a new method of Treason, so miraculously
proditorious, that the whole counsel of Devils could give them no direction
in, nor the Records of Hell afford a pattern; For, even in the time of a
Treaty, when they had plighted their faith and the whole Kingdoms for his
security; after he had enlarged his Royal benignity to such an extent of
gracious Concessions as the modesty of former Rebels did never presume to
crave, nor themselves could in reason expect; For, he had not only admitted
them to a copartnership, but for a certain time surrendered his whole Rule and
Royal Authority into their power; yet those sanguinolent Caitiffes whose
Lupine-fury could be satisfied with nothing but their Sovereigns blood,
ravished his sacred Person from his Court by an unruly crew of their armed
Janissaries, the off-fall and surfeit of that distempered Kingdom, in which
riotous crowd they brought him to a Bar in an unknown Court which themselves
had erected, where themselves, his Vassalls, became his Judges, who loading him
sufficiently with scorn and contempt, with faces worse then Luciferian,
dismissed him with a ghastly Sentence, which was executed not in a corner, but
in the light of the Sun, that all the World might take notice of it: For, on
a Scaffold which, in aggravation of his sorrow they had caused to be erected
at the entrance into his Royal Court, at their command by the common
Executioner that head was struck off, which the absolute Monarch of Heaven and
Earth had crowned with a diadem of Imperial Majesty; an act of that horrible
and prodigious nature, that it' cannot be effigiated and shaped forth to any
pattern, it being a prodition of such vast dimensions, monstrous latitude and
prodigious nature, that it wants an apt name; for never any Legist either
ancient or modern that ever made or writ of any Laws has left any name to
posterity which might be adaequate sufficient to express it.

The judgment of the Law in all Nations affirms it Treason, not to be
expiated save by death, but to imagine or contr^ve the death of a King, though
a Usurper or Tyrant; but this viperous brood whose breath is slaughter and
destruction, have not only imagined or contrived, but really acted the Murder
of a lawful King as unpattern'd in his virtues, as themselves are in their
vices, whose universal endowments of grace and nature, as well as his
deputation, justly rendered him a terrestrial deity; for, he was the perfect
Model of all contracted virtues, the blessing of his age, the pleasure of
mankind, the exaltation of nature, the Diamond in the Ring of the Monarchs of
the Earth, the Miracle of the Christian, and the mark and scope of the heathen
World; wherefore to have assassinated him by the hand of a Raviliack, had been
a supergra^uate sin; but to execute him publicly, as a common Malefactor,
was the marrow and spirits of the mystery of Iniquity, so exorbitant,
outrageous and portentuous a Treason, that the prodigies of lost humanity could
not have acted it worse; the blackest that ever the Sun looked upon, the most
cursed and infamous that ever was accounted in any Calendar of time; for, in so
many thousand years, from the fall of the Reprobate Angels, it never came
into the head of any Devil, to suggest, to the heart of any man, before this
time, so nefarious, patricidous, and flegitonticall a wickedness as this was.

And having sent the father into the other World, through a Red Sea of his own
precious blood, that they might manifest themselves to be the very offspring
of the Devil, the falsest Sinons and Impostors that ever studied or put in
practice the Art of delusion, with whom no bond of Alliance, Allegiance, Oath,
or Sacrament can stand firm, if they list to dissolve it: They have proscribed
his eldest son, their present Sovereign, with the Duke his brother, and by a
pretended Law, which to that purpose they have enacted, have made him, or any
of the Royal Family, for ever incapable of exercising the Kingly Government in
any of those Kingdoms; And by the same Act, have made it absolutely Lawful,
with an assurance of a reward, for any one that shall Murder the young King,
and the Duke his brother, as Traitors, Spies, and Enemies to that
Commonwealth; And having swallowed a plentiful hope of an eternal fruition
of their usurped Dominion, they have broken the Diadem of State, seized upon
the Regalia to their own benefit, put to sale the ornament and furniture of
the Royal Household, divided the Crown Revenues among themselves and their
adherents, overthrown the fundamental Government of those Kingdoms, from a
well-composed Monarchy, to a confused-Anarchy; and reduced the Subjects thereof
from a glorious condition of perfect freedom, to a far worse then
Aegyptiacall bondage: Nor will the free possession of one Kingdom satiate
their ambitious appetites; but that they may stretch forth their Tyranny into
Foreign parts, they have landed an Host of ravenous Wolves, or rather
incarnate Devils, in Ireland, who have out-gone the most barbarous Heathens,
in bloody Massacres, not sparing whole Cities and Towns; but, without respect
of Age or Sex, wheresoever they come, give free scope to the merciless fury of
their uncurbed Swords; Nor are those a Abaddons and Apollions, these destroyers
of nature and mankind, sensible of so small a tincture of grace as to blush at,
or palliate their unprecedented outrages; but with the faces of Sodom and
Gomorah, do publish and patronage their unmatchable Villainies, and seek to
persuade the whole World of the Justice and Legallity of their unparralelled,
regicide, and heterogeneous Government.

Now whereas it is the Office of Princes to execute Justice and Judgment, and
to punish Vice and subdue Rebellion; We have thought it our Duty both to God
and Man, to vindicate the cause of the late Murdered King of Great Britain,
and restore his exiled son to the possession of his Thrones, in Triumph and
Majesty: And for as much as all Christian Princes are equally concerned in this
Cause with Us; We have thought good to invite them to a general Diet; Which
we desire may be convoked at Antwerp in the Dukedom of Brabant; where, upon
the tenth of April, in the year of Grace 1650. Plenepotentiaries may meet
from all Emperors, Kings, and Princes that profess Christianity; where a
general and holy League being coucluded, and all ancient and private Quarrels
laid aside, We may all agree to fight under one Banner; that there a set
Model may be concluded on and drawn up, wherein every Prince shall bear a
proportionable share, in raising and maintaining a great numerous Army, in
which the whole Forces of Christendom shall be united in prosecution of this
second holy War, wherewith we will Invade that Kingdom both by Sea and
Land; faithfully resolving never to desert this just and honorable Engagement,
till (by the blessing of God) We have subdued that People to the obedience of
their Sovereign, and restored that injured King to the quiet possession of his
undoubted Rights: And for as much as the inexorable malice of those unmatchable
Rebels, extends to the general Ruin of Father, Son, and whole Famelie; so
the extent of our Justice shall range to the utter extirpation and irradication
of them, their wives, children and allies; and an absolute deletion of their
names and memories: But if Chronicles shall entail any of their prodigious Acts
to ensuing Ages, their dreadful destruction shall be therewith Recorded; that
Posterity may be as well afrighted and amazed at the punishment, as
progression of their Rebellion: And for the better encouragement of this
honorable enterprise, being the common Cause of abused Sovereignty; We are
pleased of our own Royal benignity, besides our proportionable contribution
to the general charge, to raise and maintain ten thousand well experienced
Soldiers, both Horse and Foot, and furnish them with a Train of Artillery,
and all necessary habiliments of War, out of our proper Treasury.

And for as much as examples are the most compendious teachers, and perfect
illustrations; We have thought it convenient to signify to the World, how
far We have expanded Our just indignation against that Rebellious People:
For, by Our special Decree, which We have caused to be Proclaimed throughout
all Our Dominions; We have commanded all Englishmen by a certain day to depart
our Empires, notwithstanding all former grants, licenses and Acts of
naturalization; and after that day We have forbid all Trade and Commerce with
that Nation, prohibiting any one of that Nation, upon any occasion, how urgent
soever, upon pain of High Treason, to remain in any part of Our Empire or
other Dominions: And if any shall presume, after that aforesaid day
notwithstanding this Our Decree, to stay in any part of Our Dominions, that
they be forthwith executed as Spies and Traitors: Provided always, that the
Penalty of this Decree extend not to any who either are, or hereafter shall be
employed in any of our Territories from the King of Great Britain: And We
desire that all Kings and Princes of Christendom would herein follow Our Royal
example; That as those unmatchable Rebels have out-gone all other Nations in
their sin; so they may in their sufferings in becoming an offscouring and
abomination to mankind. And We do solemnly protest Our self to be an
eternal friend to the King of Great Britain and his friends; and an
irreconciliable foe to his enemies.

Given at Our Court, at Mosco, the 20. of September 1649.
