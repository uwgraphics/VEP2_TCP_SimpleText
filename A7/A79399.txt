Charles R.

WHereas diverse Scandalous Untruths and Treasonable Assertions against OUR
Person and Government have heretofore been Annually dispersed, under pretense
of Predicting and Prognosticating future Events, in several Books commonly
called Almanacks and Prognostications: OUR Will and Pleasure is, That no
Almanacks or Prognostications, or any other Books of that nature, under what
Name or Title soever, be Printed, Published or Dispersed, within OUR Kingdom
of ENGLAND and Dominion of WALES, but such as shall be first Perused, Approved
of, and Licenced by OUR Trusty and Wel-beloved GEORGE WHARTON Esquire: And that
all Writers of Almanacks and Prognostications, Printers, Booksellers, and
other Persons whatsoever herein concerned, do take special Notice of, and pay
Obedience to this OUR Royal Command, as they will answer the contrary at their
peril.

Given at OUR Court at White Hall the 25. day of September, in the 12. Year of
OUR Reign. By His Majesty's Command. Edw: Nicholas.
