An Advertisement to the Reader.
THis ensuing Catalogue presents it self to view with a double scope, an
intimation and a request: The former gives to understand a purpose to set forth
in an entire Work the scattered Pieces of that famous Divine, Mr. Hugh
Broughton, a man rarely learned in the Originals, excellent in the clear
handling of darkest passages in the Holy Scripture, of closest meaning, eminent
in his generation. It presents what by careful Wel-wishers to the truest
knowledge and Public good has been preserved in sinister times from
perishing in obscurity. This facilitates the request; That if Pieces to perfect
what is defective, or add to the whole be in private hands, they will be
pleased not to envy them to the Public, and to light his Candle, which without
their charge shall shine to themselves brighter. Nor shall this candide
goodness be coucealed, that they may reap the good name of faithful
Treasurers and liberal Stewards. Please they therefore to repair to Mr. George
Thomason at the Rose and Crown in Paul's Churchyard London, they shall find a
further assurance not to fail of serious performance to answer their pious
Expectations.
