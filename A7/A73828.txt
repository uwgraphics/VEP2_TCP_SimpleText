A delicate new Ditty composed upon the Posie of a Ring being, I fancy none but
thee alone: sent as a New years Gift by a Lover to his Sweetheart.
To the tune Dulcina.


THou who art so sweet a creature,
that above all earthly joy
I thee deem for thy rare feature,
kill me not by seeming coy,
nor be thou mute,
when this my suit
Into thy ears by love is blown,
but say by me,
as I by thee:
I fancy none but thee alone.
Had thou Cupids mothers beauty,
and Dianaes chaste desires,
Think on that which is thy duty,
to fulfill what love requires,
it is love I ask,
and it is thy task
to be propitious to my moan,
for still I say,
and will for aye,
I fancy none but thee alone.
Let not self-conceit ore-sway thee,
woman was at first ordained,
To serve man, though I obey thee,
being by loves law constrained,
my sobs and tears,
true witness bears,
of my hearts grief and heavy moan,
let not thy frown
then me cast down,
who fancies none but thee alone.
Think what promise thou did give me,
when I first did thee behold,
There thou vow'dst thou would not leave me,
for a mass of Indian gold.
but now I find
thou art unkind,
all former vows are past and gone,
yet once again,
him entertain,
who fancies none but thee alone.
Let my true affections move thee,
to commiserate my pain,
If thou knew'st how dear I love thee,
sure thou would love him again:
I thee affect:
and more respect
thy welfare then I do mine own:
lot this move thee
to pity me,
who fancies none but thee alone.
Why should women be obdurate.
and men's proffers thus despise?
Dear, be ruled, we will have a Curate,
nuptial rites to solemnize:
thou Marigold,
whose leaves unfold,
when Tytanes rays reflect thereon,
on thee I Will shine,
for thou art mine,
I fancy none but thee alone.
The second part. Or, the Maidens kind Reply.
To the same Tune.


Dear, I have received thy token,
and with it thy faithful love,
Prithee let no more be spoken,
I to thee will constant prove,
do not despair,
nor live in care,
for her who vows to be thine own,
though I seem strange,
I will not change,
I fancy none but thee alone.
Think not that I will forgo thee,
though I Am absent from thy sight,
If I knew how to come to thee:
I Would be with thee day and night,
But well thou know,
how I am crossed,
else should my love to thee be shown,
with free accord,
yet take my word,
I fancy none but thee alone.
This proverb has often been used,
She that is bound, must needs obey,
And thou see how I Am inclused,
from thy presence night and day,
I dare not show
what love I owe
to thee, for fear it should be known,
yet still my mind,
shall be inclinde,
To fancy none but thee alone.
Though my body for season,
be absent from thee perforce,
Yet I pray thee judge with reason,
that I love thee nere the worse.
Oh that I might
enjoy thy sight,
then should my love to thee be shown,
then do not think,
her love te shrink,
who fancies none but thee alone.
Many times I think upon thee,
in my melancholy fits,
When I find my self kept from thee,
it depriues me of my wits:
often times I weep,
when other sleep.
producing many a grievous groan,
then think on me,
as I on thee,
and fancy none but thee alone.
No fastidious motions m^^^e me,
to be from thy sight so long.
Do not then (my dear) reprove me,
nor suspect I do thee w^ong:
For be thou sure,
I do endure,
in constancy surpast by none:
I long to see
the time that we,
shall of two bodies be made one.
FINIS.
