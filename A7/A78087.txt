BY virtue of several Ordinances of Parliament, authorizing the Committee of
the Militia of London and Liberties thereof, for the better strengthening and
assisting of the Trained bands and Auxiliaries thereunto belonging; The said
Committee have lately appointed several Commanders of Horse (whose Names are
underwritten) for the defense of the King, Parliament and City, according to
the solemn League and Covenant; And whosoever will bring in Horse, Arms, (or
pay Riders to be Listed under any of them) or ready Money, or subscribe to pay
so much a week (to continue three Months) toward the payment of the said
Commanders, and other necessary occasions incident thereunto, it will be
accounted by the said Committee of the Militia a very acceptable service, and
conduce much to the Ends aforesaid, in these times of imminent danger: And the
Deputy and Common-councell-men in their several Limits and Precincts, are
desired to do their utmost endeavor to further this work; and to make return
thereof forthwith to the Treasurers and others who sit for this purpose in the
Irish-Court in Guildhall. Dated the Fifth of August, 1648.

Signed in the Name and by the warrant of the Committed of the Militia of
London, By Adam Banckes Clerk to the said Committee.
