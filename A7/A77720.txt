A VINDICATION OF THE CHRISTIAN QUAKERS, FROM THE Malicious Insinuations, in a
late PAMPHLET, said to be Signed on their Behalf by D.S.
WHEREAS there is a Scandalous and Malicious Libel, or Pamphlet, lately
Published, Entitled, An Answer to several Passages, Citations, or Charges, in
a late Book of F. Bugg's, Styled, New Rome Arraigned, etc. and said to be given
forth, and Signed in Behalf of the Christian Quakers, without any Name, but
only the Letters, D. S. to it. We, who are of that Christian People, called
Quakers, and have walked in Society with them for many Years, do hereby
declare, That the said Pamphlet was not written by any, that had Direction or
Leave from us, or any in Unity with, or owned, by us, or any Meeting of ours;
but that it is a mere Trick put upon us, by some Malicious Adversary, to
Misrepresent and Abuse us, under pretense of Writing on our Behalf; and that we
are thereby greatly Wronged, and very injuriously Dealt with: Of which we think
fit to give this Public Notice, that none, for want of due Information, may be
Misled by that Pamphlet into an ill Opinion of us. For we sincerely declare,
That we do firmly believe all Things recorded in the Holy Scriptures, which we
acknowledge to have been given forth by Divine Inspiration: And we do utterly
deny and disown all Doctrines contrary thereunto, however Misrepresented by our
Adversaries.

In witness whereof, we do for our selves, and our Friends and Brethren, in
Scorn called Quakers, hereunto set our Names, subscribing our selves, as in
Truth we are, well Wishers to all Men.
