His Majesty's second Message to the Parliament, concerning Sir John Hothams
Refusal to give His MAJESTY Entrance into His Town of HULL.
WE are so much concerned in the undutifull affront (an indignity all Our good
Subjects must disdain in Our behalf) We received from Sir John Hotham at Hull,
that We are impatient till We receive Justice from you; and are compelled to
call again for an Answer, being confident (however you would be so careful,
(though without Our consent) to put a Garrison into that Our Town, to secure it
and Our Magazine against any attempt of the Papists) that you never intended to
dispose and maintain it against Us your Sovereign: Therefore We require you
forthwith (for the Business will admit no delay) That you take some speedy
course, that Our said Town and Magazine be immediately delivered up unto Us,
and that such severe exemplary proceedings be against those persons (who have
offered Us this insupportable affront and injury) as by the Law is provided:
And till this be done, We shall intend no Business whatsoever (other then the
Business of Ireland) For if We are brought into a Condition so much worse then
any of Our Subjects, that whilst you all enjoy your Privileges, and may not
have your Possessions disturbed, or your Titles questioned, We only may be
spoiled, thrown out of Our Towns, and Our goods taken from Us; it is time to
examine how We have lost those Privileges, and to try all possible Ways, by
the help of God, The Law of the Land, and The affection of Our good Subjects,
to recover them, and vindicate Our Self from those Injuries. And if We shall
miscarry herein, We shall be the first Prince of this Kingdom that has done
so; having no other end, but to defend The true Protestant Profession, The Law
of the Land, and The Liberty of the Subject: And God so deal with Us, as We
continue in those Resolutions.

Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1642.
