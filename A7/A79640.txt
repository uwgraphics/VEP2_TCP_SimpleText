A Friends Advice. In an excellent Ditty, concering the variable changes in
this World.
To a pleasant new Tune.


WHat if a day or a month or a year,
crown thy delights,
With a thousand wished contentings?
Cannot the chance of a night or an hour
cross thy delights,
with as many sad tormentings?
Fortunes in their fairest birth,
are but blossoms dying,
Wanton pleasures doting mirth,
are but shadows flying:
All our joys are but toys,
idle thoughts deceiving,
None has power of an hour,
in our lives be reading.
What if a smile, or a beck, or a look,
Feed thy fond thoughts
with many a sweet conceiving?
May not that smile, or that beck, or that look
tell thee as well
they are but vain deceiving?
Why should beauty be so proud,
in things of no surmounting?
All her wealth is but a shroud,
of a rich accounting:
Then in this repose no bliss,
which is so vain and idle:
Beauties flowers have their hours,
time does hold the bridle.
What if the world with allures of her wealth
Raise thy degree
to a place of high advancing?
May not the world by a check of that wealth,
put thee again
to a low despiced chancing?
Whilst the sun of wealth does shine,
thou shall have friends plenty,
But come want, then they repine,
not one abides of twenty,
Wealth and Friends holds and ends,
all your fortunes rise and fall,
Up and down rise and frown,
certain is no state at all.
What if a grief, or a strain, or a fit,
Pinch thee with pain,
or the feeling pangs of sickness?
Does not that gripe or that strein or that fit,
Show thee the form
of thy own true perfect likeness?
Health is but a glimpse of joy
subject to all changes,
Mirth is but a silly toy,
which mishap estranges,
Tell me then, silly man,
why art thou so weak of wit,
As to be in jeoperdy,
when thou may in quiet sit?
Then if all this have declared thine amiss
take it from me
as a gentle friendly warning;
If thou refuse, and good council abuse,
Thou may hereafter
dearly buy thy learning:
All is hazard that we have,
there is nothing biding,
Days of pleasure are like streams,
through fair Meddowe^ bliding
Wealth or woe, time does go,
there is no returning*
Secret fates guide our ^tates,
both in mirth and m^urning.
The second Part, to the same Tune


Man's but a blast, or a smoke, or a cloud,
That in a thought
or a moment is dispersed:
Life's but a span, or a tale, or a word
that in a trice,
on sudden is rehearsed:
Hopes are changed* and thoughts are crossed,
Will nor skill prevails
Though we laugh and live at ease,
change of thoughts assayleth,
Though a while fortune smile,
and her comforts frowneth,
Yet at length fails her strength,
and in fine she frowneth.
Thus are the joys of a year in an hour,
and of a month,
in a moment quite expired,
But in the night with the word of a noise,
crossed by the day,
of an ease our hearts desired:
Fairest blossoms soonest fade,
withered foul and rotten,
And through grief our greatest joys
quickly are forgotten:
Seek not then (mortal men)
earthly fleeting pleasure,
But with pain strive to gain
heavenly lasting treasure.
Earth to the world, as a man to the earth,
has but a point,
and a point is so^^ defaced:
Flesh to the soul as a flower to the Sun,
that in a storm
or a tempest is disgraced:
Fortune may the body please,
which is only carnal*
But it will the ^oul disease,
that is still immortal,
Earthly joys are but toys,
to the souls election,
Worldly grace does deface,
man's divine perfection.
Fleshly delight to the earth that is flesheth*
may be the cause,
of a thousand sweet contentings;
But the defaults of a fleshly desire,
brings to the soul
many thousand sad tormentings:
Be not proud presumptuous man,
since thou art a point so base,
Of the least and lowest Element:
which has least and lowest place:
Mark thy fate and thy state,
which is only earth and dust*
And as grass, which alas
shortly surely perish must.
Let not the hopes of an earthly desire,
bar thee the joys
of an earnest contentation,
Nor let thy eye on the world be so sixth,
to hinder thy heart
from unfeigned recantation:
Be not backward in that course,
that may bring thy soul delight,
Though another way may seem
far more pleasant to thy sight;
Do not go, if he says no,
That knows the secrets of thy mind,
Follow this thou shall not miss
an endless happiness to find.
FINIS.
