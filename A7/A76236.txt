Written For the sake of those who wants the Consolation of Israel, and would
walk in the HEAVENLY WAY thereof, if they knew it.

Written by one of Zyons Travellors, Th. Bayles.

Freindly Reader,
IT is the manner of Mariners sailing in unknown places and discovering
dangerous Rocks sands, or shoules, and being delivered from the danger thereof;
To procure buys or beacons to be placed upon them as warnings and marks to
them who afterward shall have occasion to sail that way that they may also
escape the dangers thereof. And this is but to preserve the outward life with
ship and goods which are all at best but temporal: how much more is it
needful for those who have travayled the way of Regeneration and have
discovered the many dangers that are in that way to give notice thereof to
those that are willing to travayle in that way that so they may escape the
shipwreck of their immortal Souls. And indeed many are the perils hazards and
dangers that such meet withal, sometimes in danger of being deceived and
beguiled; sometimes of being affrighted and dismayed and so disheartened and
turned back again when they have made some progress; and at other times of
being made over confident and presumptious of their skill and understanding and
of being made to think they are at their jorneys end when they have made very
small progress therein.

All which his Author as an experienced Travellor in Zyons Narrow way has set
forth, as he and many more has found it; that so all that have a mind and
earnest desire to travel that way, may be assisted with warning and good
information at every turning, and at last may be content to cease from all
falce guides and from there own reason and imaginations, and from their own
strength and wisdom, and may lay hold of that sure giude that God in his
infinite love has appointed to lead all simple and upright souls to rest by.
And therefore whoever thou art that shall read this Treatise do it seriously
and consideratly, and then shall thou see as in a glass where thy present
state is, and if thou find thy self on the righthand or on the left to be
erred from the certain way of life; wait thou for the compassionate
visitations of thy souls inward friend, the faithful and true witness of god
in thy conscience; and he will call thee back into the right way, and lead thee
in the midst of the paths of Judgments until at length thou arrives at that
haven of rest to thy immortal soul, which will answer all thy labor,
trials, travells and exercises that thou may meet withal: and if this
description of the way and the difficultys thereof do prove any help and
benefit to thee; then the Author and I have our desire, and let god have the
glory to whom alone it does belong he being the Fountain of good to all that
diligently seek him.

S. C.

THere was a man seated in a goodly place, fitted with all things needful for
a happy life, he being inconsiderate of his ways and doeings and of the event
thereof, in the time of his youth frequented the vanities of the world, and the
idle pleasures of it; whilst this man was in the participation of them, and
running on therein from one thing to another; there was one which beheld his
doeings, who was greived in him self to see the man so deceived; in great
compassion and tenderness (aiming at his deliverance) waited when he might
vissit him, and afford his help: And so it came to pass, that the man being in
the cool of the day, in some kind of recollection from his labor, and the
cumber of it, in the heart searching word of his own eternal power and
goodness, this compassionate one said unto him: Where art thou? and left him
(as far as he perceived then) to ruminate there on: the man knew not who it
was, that in this inquireing word spoke unto him, or from whence the voice
came, being a great stranger and unaquainted therewith, although he dwelt near
unto him: but such was the secret authority and force thereof, that some
entrance was made thereby in to his mind; so that he was sitting down to
consider of that which had happend unto him, and whilst he was getting into the
consideration thereof; One, having too much interrest in him and easy access,
said: Let not distrustful thoughts and vexing fear have place within thee,
for all is well enough; if thou look about thee, thou shall see that there is
no cause for them; hereupon the man rowsed him self, as if he would have
thereby discharged his heart, of that sorrow and grief, which so lately had
assailed him, and so said, he would not bow under he knew not what or be
dismayed thereby: and so returned to his beloved enjoyments again, and did
rejoice, as if all had been well with him; Now this man, as one whose heart was
whole, proceeded on according to the counsel and secret insinuations of his
deceiving freinde who by reason of his near habitation unto him, counted him
his neighbor, and did not perceive the snares which was laid for him, and
afterward did appear, or that there was any at all; so near and close did his
heart comply thereto: But his tender and compassionate neighbor, saw that his
feet went downward to death, and steps to take hold on hell, he (as at the
first) waited to show his love unto him, and the lifting up the light of his
countenance; and in his own time said, If thou do evil sin lies at the
door; which visitation came more near to the man (as he thought) entering as a
shaft into his liver, which although he strove much to pull it out, yet in no
wise could he do it, nor get a remedy, or relieve him felf of the smart
thereof; but after all his pains and careful labor to quit him self (still
the stroke remained as a burden, and incureable) and he could see no way for
that, by all the undertakeings and attempts which he could do; and now began
the burden of his thoughts and the perplexity thereby, so that he often
feared the displeasure of the Lord would breakforth upon him by reason of them,
even whilst he was young and tender in years, and has at diverse times said
in the sense of the evil thereof, in the words of the Prophet: How long should
vain thoughts lodge with in him: as finding them too burthersom and heavy for
him to bear, and bring into subjection, and as that which alone was the work
of his sufficient grace, although then he knew not that, or what it was, or
where.

Thus he groaned in him self and said, what is the matter with me, and why am I
so of ten troubled, and in my trouble fear exceedingly, and in my fear to
have torment; O! said his beloved neighbor (for he whose voice made this
inquiring in him, he looked upon him as his enemy, and had not a thought that
he that wounded, did it that he might heal) Come come, see thy neighbors and
acquaintance, they are merry men, and they refresh them selves (thou see) and
be jocund together; come drinck of there cup, and eat of their dish, that a
melancholy spirit may not come over thee, and thou go drooping up and down,
until thou makes thy self ridiculous unto them, and rob thy self of the
comfort of thy life, what would thou have? behold thy possessions, may thou
not compare with them, what want thou, or what would thou have?

The man was afraid, and knew not well what was the matter with him, but as it
afterward appeared, the conscience of him stirred in him, and there by his
peace was broken, which he had in the freindship of this world, which is
enmity against God; he could not swallow his sweet bits as formerly, but was
therein persued to his astonishment: and his pleasures become burdensome unto
him; then he said, he knew not how to live there, and therefore would go to his
neighbors habitations, and take of their mirth and pleasure, and refresh
himself in their company, and castforth (thereby) the trouble that was in his
mind, (for there the man's greiffe and trouble was) so he went and took of of
their cup, that thereby he might wash down his sorrow (as he hoped) and other
essays he made, which are abounding in the world to divert him from his
trouble, and endeavored to talk at any rate, that he might be deliverd and be
quiet.

By this time the man might have perceived, that when God visit man for his
iniquity, he makes his beauty to consume as a moth; for his face begone to
gather paleness, and his endeavors proved vain; for he could not get rid of
this searching inquiring voice which had visited him, it would be sounding in
his ears, and persuing him, and often in the midst of his laughter, sorrow
would arise, and fill his heart, so that sometimes he was ready to throw of all
his companions, and to bid adieu to his idle pleasures and passtimes, and then
would hang down his head.

And heaviness of spirit (like a tallent of lead) ready to sinck him, would
come over him as if he should have been swallowed up thereby: but still he knew
not the hand that persued him, neither did he care for acquainting himself with
it, he looked upon it as his enemy, he could not hope for deliverance from
that, which wounded him, for he saw no freindlyness in it; and he would have
bin at ease, and enjoye his frolicks (as his neighbors did) and not have bin
so afflicted as he was; but he that smot him, still did smit him, and his peace
which was broaken, seemed as if it had bin quite removed from him.

Now on the other hand he that had enticed him to the drawing his mind out
into worldly vanities, and the unprofitablenes thereof; and thereby drawn him
from Remembering his Creator in the days of his youth, before the evil days
come, where in he could say he had no pleasure, he I say continued his
insinuations and flatteries, seeking by all ways and means of his own to
dawb the man up, and that answerable to the desires of his own heart; for when
he was wounded and afflicted, so that what ever he put his hand unto,
visitations of sorrow and disquietnes arose in him; he said unto him, well, if
sin do ly at thydoor, at whose door does it not, have not all sined, and all
fallen short, why can thou not be content, and quiet thy self. The Prophets
they prophesied of a savior to come, and thou have read that he came, believe
thou that; they are the elect that believe in him, believe thy self to be one
of them, and apply the promises, and it will be well with thee; all must carry
about them so long as they are in this world a body of sin (thou knows) thou
will be rid of that when thou comes to die, and rid of all these legal fears
and frights of mind, which now thou give way unto, and readily receive into
thy mind, and from whence things proceeds, and lies in thy way, (for which
there is no cause or reason) to greive and offend thee; do thou believe the
promises (they are many and large) and that Christ dyed for thee, then all will
be well: do thou see thy neighbors, thy acquaintance, thy friends, they do not
acquaint them selves, with such petyfull fears as thou entertaines, nor with
such needless distracting doubts and questionings; and it concerns them as well
as thou, to see that they lay hold of their savior, and his merits; although
they perplex not themselves to their own wounding, and make their lives
uncomfortable, as thou do: Thus strove the adversary to hold the man in the
deceivablenes of his own unrighteousnes, that so he might have withstood the
visitations of the Lord, until there had been noe remedy: who had visited him
by his gentile reproofs, that his heart might bow before him and in the sense
of his evil, have humbled his soul before his holy throne in great contrition
of Spirit, but notwithstanding the favor of the Lord thus appearing for him,
he submitted not unto him, but sought out to him self many inventions, thereby
to have been delivered: And so the man he would go read the scriptures, as he
saw others did (for he began to think of Religion) and see to get some good
promises into his mind, to comfort and satisfy him felf with all; and thought
that if he could make out him self to be one of Gods elect, one in whom his
soul delighted; and one whom the Lord took care of and did sustain by
watching over him, and leading him by his eye, in the wey of the blessing, and
sure mercies of the Lord; that then he might sometimes enjoy him self with his
friends and neighbors, (after which there was a secret working in his mind)
which he could not then part with all; not having learnd the daily cross) and
might partake of their cups and neighbourly freindships; for the man did take
notice that some of them would sometimes be talking of Religion, of Christ's
ordinances and Christian duties, and such good things; and the other (which
they absented not them selves from) he thought would be good fellowship, good
neighborhood and the maintaining good society with them; and many he saw
esteemed them so to be; and then he should not be judged (by them) as a man
singular, or of a morose temper, and frowardly inclined; so tumbled over the
scriptures forward and backward, like those who searched the Scriptures (as
since he understood) but would not come to Jesus that they might have life; to
see for some comfortable places to stay himself upon, or thereby to relieve him
self, upon so great an occasion, as he in his distress desired; and amongst
many good things recorded there, concerning the Lords dear and tender love to
mankind in Jesus Christ, calling unto him to forsake the evil, and to cleave
to the good, and much more; and that then he would soon confound his foes, and
give him an inheritance in the promised land of blessings: And he also took
notice how that David cried out and mourned long (as well as he) and of Jobs
affliction and Paul's bewaileing him self, and saying o wretched man that I am;
and others, which he took notice of in that his inquisition; here upon he
concluded that he must not be to curiouss, or nice in that his search, he
might in so doing (for ought he knew) tempt God, and be distrustful of his
Saviors merits; and some he saw cautioned thus in their preachings; and some
told him, (whom he acquainted him self with for advice, which he sought after)
that although it be said, that those who are born of God (or are Gods elect)
they sin not, that is (said they,) they sin not willingly, or constantly, as
reprobates and wicked men do, but with reluctancie; and it was to keep them
humble in their own eyes, God saw it good to be so, or elce man would be puffed
up in spiritual pride, and grow forgetful of Gods mercies, and wax wanton,
and careless in an easefull Spirit; so then thought he, its as well with me (it
may be) as with others; as is my state, such is there then, only they lived
over a distrustful and perplexing spirit, which he gave way unto, and must be
content, it must be so (he thought) he could not help it; so endeavored
(according to the practice of the world) to disesteem or slight him that smot
him, as judging him not his friend at all, but his enemy; and as some thing
starting in his mind (like an idle dream) to fright him, and to stir up doubts
and questionings in him, concerning his salvation, and obtaining the Love of
God in Jesus Christ, then that he through and by that, should at last come to
attain thereunto.

For by this time he had heard so much, (by the report that was thereof in the
world, and by his searching of the Scriptures) concerning death and judgment,
salvation and damnation; that he thought, that if he was not one of the elect,
and so besaved, know and inherit the joys of the blessed, and ransomed of the
Lord, that then he must be in a woeful and wretched state in deed; for he had
heard and read, that hell was a place (and did believe it to be so) of endless
torment, endless pain and misery; burning with fire and brimstone, and that
the fire should never go out, or be extinguished, nor the worm die or the damned
come to an end of their torment; as at a time, hearing of one in a despayring
condition, he with others visited her who amongst other things she said; O that
the Lord had preserved me, as he has preserved you, but I am sealed down under
damnation for ever, were it to be but for a hundred thousand years, there
would then be hopes of an end, but it is (said she) for ever, for ever.

The man he thought them happy, which knew the right way, or way of salvation,
and did believe that there was one, although he did not understand it, or know
where, or which it was; for there was many ways which he heard, and took
notice of; Men crying up one while one, and crying down at another; and crying
down one another for them; which verifyed that saying, that there is away that
seems right to a man; but David said: I have chosen the way of truth, and
here by he could not attain at any certainty, or come to an assurance, or
infalibilitie of judgment amongst them; now he had read of a perfect and
everlasting way, but saw not him self in it, neither could he find it, for he
saw men believing at a large rate, and applying promises in a strange way,
which he could not understand (by what knowledge he had attained to) by reading
the scriptures, or his own condition, to have been the foot steps of the
ancient travelers, in the way of Syons salvation, which is redeemed with
Judgment; here upon he sought more strictly to inquier in to religion, and to
take a more seriouss observation thereof, by considernig those who so much
seemed the promotion of it; and he found them in astrange contradiction and
contrariety; One crying lo here, another lo there, that he knew not how to
resolve, or come at any certainty, or where to center himself, in so great a
concern, as the salvation of his soul was; for he was for that, namely the
real and infalible salvation of it; or elce, if he could not come thiter, he
should not esteem of religion and salvation, so much talked of up and down in
the world, more then afiction or a dream which is deceiveable; the talk
thereof, according to the custom of the world, he had proved, and must know it
saved, or naught would be of advantage and satisfaction unto him. Here upon he
said, that he saw no reason why he should order himself by other men's Methods
and Prescriptions; and the rather, because he had read (as well as proved them
void of answering to his necessitouss state) that he must give an account for
him self, and that to a vain thought, and idle word, as well as for
transgressions of greatest evils; and that none could answer for his brother,
and he had a desire (it was so with him) that he might give his account with
joy, and receive the heavenly blessed reception, Well don good and faithful
servant... enter into thy Masters joy.

Afther this he thought with him self to make trial, and to search into the
matter, very strictly, as he could, or should be able; for the voice of the
awackening Word of the Lord, and the entrance of it in his heart he felt, and
the disquietings it wrought there; peace he would gladly have had, but it fled
from him, and in stead thereof astonishments, and perplexities; and he was as a
wounded heart, which fearfully fled to escape its wounding, even whilst she
carried them along with her; for the more he strove for releife, the farther
off it seemed to be removed from him.

Some did reflect upon his actions, and him accounted as a fool, and lightly
esteemed they him, because they saw his visage Marring, and that he had not
that fellowship or friendly society with them, as formerly; seeming to be a man
disrespecting that, rather then eagerly persuing of it, or rejoiceing in it, as
some times before he had don; some again thought he was mad, or would be
distracted, or some thing of evil would happen unto him, and be his ruin: so
that their acceptance or esteem of him, was, as if he became a burden or
load unto them, and not a joy or delight; thus his wonted friends seemed to
frown upon his frequenting their societies, accounting his life madness, and
that his end would be with out honor.

Well, the man's greiffe remained, and his sorrows did not abate, hestill as
one overwhellming in them, would try and prove, if at last he might arrive at a
place of content; therefore sought he after means, which might be effectual
to him, and that of the best, that was to be had, at least wise according to
his own Judgment, for he desired Judgment, and understanding, that they might
be as the guirdle of his loins, and that he might not go on with fools, for
then he thought he might miss of a cure, and not be better by all his travels,
and pains; for fools perished for want of knowledge, and the heart with out it
could not be good.

Now there was some what held forth in those days as a comfortable way of
releife, for some that had been wounded, or afflicted, and a physician of good
experience reported of, which had choice medicines, of rare virtues and
operations, for such distempers as his was (as some said) who had like occasion
and made use thereof: whereupon the Man (as glad to hear thereof) applies him
self (upon their report) and makes his essay, and enters upon the applycation:
and at first trial, there seemed a hope, and from thence a joy, as if some
good effect would have succeeded, but continuing his applycations, his hope,
and with it his joy they abated; so that the Man grew as heartless as
comfortless: almost dispayreing of releife; and sitting down in his sorrow and
in his grief, as one at his wits end, alone by him self; it enterd into his
mind to visit a people near adjoining, and hoped that thereby might be
administered satisfaction and such releife as his soul stood in so great want
off, and the man was so well pleased with the motion, which inclined him there
unto, that he was ready to resolve with himself, that he should go amongst
Angels; such was the persent affection of his mind unto them, and therefore
endeavored to qualify himself accordingly, and to fashion himself what he
could with gravity, sobriety and seriousnes, which he inclined after and sought
to be such a one indeed, that hypocrisy might not have place in him, as a
thing which he always desired, he might not be defiled with, Judging that it
must like wise be so, or their society would not admit of him, to partake with
them in their holy fellowship, and that good order, which he thought, yea and
concluded, was amongst them, but so it happened unto him, that in a short space
of time, after his friendly visiting of them, their Nakedness and his own
disapointment appeared; and he saw them to be with out eyesalve, and as men
groaping in the dark, and night of ignorance, where the occasion of stumbling
and falling is.

And thus still was the Man left with his wound, and the greiffe of it, with
out releife: and Just was it with the Lord, and his great mercy unto him that
it should be so, and he left with out redress, seenig he sought in the wrong
place, and endeavored to enter into the holy rest of the Lord, at the door
which he had not set open to him; and left him disapointed because his eye was
a broad at man for help, which ought to have bin turned inward, that the Lord
might have brought nere his own salvation, by his own right arm and have
given him an inheritance therein, which alone could answer unto the necessity
of his soul, and the great want that he was in.

So that being well sencible of his not attaining unto the salvation of his
soul, there upon he retireing to sit down as forsaken and comfortless, his
deceiving enemy pretending freindship and good will, said, retire thy self from
their feliowships and societies, and take thee to thy secret closet, its a more
probable way for thy releife; read the Scriptures, apply what thou read with
diligence, pray earnestly, refresh thy self sometimes amongst those that can
discourse and reason about religion, and pine not away in solitariness, through
vexatious sorrow.

For by this time the man could have been glad of any hole or by corner of the
earth, to have bewailed himself (although he concealed his grief what he
could) and there was a harkning to the advice, and frequenting reading and
meditation, applying promises, and praying morning and evening, and could not
well let that pass at any time least there should have been neglect of duty,
growing into remissnes, and a waxing worse and worse, until hardness of heart
should have entered, and all Religion ben shut up thereby and extinguished.

And here the man leaned a while, being in some hopes of releife, he was ready
upon all his essays to promise that to him self, as well as to propound it
upon his undertakings; and now he was ready (although it proved but as a reed
of Egypt) to hope he was not so bad, or in such a desperate state, as he before
was in; but that his greiffe and sorrow was abated, and that he enjoyed some
satisfaction in his mind, which before now he was in so great distress for
want of; thus he was willing to hope for him self, for he was got under some
good duties, and godly practices, and so hoped, that the Lord would look
mercifully upon him, for Christ Jesus sake, and give him some of the necessary
releife, which he had read some had received at the Lords hands, in the time of
there need and distress.

And thus for some little season of time proceeded the man, thinking him self
some body; the thought him self now not as this man and that man was; and that
he had escaped that bondage and servility, of hanging upon other men, as many
did or as pinning his faith upon others sleeves (as men was usd to say) and
would compare him self (for information sake) with others, and say; surely it
is better with me now then they, for he accounted that he had some what of his
own to rely upon, and rest him self with all, but as he was thus resolving he
began a gain to remember his former visitation, and the sorrow and grief it
brought with it, and did occasion; so that he said, is this my hope also cut
of, and does my joy abate again, and am I still short of such an effect as I
have sought after for to enjoy?

For he had labourd to enjoy acure to be made inwardly of a secret wound in his
heart; and had sought after means to effect it, even by all ways and means
that he could be acquainted with, or seek out him self, both rising up and
lying down: and has not been wanting of careful thoughts, and all endeavors
imaginable, that so he might attain unto deliverance, which he had been and
still was in so great need of; but all availed nothing, nor naught that he was
seeking by could reach the wound and make releife; then said he in groaning
wise; O! that he knew of a physician that were able to give remedy unto him,
and that he could gladly endure a corrosive, that so he might be healed.

Now he was thus groaning and sithing forth himself; in his sorrowful state,
being alone and having no eye, mind or desire after any outward help or
deliverance, having tried all ways and means (as a foresaid) that he could
think of or imagine, and being at times affected with this kind of way, as
feeling then some thing of satisfaction and rest of mind, to fly or glaunce
through him; he at this time was again visited in the opening word of the
Lord, by his tender and composionate friend, although he had not an eye as yet
to look upon him so to be, nor a heart so to esteem of him: it being strange
(or not at all) to be considered off by him, that he that did wound and kill,
should do it thereby to heal and make a live, yet he in the movings of his
dear tender and everlasting loveing kindness said thy destruction is of thy
self, thy help is in me: then the man thought there might be help still, but
the deceiver he secretly wrought thus; whence come this, knows thou whence it
comes, or whither it will? give not way to a fancy, a dream, slying through
thine imagination, thou know not whither; least thou build castles in the
air (as men use to speak) and thou be left at last to fall, not having a
foundation.

Thus the man hurried to and again, knew not what to do; willing he was to have
releife, glad he should be to receive comfort; a savior cried he for, and
desireous was to have, but knew not where to find him; in want and destress,
anguish and perplexity he was; these things abounded in him; what should he do,
to whom should he speak, or call to, or cry unto; or by what have might he have
hopes, and find releife; he found all as miserable comforters, and none that
could tell him where his beloved was; or whilst he said tell me, could answer:
if thou know not, get the forth by the steps of the flock, and feed thy kids
by the tents of the shepherds.

He had read much (and talked sometimes) of a feast of fatt things which the
Lord would make; he wished and desired, such hunger was in his soul, with
desire of spirit, that he knew where it was, and might at last come to eat
thereof, or at least wise get some crumbs of it, that would be better to him
then that pineing woeful state that he was in, and be more hopeful of
affording some redress in his necessity.

What help had not he tried and sought after to enjoy, that so he might know a
release from his perplexities? Men he had tried, and their writings (many)
read, had made diligent search and inquiry into their lives, their deeds and
conversations, wherein their face was religiouss? and he found not thereby him
whom he desired: and marvelling at the sight of some, whom he cast upon an eye
of observation; they seemed to be heart whole, and merry, without such heart
smart as he felt, until he was ready to murmer in him self for and because of
their prosperity; and he hoped at some times, that they might have been
physicians of worth to him, by the long profession, that they would beseemed,
or thought to have made in Zyons ways, which not withstanding were ready to
over look him in his adversities; as one whom they had no bowels of compassion
for, and passed by, as one whose miseries they had no fellow feeling of; so
could not see them skillful enough, nor of that profissiencie, (after all their
noise and great stir in the profession of Religion,) as to speak a word in due
season, to a man afflicted as he was.

And upon this he was confirmed in his former resolve, concerning them, that he
saw noe reason, why he should lean upon them for help, for he found no
stabilities in their goings, or found judgment whence counsel and advice
should proceed; or that they were established on a rock, or come to the
munition of rocks, (the center of the righteouss in all ages and generations)
but were as men treading in slipperie places, and seemed to be tottering, and
as ready to fall, although not in their own eyes.

Then he desired to retire again, and thought in him self so to do, from any
hope or expectation of succor from them, and chouse rather a solitary place to
mourn in; esteeming him self increasing in his perplexities, rather then the
enjoying, or having reason to hope for an abatement of them; and concluded
that vain was the help of man, why should he desire it: for he met with naught
but disapointments and vexation whilst he sought after them, and said: O that
the time were come! spoken of and borne witness unto by the Prophets, that the
Lord would be teacher him self, and write his Law in the heart, that man might
cease from man, for where in was he to be esteemed: the more solicitouss was he
in these his desires, because so often had he been perplexed whilst his ear
was open, or heart seeking after them for help: and because he had read
concerning the Lord, and his teaching, by those who had attained formerly unto
it, thus: What teacher is like unto him? by which it seemed unto him, as if
there was none like unto him, and therefore none to be desired but him alone;
and he thought and did believe that such a state would be blessed, for then he
should sit under his own vine, and no man should make him afraid, which he
longed for to enjoy.

But again he was ready to fear and not to believe, that that should be in
his day, or whilst he lived, for he did see little or none appearance for hope
of it, although some believed that such a time should be, because they
believed, that those Prophets, which wrote, of such a thing were true Prophets,
but not yet (said some) afterward it will be, but not at present; but this
could not answer the man neither, he wanted at present, being in present want,
through his present grief, and afterward was too tediouss, like unto a man
that must perish through hunger, if he did not attain unto releife, by getting
bread; and it would be a vain thing to say unto such a one, next year or
afterward there will be bread enough, although now, none: whilst he was ready
to starve and famish for want of it.

And those who puts the day of the Lord a far of, and that says he defers his
comeing, woe is unto such (as says the Scripture) and they are of those who so
believe, who was rather for a little more ease to the flesh, and a little more
of the sleep of the night, and of the darkness thereof, wherein the fashions of
this world and the diverse lusts and vanities thereof are, rather then to be
such, as breaths for the glory of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, to
cover the earth, as the waters does the sea.

So that the man said, O! that he knew the Lord, and his way, and his will, he
would then obey him, and walk therein; and said, Lead me o Lord in the way
everlasting (which is righteouss in thy sight) that I may feel of the joy of
thy salvation. For the way in which he was, was croocked and perverse, and he
in it filled with lamentation, and mourning and woe, and would therein end (he
feared) if he helped not: and he had heard that there was a way which was right
in the eyes of the Lord, and that the Lord could bring alone to the knowledge of
it, and lead there in.

Thus breathed the man before the Lord, and unto him, and frequented
solitariness and lonelynes, and loved consideration, and hoped for Judgment and
understanding, that he might know and do aright, and serve the Lord with an
upright heart; continuing in his addresses before him: Oh that he knew the
Lord, and his way and his will, that he might order his conversation a right
before him, and enjoy the light of his countenance lifted up upon him.

For by this time he had got a notion of a light, or that there was such a
thing: given of God to man kind, but had not an understanding of it, or where
it was, or the way of it, or its work and operation in man's heart; but thought
them happy that did walk in the light of the Lord, and he would at times talk
of such a thing, and of great matters (which in the Light of the Lord he
beheld) far above his then state and condition; and please him self therewith
for a while; but there being no root of life in them, nor proceeding from the
effectual working of the light in him, but at most from a flash or glaunce
thereof which might appear unto him at some times, to let him see, but did not
possess; they vanished away, and every pleasant picture of his by little and
little was defaced, and his images struck at, were shattered, and tumbled
down, which he had had at some times some hopes in and comforted him self by
reason of their pleasantness, which to him seemed in them.

He had many inventions, desires and imaginations suggested into his mind, by
the old flattering deceiver, who had before this got a seat in his heart; but
notwithstanding all his insinuations and false promises, thereby to hold the
man in the snares and darkness of his own kingdom; he the compassionate one,
visit him in his tender love, and would not suffer his wound to be falsely
healed, or dawbed over deceitfully; so as he could not get rid of the smart and
the wounding, which made him often times to cry out, of the emptiness and
unprofitablenes of all his former ways and courses, as being weary of them, to
this compassionate one; yet not knowing him, or that he was so near unto him,
or ready to help him, as afterward (when understanding had opened his heart,
and the eye of his mind) he saw him to be; but contrary wise, looked upon him
to be far off removed, in the heavens, he knew not where, but as men said,
above the skies, at a distance and far remote; well, he thought that at the
last salvation must come to his house from or by him, or elce he must never be
saved, and how to tarry for it (for he was in present necessitouss want) he
knew not, and that occasioned the earnestnes of his labor after it, being in a
hunger, which could not be sustaind with out it.

So continued he in the persuit thereof, by reading, by meditation, and loved
to hear the conference thereof, and satisfied himself to be silent at such
times, hat he might prove and try thereby; but was not yet submitted in his
heart, to wait upon the Lord, that his arm alone might be salvation to him:
therefore to his old ways and courses, and then thought him felf again in a
pretty good way, always propounding to him self, the knowledge of the Lord and
his way, which if he could attain thereunto, and find out of by his search
and inquiry, that then he would obey him, by walkeing according thereunto.

Now on a certain day, in a retirement by him self, he takes a bible into his
hands, and it was done in a kind of wearyness of all his former labors and
persuits after the knowledge of the Lord, and at his opening of it, his eye
fell upon a place (without seeking for it) which he had not acquainted him self
with (that he remembered) before, and it was this the Lord is in his holy
Temple, let all the earth keep silence before him; he fixed his eye upon the
words as fast as he could, even with great earnestness, as accounting it
pertinent to his purpose, and that thereby there might be a door opened of hope
or direction for understanding, which he had sought for, for ought that he then
knew, and seemed to be as answering to his present state and condition;
whereupon he entered into the consultation concerning it, and that according to
the best of his skill or judgment; that there by he might find out the matter,
and arrive at such an effect (namely a resting place for his weary soul) as he
had long been searching after; but ahlas, it shortly proved to be a leaning to
his own, and not to the Lords help and assistance, for he took the way of the
many foolish builders, and unprofitable talkers; for he would be at work
still, a busy part acting in his mind (as Nimrod, the mighty Hunter before
te Lord) not comeing back to the voice behind him, or to learn, be still and
know that I am God.

But this was the way he went in, to consider the text and the chapter and
whole Prophesy; and to open the word, and fetch forth the meaning, and the
interpretation thereof: not contenting him self to be still, to wait to feel
the Lords counsel and direction, and his presence and teaching, and the
silenceing of the earth before him.

And indeed the man, as yet (although he delighted at some times to be talking
thereof) had learnd little, if ought of that, so as to abide there; yet he
thought with him self, that there were many offering to their own nett, and
burning insence to their own yarn, but few that leaned upon the Lord, or that
looked at him alone, as he began now to thinck that he did.

Thus having for some time exercised his wits about the words, and marvelling
at the providence that had cast them before his eyes, he thought with him self
now to be some body indeed, for that he did not cumber him self with wearysome
and teadiouss labors, as formerly he had don, whilst he was runnig a broad,
after men, their notions and conceptions, and with which he saw many inwrapped
and lamentably in bondage.

But whilst he thus concluded concerning himself, he was like one in a dream of
eateing and drincking, and of having good and needful refreshment thereby;
but soon he awakes, and instead of being fed and nourished, he feels pinching
want, and wasting hunger to consume him, as if thereby he should be destroyed.

Such was his case, for pawseing a little, and acquainting him self with
consideration, in a kind of repose or silence, which he had got the notion of,
and did at some times feel some real motion and inclination thereunto; the
compassionate one, which waited to do him good, brought him back again, by
his inquiring word, which remained within him, to his state and condition, and
to the showing of him that, and to the feeling the wound, and the smart
thereof, which formerly was made, when it was said unto him; Where art thou?
and he began to since and lament, and to wish for a hand or that hand, which
could relieve him, marvelling with in him self, that so great and continued a
greiff and trouble should seize upon him, upon the occasion of them, or that
thereby should be occasioned so incureable a greiffe as was in him, and under
which he had so many years groaned.

Thus as yet he kissed not the rod with the which he was smitten, nor yet did
hear it, and him who appointed it; nor submitted to the hand of him that
afflicted him; he thought still that his enemy, which broke his peace, and in
the midst of his mirth and jollity, ministered sorrow and disconsolation to him.

He had heard of the pleasant name of a Savior, who had given his life a
ransom for all men, and was willing to be ransomed and saved by him, according
to the conceptions or belief which men had of the way thereof in the world;
but to be made like unto him whom men gave vinegar and gall to drinck, as those
were who said, as he is, even so are we in this world, this no: not to toutch
witch him in his sufferings; he had read of his resurrection and of his crown
of glory, he liked well that to enjoy, he being arisen out of his suffering
state, into his fathers glory; but the learn of him, to the taking up the
daily cross, the crucifying to the world, and the affections and lusts of it;
the being made conformable unto the death, and the bearing about in the body
the dyings of the Lord Jesus, this was not in his thoughts; the other, the
other; the right hand of God where are pleasures for ever more, that he looked
for, and a river the streams where of makes glad the City of God; and had not
a thought or expectation to the contrary; although it be said, that I come not
to send peace on the earth but a sword; and if you be without correction
whereof all are partakers, then are you bastards and not sons; that that and
such things should be his from the Lord, and yet the dawning or breaking forth
of the Light of the glorious day of Christ's comeing was upon him, in which he
could say he had no pleasure.

For his vain expectations failed, and his peace fled far from him; the more
he sought or desired after it; and his state the more miserable; no releife, no
comfort, no help, nor none, nor nothing to rely upon: but on the contrary,
daily woundings and astonishments; so that he was ready to despair of being
releived, and to be an astonishment unto him self; succor there was none, nor
help, every thing which might have efforded him of that kind, was fled from
him; or so imbitterd, that nothing availed they to his refreshment, so that ha
was more ready to hide him self from the eyes of all men, in a secret cave or
rock in the earth, thath there he might have ended his days in mourning and
weepeing, then to have remained in the glory greatness and wisdom of this
world, without the inheritance of him, whom his soul had so long searched
after.

But this could not do neither, nor none to him, nor naught remained, wherein
he had hopes to obtain releife by; his hope as to that was gone, and his former
lovers remained as gall and bitterness unto him; knowledge that vanished away,
and experiences (which he formerly at times thought had been good, and
beneficial unto him,) proved void and empty; and him self left in his wound,
more then ever; in his smart, in his blood, and none to pity him, or to show
redress unto him; then said he, I will lift up mine eyes unto thee, o thou that
dwell in the heavens; O that thou would lead me in the way which is
everlasting, that my poor afflicted and destressed soul may have a hideing
place, a place of rest to ly down in, with the flocks of thy companions.

But loath he was to turn to him that smot him, as yet he had not learnd that.
Neither did he thinck that that was don by him who would at last be salvation
to him. So estranged is man's heart natuarly from the Lord, and to have faith
and belief in him: his eye was a broad (like the fools) in the corners of the
earth, and in the dark places thereof he sought for a habitation of quietness:
but the Lord frustrated all those devices of his, that he might show unto him
the vanity of his way, and the vexation by it; and bring him at last to wait
upon him for his salvation; who has said, look unto me all ye ends of the
earth and be saved.

Thus strove the old deceiver thereby to keep the man from bowing unto the
Lord, and to stand at a distance, feed on, believe in, or give way to any thing
rather then to him that afflicted him; and whose hand was come near unto him
to chastise him for his iniquity, and to deliver him through obedience, and
submission to his will, from the evil of his own heart: and thus wrought the
compassionate one whose compassions failed not, and waited to be graciouss unto
the Man (that his mind might be turned inward, and home again, to the Fathers
house, and the mantions of it; to know the holy Temple, and the Lord in it; and
the earth to keep silence before him; and the City of the King, and the King in
his Throne, and the Tower of David, and their glory strength and protection;
which now he stood in alienation to, and astranger; in a desolate place of
Dragons; with out a wall, in the open feilds: and in this perplexed desolation,
liable and in danger to be preyed upon by the beasts thereof, who said unto
him; return unto me; the Man ready to answer who art thou, but the subtle one
(whose Depths of Satan he had not known) by his easy access (as aforesaid)
hastily steps in, to save his kingdom and stronghold in the man's heart, said
unto him, to whom; return unto me, to what; do thou know? thereby to divert
the man's mind, from a farther search and inquiry into the matter, or of
acquainting him self with him whose voice utterd it self in the earth; and
said, what would thou be better then every one, or one of those that say to
his neighbor, stand off, I am more holy then thou.... Thus industriouss this
deceiver was, to hold his kingdom, standing armed to defend his house, and keep
his goods in peace, as afterward the man understood, when he was thereunto in
lightened, by the light shineing out of darkness, which before he was with out
knodlege of.

Now the compassionate one ceased not to show him self, and great kindness unto
the man, who had harkned to the counsel and direction of a deceiver, an enemy,
but masked, and pretending freindship: and met with disapointments and
frustrations, in what ever he put forth his hand unto, in answer unto the
motions of the deceiver for releife, and that which the man seemed to have of
wisdom, knowledge and understanding, of faith, hope and experience, and of such
good things, waxed old, vanished away and were come to an end (as has been
said) so that he thought him self as comfortless and as poor as Job was, for by
the light of him that searched his heart, he saw he was empty and voyed, but of
a nature and spirit, froward and perverse rather to tempt him (as Jobs wife) to
curse God, then to live as he did: that was the truth of his then state and
condition, as for dying, he would have been glad of that, and did rather seek
it then otherwise, and thought that thereby he should be at quiet, and at rest;
and that then an end would have been, of all his woeful afflictions, but as
for cursing of God, he was afraid of that, of the thing which would be very
wicked and provocking, and he knew him self to be wretched and miserable, and
it was Gods goodness and mercy, which perserved him from it.

But through all and much more then has been said, he could not flee or make
escape from the hand of him that smott him; no city of refuge (although he
sought for such a one) could he find: but smitings still came upon him, and
afflicted and tossed he was, not comforted; rather to despair of releife, then
knowing where to address him self for it; for all ways and means, men and
Judgments, that his wit could thinck of, or any ways conceive, might prove
advantagiouss to him; had he been inquisitive into, and proving; if at last he
might attain unto the beloved of his soul; but men failed, men of note and
learning failed; men of account and esteem, for experience, for sanctity, for
great abilities and endowments failed; Ordinances, (which men cried up, and
made so much a do about, crying down one another, and wearying them selves in
a labyrinth of perplexities thereby) failed; self righteousness failed;
disapointments came over all expectations; faith vanished away, hope-failed;
and that which remained to the Man (more then ever) was his infirmity, his
wound, his burden; so that he renewed his murning, his Lamentation, and said:
Is there any sorrow like unto my sorrow? and wished that he knew a physician, a
physician indeed, which could relieve him, and unburthen his soul, and give
him an inheritance with the sanctified ones? with the called, and faithful and
chosen in Jesus Christ.

For so he had read, that there had been such, and that they inherited
substance walking in the Light, as he is in the Light: but that which he
inherited, was sorrow was mourning, was lamentation; and knew not a place,
where on to lay his head in peace; being in darkness, a place of desolation.

Thus he, as one over whellmed in sorrow, and one, whom the Lord had hedged up
his way with thorns; in his deep mourning groaned forth his great misery,
which the compassionate one made a time of love; and seeing every releife,
succor, hope and help of his own failed, extended of his own dear succor
and releife; even he who kills and makes alive; I have wounded thee, that I may
heal thee: and there is none other God and Savior, which can do this, which
broke the man, and in which breaking still knew not what to do: being ready to
say in the sight of his own woeful state, how can I escape destruction.

And here may be remembered the case once of a people of old time called my
people, who being in Egypt and greatly oppressed by the taskmasters who were
set over them to afflict them, there God moved with compassion, to releife
them, sent his servant Moses, to Pharaoh King of their great oppressions
saying, Let my people go: who got passage through great Judgments, wrought by
a mighty hand and an outstretched arm; but their enemies soon persued after
them, so that great destress and fear came upon them, because of the persuings
of their enemies behind, and because of the sea, which was before, and
unpassable hills on either side: and in this their Jeopardy of destruction: the
servant of the Lord said unto them; Stand still and see the salvation of the
Lord.

Which passages, let all consider who breaths after the salvation of the Lord,
without which nothing can prosper their souls, or give unto them satisfaction
unto life; and that with seriousnes humillitie and due regard, as unto that
which affore time has been written (for the sake of those, who afterward
should come to beleve in him whom God has sent a light into the world) to be
fullfilled, in the fullfilling of which as they shall stand still, in Gods due
time and way, his salvation shall be known, and that beyond what formerly they
could have believed, or hoped for.

And the man giveing him self up to be a little quiet, from all his former
attempts and strivings after his own deliverance, (by which none has ever
come to know Gods salvation) here in he seemed as if he would have thrown him
self upon the goodness and mercy of the Lord; and feelt him self in a little
inward satisfaction and tranquillity of mind, beyond what before he had
enjoyed, whilst in those teadiouss-wearisom labors and travells, he had been
seeking by, to have come to a resting place for his soul; And so somewhat
enterd him concerning a still voice, which utterd it self ofttimes in his
hearing in the earth, which the world was ignorant of, and which the wisdom of
this world stood always in contradiction unto, and was alienated from, in
which was more (as to those that obeyed, or dilligently hearkened thereunto) as
to inward tranquillity and peace of mind; then was, in all the strength
knowledge and understanding that was enjoyed, or could so be in the world, by
the men thereof, in all there acquirings or industriouss labors therein: and
there by all men were filled with vanity and vexation of spirit (in due time to
be revealed in them) who cumbred them selves there with, or there in were
persuing after the knowledge of the Lord; for the mean time they (as well as him
self had don) forsook the physician of true vallue, and forsook their own
mercies; which (he said) he hoped now to a bide and continue with for ever.

But nevertheless, so it came to pass, that in a short time, and suddenly the
old subtle adversary (for by this time the man had cause enough so to look
upon him to be) he with his cunning craftines (as of old) draws his mind,
from the holy visitation of his compassionate friend, which had received and
believed, as conduceing to his satisfaction; so that instead of settling down,
in heart and mind, into the holy operation of it, thereby to feel his
deliverance, he steals away his heart therefrom, and begets him into a
boasting, and exalting spirit, to talk of that his enjoyment; and thereby to a
loss he came, and an abatement of the supply thereby, which he had some hopes
of, whilst it manifested it self unto him, and he joining him self thereto, for
its assistance and releife.

And being made destitute thereof, by so doing, more then a knowledge in his
brain and vain boasting; he soon felt the former misery to revive, which
made him to groan within him self: as one, like unto a ship tossed in the
troubled sea by the restless waves thereof, without a rudder, and in danger of
perishing every moment.

This made the man to recollect him self, whereby he saw not that subjection,
fear and humility in his heart, which he was inclined to, by the former
visitation: nor him self persecuteing that former desire of his, of casting
himself upon the goodness and mercy of the Lord, that so he might know a
settlement, in a habitation of quietness and peace.

And begone to see and understand, that there was an adverse part, spirit or
power in him unto his salvation, which did get and steal away his mind from
waiting for it: And further, that there was also a Spirit principle or power in
him, which wrought in his mind against the former, and him for joining to it;
which brake his peace, and made those woundings in his soul, from whence arose
all those fears, distresses and miseries, which he had so long (in deepheart
sorrow) groaned under; and from whence sprangfort those hopeful, and true
refreshing beams of comfort, which he had at sometimes had some feeling of,
and was good cause and encouragement unto him, further to wait thereon, as on
that alone, which might work his deliverance.

And in the consideration of this he some time was, and the Lords secret and
still drawings of his mind inward, often visited him, to draw him to him self,
from whence he was departed into folly: so that the man in tremblingwise, or
broakeness, began to be, before the Lord, and to incline his heart to him, who
before now had visited him, to his wounding: even he who searches the heart,
and tries the reins had smitten him; that in everlasting kindness he mightly
down and sorrow be removed from him. And as the compassionate one unvailed the
man, and understanding began to reside with him, this was unto him, as if life
had enterd to the raising of him up above his former troubles; like unto a
woman for joy that a man was born into the world; and remembering how he had
been deceived (for he could not but with greiffe of heart reflect back on that)
he began to have regard thereto, in more bowedness of spirit; least that he
also should loose the fruition of so great mercy: and therefore said, Let me
know thee, O thou searcher of my heart, that I may obey thee, and deliver me
from all my enemies, and that was it, which he was earnest for, and had his eye
at, and hoped to enjoy: but it was in a hasty mind, out of true subjection and
understanding, as those of old time who said, Lord will thou at this time
restore the kingdom to Israel, so apt is man to make have and not to wait
resignedly upon the Lord, that his will might be don, and work effected in the
earth.

And it is to be noted (for so it came to pass) that as the man sunck down or
bowed before the Lord, and breathed for the manifestation, and teaching of his
holy power and Spirit, to effect and work there in his soul, according to the
good will of his own tender goodness and compassion; that the Lord further
enlightened his understanding, (although contrary to his own) giveing him to
see the darkness and confusion in which he was wrapped about, as with a mantle;
and fetterd as with chains of Iron, where at fresh cause of lamentation and
mourning arose in him, in consideration of that enimitie, disobedience and
rebellion that he had lived in indayes by past, against his maker; for of this
he was persuaded in his mind; who before now thought, that although he had not
spent his time so citcumspectly, or with such holy consideration and sobriety,
as he should or ought to have don: yet far was it from him to think or believe,
that he had so far fallen short of his duty, or so far been alienated from his
Maker, as now he began to be convinced that he had, and was.

And concluded that it had been well for him, to have remembered his Creator in
the days of his youth, and not to have spent so much of his pretiouss time,
in such idleness and vanity, according to the evil course of this world, as
he had don; which if he had not hearkened unto, nor inclined his heart to follow
after; but had sought after the Lord to know him, according to his early
visiting of him to return unto him, to walk before him in his holy fear, he
had come to know (with those which so do) no great travel; for its said, that
wisdom preventeth those which early seek her, by first showing her self unto
them; and he did really believe the same, and has since seen the fullfilling
so it in many, who has sought after her betimes.

But as the Light of the Lord did arise and shine forth in him, letting him to
see things which differd from it, this caused him to confess his guilt before
the Lord; he could in no wise deny or extenuate it, for he read it in his own
conscience, which stood as an everlasting record against him; and now he
thought him self in a more desperate and distressed condition then ever before;
for he could not speak for him self, he could not call for mercy, he was
afraid to lift up his eyes to heaven, the pressure of his own iniquity lay so
heavy upon him; neither knew he how to eat or drinck, possess or enjoy; he was
afraid and his fear increased day by day; for understanding was given unto
him, and the revealation of his wretched and deploreable state in measure stood
open and bare before him: So gloriouss was the outgoings of the Lord, in the
removing the veil of his heart, so as if he needed not any one to accuse him,
or to lay things to his charge, or to make him guilty in his own eyes; And as
he saw him self at first deceived, so now how forward he had been to yield to
the deceiver, which stood as an aggravation of his former evils, in which he
had lived.

Thus saw he, that he stood in covenant with hell and death, and alienated from
God, in enmity and ungodlyness; or as that of Solomon, when he thus concluded,
I said in my heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might
manifest them, that they might see, that they them selves are beasts.

Whilst thus he stood, what to do he knew not, was ready to loath and abhor him
self, and to wish that he had never been born; for the book which was opened
was as a thousand witnesses, he saw he could no ways evade its record and
testimony, no escaping no fleeing from it; and what he read therein, he read it
all to be against and not for him, nor no ways tending to his releife, that he
could see, but the contrary.

For as for those things whereby he might have had hope, as the receiveing of
him whom God had sent, in the ministration of a wakening conviction, and
drawing near in true holy subjection thereunto: and those good things of his
before spoken of, which could not stand or remain with him to his support, in
this the day of the appearance of the son of God in clouds: because his work
was, (and for ever is) to make a decision for the Lord in the righteouss
judgeing and scattering of these things, which had not been effected or wrought
by his holy Spirit, who has said, without me you can do nothing: but were
produced and taken up (as before has been said) to seek and obtain life by,
and not acting or working from it, so was climbing up a wrong way, and not
striveing to enter into the true sheepfold at the right door; so that when he
came to have need indeed, his Lamp proved without oil, for so he saw himself
to be, as the heart searcher found him out, to lay wast the inheritance of the
wicked for ever.

So that an anchor to have held his soul by, in this the day of his sore
troubles and afflictions, he had not, nor naught to defend himself withal
therein, but was found out to be by him, (who is the Amen, the faithful and
true witness, whose eyes are as a flame of fire) naked and blind and
miserable; darkness and ignorance filling his heart, and the woeful effects
thereof; and what to do more he knew not; for the revelation of this his
destitute and forsaken state; and the opening his heart in the manifestation
thereof, and bringing things forth into his remembrance; and setting them
before his face; all this and what ever might besayd of that kind, was not
deliverance, it was but manifestation; not a setting him at liberty from the
night, and the chain of it; neither a setting him at the table of the Lord, to
eat of the flesh of Christ, and to drink of the consolateing wine of the
Kingdom; but the ripping open of his corrupted heart, that he might learn to
know him self, and what it was to go from the Fathers house, to feed him self
with husks amongst swine.

And herein, in measure was the great love of God manifested unto him, in not
suffering him to go on in his former ways and courses, until those things
which belonged to his peace had been hid from his eyes.

Thus the Lord proceeded with him, and then the vialls of wrath was not poured
forth, nor the recompense and reward in flames of fire from heaven, to execute
vengance on that ungodly nature and Spirit, which he had cleaved to and lived
in, and thereby had been adulterated from his maker; Of these things he knew
not as yet, as afterward, when the day burned as an Oven, to consume the
stuble and the dross, in which day (he might have said) who shall abide, or who
shall dwell with devoureing fire? The man dyed in greiff unutterable, and such
sorrow as never was before; nor can demonstration and greatest utterance tell
of, as he shall know, who thereunto shall be brought, by the righteouss
correcting hand of the Lord, when he will be eased of his adadversaries, and
avenged of his enemies, in which day the Lord will judge with fire.

Some times whilst sorrow has filled his heart, and perplexity his Spirit, by
reason of the disquietnes and trouble which was there; he has walked into the
feilds, and seen allthings in a sweet serene calm, scarsly a leaf of a tree to
stir, he has been affected therewith, and said with in him self, the creation
is more happy then I, which is at rest in its place, from such storms and
tempests, as he was filled with: and wished and desired that he might know so
great a calm inwardly, as those creatures outwardly did enjoy; for he concluded
surely a blessed state it would be unto him, who now was filled with restless
thoughts and greiffs, as the sea is troubled when the mighty winds rowleth the
waters thereof on heaps, for then he should know tranquillity of mind, and
rest in the holy one; which nothing but his power could say be still, and
effectually work it for him; for all his attempts had proved short, and whilst
he was striveing was disapointed, and so in sorrow lay.

Thus was it with the poor and comfortless man, who in misery was and distress;
good things was removed away from him, and his pretented friend manifested to
be his enemy, a bad one indeed, for so he thought him now to be, who through
all his pretenses, deceivings and flatteries sought his ruin and destruction;
but how to get rid of him out of his heart (for there he had seated himself)
and to redemption and salvation (the thing which all along was in his eye) he
knew not.

And thus lay the man in his grief and the terrors of the Lord revealing in
him, because of his transgressions; And so gloriouss and dreadful was the
Majesty thereof, that he exceedingly feared and trembled; and how help should
come unto him, or when, or never, he knew not, he was a fraid to look to the
Lord (as has been said) or to hope for his help, for with what (thought he)
shall I look, I who am in a state rather to greive and vex the Lord, rather
then to hope or trust in him and to rebel against him and transgress, rather
to curss then to bless his holy Name; well if it be thus with me (said he) as
it is, and surely so it was with him, as the Prophet said; that as every battle
of the warrior is with confused noise and garments rowld in blood, so this is
with burning and devoureing fire; then in a bed of sorrow I am, out of which I
can not arise; but oh that I might be helped and releived I even I who am
without comfort or releife, like unto the poor destitute people of old time,
who for many days were with out a King, and without a Prince, and without an
offering, and without an image, and without an Ephod, and without Jerraphim,
but afterward its said of them, that they should seek the Lord and David there
King.

Now although it was a lamentable state and condition, yet it might be, it was
possible with the Lord, that at the last, he might know the repayrer of
breaches, and the restorer of paths to dwell in, and that at last he might
come to walk in the Light of the Lord, (with his ransomed ones) and be taught
of his ways; and to know his secrets, as those did, who feared his holy Name;
For Job was miserable, when he scraped his soars with a potsheard, and the
Lord restored him; and David cried long and sought the Lord, and at last he
said, that the Lord had heard him, and granted unto him his request; so that he
in trust in the Lord said, surely mercy and goodness shall follow me all the
days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever, so dearly
did the Lord for ever, so dearly did the Lord engage his heart unto him: And
Paul cried out: O wretched man that I am, and yet afterward he said, that the
Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, had set him free from the Law of Sin
and death, which was the great occasion (the Law of Sin and death having
dominion over him) of his wretched woeful state; and many others which he had
read of, and said why not I, why should not I partake of the goodness and
mercy of the Lord, as well as they, for he concluded that neither they nor yet
any that did partake thereof (which is the benefit that comes by Jesus Christ)
had more need of it, feelingly then he had.

Thus he entertaind a belief into his heart, and said that he hoped the Lord
was the same to day as yesterday; even a God gratiouss and merciful pardoning
iniquity and sin for his own name sake; and that is arm was not shortened,
that he could not bring forth deliverance, as of old time; and therefore said,
that he would hope although it were but a little (least he also should be cut of
through unbeleife, as those who fell short thereby) and though he found in him
self little or no cause for it, but his necessity; I Will hope and I Will wait (said
he) although it be against hope, there may be some what in it, more then I know
at present. This was when he in the deep sense of his state, stood as one
broken and poured forth before the Lord, in tears and sorrow days and nights;
and he must have it freely and of good will or not at all; and in mercy and
loveing kindness; for he had naught but misery and necessity to part with;
being naked and bear before him, for his coverings wear rent, and he remained
as empty and void of any thing, which should have been life or refreshment unto
him. Now he had read thus, I counsel thee to buy of me white raiment that thy
nakedness may not appear, and that thy shame may be coverd, and in such a
state of need he was, and necessity; unto which that counsel was given; and he
had tried many sellers, and many merchants, whose merchandise he found answered
not to relieve him, in his necessity; and their garments were too short to
cover his nakedness with all; and having essayed for releife where by he might
have had hopes, and not walked too and fro under the subjection of
disconsolation and amazement; he thought at the last, by the conduct of a
secret still and inward virtue, that he must buy enjoy and possess that
covering, which can hide and be sufficient thereunto, from the storm in Gods
sight, of him which searched his heart, and tried his reins, which brought to
light the thingh of profane Esaw, and that stretched forth the rod of Justice
and Jugment, upon the back of the fool, which had said in his heart, there is
no God; and that as it is written, he stood at the door, and had long there
stood knocking, that he might be opend unto, and come in; and this he could not
deny but must confess, although he had an ear, and did often hear him
knocking, yet strove he against him, and was loath to yield or submit
thereunto, through the unbeleife and hardness of his heart, begotten in him, by
his false and deceitful adversary, then disguised like a friend.

But now his necessitous state, and deplorable condition enforced him (such
constraint had the love of God upon his soul) to receive him in, that he might
and his father come in also and sup with him, and he with them; so the man
expected the supper, the food, the refreshment; the covering and salvation: and
thought it no more then so, so alienate and estranged was he from the right way
of the Lord in darkness and ignorance; but otherwise he found it to be, as at a
certain time the Lord said unto him, when in a sad bewilderd state he was; I
will lead thee by a way which thou know not, and so it came to pass, an
unknown way it was, wherein he never could make a right or straight step, but
as his mind inwardly was directed, by the guidance and hand of his holy power;
no longer could he see his way, or the path in which he was with safety to
tread; that so he might have hopes at last to pass through into the desire of
his soul; but as his heart was fixed in relyance upon the Lord, out of all his
own strivings motions and contrivances. And so the opening of the door was to
be, which his own hardness of heart and unbeleife stood against, before that
he that stood at the door and knocked could get in, and the crookednes and
perverssnes, that the way of the Lord migh be prepared, and his entrance in be
through faith in him; and thus the voice of a burning and shining Light cried,
prepare the way of the Lord, make his path straight.

Thus the doing of all those forementioned lets and hindrances away, and
leagues and covenants with hell and death must be parted with, broken and made
void, and that by him and his assistance, who comes with his fan in his hand,
thoroughly to purge his floor; till when no supper could be enjoyed, although
here a little and there a little of the crumbs thereof, might fall down unto him,
by way of encouragement, and to teach him, that worthy was the Lord to be
waited upon, and sought after, in the way of his Judgments.

For so began they to be manifested with in him as a refiners fire, as fullers
soape; the burning heat whereof and sharp pierceings, made him to fear
exceedingly, that the wheat would have been consumed with the chafe, that his
small hopes, which did arise in him, from the experience he had, as in the
twinkling of an eye beheld, of the mercy of the Lord; and weak resolution,
and himself must for ever have been consumed, in its gloriouss and righteouss
workings; thus was he filled with dread and fear before the Lord, and the
ariseings of his gloriouss power.

And Moses saw a bush burning with fire, and the bush not consumed thereby; and
Moses turned aside to see that great sight; and the Lord spoke from out there,
and said unto him: put of thy shoes from of thy feet, for the ground where on
thou stands is holy, and Moses hid his face, and was afraid to look upon God.
And the man said, that he saw that his feet was not to be shod with his own
shoeing, but with the preparation of the gosple of peace, or he could not make
straight steps with his feet on the holy ground.

And he had read of some that turned a side like a deceitful bow, and that
Joseph's bow a bode in his strength, and he was renowned and stood in a blessed
and holy record, amongst the ancient worthyes of the Lord, who through faith
subdued Kingdoms, of weak were made strong, obtaineing throw faith a good
report: and the man said, Well, if the Lord will destroy me for ever, my mouth
is stopped: he could not raise a defense for him self, he dared not to complain,
for he had sind aganist him, and saw that he must bear his indignation,
whither or not that ever he knew an end, or redemption out of it.

His distress and misery was great, which those not acquainted with the
judgments of the Lord, that proceeds out of his mouth as consumering fire (as
David said) can not believe, although told unto them, by those who have been
acquainted with them, and traveld through the way thereof.

But at last it pleased the Father of mercies, according to the counsel of the
working of the Lord in his wisdom and goodness, to instruct the man, and
wrought in his mind, to cause him to lie down in his will, and submit him
self to the rod of his chasticeing hand, which as he yielded him self
thereunto, he felt some what working, and enlargeing, or opening it self unto
his encouragement; whereby he in some hopes began to say: True and righteouss
are thy Judgments, and that if he perished everlastingly, from beholding his
face with joy, and his salvation, yet he must and would justify him and his
righteouss judgments for ever more, and after this he felt a joy to spring in
him, and to feel some Spirit to revive, and did at some times seem as if he saw
some glimpses of a great glory (as a far off) and of a heavenly Arm, and that
there was salvation in it; but could not get to it, he thought if he could, and
therein continue, that the winter would be past, and the time of refreshing
from the Lords presence would be come, and the hearing of the voice of the
turtle, where in his tears would be wiped away (according to the Prophet) and
that the sorrowing and sithing would flee away, and instead thereof joy and
rejoiceing would be, which he longed for, having some expectation or belief
in him, that the ancient Prophecies, were many of them as really to be
fullfilled in these latter days, as ever they were at first spoken forth, and
that because of the unchangeable faithfullnes and goodness of the Lord.

But now he rather ran into have, then to run the race which he saw in measure
set before him, and that was to wait for Gods salvation; for without that
manifestly he saw, salvation he could never attain to; seeing all his former
ways and courses proved ineffectuall to him; and no ways advantageous; and he
rejoiced in some measure, and was glad in the beholding of it, although it
seemed to be, and was a far of, and not brought near unto him; and earnest he
was to inherit it, and not to ly in the fire for the utter consummation of the
dross, and through purgeing of the floor: and so earnest indeed the man was, and
in hastines of Spirit, that he had all most lost his submission to the will of
the refiner, and instead of waiting patiently upon him, to hear what he would
speak to him, and to see what he would do for him, who is the mighty
Counselor, and of whom he had read, that he would speak comfortably to
Jerusalem, and peace to his people, who feared his Name, notwithstanding he was
for taking the Kingdom (some thing of his old practice and endeavors) not
considering, that he ought not to make have, nor to fly with the swift, and cry
as some did, Nay, we will flee upon horses (such whirling Notions men chose,
rather then to bow before the Lord, that he might be exalted Lord and King over
all his ever.)

Now the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, thus the man
had read, and so there was another lesson that he was to learn, and that was as
an honest Prophet of the Lord once said, In returning and in rest you shall be
saved, in quietness and confidence is your strength; which the Apostle answered
unto, when he said, The Lord direct your hearts into the Love of God and into
the patient waiting for Jesus Christ: That he might know and feel therein, that
the Lords Arm alone brought salvation, and that he might have naught nor none
to glory in but the Lord, who for his own mercy sake dothsave and deliver.
Thus he was to turn off his have, and not to take the Kingdom by force, but to
feel the meek peacable Prince thereof, to lead him into it, and to give him
therein a portion and privilege, amongst the Princes, upon the Throne of
judgment and mercy for ever. And thus learned the man again to return in his
mind, into the enlightening opening light of the Lord, which in his heart was
as a fire and a flame, and to resign up unto it, to feel the effect thereof,
which he hoped might be at the last blessed and greatly advantagiouss to the
stay and comfort of his then greived mind; as others had enjoyed before him,
whom the Lord had lead by his own right arm, into a habitation of joy and
salvation.

But nothwithstanding all this, he again fell to contriving of a speedy way
and to wish for the enjoyment of that, which before this time by way of
encouragement had visited him; to teach him, that not by might nor strength,
but by the Spirit of the Lord and its holy leading and teaching, he was to hope
for, and enjoy his deliverance; And the voice sounded in his ears be still,
according to what he had read in Habbakuk: Let all the earth keep silence
before him.

Here upon he again inclined to sinck down in his Spirit, unto the messenger
of the Lords glorious holy power revealed with in him, and there to abide and
endure in patience of mind and Spirit, for its holy purpose and work to be
wrought in the earth, that it also might be replenished, and bring forth its
increase to the Lord.

Whereupon he said, O Lord! lead me on in the way which is clearing, for to the
day of claering thou know that I have earnestly desired, (with desire of
spirit) to come, and now I am in some measure come, throw thy draweing, by thy
blessed hand held forth unto me; O Lord God of mercy and compassion, guide
thou my feet, and uphold me by thy free Spirit, that in that thy holy way,
which is the way of the blessed, and of the ransomed ones, I may be kept and
perserved.

Yet still again and again, the old deceiver and adversary of the souls
blessedness, at diverse times and on diverse occations, threw some thing or
other into his way, that thereby he might stumble and fall, or be discouraged
and offended; so that he might grow weary and not hold out, but faint and go
backward, and not forward, and to seek for releife amongst his old lovers and
acquaintance; or might dig to himself a cistern for water which could hold
none, or take some other way or means for his deliverance; and here with the
man was so besett by the adversary, to divert his course, and to draw him back
again to perdition, and from following on to the salvation of his soul, as is
beyond utterance.

And can not be declared or believed, as experience and the same state
condition, works the understanding of it.

And in that day, when man if so surrounded by the devoureing enemy, as it is
said of him, he goes about like a roaring Lion, compassing the earth to and
fro, seeking whom he may devour; he must make God alone his trust and hope and
deliverer, eying him in stedfastnes of heart and mind, and not the adversary,
whose labor it is to draw the mind away after him, and his fear; or elce out
there he can never come, to know the deliverance and salvation, which Jesus
Christ is to all those that abides with him, in the faith and hope of Gods
elect, but must be preyed upon, and led into destruction for ever.

Now as this deceiver thus lay in wait and wrought to ensnare and beguile the
man, so all so the compassionate one, ceased not to visit, and secretly convey
his help unto him; and often it would be in his remembrance, that he that
puts his hand to the plow and then loock back, is not meet for the kingdom
of heaven, which he had so earnestly desired to enjoy; neither was he that
sowed sparingly, to expect plentifully to reap, but if he did so hope to do, he
would deceive him self, and be as those that feed on ashes; for in stead of
having a harvest of well filled sheaves, with hanging ears of corn, he would at
last reap the wind, and be disapointed, as those who began in the spirit, and
would be made perfect by the flesh, or sought so to be.

So that now he began to learn to give up to the fire which burned, and to the
hammer which brake him down, in as much as might be quieting him self, and
submitting, as that which was most proper for him, in this his great suffering
state, and entertaind a fear in his heart, least that he should offend the
Lord again by turning from his Judgments, which were executing in him, and
from the terror and righteousness thereof; and therefore again cried out unto
the Lord, and said: O Lord, I pray thee, since I have prayed to see thy day
and its glory, and that thou have in thy great loveing kindness, brought me into
the glorious dawnings and breakings forth thereof, let not thy way be too
narrow or straight for me; let me not turn a side to the flocks of thy
companions, but as they went down by the steps of the flock, to the washing,
and returned by the tents of the sheepheards, upon the bancks of salvation, so
I also into the holy habitation of thy heavenly rest, may be brought by thine
own right arm, in the way (and through it) of condemnation, at last to sit
down in the ministration of life, to behold thy face in thy exceeding glory in
joy and peace; and teach me to apply my heart to wisdom (which is hid from all
the wise of this world) for thou know that it is wisdom alone of thee which
I crave, to direct my feet a right in thy sight.

And that was the thing which he wanted and alone desired of the Lord, and
thought with him self, that he matterd not what he parted with; or how or what
he was in the account, or eyes of the world, so that he might find rest. And
thus having made some progres, in the blessed race of eternal life; and
having in him a Judgment and understanding (according to that experience of
the effectual working of the grace of God in him) he advises all, who is (in
any measure) awakened into the sense of their want of the knowledge of God, and
of his great love in Jesus Christ, and of their own woeful and miserable
estate thereby; that they abide in submission unto the Lord therein, and not
seek to them selves ways and means, thereby to work their own deliverance;
but in longings and groanings in their Spirits, travel after the desire of
their souls; that so the Lord (in his own blessed way and time) may open a
door of understanding in their hearts, for their acces unto him; and strive not
by unlawful ways and courses after redemption, or an admission into the holy
Kingdom, whereinto nothing that defiles, or is managed by man's skill or hand
may come; for many have striven and not enterd; and asked, and have not
received; because they have asked amiss, and not striven lawfully.

Therefore feel the Lords heavenly arm and power to arise and work
deliverance, and propound not to thy self an easy way of accessing to the
flesh, into the holy habitation of his eternal life; for it must be by the
sword, the Judgment determined must be fullfilled, and the fullfilling must be
according to the counsel and righteouss will of the Lord, to whom, who may say,
what do thou?

And abide his pleasure, and let his Kingdom come into thy heart as he
pleases; if it be by a thundering power from heaven, to cleave the rocks
assunder, and rending the veil thereby of from thy hard heart, with
astonishments, amazements and confoundings to thy vain confidence and
expectation. Be still, be still before the Lord, and before the glorious
ariseings of his holy power; that he may work his work in the earth, and that
will praise him and deliver thy soul; and hereby alone shall thou know, and
come to witness the Lords ransom: for it is his and not thine, and inherit that
which thy soul languish in want off.

And those who are come to the redeeming power of the Lord, and to the knowing
of redemption in any measure, and the feeling the judgment thereof; for so it
must be, Zion is redeemed by judgment; lie down, lie down; and flee not for
thy life, for if thou do thou will loose it: and in that day, seek not to
escape, but let this be the travel of thy soul, in bowednes of Spirit to
submit unto him, that thou may feel that mind and to be of it, which can say,
true and righteous are thy judgments o Lord, for thou judge for the poor and
needy of the earth.

Thus shall thou know the effect of righteousness, peace and assurance for ever,
and the oil of gladness, making thy face to shine with the innocent life and
spirit of the Lamb, and by no other means, no other way.

These things are veryfyed by a cloud of witnesses, who stands in an
everlasting record of blessedness and life eternal, which the holy Scriptures
testified gained a good report, for they enterd into that their Masters joy
through believing in him whom God had promised to raise up, who saw his day and
rejoiced, and it was reckoned unto them for righteousness; who dyed in the
faith, and although dead yet speak; And unto us has God fullfilled his
promise, and in due time sent forth his son, in the word of eternal life unto
all those who believe in his name, and that follow him in the regeneration and
renewing Spirit of life and righteousness; not in the talk thereof, a cheat
which too to much abounds in the world, but to know him, and the fellowship of
his sufferings, and the being made conformable unto his will, who come not to do
his own will but the will of him that sent him (until that thou be translated
from death to life) which will is the sanctification of all those which are
obedyent in their hearts unto him. So if thou say that thou love him, keep his
comandements, let them not be greivious unto thee, run the way thereof with
delight (as David) how do I love thy comandements: Men make void thy Law, but I
will keep thy Law, hide not thy comandements from me.

This is the raee thou art to run, these are the marks of the true runners,
therefore so run as that thou may obtain, to inherit life; and bear about
in thy body the marks of the Lord Jesus, and his faithful followers, who
follows him whither so ever he goes; as believing that it is enough for them
to be as their Lord, who loved them, and gave him self a ransom for them and
all men, to be testified of in due time; and this is the consolation and the
great rejoyceing, that the testifycation thereof many are made witnesses, and
the ransom is known, and the deliverance is come; and many have, and many
shall sit down in the blessed inheritance of it, in the heavenly Mantions in
Christ Jesus, with Abraham, with Isack and Jacob; waiteing and traveling for
the comeing in of that Number, which shall be gatherd to the Lord, and to his
standard, to reign with him on Mount Zyon, in the heavenly Jerusalem, the place
of blessedness, world without end. Amen.

The Writter of these things, says that they are written in the great Love of
God, for the sake of those who wants the consolation of Israel, and would
gladly walk in the heavenly way thereof, if they knew it; that they may hereby
take notice and have a view, of the foot steps of the man, and the way of the
Lord with him, to take him of from the wild and evil ways and courses of the
world; that so he might lead him to hat hope, which is as an anchor to the
soul, that his heart might be fixed and he trusting in the Lord, (as David
said, My heart is fixed, o God, my heart is fixed) until he should see his
desire upon his enemies.
