seal of the Commonwealth
Tuesday the five and twentieth of August, 1657. At the Council at White Hall.
HIs Highness and the Council, calling to mind the memorable Mercies which the
Lord was pleased to vouchsafe to this Nation of England, in the admirable
successes and Victories given to their Forces, on the third day of September,
in the year 1650. at Dunbar, and on the same day in the year 1651. at
Worcester, and being desirous that such eminent salvations wrought by the Lord,
should not be forgotten, but continued in thankful remembrance, Have thought
fit to appoint and set apart Thursday the third day of September next, to be a
day of Public and Solemn Thanksgiving to the Lord, in the remembrance of the
Mercies aforesaid, to be kept and observed in the Cities of London and
Westminster, and all places within the late Lines of Communication, and Weekly
Bills of Mortality, and all other places where the notice hereof shall come,
not doubting but the Ministers and such as fear the Lord in this Nation, will
with all readiness join in a Duty to which God has engaged them by such signal
and redoubled providence.

Henry Scobell, Clerk of the Council.
