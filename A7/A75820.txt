A Practical Catechism Of purpose framed for the help of such as desire to
enjoy more sweet and intimate Soul-communion with Jesus Christ in that sacred
Ordinance of his own Supper.

Begun at Newport-Pagnel in Buckinghamshire, revived at Luton in Bedfordshire,
and now perfected at Queen Hithe in London.

By Samuel Austin, an unworthy Minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

1 Cor. 10.16, 17. The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the Communion
of the blood of Christ? the bread which we break, is it not the Communion of
the body of Christ? For we being many, are one bread, and one body: for we are
all partakers of that one bread. 1 Cor. 12.13. For by one Spirit we are all
baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or
free, and have been made to drink into one Spirit. 1 Ioh. 1.3, 4. That which we
have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with
us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. London, Printed

THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY, To my dearly beloved friends, the Church and
faithful People of God, which are at Newport-Pagnell in Buckinghamshire, at
Luton in Bedfordshire, and at Michael Queen Hithe in London: 2 Pet. 1.2.
Grace and Peace be multiplied unto you, through the knowledge of God, and of
Jesus our Lord.
Dearly beloved:
IT is not unknown to some, if not to the most of you; that this sacred
Ordinance of the Lords supper, is superstitiously and profanely abused by
many, who are extremely zealous to have their part in the outside, and visible
elements of this Ordinance, As Popish spirits who content themselves with the
opus operatum, or work done.
but never care for the invisible grace, or spirit of Christ in the Ordinance:
Others there are that do (...) much slight and despise both the elements, and
the grace of it, that they seldom, or never care for the participation of it,
unless formally, and for fashion sake. Others, that not only neglect it
themselves, but hinder such from it as much desire the renovation of their
Covenant, and sweet Soul-communion with Christ, in the due participation of it.
And some there are also sprung up of late I hear, (which to me appear in a more
strange visage then the rest,) who deny this and other Ordinances of Christ in
the New Testament, to be now had in use at all amongst Gods people; they
holding this as a principle; That this and all other Ordinances are now lost
and dead with Christ and his Apostles: which sad opinion, I must confess, I
cannot look upon, as a notion of any new light, as some may please to esteem of
it; but rather to bewail it as a strange and dangerous fancy, without, and
against the word of truth, Mat. 28.19, 20. 1 Cor. 11.23. etc. 25, 26.
or as an ignis fatuus, a fond light, that will lead those that follow it (if
God in mercy prevent not) into utter darkness. To administer some means of cure
to these sad distempers (if God shall please to glorify himself by so weak an
instrument:) I have taken this opportunity, to send out these few Catacheticall
thoughts of mine, upon this Ordinance of the Lords supper; wherein I have
endeavored to clear to you and others, (so far as a work of this nature would
bear) these four particulars. 1. The divine authority of this Ordinance. 2. The
nature of it. 3. The ends of it, (wherein the perpetuity of it is employed.) 4.
The requisites, or things required for the prevention of the abuse, and the
better help of my self and others, to the sweet and comfortable participation
of it. All which (dearly beloved in the Lord) I have thought good to present
respectively unto your selves, as the fittest objects I could make choice of to
dedicate this work unto; and that for diverse reasons, as these in special.

1. Because it was conceived, and brought forth amongst you, as being a part of
my poor ministerial pains, while divine providence did call me to labor with
you, and therefore you have the more right unto it. A poor child by Law, must
be kept where it was born; I leave it therefore to your tender care, hoping you
will nourish it as your own.

2. It was at first intended for your spiritual good; and therefore I do now
the more boldly bequeath it to you.

3. These labors of mine in a way of Catechizing, have been sometimes
profitable to some yea, I may say with thankfulness to God (by the
acknowledgment of others) to many of you; As at Newport especially, before our
late troubles; where I bestowed many years pains in this exercise.
I desire by this means, they may prove so unto you all.

4. Divine providence has called me off from some of you; and I know not how
soon I may be called from others where I now am, to a country and people, that
have more need of the ministry, (at least more sense of their needs, then many
now in London have.) Where I may be more serviceable to God, then in that
slender Congregation which I now attend. And therefore I desired to leave this
amongst you, as a perpetual pledge and memorial of my most dear love unto
your souls; and of my most earnest desires to help you on in your more sweet
and intimate Communion with Jesus Christ, in this and other of his Ordinances
of grace here, till he shall call you home into full Communion with himself,
in his everlasting glory.

5. The time will come (how soon I know not) that you all (as well as my self)
must give up your accounts Romans 14.10.12. 2 Cor. 5.10.
of your Stewardships to Jesus Christ; and what holy use you have made of this
and other Ordinances of grace; I thought it meet therefore to leave this with
you, both to put you in remembrance As 2 Pet. 1.12, 13, 14, 15.
of your duty, and to help you in it; that so you may give up your accounts
with joy, and not with grief.

6. There are some reasons in respect of the times.

1. You know the times are full of loosnes and profaneness: by this, I desire to
press you to more holy strictness, Ephesians. 4.17. and 20. and 5.15.16. Heb. 12.14.

2. The times are full of unchristian bitterness, divisions, etc. By this I
desire, that you may endeavor the more to make up breaches, and to preserve
Christian Unity and Unanimity amongst your selves, Remember Phil. 2.1, 2. Which
has been sometimes opened and applied unto you.
Phil. 2.1, 2. Ephesians. 4. v. 3.

3. The times are full of slighting and neglecting this and other divine
Ordinances, the means and ministry of grace, (which are sadly withdrawn from
some of you, As Newport and Luton.
) I desire you by this, to prize them the more, to pray for them more earnestly
where they are wanting, and to make more holy use of them, where and when you
have them.

4. These are times wherein men are much taken up in seeking after new notions,
and strange opinions. I desire by this, you may seek the more earnestly after
the Ier. 6.16 1 Ioh. 2.7.
old truth of Jesus Christ, and stick more close unto them. While others are
notionall, be you practical, 1 Cor. 8.1.
and Joh. 13.17. these are the reasons of my dedication.

Give me leave to add some reasons for my publication of this poor piece (if it
shall be approved) and I have done.

It was not either from the apprehension of the want of other more learned
helps in this kind, of which there are many Mr. Daniel Rogers two Treatises
upon the Sacraments. Mr. Dike, Bradshaw, Hildersam, etc.
very useful and profitable, for which I desire to bless God; nor from any
thoughts of the worth of this, as flowing from my self, which I conceive to be
very weak. But.

1. Out of desire to add my poor mite, to the helping on of the great work of
God now in agitation, scil. the administration of this Ordinance of the Lords
supper (amongst others) in its purity.

2. To satisfy the earnest desires of some friends, not to be despised.

3. To prevent my tedious labor of writing copies for such as did desire it.

4. To have a help in more readiness for preparation of the people I relate
unto, for the Lords supper. This help I conceive being more familiar to them
then others.

5. To give some taste of my poor labors in this kind, (which have done good to
some) though I have not time to send forth all.

6. And lastly, to stir up others of my brethren, who are more able to send out
those helps of theirs, which may prove more profitable. And to bestow the more
diligent pains in this great duty of Catechizing; which if ever, would at this
time prove very seasonable. Prove. 22.6. Hos. 4.6. Heb. 5.12. etc.
Thus you have the reasons both of my Dedication, and Publication. I have kept
you to long in the Porch; I shall now lead you into the House it self. The
Lord give you, and others abundance of joy and consolation in Christ, in the
use of it. So Prays,

Your truly loving friend and servant for Jesus sake, Samuel Austin.

Some brief Or, A Practical Catechism.
Catecheticall Directions by way of question and answer, the better to prepare
my self, and others, for sweet Communion with Jesus Christ, in that sacred
Ordinance of his own Supper; begun at Newport, revived at Luton, but perfected
at Queen Hithe in London,
By S. A.
The Text laid as the foundation of this Exercise, 1 Cor. 11.23, 24. etc. 29.
The sum of these directions, showing 1. The Author. 2. The nature. 3. the ends
and 4. the requisites of this Ordinance.


Quest. WHo is the Author of this Sacrament of the Lords Supper?

Answ. The Lord Jesus Christ himself, 1 Cor. 11.23. Mat. 26.26, 27. [and
therefore it is called the Lords Supper, because he is the Author, and
Institutor of it. 1 Cor. 11.20.]

Quest. What gather you from hence?

Answ. These five things:

1. That we must prize and esteem it highly, as the precious Ordinance of Jesus
Christ, 1 Cor. 10.16. and cap. 11.27.

2. We must not slight, but come to it, and partake of it with faith, fear and
reverence, as of his Ordinance; as Isa. 55.1, 2, 3. Mat. 22.4, 5. etc.

3. We must go to him, and wait upon him, by faithful and fervent prayer, for
his special presence with, and blessing on us in this his own Ordinance, Joh.
14.13, 14. Mat. 18.19, 20.

4. We must make it our special care, and labor, As the life and soul of this
Ordinance.
to enjoy him, and close in sweet Soul-communion with him, in this Ordinance
Cantic. 1.2. Joh. 6.27.

5. And lastly, That those who are slighters and despisers of it, are slighters
and despisers of Christ himself, whose Ordinance it is, and therefore they must
look to answer for it. Mat. 22.4, 5. 1 These. 4.8. 1 Cor. 11.27.

Quest. What is the nature of the Lords supper?

Answ. It is the second Sacrament of the New Testament, or the Sacrament of our
growth and continuation in Jesus Christ, and his Church, As Baptism is the
first Sacrament, or the Sacrament of our initiation, or entrance into Jesus
Christ and his Church
wherein by the due and worthy receiving of Bread and Wine, according to
Christ's institution, is signified and sealed unto us, our true receiving of the
body and blood of Jesus Christ, with all his Conceive it in a spiritual sense.
Compare Joh. 6.51, 52, 53, and 63. verses.
precious merits and excellencies, to the nourishing up of our souls unto
everlasting life. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25, 26. Joh. 6.27.52.53. etc.

Quest. Why, or for what ends must we partake of this Ordinance?

Answ. For these three ends. 1. To testify our obedience unto Jesus Christ.
Math. 26.26, 27.

2. To perpetuate the memorial of his death for us, and infinite love therein
unto us. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25, 26. Joh. 15.13.

3. To seal up our intimate Union, and Communion with him by faith, and with
the Saints by love. 1 Cor. 10.16, 17. and 12, 13.

Quest. What are the requisites, or things required of all such as desire to be
worthy and welcome partakers of this Sacrament?

Answ. These three viz.

1. Due preparation before they come.

2. A right disposition or behavior of themselves when they come.

3. An answerable, careful, Christian carriage when they are gone.

Quest. Why must they prepare themselves before they come?

Answ. For these four reasons.

1 Because God requires it in all his services, (as 1 Samuel 7.3.16.5. Ecles.
5.1. Amos 4.12.) so especially in this, 2 Chronicles. 35.6. 1 Cor 5.7, 8. and 11.28.

2. The Saints practiced it both in the Old and New Testament. 2 Chronicles. 30.15,
16, 17, 19. Ezra 6.20, 21, 22. John 11.55. 1 Cor. 5.7, 8.

3. Mercy and pardon belongs only to such as prepare themselves for it. 2 Chronicles. 30.18.

4. The miserable inconveniences of coming to it without preparation, which
are these three, viz.

1. It Is a horrible sin; no less then guilt of the body and blood of lesus
Christ. 1 Cor. 11.27.

2. It Is a filthy shame; as to come with old nasty clothes to a Kings sable. 2 Chronicles. 30.3.15. Mat 22.11, 12.

3. It Is a most fearful danger; as to come to eat, and drink damnation to
themselves. 1 Cor 11.29.

Quest. But wherein does this due preparation of our selves before we come,
consist?

Answ. In these two things.

1. In self-examination before we come. 1 Cor. 11.28.

2. In putting on our wedding garment. Mat. 22.11, 12. Rev. 19.7.

Quest. What is required of us, in this self-examination?

Answ. These two things. First, We must set some time and pains apart about it.
Secondly, Consider the things we must examine our selves of before we come.

Quest. Why must we set some time and pains apart about it?

Answ. For these four reasons.

1. Because every duty requires time and pains, [ Ecles. 3.1.9, 10. Jer.
48.10.] so this especially. Psalm. 4.4. Sam. 3.40. 1 Cor 11.28. and 31. verses.

2. We cannot find out our sins, to be humbled for them, nor our graces, to
rejoice in them, or rather in God for them, without time and pains. 2 Cor.
13.5. Gal. 6.4. 1 Cor. 1.30, 31. etc.

3. We cannot bring our hearts to close with God in this, or any other holy
duty, unless we bestow some time and pains about it. Psalm. 208.1, 2. 2 Pet. 1.5
and 10. verses. with Mark. 1.35.38.

4. This will abundantly requite all our cost. 2 Pet. 1.5.10, 11.

Quest. What are the things, we must examine our selves of?

Answ. These two, viz. 1. What need we have of this Sacrament. 2. Whether we be
the persons invited to it.

Quest. Why must we examine our selves of these?

Answ. For these two reasons.

1. Because unless we find and feel our need of this Sacrament, we will never
care for it, or desire it as we ought. Mat. 9.12.

2. Although we do find and feel our need of it, yet if we are not the parties
invited to it, we can hope for no benefit by it; as a feast does no good to
those who are not called to partake of it. Mat. 22.11, 12, 13.

Quest. How may we find, and feel our need of this Sacrament?

Answ. By serious looking on our own spiritual vileness, sinfulness, and
emptyness of grace in our selves by nature, and then on the fullness of grace
that is in Christ, as presented to us in this Sacrament. As for instance: 1.
Although we find our selves dull, yea dead (spiritually) in our selves by
nature, 2 Cor. 3.5. Ephesians. 2.1. etc. 4, 5. verses. Yet Christ is here presented
as a fountain of life, to quicken us, Ephesians. 2.1. etc. John 4.10, 14. Rev.
21.6. Secondly, Though we be dark and ignorant in our selves; yet Christ is our
wisdom to enlighten us, 1. Cor. 1.30. Thirdly, Though we are guilty, and
liable to condemnation of our selves: yet Christ is our righteousness, to cover
and justify us. 1 Cor. 1.30. Phil. 3.7, 8, 9. Fourhtly, Though we are polluted
in our selves, yet Christ is our sanctification, that fountain of David opened,
to cleanse and purify us, Zeach. 13.1. Fifthly, We are soul-sick in our
selves, yet Christ is here our Physician to heal us, Mat. 9.12. Sixthly, Our
graces viz. faith, hope, patience, humility, love to God and his people, etc.
Are exceeding dull and weak in our selves, yet Christ is here our bread of
life, to quicken, and strengthen them in us, Joh. 6.35. Seaventhly, and lastly,
Our corruptions, temptations and soulenemies are very strong, [see Rom 7.23.
Ephesians. 6.12. Luke 11.21. 1 Pet. 2.11.] But we may here see what great need we
have of the virtue and power of Jesus Christ, in this Sacrament, to subdue and
conquer them. 2 Cor. 12.9. Romans 8.37. etc. Phil. 4.13.

Quest. But how shall we know whether we be the persons invited to this
Sacrament?

Answ. We may know it by these three things.

1. If we be such as hunger and thirst after Christ Jesus, and his precious
merits, and righteousness in this Sacrament, out of true sense and feeling of
our own sin and misery, as, Isa. 55.1, 2, 3.

2. If we be the children of God, this bread is provided for the children, and
not for dogs. Mat 15.26. with 7. cap. ver. 6.

3. If we be the Servants of God; he has furnished his table only for his own
servants, not for ruffians, loyterers, or such as are strangers to him. Luke.
12.36, 37. with cap. 22. the verses, 26, 29, 30.

Quest. How shall we know whether we are such as do truly hunger and thirst
after Christ Jesus and his precious righteousness in this Sacrament?

Answ. We may know by this, if we have the true marks and symptoms of
spiritual hunger and thirst answerable to those in nature.

Quest. Which are they?

Answ. These six especially, viz.

1. A true sense and feeling of the great want of meat and drink, Pro. 27.7. So
here we must find and feel our exceeding want of Jesus Christ, if we hunger,
and thirst for him. Mat. 5 6. with John 7.37. etc.

2. Pain and torment for this want, till it be supplied, as Judges 15.18, 19.
So here till the soul enjoys Christ, Psa. 42.1. Cant. 3.1, 2.

3. An earnest desire, and going out of the soul after meat, and drink; so here
after Jesus Christ. Psalm. 42.1.63.1. etc.

4. A diligent use of means, to obtain these; as our poor people when they
have no food at home, go abroad to the market, and to their neighbors for
supply. Genesis 42 2. So here, when we find the want of Christ at home, we must
seek abroad for him, come to his house, Word, Ministers, Ordinances, etc. as
Cant. 1.8.3.1, 2. etc. Joh. 5.39. We must go many miles for him, if need be, as
those, Joh. 6.24. Mat 2.1, 2. etc.

5. Willingness to be at any cost or charge, to obtain these, as Jacob and the
Egyptians. Genesis 42.2.43.11. and 47.13.19, 20. as Job. 2.4. So we must be
willing to part with any thing, not only our sins and lusts, our pleasures and
profits etc. But with our dearest lives (if need require) and count all as loss
and dung, that we may win Christ. Mat. 13.44.46. Phil. 3.7, 8. as Acts 21.13.
Rev. 12.11.

6. Readiness, and resolution to break through any dangers, and difficulties to
obtain meat and drink, as those lepers, 2 Kings 7.4. And as in the Proverb,
hunger will break through stone walls. So those who are spiritually hungry and
thirsty after Jesus Christ, will break through any dangers and difficulties;
reproaches, disgraces, persecutions both of tongue and hand, through bad
report, as well as good; will do or suffer any thing to win Christ. Heb. 11.25,
26, 36, 37. etc. 2 Cor. 6.4, 5. and 8. verses. with Acts. 21.13. Rev. 12.11. as
before. If we be thus spiritually hungry and thirsty after Christ in some
sincere measure, we are the guests invited, but not otherwise.

Quest. How shall we know that we are the children of God?

Answ. We may know by this if we have the dispositions and affections of
children. viz. these four.

1. Children partake of the nature and image of their Parents. as, Genesis 5.3. So
if we be Gods children, we must partake of the divine nature and image of God;
be holy as he is holy, merciful, heavenly, as our heavenly father is
merciful, etc. 2 Pet. 1.4. and 1 Pet. 1.15. Joh. 3.3, 5. Mat. 5.44, 45. etc.
48. Luke 6.36. [compare Ephesians. 5.32. Col. 3.10.12. etc.

2. Children have a dear love unto, and longing desire after the presence of
their Parents. So we after God, to enjoy him in grace and glory. Psalm. 42.1, 2.
etc.

3. Children (such as are good) are afraid to offend their Parents, careful to
please them. So we must be afraid to offend our heavenly father, etc. as Mar.
1.6.

4. Children go to their Parents, to supply their wants, cast all their care
upon them, to feed and cloth them, etc. So we on God. Mat. 6.25, 26. etc. 31,
32. Mat. 6.25, 26. etc. 31, 32. If we have those dispositions and affections of
Gods children in us, this bread of the Lord is provided for us; but not else:
If we be not born of God partakers of the divine nature, are not holy,
heavenly, merciful, etc. But profane, earthly, cruel, etc. we are not the
persons here invited.

Quest. How shall we know whether we be the servants of God?

Answ. The Apostle resolves us, Romans 6.16. His servants we are, to whom we
obey. If we do the works of God, and obey him, we are his servants: but if we
do the works of sin and Satan, and obey them, we are their servants, not Gods.

Quest. Which are the works of God?

Answ. Those duties which God himself commands, to be performed in his own way
and manner. Deuteronomy. 12.32. Mat. 28.20. 1 Chronicles. 15.13.

Quest. What are those duties?

Answ. They are of two sorts. First, Of Piety toward God, as in the first
table of the Law. Mat. 22.37, 38. Secondly, of charity toward our neighbor,
as in the second table. Mat. 22.39.

Quest. Which are the special duties of Piety which we owe to God?

Answ. They are many, according to the several Commandments in the first
Table, as these especially.

1. To know him as our God, to believe, or rest on him in all our straights; to
hope in him, to fear him, to love him with all our hearts, etc. To make choice
of him, and him only, as our God; to be zealous for him, his truth, cause,
glory, etc. As in the first Commandment. Exodus 20.3. 2 Chronicles. 28.9. Joh. 17.3.
Psalm. 9.10. Jer. 17.7. Psalm. 31.19, 23. Deuteronomy. 10.20. Psalm. 119.139.

2. To worship him not by images, or any imaginary way of man, but purely,
spiritually, sincerely, faithfully, reverently, etc. as he requires, without
profaneness, ignorance, or superstition, on the one side; or formality, and
hypocrisy, on the other; as in the second Commandment. Exodus 20.4, 5. Joh.
4.22, 23, 24. Acts 17.22, 23. Isa. 29.13.

3. To honor him in his name, titles, attributes, his word, worship, works,
etc. and that in our hearts, words, and conversations, as in the third
Commandment. Deuteronomy. 28.58.

4. To sanctify his Sabbath, by consecrating it, as holy and honorable to the
Lord, setting apart the Lords day, to the Lords Service; scil. to duties of 1
praise, 2 prayer, 3 reading and hearing of the Word, 4 Catechizing, 5
meditation, 6 godly conference, 7 examination and repetition of what we hear to
apply the same to our practice and edification: also to duties of * mercy, and
necessity as there is occasion; as to visit and administer to the sick, to
comfort the sad, instruct the ignorant, warn the unruly, to convince and bring
home poor seduced and sinful souls to the ways of truth and holiness,
reconcile differences, etc. To provide necessary food, raiment, quench a
dangerous fire, lift up the Ox fallen in the ditch, preserve the creature
which would else be spilt, etc. as in the fourth Commandment. Compare Isa.
58.13. Rev. 1.10. 1 Psalm. 92. the whole Psalm, entitled a Psalm for the
Sabbath day. 2 See Isa. 55.6, 7. Mark 1.35. etc. 38, 39. 3 Luke 4.14, 15. and
15.21. 4 16, 17. etc. Act. 13. Deuteronomy. 6.6, 7. Gal. 6.6. 5 Psalm. 1.2. Luke 2.19.
6 Luke 24.17. etc. 25. etc. 32. with Act. 13.43. 7 Act. 17.11, 12. Joh. 13.17.
* For duties of mercy and necessity, see these Scriptures, Mat. 12.1. etc.
7.10, 11, 12. Ibid. Mat. 25.35. etc. with 1 These. 5.14, 15. Gal. 6.1. etc. Jam.
5.19, 20. Romans 12.18. 1 Cor. 1.10. etc. 6.1. etc. Mat. 12.1. etc., with Luke
6.1. etc. 10.

Quest. Which are those duties of charity, we owe to our neighbors, as in the
second Table?

Answ. They are these two in brief.

1. We must love them as our selves, Mat. 22.39.
not only in their souls, as our own souls. Luke 22.32. Phil. 2.4.20. etc. But
in their honors, as if our own, in every relation; whether our Parents
natural, politic, or spiritual, etc. whether as superiors, equals, or
inferiors, as in the fifth Commandment. Exodus 20.12.

2. In their lives, by seeking the preservation and comfort of them, and that
in our thoughts, words, and deeds, as of our own, as in the sixth Commandment.
Exodus 20.13.

So 3. In their chastities.

4. Their estates.

5. Their credits, and good names, in the same manner, as of our own, i. e. as
we ought to love our own. As in the seventh, eighth, ninth Commandments. Exodus
20.14, 15, 16.

6. And lastly, We must conscientiously resist every covetous thought or
desire, Jam. 1.14.
arising in us, or cast into our souls by Satan, Luke, 22.3, 4.
after any thing that is our neighbors, whether his house, wife, etc. and be
sweetly satisfied with that portion, and condition, which is, or shall be
allotted to us by the Lord. As in the tenth, and last Commandment. Exodus
20.17. Romans 7.7. Compare the examples of David, Paul, etc. Psalm. 16.5, 6. Phil.
4.11, 12. These, and the like, are the works of God.

Quest. Which are the works of sin, and of the Devil?

Answ. Every breach of the Law of God, or whatsoever is contrary to these
former duties. 1 John 3.4, 8. as,

1. All ignorance of God, unbelief, want of hope in God, fear of him, or love
to him; all hatred or contempt of him; neglect of zeal for him, his cause,
truth, etc. The not making choice of him as our God, the loving our pleasures,
profits, or any thing more then him, etc. 2 Timothy 3.4. Jam. 4.4. against the
first Commandment.

2. All worshipping of God by Images, or any imaginary way of man, without
warrant of the word of God. Deuteronomy. 12. Ma. 32.15.9. As al prophanes, ignorance,
superstition, irreverence, infidelity, formality, or hypocrisy in his worship,
Isa. 29.13. John 4.23, 24.
or the wilful contempt and neglect of it, against the second Commandment.

3. All abusive cursing, swearing, irreverent use of Gods name, his titles,
attributes, word, worship, works or servants, either in thought, word, or deed,
against the third Commandment. Deuteronomy. 28.58.

4. All profanation of the Lords day, by vain sports, worldly employments,
etc. giving way to our own thoughts, words or works on that day, not making it
our delight to consecrate it as holy, and honorable to the Lord, as is
required. Isa. 58.13. Or by neglect of the duties of this day before mentioned,
whether of Piety toward God, or of charity and mercy toward our selves or
others, in public, private, or secret, against the fourth Commandment.

5. All hatred or injurious dealing toward our neighbor, his soul, body,
honor, or relations (as before) his life, chastity, goods or good name. Lev.
19.17, 18. All neglect of that affection, and duty of love which we owe unto
him, his soul, body, honor, etc. With all covetous desires of any thing that
belongs unto him, against the second Table of the Law. Mat. 22.39. To all which
we may add that large This catalogue of scandalous sins, may be of good use to
show who are to be debarred from this Sacrament.
Catalogue of scan. dalous sins, mentioned, 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. with Ephesians. 5.3, 4,
5. Gal. 5.19, 20, 21. and 2 Timothy 3.2, 3, 4, 5. etc. All which are properly
called the fruits of the flesh, and the works of the Devil. Gal. 5.19. etc.
John. 8.41.44. By these we may try our selves if we do the Lords works, and
that in the Lords manner, as before we are the servants of the Lord, and the
guests invited to this table: but if we do the Devils works, we are the Devils
servants, and not the Lords. Joh. 8.41.44. Romans 6.16. And we may partake of the
table of Devils, but cannot partake of the Lords table. 1 Cor. 10.21. Christ
will have no Communion with us. 2 Cor. 6.14. [So much of the first branch of
preparation before we come; which is self-examination.]

Quest. What is the second thing required in preparation before we come?

Answ. It is the putting on our Wedding garment. Rev. 19.7. Mat. 22.12.

Quest. What is this Wedding garment?

Answ. It is nothing else but Christ Jesus, and his righteousness, with those
Sacramental graces, wherewith he usually adorns all such as he admits into
inward sweet Communion with himself. To. 1^.12.14. Phil. 3.8, 9. Rev. 19.7, 8.

Q. Which are those Sacramental graces?

Answ. These 6. especially. 1. Saving knowledge of God, and of Christ Jesus.
Joh. 17.3. 1 Cor. 10.15, 16. with cap. 11.29.

2. True repentance of our former sins. Exodus 12.8. 1 Cor. 11.31. 2 Cor. 7.9, 10.

3. New obedience for time to come. 1 Cor. 5.7, 8. 2 Cor. 5.17.

4. A lively faith in Gods mercies through Christ. Joh. 6.35. and 7.37.38.

5. A thanful remembrance of his death. Psalm. 116.12, 13. 1 Cor. 11.26.

6. Charity to all men, but especially to the household of faith. Mat. 5.44, 45.
Romans 12.18. 1 These. 4.12. Ephesians. 4.32. Joh. 15.12. Gal. 6.10.

There are many other graces that serve to make up this wedding garment, viz.
Humility, Holiness, Heavenly-mindedness, etc. 1 Pet. 5.5. Psalm. 45.13, 14.
Col. 3.1. etc. But they do all attend on these, as the Virgins on the Kings
daughter. Psalm. 45.13, 14.

Quest. But may none come to this Sacrament without these six special Graces?

Answ. No, unless they will come to eat and drink damnation to themselves, as
before, 1 Cor. 11.29.

Quest. How is this cleared?

Answ. In these six particulars:

1. Without saving knowledge they cannot discern the Lords body, viz. Either
the necessity, or excellency of it in this Sacrament; and therefore if they
come, they must needs come to condemnation, as before, 1 Cor. 11.29, 34.

2. Without repentance, their best sacrifices are an abomination to the Lord,
Pro. 15.8. Isa. 1.12, 13. etc. 16.

3. Without new obedience there is no Communion with Christ, in this or any
Ordinance. 1 Cor. 5.7, 8. 2 Cor. 5.17. and 6.14, 15.

4. Without faith there is no possibility of pleasing God in this or any
service. Hebr. 11.6. Ephesians. 1.6. 1 Pet. 2.5.

5. The nature of this Ordinance requires thankfulness, and therefore it is
commonly called, the Eucharist, [i. e. a sacrifice of thanksgiving. Mat. 26.27.
1 Cor. 11.24.] Because it was begun and ended of Christ with thanksgiving, and
cannot be rightly used without it. Mat. 26.26, 30.

6. There can be no Communion with Christ, or with one another in this
Sacrament, without love and charity. 1 Cor. 12.13.13.1, 2, 3. and 16.14. You
see here the necessity of those sacramental graces.

Qu. Pray show me also the nature of those graces as they lie in order. What is
that saving knowledge which is here required?

Answ. It is that grace of God in us, whereby we do in some measure know and
apprehend GOD the Father (the only true GOD) to be our God and our Father, and
Jesus Christ whom he has sent to be our Savior. Joh. 17.3.20.17. Phil. 3.8,
9. It is that whereby we know and find our selves sinful, vile, and lost in
our selves; but found and saved in and by our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom is all
fullness of grace and salvation for us. Luke 19.10. Phil. 3.7, 8, 9. Joh. 1.16.
Acts 4.10 12.

Quest. What is the second Sacramental grace, viz. True repentance?

Answ. It is not a mere lip-profession of repentance, as the world takes it; as
to cry God mercy after an oath, and to swear again; to cry alas, and say we are
sorry for our sins, and it may be shed tears over them, and yet go on still in
the willing allowance and Commission of them, as those in Isa. 1.12, 13. etc.
58.3. etc. with Jer. 3.4, 5. and 7.9, 10.

Quest. What is it then?

Answ. It is that grace of God, whereby we have a true sight and feeling of our
sins not in general only, but in particular, [as 1 Samuel 12.19. Neh. 1.6, 7.
Romans 7.7. etc.] joined with an hearty confession of them unto God, serious
contrition, and sorrow for them, a sincere loathing, and an utter leaving and
forsaking of them. Ps. 32.5.51, 4. Ezekiel. 7.16. Zech. 12.10. 2 Cor. 7.10. Ezekiel.
36.31. Prove. 28.13. Hos. 14.8. this is that true repentance here required.

Quest. What is new obedience?

Answ. It is that grace of God whereby we resolve with purpose of heart to set
upon all those duties which God requires. [Whether of Piety, or charity, in
secret, private, or publike] Acts 11.23. with Josh. 24.15. It is to do, yea to
delight to do what ever God will have us do, and to shun what ever God will
have us shun. Act. 9.6. Psalm. 40.7, 8. and 119.101. 1 Pet. 3.10. In a word it
is to become a new creature. 2 Cor. 5.17.

Quest. What is that lively faith, which is the fourth Sacramental grace?

Answ. It is that special grace of God given to his elect, whereby they go out
of themselves, as being vile and lost sinners in themselves, and rest wholly
and only upon Jesus Christ and Gods free mercy in him for their salvation. Acts
16.30, 31. Ephesians. 2.8. Tit. 1.1, 2.

Quest. But every drunkard and swearer, etc. will say they have faith; and hope
to be saved by Christ as well as the best, what would you say to such? for all
have not faith. 2 These. 2.2.

Answ. I would say as the Apostle James does Jam 2.14, 17, 18. What does it
profit my brethren, though a man say he has faith, and have not works, can
faith save him? etc. again, faith if it has not works is dead being alone, etc.

Quest. But how may we know whether our faith be true, yea or not?

Answ. We may know it by two things.

1. By the nature. and:

2. By the effects, or operations of it.

Quest. How may we know it by the nature of it?

Answ. Thus: It will empty us and carry us out of our selves, and our own lost
estates, to rest and quiet our souls, wholly and only in, and upon Jesus Christ
for our salvation, as Acts 16.30, 31. 1 Cor. 1.30. So to rest on him for
temporals as well as spirituals. Psalm. 23.1.

Quest. What are the effects or operatis ons of it?

Answ. These three.

1. It is a living, not a dead faith. Heb. 2.4. Gal. 2.20. [The soul that has
it, must live by it spiritually, i.e. by drawing spiritual life and influence
from Christ, and not swear by it, as too many do.]

2. It is a working (or loving) not an idle faith; it works by love to God, his
people, Word, and Ordinances. Gal. 5.6. Jam. 2.18. with Psalm. 119.97. etc. It
is like Dorcas, full of good works, Acts 9.

3. It is a purifying and holy, not a filthy and unholy faith. Act. 15.9. 1 John 3.3. 2 Cor. 7.1. etc. it is holy in it self, and makes those pure and holy
that partake of it, Jude 20. Like a good housewife that makes all clean where
she comes; so faith. Ibid. Acts 15.9.

By these we know our faith to be the true faith of Gods elect; but if these be
wanting, it is an illusion of Satan, mere presumption, not faith.

Quest. What is that thankfulness which is here required?

Answ. it is not a mere lip-devotion, but a pious and hearty acknowledgment of
the great love of Jesus Christ in dying for us, with answerable desires and
resolutions (by Gods grace) to do and suffer any thing for Jesus Christ, who
has done and suffered so much for us: as, Psalm. 103.1, 2, 3. and 116.13. Rev.
1.5. and 12.11. Acts 5.41. and 21.13.

Quest. What is the last piece of this wedding garment, viz. Charity which is
here required to be put on by us, over and above all the rest, as being the
bond of perfection? Col. 3.14.

Answ. It is that gracious affection of soul, where we must have a true,
tender, and compassionate love to all, viz to wicked men, and enemies, as well
as others, I mean unto their souls, not sins; as Mat. 5.44.45. But especially
to the household of faith, the Communion and fellowship of the Saints, Gal.
6.10. Ephesians. 4.32. Joh. 15.12. 1 John 5.1. etc. Where there is most of God,
there must be most of our love, and dearest affection. Psalm. 16.3. Phil. 1.1.
and 4.1. 1 John 5.1.

So we that have one and the same God and father, the same Christ, spirit,
baptism, table, faith, hope heaven, etc. should have the same most intimate
love, and dear affection in Christ Jesus to one another, desiring and seeking
the good and Salvation of each other as our own. Ephesians. 4.3, 4, 5, 6. Phil.
2.1, 2, 4. 1 These. 2.7, 8. These are the sacramental graces or wedding garment
to be put on, by way of preparation before we come.

Quest. What is the second thing required of those that would be worthy and
welcome partakers of this Ordinance?

Answ. A right disposition and behavior of themselves when they come.

Quest. How is this proved?

Answ. This is required in all our approaches unto God, so here especially; See
Psalm. 2.11, 12. and 95.1, 2, 3, 6. Eccles. 5.1, 2. Mal. 1.11. As if we were
invited to some great man's table, we would behave our selves seemly, and
sutably to so great a presence: so we being invited to the table of the great
King of Heaven and earth. Mat. 22.2, 11.

Quest. Wherein does this right disposition or behavior of our selves, consist?

Answ. In these 6. particulars. viz.

1. In demeaning our selves humbly, without high-conceitedness. Mic. 6.8. Romans
7.24. 1 Timothy 1.15.

2. Reverently, without rudeness, Eccles. 5.1. Mal. 1.11, 12, 14.

3. Intensively, without distractedness, wholly minding the business which we
came about, scil. to feed (in our selves) upon Jesus Christ. Joh. 6.27.

4. Sincerely, and heartily without feignedness. Pro. 23.26. Isa. 29.13. Romans
10.9, 10.

5. Divinely, and spiritually, without earthliness, Exodus 12.24, 27. 1 Cor.
11.25, 26.

6. With renovation of our Covenant, both of Faith, and obedience toward God,
and love unto the Saints without back-slidingness, Cant. 2.16. and 6.3. with
Exodus 24.3, 7, 8. 1 Cor. 6.15. 1 These. 3.12. and 4.9, 10.

Qu. Pray open and explain the meaning of these 6 particulars a little more
fully, for the further benefit of your selves and others. First, How must we
demean our selves humbly without high conceitedness, when we approach unto God
in this Ordinance?

Answ. We may conceive it thus, viz. By lying low in our own eyes, and in the
eyes of God, in true sense and feeling acknowledgment of our own sinfulness,
vileness, and unworthiness, of the least mercy in our selves, (having so often
slighted, and abused mercy) and worthiness of the greatest shame and misery;
and therefore we look upon it as a most high mercy of our God unto us, that we
who are such vile, unworthy wretches, should be admitted to gather up the
crumbs under his table: as in the confessions of Jacob, David, Daniel, Paul,
and that precious Canaanitish woman. Genesis 32.10. 1 Chronicles. 17.16. etc. Dan. 9.7,
8. Ephesians. 3.8. Mat. 15.27.

Quest. How may we demean our selves reverently without rudeness?

Answ. By setting our selves as in the presence of the great King of heaven and
earth; before whom the very Angels hide their faces, and the Elders cast down
their Crowns to give him glory, Isa. 6.1, 2. etc. Rev. 4.10, 11.

Quest. How intensively, without distractedness?

Answ. By applying our selves wholly to the business which we go about; which
is not to feed our bodies, but our souls, and that with the body and blood, the
precious merits and excellencies of Jesus Christ, As a man invited to a feast,
comes not to gaze, but to eat. So we to feed upon Jesus Christ.
that meat which endures to everlasting life. Joh. 6.27. It is to suck life and
salvation from his bleeding wounds. Isa. 53.5, 6. Gal. 2.20. To get a rich
supply of all grace, as faith, hope, patience, humility, holiness,
heavenly-mindedness, sincere love to God, his word, people, Ordinances, etc.
from his fullness. Joh. 1.16. and 7.37, 38. etc. To gain strength against every
base lust, wandering desire, and against all our pride, envy, malice,
worldliness, etc. and gracious abilities to all holy duties. Compare 2 Cor.
12.7, 8, 9. with Phil. 4.13.

Quest. How sincerely and heartily, without feignedness?

Answ. This is done by performing every duty with our hearts; we must pray,
hear, confess, and bewail our sins with the heart; believe and close with
Christ in the heart. Pro. 23.26. Isa. 29.13. Joel 2.12, 13. Romans 10.9. Acts
8.37. etc. not to say we repent, and bewail our sins, and yet were never sorry
for them, or sensible of them, or did ever resolve to leave them: so to say we
believe in Jesus Christ, and yet our hearts are far from him, we were never
taken off from our sins, or from the creature, or carried out of our selves to
rest on him. This is to take the name of the Lord our God in vain, Against the
third Commandment. Exodus 20.7
to sin against him with aggravation: we had need to take heed of sinning there
where we come to confess: bewail and ask pardon for our sin See Isa. 1.13, 14.
etc.
Jer. 3.4, 5. and cap. 7.8, 9, 10.

Quest. How divinely and spiritually, without earthliness?

Answ. By raising our hearts to high and holy meditations in the outward
Sacramental signs and actions of this Ordinance, and thereby feeding and
solacing our souls with the inward grace of Christ herein presented to us.
Exodus 12.24. etc. 27. 1 Cor. 11.25, 26. As for example, 1. When we see the
Minister in the name of Christ setting apart the bread and wine; then Meditate
on Gods gracious act, of setting apart his Son Jesus Christ, for the work of
our Redemption. Joh. 3.16.

2. When he blesses the bread, then let us lift up our souls to bless God for
Jesus Christ. Luke 1, 68. etc. Ephesians. 1.3. etc.

3. When we see the bread broken, and the wine poured out in this Ordinance,
then think with our selves, even thus was the blessed Body of Jesus Christ
broken and crucified for us, and his precious blood poured out for us, viz. For
me and thee in particular. Isa. 53.5, 6. 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. Gal. 2.20. Rev. 1.5.
etc.

4. When the Minister gives unto us the Bread and Wine, then think, thus does
God freely offer and give unto us Jesus Christ. Isa. 9.6. Joh. 3.16.

5. When we receive the Bread and Wine by the hand of the body; then stretch
we out our special faith, which is as the hand of the soul, to receive and
apply Jesus Christ with all his precious Merits and Excellencies to our
everlasting good. Joh. 1.12.

6. When we feed upon the Bread and Wine by the mouth and stomach of our
bodies, then let us sweetly feed by faith upon Jesus Christ to the refreshing
and nourishing of our souls to everlasting life. See Joh. 6.51.53.54. etc. We
must take heed of sitting idly, or in a brown study, as our poor ignorant
people use to do; but let our hearts be wholly taken up with sweet meditations
of Jesus Christ and him crucified, and of Gods free and infinite love to us in
him, as presented to us in this Ordinance. 1 Cor. 2.2. Gal. 3.1. As John was
ravished in the spirit on the Lords day. Rev. 1.10. so we should be ravished in
the spirit at the Lords supper.

Quest. How must this be done with renovation of our covenant of faith, and
obedience toward God, and of love unto the Saints, without back-slidingness?

Answ. 1. We must renew our faith as the Spouse in the Canticles, by closing
more intimately with Christ then ever; saying, I am my beloveds, and my beloved
is mine. Cantic. 2.16. and 6.3.

2. Our obedience to God, as Israel in Moses and Joshuahs time. Exodus 24.3.
etc. 7, 8. verses, with John 24.16, 17, 18. as we take the Lord to be our God;
so we must engage our selves (by grace assisting us) to be his people. And that
we will never swear, lie, steal, cozen, be drunk, profane his Sabbaths, slight
and despise his Ordinances, or break Covenant with him as we have done, either
by wilful commission of any sin, or neglect and omission of any duty: and
therefore this is called a Sacrament, or Military Oath, whereby, as soldiers
of old, did engage themselves to be true to their Captain, as well as he to
them: So we, in this Ordinance, do solemnly engage our selves to be true and
faithful to Jesus Christ, as well as he to us.

3. Our love unto the Saints, as David, Paul, and the Saints did to each other
of old, Psalm. 16.3. 2 Cor. 7.1, 3. Phil. 4.1. 1 These. 3.12. and 4.9, 10. Ephesians.
1.15. So we must now resolve (by the grace of Christ) that there shall be more
true love, and mutual dear affections between us that are members of the same
body, united by the same Spirit, partakers of the same Table, professors of the
same faith and hope, and to be heirs of the same Kingdom, then ever there has
been. Ephesians. 4.3, 4, 5. etc. and that we will not admit of any more unchristian
bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, or evil speaking, or any malice,
heart-burnings, or unbrotherly jealousies against one another, or strifes and
contentions with each other as heretofore: Genesis 13.8.
Ephesians. 4.31, 32. And therefore this is fitly called the Sacrament of our
Communion with Christ by faith, and in him with each other by the bonds of
Love. 1 Cor. 10.16, 17. and cap. 12.12, 13.

Quest. What is the third and last thing required of those, that would be
worthy and welcome partakers of this Ordinance?

Answ. A careful Christian carriage when they are gone, such as may in some
measure answer their sweet Communion with Jesus Christ. Col. 2.6, 7. As ye have
therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him, etc.

Quest. How must this be done?

Answ. These 4. ways. 1. Thankfully, without forgetfulness. Ps. 103.1, 2, 3.
and 116.12, 13.

2. Worthily, without baseness. Col. 1.10.

3. Thrivingly, without fruitlesness. 1 These. 4.1. 2 Pet. 3.18.

4. Hungringly, without fulsomness. Mat. 5.6.

Quest. Pray explain these 4. particulars a little more fully, for the better
knowledge and practice of them. 1. How may we carry our selves thankfully,
without forgetfulness, when we are gone from this Ordinance?

Answ. By stirring up our souls and all that is within us to bless the Lord
exceedingly, who has vouchsafed to invite, and admit us freely to his own
table, and to feed, and feast us with the precious merits and excellencies of
Jesus Christ. And although we deserve not the least crumb of mercy: nay,
deserve nothing but hell and misery in our selves, and to have Communion with
Devils, and damned spirits to all eternity; yet that he should please to take
us into blessed and intimate Communion with himself. Oh! what should we render
to the Lord for this? We can never be sufficiently thankful to him for so
great a mercy. Ps. 116.12.13. Ephesians. 1.3. etc.

Quest. How Worthily without Baseness?

Answ. By behaving our selves suteably to so high a privilege. Col. 1.10. As a
man who is admitted to feast at a great man's table, will not away with base
inferior company, and course or nasty diet. So we being admitted into high
Communion with Jesus Christ, and to feast upon his precious excellencies,
should loath our former vain, and base companionships with drunkards, swearers,
etc. and to feed upon the filth of our own lusts, pride, malice, etc. 1 Cor.
6.15. 2 Cor. 6.14, 15.

Quest. How thrivingly, without fruitlesness?

Answ. By getting strength and growth in every grace, as in faith, hope,
repentance, humility, holiness, heavenlymindedness, love, patience, etc. and
more power against our spiritual enemies, as sin, Satan, etc. 1 These. 4.1. 2
Pet. 3.18. Ephesians. 6.10. etc. 1 Pet. 5.8, 9. etc. As a man that has been at a
feast, becoms more strong (...) for his work; so we in the wor^^ of Jesus
Christ.

Quest. How hungeringly, without fulsomness?

Answ. By earnest desires and resolution to come again as God shall give us
opportunity, 1 Cor. 11.26. As a travellour that has a great journey to go,
baits often. So we having a great journey, to go from earth to heaven, to the
heavenly Canaan, the new Jerusalem, we must feed upon Christ often in this
Sacrament, till we grow up in him who is our head, unto a perfect man, unto the
measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Ephesians. 4.13, 15. And so at
length obtain the end of our hopes, the everlasting salvation of our souls. 1
Pet. 1.9. Gloria sola Deo.

FINIS.
