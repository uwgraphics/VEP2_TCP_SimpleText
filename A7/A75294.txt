A DECLARATION OF THE WITNESS OF GOD Manifested in me from my YOUTH.
FRom my Youth I was made sensible of something in me which was contrary to
God: but that which made it manifest I knew not to be of God; although it was
the seed of God in me which was Light, which made manifest my deeds to be
wrought in darkness: for from that time that I was ten years of age, I knew
Sin: but I knew not God: yea and before that time I knew it, but in many years
after I knew not God: for when I would Lie, there was something within me which
told me lying was a sin, and swearing was a sin, and evil speaking, and
deceitful dealing, and fighting, and backbiting, and such like was contrary to
God; and it did not only discover such and such names of things unto me which
were eivell, but it made the nature of them manifest unto me when they were
acted, either by my self or others: this showed me that Lying was to speak
falsely, Drunkeness, was to drink too much, and so sorth; and when I had Lied,
then it would reprove me, or dealt deceitfully, it would lay open it to me, so
that at all times when I co^mited evil this was ready to Condemn me, and this
was always contrary to the evil and many times Terrors of endless Torments
was laid before me: insomuch that I was restrained many times from accompanying
with my familiers, and delighted to be alone: and something in me desired to
know God: this I witnessed before I knew the Letter of the Scripture: but as I
grew in years, I grew in wickedness, and the wicked one grew stronger and
stronger in me, and the just grew weaker and weaker: So that I came to delight
more and more in sin, and that which before reproved me, I found to be dead,
then all my delight was in drunkenness, and uecleanness and was given up to
Commit sin with greediness: yet at some times I was shown what I had don: But
that which made manifest I knew no^ After this I began to give some heed to the
Priests of the World and heard them declare of a God and of a Christ which must
be believed in for Salvation, and through Faith I must be saved, and Faith was
to believe that Christ was the Son of God, and that he was Crucified for our
sins, and rose again for our Justification, and then I began to search the
Scriptures and I grew up in the knowledge of the Letter, and did believe
according as the Priests told me, and there I thought my self to be safe, for
when I was Convinced of sin in my Conscience, I was not long without a remedy,
for there was not any promise in the Scripture which was to believers, but I
could aply them unto my self because I did believe that Christ dyed at
Jerusalem and was buried, and the third day rose again etc. In this State I
continued for some years, yet still taking pleasure in unrighteousness: but
could speak much of the Letter of the Scripture, at the last I came amongst a
people called Anabaptists and was diligent in hearing them, and was much taken
with their words: and desired to be in fellowship with them, which was granted
me; then newness of Life was required of me, by something within me which I knew
not, but in that state I was not able to attain unto it, and although I was
Baptized with water, yet repentance from dead works I could not witness; but I
grew much in the wisdom and became a speaker amongst them: Yet that which I
Preached down in others, was upheld within my self; and so whilst I preached to
others I was Condemned my self by that in my Conscience; for that told me sin
was alive in me, and that I was under the power of darkness, and many times
when I was tempted to Commit uncleanes something within me would show me the
Tempter, and the temptation; yet I found not any power to resist it: but with
violence of lust was carried away to Commit it, and then something within me
would mourn and groan under these Abominations so that sometimes Tears would
proceed from mine eyes, yet a remedy I knew not, for that eye with which I
should have beheld my Savior was blinded by the God of this world: and in this
State I was Chosen to be an Elder, because of my Wisdom in the Letter: and
when I was so, there was none so forward as I to condemn Sin, and yet my self
the greatest sinner, and would condemn them for not washing according to the
rule, meaning the Scripture; whilst I my self was Condemned in my Conscience
to be an Enemy to God: Then many times the Saints faillings would be presented
unto me, to comfort me in that State, and therein many times I took Courage
and comforted my self in wickedness: which I acted privately, then as I grew
higher in my wisdom I began the more to conform to the Letter of the
Scripture for the Scripture declared against anger, then I began to abstain
from it outwardly; and uncleanness, filthyness, and deceit outwardly, and pride
outwardly, and so many of the branches of Sin were Cropped off: but the Root and
ground from whence it proceeded was not moved for when my will was crossed I was
filled with anger, and that remained in my heart and Lust had its abideing
place within me, and my heart was puffed up with Pride: and deceit lodged within;
and yet in this State I could speak of Saints, and of washing and clensing,
and purifying by the Blood of Christ, Redemption, and Justification
Sanctification, and Holiness, all these things I could speak of, and so the
deceit which was out of the Life of the Saints, in the Curse got the Saints
words for a Covering, and persuaded me that there was no freedom from Sin
until I was dead, and then that faith which I had while I lived, by that I
should be saved when I was dead: So that Faith which purifyeth the heart I was
a Stranger to, and always when the witness of God Convinced me of Sin in my
Conscience the deceit drew out my mind from it, to look upon a Christ without
me: and to mind the Scripture to be my rule, then many times it would be
manifested to me wherein I walked Contrary to the Scripture, and contrary to
the Saints walkings; then the deceit would persuade me that the Scripture did
not declare how they did walk, and how they were, but how they should walk;
and how they should be, but never any of them did attain to what they should
be; and therefore Christ dyed, that his Righteousness might be Imputed unto us,
and so we only believing in that should be saved; and so God did not look upon
us as we were sinners, but he looked upon us through his Son who had borne his
indignation for us, and this was my Covering: And the Enemy got a place of
abode within unmolested; and was transformed into an Angel of Light, Crying up
the Ordinances of Christ, the Ordinances of Christ, Baptism, and breaking of
Bread; and all that were not in this way were Judged to be in the Kingdom of
Satan, And out of the way of Christ. And so with the Saints words I was
painted, but to the Life of the Saints I was a stranger: for the Cross of
Christ I knew not, but the enmity remained alive within me by which I was shut
out from God, and his Covenant of Light I knew not, yet in this state I was
called a Minister of the Gospel: and an Administrator of the Ordinances of
Christ, when I was a stranger to his Light, and an Elder of the Church, when I
never witnessed a Child's State. And so in this condition I continued, having a
high Conceit of my self and outwardly many evils I had left, with which the
world lived in; because the Scripture declared against them, and not because I
had a Light within me, which witnessed for God against them, but was a Sranger
to it and yet in my fallen wisdom which was sensual and devilish I had got
the Saints words to speak of, but the spirit which they had, by which they
gave them forth I knew not not; And so in this Nature which is estranged from
God, and is an enemy to him was our fellowship, and being in this Nature we
called our selves a Church of Christ, and Saints, when I knew not what a living
Stone was: And I being in this State, many times that in my Conscience would
tell me that I was not a member of Christ, for I never witnessed the new Birth,
and sometimes this would strike Terror in me, and then it would be presented
unto me that an Elder must be blameless, and that in my Conscience would lay
open the wickedness of my heart, and let me know that I was not blameless, and
that would let me see that the hand of the Lord was against me for I had only
the form of Godliness, but power I wanted by which Sin might be overcome, and
the good I was a Stranger to with which I should overcome evil, as says the
Scripture: Be not overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good; and so Sin
had Dominion, evil thoughts had Dominion Luft and Anger etc. And although I
had Cropped off many branches in my will that my profession might not be shamed
before the world, (which made it so much the more deceitful, because of its
fair outside) yet the Root remained and the earth stood by which it was
nourished, and the Ax was never laid to the Root, no it never came near it,
but there it stood firm unmolested for the Devil had persuaded me I should
never be freed from Sin whilst I lived, and much less from evil thoughts, and
I believed him, for he had made me blind that I saw nothing to the contrary;
and so in the height of my profession whilst I said I was a Jew, my heart was
the Sinagogue of Satan, and that he might get a peaceable habitation to Reign
as (...) within me. He taught me to look without me, for Salvation and take
the Prophets words, and the Saints words to be my rule; for he persuaded me
that there was no other rule in these days, or way to know God; then that
which they had left in writing, so he having persuaded me herein, he obtainted
his end; for I looking out with my first nature and falen wisdom (run) unto
the Letter of the Scripture, and so in that nature which is under the power of
the devil and accursed from God, I had got a profession of words; and so I fed
upon wind, but all this while the devil had his desire; for the seed of God
which was Light within me, which let me see my Sin I knew not, though something
convinced me of Sin, yet I knew not what it was; for the God of the world, who
ruled in my heart had blinded my Eye, with which I should have seen my
Redeemer; and so the seed of God was kept in Captivity, and death reigned even
over that which had not transgressed, and the beloved of God (the Light) was
delivered into the hand of the devourer; and the Just was opressed: And so
whilst I had took upon me the Name of a Saint I was an Enemy to God: Look
(here you highest of professors behold this is your state) at last the Lord was
pleased to begin his work in me, and did let me see that the longer we
continued in our profession, the more wickedness and Confusion we grew into,
and there was scarce any Sin that was Committed by the world: but it was to be
found amongst us, who called our selves Saints; as Pride, Covetousness, Lust,
Envy, Eivill-speaking, Anger, Lying, Vaine-Jesting, Idle-talking etc. That in
stead of growing up in purity, we wrew up in Impurity; differing nothing from
the World, only in our profession, then I saw the vanity of all profession, and
being out of all profession. Yet I knew not that which showed me the Vanity of
it; for the wicked one having possession of my heart, kept my mind from that
which showed me the deceit of my heart, and the deceit of all profession; and
persuaded me that there was no God; and led me out into liberty to follow my
own hearts lust; but still there was something within me though very low which
did bear witness against Sin, but I knew not what it was although many times I
was terrifyed with it, but it was his everlasting love that in this State I
continued not long; for there being one who was sent by the Lord to declare his
name whose Ministry I witness to be of God declared: that that which Convinced
man of Sin, was the light of Christ with which he had enlightened every man that
Comes into the world, and this Doctrine peirced through me, yea it peirced
through the earth and never ceased until it read^ed the witness which lay in
the grave under death which was covered with earth, this heard the voice, and
knew the voice, and owned the voice, and did arise out of the grave, then that
which had kept it in bondage even the same which had got the Saints words to
speak of, and had made a profession was dismayed, and fearesulness laid hold
upon that nature, and that would have fled from the presence of the Light but I
turning my mind to within to the Light, saw my self poluted, a den of
Thieves, a Cage of unclean Birds, a habitation for Dragons; and the Sinagog of
Satan: Then did the Just arise in fury and indignation then was the Sword
drawn, and made ready for the slaughter, and the everlasting Arm was streched
out against the heathen to cut down and to destroy, and make desolate that
great City Babylon, which had laid Gods heretage waste; then did he arise in
his power, and did slay on the right hand, and destroy on the left; then did
her young Men fall in the Streets, and her Men of War were Cut off, and her
strong ones did faint, and her mighty ones were dismayed before the presence of
the Lamb that was dead and is alive, and lives for ever more; for his hand
did not spare neither did his eye pity, until he had avenged himself of his
adversaryes, and had gotten himself a Name above all Names; and so keeping my
mind to that of God, which was manifested in me, I Came to see the giving out
of the Law, which was dreadful to that Nature which had Sinned, which Law was
Light, by which Light, I saw my self, and my nakedness was discovered, and
Gods Judgments made manifest against the transgressor; then rotenness possessed
my Bones, and my flesh did stink, and a noysom sore brak-forth upon me, and all
my joy was turned into mourning and bitter Lamentation; for there was no way to
escape the Sword, if ever I came to the tree of Life; for it turned every way,
and the seven Thunders uttered their voices, and the seven Plagues was
powered forth upon that Nature the man of Sin: So here I came to witness the
Lord to enter into the house of the Thief, and to be a swift witness against
the Sorcerer and all evil doors. And so as I kept my mind to the Light, I
came to witness my redemption and the first Nature to be destroyed, for as I
came to mind the Light, I minded the Law of God which Law is Light, which Law
I found written in my heart, and so keeping my mind to that which discovered
Sin, I received power against Sin, and my mind being kept to that, mine eye
was single and my whole body was full of Light, so that I could see the enemy,
and comprehend his wiles, and see the temptation, and see that Nature which had
joynded and would join with the tempter, but standing in the Light, I stood in
that which crossed that Nature and did abide in the Counsel of God, and through
this Cross that nature was slain, and a dying to Sin, I came to witness through
the Light and I had no more need to be taught of Men or to look without me for
a theacher, for this showed me what was good; and what the Lord had required of
me, and when I looked out and gone from it, this would reprove me, and let me
see wherein I had offended and this would rise up in Judgment against the
offender and I keeping my mind to it the wicked could not escape, nor the
deceiver could not be hid, for the things of Esau were searched out, and his
hiden things sought up, and I found the Lord watching over me to pluck up and
to throw down, and to make waste the habitabion of Esau, and here I came to
witness a Disciples state, for my mind being kept to the Light, I was upon my
watchtower, and there I could see the Enemy, for the Light made him manifest
and every vain thought was brought to Judgment, and the house of Joseph was a
flame, and the house of Esau as sttubble, and the house of David grew stranger
and stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker; and here I came to
know the terrors of the Lord against that which had sinned and the Man-Child
came to be borne, which nothing could satisfy but the Bread of Life: and God
gave me Manna from heaven, fro it to feed upon, and it was fed and grew strong
in Battle, so that he slew on the righ hand, and destroyed one the left; and
his Name became dreadful to his adversaries, for all judgment was given unto
him, and as he did over come, then pure joy would arise and the living would
praise him from whom deliverance came. And here I came to witness Faith by
which my heart was purified, and by which I overcame the world, which faith is
the gift of God, to which faith, in the highest of my profession I was
reprobate as all the worlds professions are, for I only believed because it was
Written; and so my fallen wisdom and first Nature which is accursed being sound
in the transgression believed the report of a thing as of God and Christ
without me, but I did not believe in the Light as Christ Commanded who says
believe in the Light, that you may be Children of the Light, but to this Light
I was a stranger and an Enemy, my mind being alianated from it, looking for a
Savior without me, when when the Enemy of my happiness which alone I had need
to be saved from, was within (O! all professors read your conditions) and so
the door to the Father which is the Light, I was an Enemy unto, and so an
Enemy to God being an Enemy to his Light; for how could I be reconciled to God
whilst I was condemned for Sin in my Conscience by that measure of Light which
he had given me to walk by, which is a measure of himself that Condemned me,
then how could I be justified by him who is one with his Light, and so the
reconciliation which the Saints witnessed I knew not, until my Sin came to be
taken away by Christ, the Light; then I came to witness Salvation by Jesus who
saved me from mine Enemy, mine Enemy was Sin, he saved me from Sin, the sting
of death is Sin, in saving me from Sin I was freed from death, and the strength
of Sin is the Law; in saving me from Sin, the righteousness of the Law was
fulfilled in me, who walked not after the flesh. Take notice the flesh did not
lead me but after the spirit; Take notice again by the spirit I was led, and
and the spirit is Light which leads not into Sin, but into righteousness, and
being led by the spirit I had peace with God; the spirit is Light, following
the light, obeying ths light, believing in the light, I was by the light
reconciled to God, and by Christ the light, the middle wall of Partition was
broken down and he was my Peace, the light. Hear all you professors of the
World are shut out, whose mind is from the light, he is not your peace whilst
you commit Sin, for Sin is reproved by the light, and that which is reproved is
made manifest by the Light.
