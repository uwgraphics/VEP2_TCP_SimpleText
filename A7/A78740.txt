His MAJESTY'S Declaration To all His loving Subjects, of His true Intentions
in advancing lately to Brainford.
THough Our Reputation be most dear to Us, and especially in those cases
wherein the truth of Our most solemn Professions (and by consequence of Our
Christianity) is questioned, yet it is not only for the Vindication of that,
and to clear Our Self from such Aspersions, but withal to preserve Our
Subjects in their just Esteem of, and Duty to Us, and from being engaged into
Crimes and Dangers by those malicious reports, so spitefully framed and
cunningly spread against Us concerning Our late advancing to Brainford, That We
have resolved to publish this Our following Declaration.

AT Colebrook, on Friday the 11th of November, We received a Petition from both
Our Houses of Parliament, by the Earl of Northumberland, the Earl of Pembrooke
and Montgomerie, the Lord Wenman, Master Perpoint, and Sir John Hippisly: And
indeed We were well pleased to see it so much liker to a Petition, then the
other Papers We had often of late received under that Name, and returned to it
the next day so gracious an Answer, that We assure Our selves could not but be
very satisfactory to all that were truly lovers of Peace. The copies of both do
here follow.

To the Kings most Excellent Majesty,
The humble Petition of the Lords and Commons now assembled in Parliament.
WE Your Majesty's most loyal Subjects the Lords and Commons in Parliament
assembled, being affected with a deep and piercing sense of the miseries of
this Kingdom, and of the dangers to Your Majesty's Person, as the present
Affairs now stand, and much quickened therein with the sad consideration of the
great effusion of Blood at the late Battle, and of the loss of so many
eminent Persons: And further, weighing the addition of loss, misery, and
danger to Your Majesty and Your Kingdom, which must ensue, if both Armies
should again join in another Battle, as without Gods especial Blessing, and
Your Majesty's concurrence with Your Houses of Parliament, will not probably be
avoided.

We cannot but believe, that a suitable Impression of tenderness and compassion
is wrought in Your Majesty's Royal Heart; being Your Self an eyewitness of
the bloody and sorrowful destruction of so many of Your Subjects; And that
Your Majesty does apprehend what diminution of Your own Power and Greatness
will follow, and that all Your Kingdoms will thereby be so weakened, as to
become subject to the attempts of any ill-affected to this State. In all which
respects, we assure our selves that Your Majesty will be inclined graciously
to accept this our humble Petition, that the misery and desolation of this
Kingdom may be speedily removed and prevented. For the effecting whereof, we
most humbly beseech Your Majesty to appoint some convenient place, not far
from the City of London, where Your Majesty will be pleased to reside, until
Committees of both Houses of Parliament may attend Your Majesty with some
Propositions for the removal of these bloody Distempers and Distractions, and
settling the State of the Kingdom, in such a manner, as may conduce to The
preservation of Gods true Religion; Your Majesty's Honor, Safety and
Prosperity; and to The Peace, Comfort, and Security of all Your People.

His Majesty's Answer to the aforesaid Petition.
WE take God to witness how deeply We are affected with the miseries of this
Kingdom, which heretofore We have stroven, as much as in Us lay, to prevent; it
being sufficiently known to all the world, That as We were not the first that
took up Arms, so We have showed Our readiness of Composing all things in a
fair way by Our several offers of Treaty, and shall be glad now at length to
find any such inclinations in others: The same tenderness to avoid the
Destruction of Our Subjects (whom We know to be Our greatest strength) which
would always make Our greatest Victories bitter to Us, shall make Us willingly
hearken to such Propositions whereby these bloody distempers may be stopped,
and the great distractions of this Kingdom settled, to Gods glory, Our Honor,
and the welfare and flourishing of Our People; And to that end shall reside at
Our own Castle at Windsor (if the Forces there shall be removed) till
Committees may have time to attend Us with the same (which, to prevent the
Inconveniences that will intervene, We wish may be hastened) and shall be ready
there (or if that be refused Us) at any place where We shall be, to receive
such Propositions as aforesaid, from both Our Houses of Parliament. Do you your
duty; We will not be wanting to Ours; God of his mercy give a Blessing.

BUt the same night after the Messengers were gone, certain information was
brought unto Us, That the same day the Earl of Essex had drawn his forces with
great store of Ordnance out of London toward Us, upon which a Council of War
being present, and We having there considered, upon debate, Our present
Condition, That being already almost surrounded by his forces, some at
Windsore, some at Kingstone, and some at Acton, If We ^ered the remainder to
possess Brainford, We should be totally hemmed in, and Our Army deprived of
all convenience of either moving or subsisting. Yet how necessary soever it
appeared, We could not obtain Our own consent to advance toward Brainford, and
either prepossesse it, or dispossess them of it, till We had satisfied Our
selves that it was as lawful as necessary, and fully weighed all, that not
only reason, but malice it self (which We knew to be very watchful upon Our
Actions) could object against it. We considered first that it could not
reasonably be esteemed an aversion from Peace, and an intention to interrupt
the Treaty then in expectation; Since on the other side We had cause to believe
by the former rejection of Our offers of Treaty, when We were supposed to be in
no condition of strength, That if We would not thus preserve Our Selves from
being so encompassed as to come into their Powers, the very possibility of a
Treaty would immediately vanish. We considered next, that much less could it
be interpreted any breach of Faith, since willingness to receive Propositions
of Treaty was never held to amount to a suspension of Arms; Since otherwise We
must (because mention of a Treaty had been once made) by the same Logic have
been bound not to hinder them to encompasse Us on all parts to Colebrook Towns
end; Since no word to that purpose (of any suspension) was in Our Answer; Nay,
since in that (by wishing their Propositions might be hastened, to prevent the
inconveniences which would intervene) We employed, that by this Arms were not
suspended; And since their own Votes of proceeding vigorously, notwithstanding
the Petition, and their own actions, in sending after their Messengers great
store of forces with Ordnance so near to Us (having before girt Us in on all
other parts, and sent men and Ordnance to Kingstone after the safe conduct
asked of Us) implied the same.

Being resolved upon these Reasons, That this advancing was necessary and just,
We were not yet satisfied till We had endeavored the same day (though the
interruptions of shooting stopped up the way till the next) to satisfy Our
Parliament and People of the same, and that Peace was still Our desire, We to
that end directed a Message by John White Esquire, which was so received, that
his danger of being put to death for bringing it, and the imprisonment of him
and the Trumpeter that went with him in the Gatehouse, showed that the very Law
of Nations was by some no more considered then all other Laws had been before.
A Copy of which Message hereafter follows, to show how little temptation the
matter of that gave them for such an usage.

His MAJESTY'S Message of the 12. of NOVEMBER.
WHereas the last night, being the eleventh of November, after the departure of
the Committee of both Our Houses, with Our gracious Answer to their Petition,
We received certain Information, (having till then heard nothing of it, either
from the Houses Committee or otherwise) That the Lord of Essex had drawn his
Forces out of London toward Us, which has necessitated Our sudden Resolution
to march with Our Forces to Brainford; We have thought hereby fit to signify
to both Our Houses of Parliament, That We are no lesse-desirous of the Peace of
the Kingdom, then We expressed in Our aforesaid Answer; The Propositions for
which We shall willingly receive where ever We are, And desire (if it may be)
to receive them at Brainford this night, or early to morrow morning; That all
possible speed may be made in so good a work, and all inconveniences,
otherwise likely to intervene, may be avoided.

ANd to justify yet further, that Our intention was no other then was here
professed, as soon as We were informed that the Earl of Essex his Forces were
departed from Kingstone, before any appearance or notice of further Forces from
London, (Our end of not being enclosed being obtained) We gave orders to quit
Brainford, and to march away, and possess that place.

We cannot but make one Argument more of the truth of Our Profession, that this
was all Our end, and that We had not the least thought, by so advancing, to
surprise and sack London, (which the malignant Party would infuse into that Our
City) And that is, That probably God Almighty would not have given such a
Blessing to Our journey, as to have assisted Us so both by Land and Water, as
with less then a third part of Our Foot, and with the loss but of ten men, to
beat two of their best Regiments out of both Brainfords, for all the great
advantage of their works in them, to kill him who commanded in chief, and kill
and drown many others, To take five hundred Prisoners, more Arms, eleven
Colors, and good store of Ammunition, fifteen pieces of Ordnance, (whereof We
sunk most that We brought not away) and then unfought with, and unoffered at,
nearer then by Ordnance, to march away, notwithstanding the great disadvantage
of Our Forces by the difficulties of the Passages, if He, who is the Searcher
of all hearts, and Truth it self, had not known the truth of Our Professions,
and the innocence of Our heart, and how far We were from deserving those
horrid Accusations of Falsehood, and Treachery cast so point blank upon Our own
Person, that it would amase any man to see them suffered to be printed in Our
City of London, if any thing of that kind could be a wonder, after so many of
the same, and how really they desire Accommodation, who upon this have Voted
they will have none.

These Our Reasons for this Action, This Our satisfaction sent for it, and this
Blessing of Gods upon it, will (We doubt not) clear Us to all indifferent
persons both of the Jesuitical Counsels, and the personal Treachery to which
some have presumed so impudently to impute it; And God so bless Our future
Actions, as We have delivered the truth of this.

The Answer of both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT, To His Majesty's Message of the
twelfth of November.
TO Your Majesty's Message of the twelfth of this Month of November, We the
Lords and Commons in Parliament do make this humble Answer; That this Message
was not delivered to us till Monday the 14th. We thought it a strange
Introduction to Peace, that Your Majesty should send Your Army to beat us out
of our Quarters at Brainford, and then appoint that place to receive our
Propositions, which, yet it plainly appears, Your Majesty intended not to
receive, till You had first tried, whether You could break through the Army
raised for the defense of this Kingdom and Parliament, and take the City being
unprovided and secure in expectation of a fair Treaty made to secure the City.
If herein Your Majesty had prevailed, after You had destroyed the Army, and
mastered the City, it is easy to imagine what a miserable Peace we should have
had, and whether those courses be suitable to the expressions Your Majesty is
pleased to make in Your Answer to our Petition, of Your earnestness to avoid
any further effusion of blood, let God and the world judge.

As for our Proceedings, they have in all things been answerable to our
Professions: we gave directions to the Earl of Essex to draw the Army under his
Command out of the City and Suburbs, before we sent any Message to Your
Majesty: So that part of it was inquartered at Brainford before the Committee
returned with Your Answer. And immediately upon the receipt thereof, that very
morning Order was taken that the Soldiers should exercise no act of hostility
against any of Your Majesty's people. We sent a letter by Sir Peter Killigrew
to know Your Majesty's pleasure whether you intended the like forbearance of
hostility. But the fury of Your Soldiers, thirsting after blood and spoil,
prevented the delivery of the letter. For coming upon Saturday in his way
toward Your Majesty as far as Brainford, he found them in fight there, and
could pass no further. God who sees our innocence, and that we have no aims,
but at his glory, and the public good, will (we hope) free Your Majesty from
those destructive Counsels who labor to maintain their own power by blood and
rapine, and bless our endeavors, who seek nothing, but to procure and
establish the Honor, Peace and Safety of Your Majesty and Kingdoms, upon the
sure foundation of Religion and Justice.

To the Answer of both HOUSES of Parliament to His Majesty's Message of the
twelfth of November, His Majesty makes this REPLY.
THat His Message of the twelfth, though not received by them till the 14th,
was sent to them first upon the same day upon which it was dated, and, meeting
with stops by the way, was again sent upon the thirteenth, and taken upon that
day at ten in the morning by the Earl of Essex, and though not to him directed,
was by him opened, so the slownesse of the Delivery is not so strange as the
stop of the Letter said to be sent by Sir Peter Killigrew, which His Majesty
has not yet received, but concludes from the matter expressed to have been
contained in that Letter (to wit, to know His Pleasure, whether He intended the
forbearance of Hostility) and by the Command of such forbearance said to be
sent to the Lord of Essex his Army, that no such forbearance was already
concluded, and consequently neither had His Majesty cause to suppose, that He
should take any of their Forces unprovided and secure in expectation of a fair
Treaty, neither could any Hostile Act of His Majesty's Forces have been a
course unsuitable to His expressions, much less could an endeavor to
prepossesse (for so He hoped He might have done) that Place, which might have
stopped the further March of those Forces toward Him (which, for ought appeared
to Him, might as well have been intended to Colebrook as to Brainford) and by
that the further effusion of blood, deserve that style.

His Majesty further conceives, That the printing so out of time of such a
Declaration, as their Reply to His Answer to theirs of the sir and twentieth of
May, but the day before they Voted the delivery of their Petition, and the
March of the Earl of Essex his Forces to Brainford so near to His Majesty,
when the Committee at the same time attended Him with a Petition for a Treaty,
the Earl of Essex being before possessed of all the other Avenues to his Army,
by his Forces at Windsore, Acton, and Kingstone, was a more strange
introduction to Peace, then for His Majesty not to suffer Himself to be coopt
up on all sides, because a Treaty had been mentioned, which was so really and
so much desired by His Majesty, that this Proceeding seems to Him purposely by
some intended to divert (which it could not do) that His Inclination.

That His Majesty had no intention to master the City by so advancing, besides
His Profession, which (how meanly soever they seem to value it) He conceives a
sufficient Argument (especially being only opposed by Suspicions and Surmises)
may appear by His not pursuing His Victory at Brainford, but giving Orders to
His Army to march away to Kingstone as soon as He heard that place was quitted,
before any notice or appearance of further Forces from London; Nor could He
find a better way to satisfy them before hand, that He had no such intention,
but that His desire of Peace, and of Propositions that might conduce to it,
still continued, then by that Message of the twelfth, for which care of His He
was requited by such a Reception of His Message and Messenger, as was contrary
at once both to Duty, Civilitie, and the very Customs, and Law of War, and
Nations, and such as theirs (though after this Provocation) has not found from
Him.

His Majesty wonders that His Soldiers should be charged with thirsting after
Blood, who took above five hundred Prisoners in the very heat of the fight, His
Majesty having since dismissed all the common Soldiers, and entertained such
as were willing to serve Him, and required only from the rest an Oath not to
serve against Him: And His Majesty supposes such most apt and likely to
maintain their Power by Blood and Rapine, who have only got it by Oppression
and Injustice; That His is vested in Him by the Law, and by that only (if the
destructive Counsels of others would not hinder such a Peace, in which that
might once again be the Universal Rule, and in which Religion and Justice can
only flourish) He desires to maintain it. And if Peace were equally desired by
them, as it is by His Majesty, He conceives it would have been proper to have
sent him such a Paper as should have contained just Propositions of Peace, and
not an unjust Accusation of His Counsels, Proceedings and Person. And His
Majesty intends to march to such a distance from His City of London, as may
take away all pretense of apprehension from His Army, that might hinder them in
all security from yet preparing them to present to Him, and there will be ready
either to receive them, or to end the pressures, and miseries, which His
Subjects to His great grief suffer through this War, by a present Battle.

FINIS.
