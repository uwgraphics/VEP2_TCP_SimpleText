A Proclamation for repealing and making void of all Letters of Marque or
Reprisall, and Commissions of that nature, granted before the first of July, in
the 18th year of His Majesty's Reign.
WHEREAS at several times before the first day of July in the Eighteenth year
of Our Reign, several Letters of Marque or Reprisall and Commissions of that
nature, have been granted to several Persons under Our Great Seal of England,
or under the Seal of Our Admiralty, giving them power thereby to set forth to
Sea one or more ship or ships Equipped, Victualled and Manned in Warlike
manner, and therewith to take, seize, or surprise the Ships Goods and
Merchandises of such Persons, Countries, or States as are limited or mentioned
in the said Commissions, for the satisfaction and reimbursment of such Person
or Persons to whom such Commissions were granted, of and for the Losses and
Damage which they had sustained at Sea or in Foreign Parts; and in
particular such Letters of Marque or Reprizall, or a Commission of that nature,
was granted before the said first day of July, unto one Gregory Clements of
London Merchant, and his Partners or Associates. And whereas the said Gregory
Clements, his Partners or Associates, and others to whom such Letters or
Commissions have bin granted as aforesaid, have had sufficient time to recover
their losses, and as We are credibly informed, have seized, and taken the
Ships, Vessels, Goods, and Merchandises of diverse Subjects of Our friends and
Allies, and have received full satisfaction for their Losses, and do shelter
themselves under the power of the Rebels, which are now in Arms against Us,
so that there is no means open for examination of what Goods, or Merchandises
have come to their hands, or have bin taken or seized by them, and yet still
they endeavor to make further use of those Commissions, or Letters of Marque
or Reprisall; We do therefore by this Our Proclamation, Publish and Declare
Our Will and Pleasure to be, To Repeal, Revoke, Determine, and make Void, all
Letters of Marque or Reprisall, and all Commissions of that nature, for letting
forth any ship or Ships, and taking of Prizes, granted at any time since
the beginning of Our Reign, before the said first day of July, in the said
eighteenth year of Our Reign, to the said Gregory Clements, his Partners or
Associates, or to any other person or persons, or to any Corporation or
Body-politique whatsoever, upon any pretense or suggestion whatsoever; And that
all such Commissions, and Letters of Marque or Reprisall granted within the
time aforesaid, and the force and effect of the same, be from henceforth
Revoked, Repealed, and absolutely void and determined; and accordingly We do
hereby Revoke, Repeal, Determine, and make void the same; And We do hereby
further publish and declare, That all prizes which shall at any time hereafter
be taken, and all Acts whatsoever which shall at any time hereafter be done or
Acted, by or under color or pretense of any such Commission, Letters of Marque
or Reprisall, granted within the time aforesaid, shall be taken, deemed and
adjudged as illegal and void, and without warrant or authority, and the person
or persons which shall take, act, or do the same to be punishable, as if such
Commissions, Letters of Marque or Reprisall, had never bin made or granted, any
Clause, Matter, or thing contained in any such Commission Letters of Marque or
Reprisall to the contrary here of not withstanding.

Given at Our Court at Oxford, the 19. day of December, in the Twentieth year
of Our Reign.
GOD SAVE THE KING.
