My Lord,
YOur letter of May 2. together with your Lordships, therein enclosed
Declaration, came to my hands the 27 of the same, being here delivered by the
Lady Dungar.

Concerning which you desire I should give my Resolution by some Gentl.
expressly employed to your Lordship, rather then by Letter, but I have fixed on
this course of writing rather, this being the way less subject to
misconstruction.

In that your Letter and Declaration, I find your Lordship resolved on a
Sessation, with the Rebels (grounded as is presented) on misgovernment in
England, and on those short supplies thence, made over to your Lordship, and
that Army under your command.

I pass by what causes those grievances pretended as from England, whereof,
as none here can be competent Judges, so, can I not conceive why the interest
in this Service may not be performed and prosecuted, without our over-neer
prying into the grounds or parts, in this more remote distractions, whereunto
none here are called out, as to be engaged.

As for your Lordships discouragements in the service, in your so great want of
supplies, and for so long time, I have my Lord, labored under the same
perplexities, being every way, and as long, and as nearly pinched with the like
evils. Yet as nothing of all that want, though much more, could draw me to
resolutions of expecting a subsistence from the Rebels, by compliance with
them: So, could I never cast the retarding of our supplies out of Engl. on any
sinister designs or disaffections of the Parliament toward us, but on the
home distractions rather of Engl. which I beseech God, the God of peace, to
make up, as in his good time I nothing doubt, but he will perfectly do.

The good beginning whereof, even now very hopefully appearing, and we hear at
present gathering the comfortable fruits thereof, in those plentiful supplies
designed for us, and more daily expected. And I am very confident your Lordship
had before now found the like, and as fully, had not those obstructions bin
most unhappily cast in, which I doubt not but your Lordship may yet remove in
your timely application to the Parl. which I most heartily desire you would
do, and wherein you cannot want those in Engl. who will very really and
effectually serve you. As to those your Invitations given me, for running that
course in joining with the Irish in Lemster and Munster; may be avenged the
blood of those in whose quarrel we have fought; and those just ends
accomplished which we ever proposed to our selves. The Lord Taffe and his
adherents being content to subscribe (as your Lordship says) in Declaration
for His Majesty, and a free Parliament in Engl. Your Lordship also adding; that
upon perfection of the Articles between you; provisions should be made for me
or any of the Protestant profession who shall adhere to the agreement. Wherein
I am nothing satisfied how the Munster and Lemster Rebels (being by their Oath
of association; professed enemies of the Protestant Religion) and involved in
the same guilt of blood equally with others of their party; and appearing in
the present horrid Rebellion, and that principally and above others of that
party in other Provinces; should be thought notwithstanding fit instruments to
avenge the blood of those in whose quarrel we have fought, and for
accomplishing those just ends by the Parl. propounded.

As for my self therefore; I shall rather hazard; that in your Lordships
Declaration of your resolution to your best power; to give opposition to all
such as shall not cooperate with you in this your intended way. For; as I
nothing fear any opposing powers; God assisting me in his own cause; so shall
no advantages; or by-respects whatsoever; draw me off from that principle of
fidelity; whereunto I am resolved to stand unmovable: In order whereunto

I am my Lord, Your Lordships Most humble servant. M. JONES.

For the Lord Inchequin.
The Declaration of the Lord Marquisse of Clanrickard.
Whereas I have often before now: since the beginning of the commotion;
interposed my best indevors without regard of fortune; pains; or health; by all
the ways I could possibly conceive (for integrity and candor of intention
therein, I appeal to God the true searcher of hearts) for the composing the
grieving; and still growing distractions of this kingdom; my Native Country;
and to reduce the same and the interest of religion; loyalty; and just
liberties; thereby pretended; to the best and happiest condition I could; being
constantly of opinion that a long continuance of war; would at last prove
fatal and ruinous to the Natives (as by the present woeful experience of
dearth; famine; and civil contentions does to every one appear) then
destructive to the foresaid; by them pretended; protested and sworn ends;
though through mine own and the Natives sins: or some secret judgment of God;
produced no other effect then the increasing of jealousies and
misconstructions; which at length forced me into the resolution of banishingmy
self from my Native Country; and all that was dear unto me therein* rather then
be a spectator of its increasing calamities; or at leastwise not to
intermeddle with its public affairs until their own ways and wilfulness
made them sensible of their omission and lost opportunities: Yet
notwithstanding the feeling sense I have of the now threatening ruins; or
rather present irrecoverable destructions; like to fall generally on all parts
of the kingdom; as well by the power and invasion of his Majesty's present; and
the kingdoms professed enemies; the Parliament of Engl. Forces; and their
adherents; as they yet stand in opposition to his Majesty's just rights and
authority, as by the sad effects of civil discord arising between the Natives
themselves; the consequence whereof (if not timely prevented by a speedy
reconciliation; or suppressing) will soon root out Religion; divert the due
course of Loyalty; and instead of just liberty bring slavery on the Subjects;
besides all kind of incident losses and miseries.

After a deep and serious consideration and recollection of the premises; and
especially of the desperate and deplorable condition this Province of Connought
is in now; questionless intended to be made the seat of War; and civil
dissension.

I do hereby declare my settled and unalterable resolution, to assume the
command in chief of the Forces of this Province, both by former commission
immediately derived from his Majesty, and the power and authority or the
Supreme Council of the confederate Catholics of this Kingdom, entrusted to
be over the party in this Province, by their Letters bearing date the twenty
eight of May last and do take upon me so far forth, as my ability can extend
the defense thereof, against all His majesty's known Enemies, and all other
unauthorized invaders, and intruders, until His Majesty's pleasure for the
happy settlement of this Kingdom, and advancement of his service be made
known.

I do likewise protest and declare, on the word and honor of a Peer, so God
vouchsafe to bless my actions and intentions, that even as I had grace of
being bred, and entrusted (as also my Ancestors before me) in the truth of the
Roman Catholic Religion, so I shall til death persevere in the same, and to
the uttermost of my power, by all just honorable and fit ways, advance the
same, and preserve its splendour, and lawful interest, and uphold and maintain
His Majesty's Rights, Power and Prerogatives, and of the Crown of England in
this Kingdom, preserve the Rights and due Liberties of the Subjects therein.

And I do further declare that I do fully agree and concur in opinion with
the supreme Council, and the Generality of this Kingdom, that the late
Cessation by them concluded, with the Lord Baron of Inchequeen is of present
great advantage to the Kingdom, and for the further advantage of these ends
above expressed, the said Council for quieting tender Consciences, having
provided by an appeal, in the behalf of the confederate Catholics, from the
Lord Nuntio, his proceeding in point of Ecclesiastical censures, and by him
allowed of, I shall endeavor to have the said Cessation accepted, and admitted
in all parts of this Province, according to the Directions and Orders of the
said Council, to those in authority over their party therein, and will to the
best of my power oppose any Forces, that shall attempt to enter into this
Province, and to suppress all persons, that shall presume to raise Forces
there in, without public Authority.

Given at Portumne June 10. 1648. Clanrickard.

A Declaration by Eugenious O Neale General of the confederate Catholics of
Ireland of the Forces of Ulster and the rest of the Commanders of the same
Forces.
WE might be held prodigal of our own honor and give occasion of suspicion of
our loyalty to our Sovereign if in the amidst of the multitude of calamities
and impostures that are belched forth against us, we should neglect to
appologize for our integrity, we have by free and full consent without any
reluctance, in the view of the whole World taken the oath of Assotiation
appointed by universal Vote, to be taken by all the Confederate Catholics of
Ireland, wherein we have manifested our Religion toward God, and secure our
loyalty toward our Sovereign, this Oath we have as frequently, and freely
iterated, as any the rest of our Confederates in this Kingdom, We have also
avowed that Solemn Protestation made by the Catholic Clergy of the same
confederacy, protesting to give unto Caesar what is due unto Caesar, and to God
what is due unto God, as we never resolve to violate this Oath and
Protestation, so do we resolve never to adhere to any that have, or shall
endeavor to suppress the one or the other, such boast most of loyalty, but
are most conscious of disloyalty, who have by this Cessation given to the Kings
sworn Enemies, two entire Counties in Munster, which were in the possession of
the confederate Catholics without receiving any assurance of his Loyalty or
the restitution of the same Counties after the expiration of the Cessation,
they have (as if they were Lords Paramount of the Subjects living) disposed as
well of the spiritualty as temporalty without the Subjects consent, and to the
use and maintenance of the Kings Enemies, Kilkenny and other quarters belonging
to the confederate Catholics, they have actually delivered unto that great
personage, whom their souls knew to be wholly disposed to betray the Kingdom,
unto the Parliament, unto this great parsonage, they do still adhere,
notwithstanding those horrid treasons committed in the delivering over to the
Parliam. the Castles of Dublin, Drogheda, Trime, Dundalke, all those Garrisons
remaining in his quarters: For him all industry is used to procure vast sums
of money, even in the Quarters of the confederate Catholics, by way of Loan,
morgage, and otherwise, as the 11th. and 12th Articles of the unwarant^ble
Cessation do abundantly insinuate, yet these would need be held Loyal
Subjects, and all others who oppose their smister practices though therein
bound by oath, must be held disloyal, if we have as freely and as often as
any other our fellow Catholics bound our selves with ligatures of Loyalty
since these commotions, unless the depraved judgment of the disloyal (to
choke their own crimes) will censure it disloyalty in us, to defend with
Christian resolution the freedom of our Religion, the Prerogatives of our
Sovereign, and Liberty of our Free borne Nation, whereby we are obliged unto
the present observance of this Oath and Protestation, The Sea apostolic, by
its apostolical Missions frequently exhorted us, and to second our endeavors
therein, has sent to the Catholic confederates frequent^ Subsidies, so far is
it from truth, that either his holiness or we, is against the Allegiance due
by Subjects unto their Sovereign, others who look upon state policy more then
Religion, and continue no longer in allegiance then the condition of time will
permit, have no longer adhered to their Sovereign, then while they were
necessitated, necessity being taken away they have sided with the Kings Enemies
(the Parliament) against their Sovereign, Ve auplice cord, unto such we may
not unless we wilfully violate our Oath, and adhere without some assurance of
their Loyalty and Engagement, not to prejudice the Catholic Faith, for which
two points the late Cessation made by the Malignant party, of the supreme
Council, and of the whole Clergy, has not so well provided as we could wish,
who for their own mischevous ends endeavor to set forward the same Cessation,
by blemishing our integrity, and by that means to draw upon us the indignation
of all such as either seemly or really are for His Maje. for not being capable
to move the heavens, to second their Designs, they make their recourse to
Archeron, unto these that truly and really adhere unto His Majesty, without
prejudicing of our Religion we do and ever shall adhere to those who only
counterfeit such adherents to avoid the Force of the Catholics we may not
adhere, and upon this resolution not only we, but all the confederat
catholics, together with these corporal Towns that christian-like resolved to
observe two branches of their Oath, denied to yield obedience on unreasonable
and prejudicial cessation, Therefore our Armies are taken to defend our selves
as well against those distressed exiled catholics that depend upon us against
all others that have actually declared themselves against his Majesty and are
known to continue still in resolution, beseeching the Lord of Hoastes who
penetrates the secrets of our hearts never to bless our Designs longer then
we intend truly and unfainedly, even without resp^ct of private ends, to
observe that command of our Lord Jesus, give unto Caesar, what is due unto
Caesar; and give unto God, what is due unto God, for accompishing whereof we
conjure all the confederate Catholics, together with those faithful Subjects,
of what Religion soever) that unfainedly adhere to His Majesty to join with
us against all Parliamentary Rebels and all factionists, who for their own ends
comply with them to the violation of their Oath, the prejudice of our
Sovereign, and ruin of the distressad Nation,
