LONDON, Printed for R. Smithurst, near Pye-corner 1648,

The Copy of a LETTER FROM APPLEBEY-CASTLE.
Right Honorable,
AFter Colonel General Ashton had relieved Cockermouth Castle with the
Lancashire forces, The English Horse would have entered Carlisle, but were not
permitted by those that were there before, where upon some of them dispersed
several ways, and the body of the Cavalry marched hither to Appleby, whither
Col. Genesis Ashton came against them, And found about 1000 besides the Garrison
Soldiers. They had 1200 Horse, but our Soldiers bought most of them at small
rates before the surrender, which was after made, The particulars whereof was
thus.

Col. Genesis Ashton sent a Summons for them to be all prisoners at mercy, and
surrender their Arms to the Parliament, with Appleby Castle, and all the Arms
and Ammunition. This occasioned some overtures for surrender thereof, which was
done with speed. And Saturday October 7 all things were concluded between them.

The terms were, For the inferior Officers and Common-Souldiers to go home,
lay down their Arms and be quiet, and observe all Orders and Ordinances of
Parliament, and Sir Philip Musgrave, Sir Thomas Tilsley, Sir Robert
Strickeland, Sir William Huddleston, and the rest of the Officers to go beyond
the Seas, And to have 6 months allowed to stay and provide for their going,
except the Parliament shall in the interim do any thing in their behalf, They
to observe all Orders, and Ordinances of Parliament, which if they do not,
then to have no benefit of the Articles, and to be at the Parliaments mercy.

I have sent you herewith a List of the Officers, and also a List of the
Ordnance, Horse and Arms. On Monday Oct. 9. they delivered the Castle, and
surrendered their Horses and Arms that were left, most of which they had sold
before, and so the number surrendered was but small, save only 500 foot Arms in
the Castle, But however (though the Soldiers paid a small matter for them, and
indeed it was but small, yet) we have 1200 of their Horse. For the other
particulars I refer you to the enclosed.
