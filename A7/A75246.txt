AN Congratulatory POEM, ON The safe Arrival of the Scots AFRICAN and INDIAN
Fleet in CALEDONIA, and their kind Reception by the Natives, with an Amicable
advice to all concerned.
SCOTLAND Rejoice, and praise the King of Kings,
Who this your project to good success brings
Commands the Winds and Seas to favor you more
Than any e're attemp't that place before,
From British Ports and makes you Friends of those
Whom all Men Judged, would have been your foes,
Brake off Divisions then, in Unity,
Amongst your selves, and in Fraternity,
Together live, to all the Earth it is known
The Thirstle Buds after the Rose is blown;
Let Courage and Conduct, you strengthen so,
As may enable you against any Foe,
Your Ancestors by Courage got Renown,
And by their Valor Run their Enemies down,
No Nation e're could Conquer SCOTLAND, by
The force of Arms, if not that Treachery,
Too much prevailed with those who bear Command,
Which to the sad Experience of this Land,
Is Ah! Alas too true therefore take Head,
The Proverb is, that burned Bairns fire do Dread,
Let no pretentions fring affinity,
To one another, But see that ye agree,
With Courage to defend you from all Foes.
That they who dare molest you, may find blows:
The Thirstle pricks the fingers with it Close.
I wish that Heavens may still favor this Trade,
Under the Indian Pole, and Treasure hade
Worthy the pains and Travel you are at,
To Enrich this Land was long Depauperat,
That SCOTLAND may yet Flourish and in Peace,
Preserved be from all seek to deface,
Its Fame, so that its Honest industry,
May Persevere to all Posterity,
That all the Neighboring Nations yet may own,
SCOTLAND deserves still Honor and Renown,
And those who do this Traffic Propogat,
May have their Names, in Ages Memorat,
That whilst the Sun and Moon endure they may
Be prosperous, I Heartily do pray,
Though some may chance by casual Death to fall
Yet let not that discourage great nor small;
For since they Sailed, double the Number have
Even here at Home, doubtless gone to the Grave.
More Honorable, a Funeral cannot be
There. Brave Adventurers have tho in the Sea,
They be entombed till she yield up her Dead,
No Man of Courage will such dangers Dread,
To wish my Country well, 's all I can do,
Since I am poor of purse and Person too.
R. A.
