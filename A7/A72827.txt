Y^u desperate Swearers,
and foul Blasphemers all,
Give ear unto an accident,
which lately did befall
Upon a wicked Keeper,
God did his Judgment show,
Near to the Chase of Enfield,
as many People know.
Then lend atention
to that which I repeat,
Wherein you may admire
Gods judgments wondrous great,
And learn blasphemous Swearing
to fl^e, for God says plain,
He will not hold him guiltless
that takes his Name in vain.
Now to my Story
I come with trembling fear,
A lewd ungodly Liver
one night was stealing Dear:
The Keepers that with vigelance
there nightly round did keep,
Upon this Venson-stealer
most subtly did creep.
And having him encompast,
he could not escape away,
One Keeper to an other
in desperate wise did say,
Now will I shoot this Fellow,
according to the Law,
And thereupon, his Crosse-bowe
he suddenly did draw.

To the same Tune.




ALso his wicked
profane blasphemous tongue.
Which with vile swearing
had done his Maker wrong,
Out of his mouth now hangs
that every one may view
How God rewards Blasphemers
and gives them there due.
One thing is worthy
to be observed well,
That at the season
when this strange thing befell,
A Tempest fell in London
upon that very day,
And this was done within that night
as many people say.
If all Blasphemers
in this kind were served,
Gods holy Precepts
would better be observed,
But let all men be warned
to flee this foul offense,
Which does the Lord to anger
above all sins incence.
And let all murderers
be warned by this tale,
For God such foul offenses
to punish will not fail,
Oh do not seek for vengeance
which to the Lord belongs,
Who will when he thinks fitting
revenge his servants wrongs.
Also this is a warning
for those that live by stealing,
The Lord seuearely plagueth th(...)se
who live by such false dealing
As now he has this wreched Thief
who died in his sins,
And few that runn so vile a race
a better ending winns.
What ere you be give not your mind
to live by pilfering theft,
But larne to labor with your hands
and use some honest shift,
Then God will bless your labors
what ere you take in hand,
And every thing shall prosper
as well by sea as land.
In fine, let all be warned
at this Gods Judgment shown,
And think if you offends the like
the case may be your own,
Provoke not God to execute
his wrath on you for sin,
But by the example of these twain
to mend your lives begin.
FINIS.
