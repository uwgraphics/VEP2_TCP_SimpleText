THE CASE Of the Landlords of the Houses IN White-Fryars, Salisbury-Court,
Ram-ally, and Mitre-Court.
THAT by color of a Clause in the late Act of Parliament (Entitled, An Act
for the more effectual Relief of Creditors, in cases of Escapes, and for
preventing of Abuses in Prisons, and pretended privileged Places) which gives
Power to Sheriffs, and other Officers, which by Law, have Power to Arrest, and
do other legal Executions in the said Places; and in case of Resistance or
Refusal, to break open any Door or Doors, diverse violent and unruly Persons,
have been so bold as (when there was no Resistance, or any Demand to open the
Doors) to break open several Houses in the said Places, and carried away the
Inhabitants thereof, which has deterred many Persons of Value to abide and
dwell in the said Places, or to take any of the said Houses to dwell in;
whereby the said Places are now almost wholly Depopulated, whereby the
Landlords are deprived of their Rent, but notwithstanding are obliged to Pay
Taxes and Ground-rent to the utter Ruin of many whose Estates lie in some or
one of the said Places.
