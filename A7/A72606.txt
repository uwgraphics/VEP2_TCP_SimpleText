TO MY HONORABLE AND MOST respected good friend: Sir William Norres Knight of
the honorable order of the Bath: Thomas Bateson wishes long life, health and
happiness, with increase of honor.
SIR, I am bold to present unto you these few MADRIGALES, and I pray you as
you have heretofore (rather for your exceeding love to me, then for any worth
that I acknowledge of the Songs) given them your private applause and liking,
when I sent them to you ever as they were composed in loose papers, so you will
much more now, (for now in-deed when they come to the worlds eye and censure,
they had more need of it then ever) Vouchsafe to give them your good
countenance and public patronage. In truth I must confess, they are like
young birds feared out of the nest before they be well feathered, and find no
place so fit to light on as on the branches of your favor: where (such is
your love to me and Music) I hope they will be so shrouded in the leaves of
your good liking, that you will give leave neither to any ravenous Kite nor
crafty fowler (I mean neither to any open mouthed Momus nor more sly
detractor) to devour, or harm them, that cannot succor nor shift for
themselves. I could wish them a Cage of as many sweet singing Nightingales to
salute your ears with the choicest of delightful Notes and the melody of most
eare-pleasing harmony, that your idle time might not pass without delight, if
they might yield it to you. But whatsoever they are, yours they are, and for
you only they were made. It was your good countenance that did encourage me
to this; Your love to Music does not only challenge it of me, but even the
uttermost that Musicks art can afford; which if it were in me, I would most
willingly offer to you; Now let these my affectionate endeavors be accepted,
since this is all that I can perform: except the honoring of your Virtues, and
observance of your worthiness.

Yours in all love and so obliged, Thomas Bateson.

FINIS.
TO MY HONORABLE AND MOST respected good friend: Sir William Norres Knight of
the honorable order of the Bath: Thomas Bateson wishes long life, health and
happiness, with increase of honor.
SIR, I am bold to present unto you these few MADRIGALES, and I pray you as
you have heretofore (rather for your exceeding love to me, then for any worth
that I acknowledge of the Songs) given them your private applause and liking,
when I sent them to you ever as they were composed in loose papers, so you will
much more now, (for now in-deed when they come to the worlds eye and censure,
they had more need of it then ever) Vouchsafe to give them your good
countenance and public patronage. In truth I must confess, they are like
young birds feared out of the nest before they be well feathered, and find no
place so fit to light on as on the branches of your favor: where (such is
your love to me and Music) I hope they will be so shrouded in the leaves of
your good liking, that you will give leave neither to any ravenous Kite nor
crafty fowler (I mean neither to any open mouthed Momus nor more sly
detractor) to devour, or harm them, that cannot succor nor shift for
themselves. I could wish them a Cage of as many sweet singing Nightingales to
salute your ears with the choicest of delightful Notes and the melody of most
eare-pleasing harmony, that your idle time might not pass without delight, if
they might yield it to you. But whatsoever they are, yours they are, and for
you only they were made. It was your good countenance that did encourage me
to this; Your love to Music does not only challenge it of me, but even the
uttermost that Musicks art can afford; which if it were in me, I would most
willingly offer to you; Now let these my affectionate endeavors be accepted,
since this is all that I can perform: except the honoring of your Virtues, and
observance of your worthiness.

Yours in all love and so obliged, Thomas Bateson.

FINIS.
TO MY HONORABLE AND MOST respected good friend: Sir William Norres Knight of
the honorable order of the Bath: Thomas Bateson wishes long life, health and
happiness, with increase of honor.
SIR, I am bold to present unto you these few MADRIGALES, and I pray you as
you have heretofore (rather for your exceeding love to me, then for any worth
that I acknowledge of the Songs) given them your private applause and liking,
when I sent them to you ever as they were composed in loose papers, so you will
much more now, (for now in-deed when they come to the worlds eye and censure,
they had more need of it then ever) Vouchsafe to give them your good
countenance and public patronage. In truth I must confess, they are like
young birds feared out of the nest before they be well feathered, and find no
place so fit to light on as on the branches of your favor: where (such is
your love to me and Music) I hope they will be so shrouded in the leaves of
your good liking, that you will give leave neither to any ravenous Kite nor
crafty fowler (I mean neither to any open mouthed Momus nor more sly
detractor) to devour, or harm them, that cannot succor nor shift for
themselves. I could wish them a Cage of as many sweet singing Nightingales to
salute your ears with the choicest of delightful Notes and the melody of most
eare-pleasing harmony, that your idle time might not pass without delight, if
they might yield it to you. But whatsoever they are, yours they are, and for
you only they were made. It was your good countenance that did encourage me
to this; Your love to Music does not only challenge it of me, but even the
uttermost that Musicks art can afford; which if it were in me, I would most
willingly offer to you; Now let these my affectionate endeavors be accepted,
since this is all that I can perform: except the honoring of your Virtues, and
observance of your worthiness.

Yours in all love and so obliged, Thomas Bateson.

This song should have been printed in the set of Orianaes.
