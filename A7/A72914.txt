An excellent Ditty, both merry and witty,
Expressing the love of the Youths of the City,
Who take delight, as my Song does say,
Betimes in the morning to fetch home May,

To a pleasant new tune, or the two lovely Lovers.


AWake my own dear sweeting,
why do thou sleep so long;
The Sun is near up rising,
do not thy self such wrong,
Upon this pleasing morning,
swiftly let us take our way
With joy to welcome in,
the merry month of May.
I se the day star twinkling,
rising in the East,
Which tells us that Aurora,
has left her sluggish rest,
Then rise up my own Honey,
and let us take our way,
With joy to welcome in,
the merry month of May.
The Flowers are neat and dainty,
which do be all lovlie,
To walk into the Meddowes,
to give our hearts delight:
Under the rare green shadows,
we may sport and play,
With joy to welcome in,
the merry month of May.
The birds are sweetly singing,
upon the greene-wood ^rees,
Down in the Meadows may we,
walk up to the knees,
In Primrose and sweet Dazies,
with Cowslyp neat and gay,
Then come my only sweeting,
let us got gather May.
The Nightingale must pleasing,
chants forth her merry strain,
Then who would stay at home,
that might such pleasure gain.
The youths of this fair City,
trimmed in their best orray.
Are marching forth this morning,
with joy to gather May.
With Drums, with Fifes, and trumpets,
they are bravely graced,
With Muskets in the forefront,
which they have rately placed,
They all went on in pleasure;
attyred neat and gay,
And every young man has his Love,
that goes to gather May.
Roger with his Susan,
an^ Robert his fair lane,
Richard with his sweet heart,
to be leg do disdain,
Sweet William and fair Nancy,
in their apparel gay,
Is early gone this morning,
abroad to gather May.
John Iinkin with his Gilian,
Tom with Penelope,
And Humphrey with sweet Prudence
why then sweet may not we,
As well as all these Lovers,
in our apparel gay.
Upon this merry morning,
walk forth so fetch home May.
The second part.
To the same tune.


There Is Randall with his Sara,
marching hand in hand,
Rowland and sweet Maudlin,
that yield to his demand,
There Is Arthur and sweet Margaret,
which does her Love obey,
Is early gone this morning,
abroad to gather May.
Nicholas with his Betty,
and Francis with fair Mary,
Martin with Rebecca,
and Dorothy with Harry,
El^s with his Katherine,
were gone the break of day,
In their apparel neatly,
to fetch home gentle May.
Edward with sweet love,
and Lucres with Valentine,
James with his sweetheart Alce,
they must have Cream and Wine
These Lovers march in order,
whilst Music sweet does play;
With songs and pleasant Ditties,
about to gather May.
This is the month of pleasure,
and Aprils watery showers,
Has faln^ in comely measure,
to increase the pleasing flowers,
That Lovers gather early,
to make them Posies gay,
Composed of sundry colors
within the month of May.
Margery my sweeting,
thy Siluester does call,
I feign would be this morning,
the foremost of them all.
I see Apollo's splendour,
darts from the East most gay,
To grace these comely Lovers,
to fetch home lovely May.
The Blackbird sings most sweetly,
so does the Nightingale,
The Fawnes play in the high woods,
the Mare runs ore the Dales,
The bleating Lambs most sweetly,
delight to sport and play,
The small birds sweetly warble,
to welcome pleasant May.
Sweet Sillib^bs w^^'l have Love,
with Cakes and P^^ding-pye^,
With Cream ^e ^re^'d with Sugar
if that my Madge will ^ise.
L^ hear the Cucko^ sing sweet,
and see her feathers gray,
Who with her notes most kindly,
does welcome in sweet May.
Strike up thy Pipe good Piper,
I see my Love does come,
Much like the Queen of beauty,
her splendour lights the room,
Come, come my gentle sweeting,
with all the speed we may,
Lets walk to the green Meddowes
to gather pleasant May.
