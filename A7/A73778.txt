The Cuckowes Comendation: Or, the Cuckolds, Credit: Being a merry Maying Song
in Praise of the Cuckoo.
To the Tune of the Buttoned Smock.




OF all the Birds that haunts the woods,
The waters or the Plain;
I like the Cuckows pleasant tunes,
though some his Notes disdain:
For all the fair green Season,
most cheerfully he sings,
And with his double Ditties makes
the Hills and Valleys ring.
The Earth to entertain him,
puts on her best array,
The lofty trees and lowly shrubs,
likewise are fresh and gay;
The Birds to bid him welcome in,
do warble pleasant notes,
All Beasts in fields an^ Forests wild
cast off their winter coats.
And when he comes amongst them,
he chaunts his melody,
More freely then a ^awyer,
that takes a double Fee:
He far excells the Fiddler,
his melodie's more free,
As well unto the poorest sort,
as to the highest degree.
The Citizens that hear him,
will walk to fetch (...) May;
Their wives like (...) cheer them,
will dress themsel^^s most gaye
All for to hear the Cuckowsing,
and warble forth his ^^^^es,
The Maidens and the Prentises,
together go in flocks.
He Will sing unto the Courtier,
as well as to the the Clown,
He su^^eth not his music,
in City nor in Town:
And many when they hear him,
will think this Proverb true,
That Gold and Opportunity,
will make some Women do.
The Lawyer when he heeres him,
his velvet Cap off sturres,
And fears whilo he is at Westminster,
another Cause demurres:
Lest that some younger Student come
at home and in his place,
To have the free soliciting
of his own proper case.
The Merchant and the Mariner,
that foreign Countries find,
When they do hear the Cuckoo sing,
rest doubtful in their mind:
While they strange traffickes take in hand
to load their Ships with wares,
Their Pinnace that they left at home
some other Burden bears.
The Maidens when they hear him,
accuse him for a blab,
The jealous Doctor when he cries,
thinks his young wife a Drab:
Captains and wedded Martialists,
when they do hear him cry,
Likewise mistrust their Wives at home,
in others Arms do lie.
The silken suited Citizens
which let their gorgeous Spouses
Go frolic in good company,
whilst they do keep their houses:
If they do blame the Cuckoo sweet,
they do the Bird abuse:
For wine and opportunity,
will make some women loose.
The second Part,
to the same Tune.


ANother takes a Garden,
to which in pleasant weather
The Mistress must a walking go,
the Prentice brings her thither:
And then it so may fortune,
that walking on the way,
They fall into some dancing-Schools,
and there they both do stay.
But then and if the Citizen
does hear the Cuckowes sound,
He fears not but his Prentises,
from Venery are bound:
Suspecttly then he keeps his house,
and casts up his Book,
Mean while the Mistress and her Man,
are doing what, go look.
And there he Knights and Gentlemen,
which gallant seem and stout,
Do let their wives have Coaches,
to whirle the streets about,
Manned only by a Coachman,
an Usher and a Page:
Yet when they hear the Cuckowes note,
they neither fume nor rage.
For if my Lady lights,
the Coachman must sit still,
The Lacquey he is then imployd,
to do her worships will:
The Usher for her Ladyship,
he well does know his part,
And does that which the Prentise did,
to please his Mistress heart.
The Tailor that so neatly
does fit his Mistress wast,
And puts on her strait Bodies,
when Petticoats vnlac'd,
Whilst thus he fits his Mistress,
another is at home.
To ease his wives strait Bodies,
which are to narrow grown.
The Butcher that for fat wars
full often abroad does ride,
And leaves his wife to sell the Joints,
that he does well provide:
While he from home is ranging,
his Wife a Friend may find,
That of a Lamb may make a Ram,
and use her very kind.
The Smith which on his Anuill,
the Iron hard does ding:
He cannot hear the Cuckoo,
although he loud does sing,
In poynting of Plow-Harnesse,
he labors till he sweat,
While another in his Forge at home,
may steal a private heat.
But to conclude of all sorts,
though high or low they be,
There Is many loose back-sliders,
would there were none for me:
And yet it grieves my Conscience,
that such a lovely Game,
Should make the Cuckoo hated,
and scandal his good name,
His body is as toothsome,
and pleasant as his voice,
And use him as a Diet,
he is a food most choice:
He fortifies the back part,
and freeth some Disease,
And therefore use you all the Art,
may best the Cuckoo please.
FINIS.
