royal blazon or coat of arms HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT By
the King.
WHereas it is found meet and expedient, upon weighty considerations moved to
His Majesty, by the intervention of some of His friends, to lay aside
Hostility with the King of Spain, and so to remove by fair and peaceable
means the cause of the War, which has bred interruption to the Amity
betwixt the two Crowns, upon assurance given His Majesty hereof by that King,
His most Excellent Majesty has condescended to renew the ancient Amity, and
good Intelligence betwixt the two Crowns, their Realms, Countries, Dominions,
Vassals and Subjects, And does accordingly make known to all His loving
people, that the said Peace and Friendship being so established, not only all
Hostility and War is to cease on both sides from henceforward, But also the
former Trade and Commerce, as it stood in the use and observance of the
Treaty, made by His Majesty's blessed Father, is restored and confirmed
between the said Kings, their Kingdoms, Territories, and Subjects as well by
Land as Sea and Fresh Waters.

Which His Majesty has thought fit to declare unto all manner of His
Subjects, of whatsoever estate they be, strictly charging and commanding them
to observe and accomplish all that hereunto belongs, As it is certainly
promised to be published on the side of the King of Spain, the Date these
Presents.

Given at His Majesty's Palace of Westminster, the fifth day of December, in the
sixth year of His Majesty's Reign.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: and by the Assigns of John Bill. 1630.
