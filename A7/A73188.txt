A merry new Song of a rich Widows wooing,
That married a young man to her own undoing.

To the tune of, Stand thy ground old Harry.


I Am so sick for love,

Which makes me cry,
With a loue-sicke eye,
Have at thy coat old woman:
Have at thy coat old woman,
Here and there, and every where,
Have at thy coat old woman.
I may have maidens young,
and lusty gallants plenty:
Yet will I be
As true to thee,
as if thou were but twenty.
Have at thy coat old woman,
Have at thy coat old woman:
Here and there, and every where,
Have at thy coat old woman.
I Will till thy pasture ground,
and mow thy pleasant meddow:
My mother me told,
I must be bold
in wooing of a Widow.
Have at thy coat old woman,
Have at thy coat old woman:
Here and there, and every where,
Have at thy coat old woman.
I Will give thee all those joys
a young man may afford thee:
And ride each day
With thee any way,
and bravely will maintain thee,
^^ue at thy coat, etc.
This pleased the widow well,
and her old blood revived,
To hear his noate,
Still have at thy coat,
'twould make at old wench long-liued.
Have at thy coat old woman,
Have at thy coat old woman:
Here and there, and every where,
Have at thy coat old woman.
Old Rat she loved good cheese,
and thereupon would nibble,
And dance a round
To hear the sound
and music of his fiddle.
Have at thy coat old woman,
Have at thy coat old woman:
Here and there, and every where,
Have at thy coat old woman.
To an old woman's heart
no greater comfort may be,
Then to live in delight,
And marry a Knight,
and to be made a Lady.

Have at thy coat old woman:
Here and there, and every where,
Have at thy coat old woman.
The Moon scarce changed thrice,
ere this old Less did marry:
But all her sport
Was quick and short,
and did full soon miscarry.
Have at thy coat, etc.

IN Gold and Siluer-lace,
and pipes of smoking Fogus,
Then every day
He spent her away
in gold a brave Iacobus.

Here and there, and every where,
Have at thy coat old woman.
He made her Reddockes fly,
and her old bags to ratlte:
It was charge to keep
So many sheep,
and herds of horned Cattle.

Here and there, and every where,
Have at thy coat old woman.
An hundred of good Oaks
he sold to buy a Hobby,
Abroad for to ride
In pomp and pride,
while she sat like a noddy.
Have at thy coat, etc.
Her comply coat of woollen,
he changed into fine Satin:
Yet in a week
She was to seek,
and beg her bread by Patten.
Have at thy coat, etc.
Her house most richly stored
whereof he made not dainty:
But in a day
He consumed away
what she had got in twenty.
Have at thy coat, etc.
He cherisht her mumbling gums,
with food as they had need on:
For want of her teeth,
He gave her Bull-beefe,
but once a week to feed on.
Have at thy coat, etc.
When she had lived two months,
this lusty youngmans purchase,
With kindness thus killed,
Her coffin he filled
with her consumed carcass.

Have at thy coat old woman:
Here and there, and every where,
Have at thy coat old woman.

and trust your selves with no man:

for Have at thy coat old woman.

Have at thy coat old woman:
Here and there, and every where,
Have at thy coat old woman.
