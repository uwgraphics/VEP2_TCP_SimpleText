HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms M I. I.
blazon of the City of London
By the Major.
WHereas diverse good Acts and Ordinances have heretofore been made, as well by
public Proclamations, as other ways: for the restraining the great Abuses
daily committed and used in brewing and uttering of extraordinary strong Ale
and Beer, of fifteen shillings and sixteen shillings the barrel, in such
unusual and strange manner, and by such unlawful measures and prizes, as in
former ages was never known and suffered, and grown now to such a habit of
Idleness and drunkenness, as is fit to be reformed: Or else the poison
thereof, will trench to the prejudice of the whole Kingdom, which in no wise
is to be suffered. Wherefore, the right honorable Sir John Iolles, knight,
Lord Mayor of this honorable City, having called before him, the Master and
Wardens of the Brewers, and Freemen of this City of London, and sundry other
discreet persons of understanding and grave discretion, have diligently
enquired, the reasons and causes of the great dearth of Barley and Malt at this
present throughout the whole kingdom: finding that the prizes of Malt is one
third part dearer by the quarter, then is Rye, and bears near to the price
of ordinary wheat: which will make the greatest part of the Earable Land of
this kingdom to be sown with Barley. And consequently, whereas in former
times, in the knowledge of many Merchants yet living, That this Kingdom did
yearly spare great quantities of wheat to be transported into foreign parts
beyond the Seas, so much wheat as did return into this kingdom in species of
Gold and Silver, yearly many thousand pounds, which was here Minted into the
Kings Majesty's Coin: and now so little wheat sown here, to give room for
Barley, that we are served with wheat our selves, out of foreign Countries,
who draw away the Coin of this Land, both Silver and Gold from England, for
their Corn, to the like number of many thousand pounds yearly, to our great
prejudice: All which inconveniences, do grow by the brewing of this heady
strong drink, which wastes our Corn infinitely.

And further, a new evil is crept into the City and Suburbs, amongst the petty
Victualers and Alehouse keepers, that become Brewers in their own houses of
strong Ale, and so are both Brewers and Victuallers, and retaile the same at
two pence or three pence the quart, to the poorest laboring people of the
City, to the misery of their poor wives and children, whose husbands give as
much for a quart of strong Ale, as would find their wives and children both
bread and drink at home. For Reformation of the foresaid abuses, the Lord
Mayor by all the best means and power that he can use, intends forthwith
with all severity to reform within the City of London, and Liberties thereof,
to the example of the rest of the kingdom. And therefore hereby Charge and
Commands, That no Inholder, Alehouse keeper, Cook, Tobacco seller, nor
other Victualler, or keeper of Ordinaries whatsoever, shall in any wise, brew
any drink in their houses, neither Beer nor Ale, nor utter, nor sell any Ale
or beer at other rates, then is by the Law appointed, (viz:) a full quart of
the best Ale or Beer for a penny, and a full quart of the smaller beer for a
half penny. And likewise, straightly charge and commands all brewers, which
are brewers by their trade either of Ale or beer, that they nor any of them,
do brew any Ale or beer, at any other rates, or in any other manner then is
appointed by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, nor at any other prizes,
then that the Victuallers may be able to afford the same at the rates
abouesaide: of a penny a quart the best, and a half penny the quart of the
smaller. AND, that it shall appear, the Contents of this Proclamation shall be
straightly looked into, his Lordship has appointed in every Ward of London,
certain honest and well disposed persons, to search and view, throughout their
Wards where any of these abuses shall be committed, to discover them to the
Lord Mayor, to the end, that severe punishment may be inflicted upon the
offenders.

And further, whereas of late there has been a very gross and corrupt use,
or rather Abuse, set up amongst bakers of Market bread, by many Forreiners, and
some bakers of the City: touching the baking of false sized bread, never wont
to be used, (viz:) in baking of three-peny, fiue-peny, eight-peny, and
Ten-peny Loaves of bread, to beguile the simple people, and Children withal,
in selling the three penny Loaf for a groat, the five penny for six pence, the
ten penny for twelve pence, which is not fit to be used or suffered. Wherefore,
the Lord Mayor straightly Charge and Commands all Bakers of bread, of what
kind or condition soever, That they, nor any of them, shall not in any wise
bake, nor put to sale, either in their shoppes, nor in the Markets of the
City, any wheaten or white bread of any size above the penny loaf, and two
penny loaf: nor any brown or household bread, above the penny loaf, or two penny
loaf, six penny loaf, and twelve penny loaf, which shall have the print in
the top of the Loaves, (viz:) on the two penny loaf, the print of 2. on the
six penny loaf, the print of 6. and on the twelve penie loaf the print of 12.
And if they bake or put to sale any other bread of other sizes and prizes, the
same shall be given away in the Market to the poor: and the sellers thereof
committed to prison for their wilful offense therein committed.

God save the King.
