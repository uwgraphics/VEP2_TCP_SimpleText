AS for to speak of noblesse spyrytuall. It is ye most great noblesse that is
/ and that man may have. That is to have evermore his heart and his affection
unto his creature / to seche knowledge of him and of his ordynaunces / as
wherefore he made the au^gelles the man / the woman / marriage / paradyse / hell
/ and where they ben / and wherefore he would be borne of the vyrgyn Mary / and
the which sygnyfyeth his deeds and his works. And also of the Antechryst and
of ye deed bodies and how a man should confess him and to whom. Now inquire
we than of his things as ye dyscyple does the which demands of his
master / and the master answery^ge unto his demaundes as it follows.



Here follows a little treatise Intytuled or named the Lucydarye good and
prouffytable for every well dysposed person the which has will and affection
to know of noblesse spyrytuall.
depiction of master and discipleMAyster tell me what thing is god. My child
he is a thy^ spyrytuall in the which is all dygnyte and all perfeccion the
which is knowing al thing all mighty / and evermore dury^ge without end and
without begy^nynge of an other. And also he ne may be mesured ne comprehended of
man enough for to se him ne his beautes ne may be no^bred / ne his dygne
puyssaunce ne may be taken of any entendement so much is he great. And also he
is full of all bounty and mercy. Master may he be but one only god. My child
/ nay / For if there were many gods every of them should be all puyssaunt
and than might they make thing contrary co^uenable yt one to ye other yt
which is against nature dyuyne so yt he ne may be but one substance / and one
essence dyuyne the which is pryncypall cause effyeyent of all things and he
is the sovereign good unto the which every heart desires to come the which
entendeme^t humayne ne may comprehend ne ymagen. Master wherefore is god
called fader. My child for the engendrement appertains pry^cypally unto the
fader more than unto the mother / Wherefore man should grant unto god the most
pryncypall party. Master wherefore call we not the second person of the
trynyte as well daughter as sone. My child for as much as the sone is of more
strong nature / for he took nature humayne in the form of man and not of
woman. Master wherefore is not ye holy ghost called of the sone and the sone
were called mother. My child it is for that / ye he proceeds and dyscendeth
also pryncypally of the one as of the other. Master where was god before that
he made the world. My child he was not in no place corporell. For nothing
was but he all only / but he was in him self fader and sone / and holy ghost
in one self essence. Master where is he now. My child god occupyeth no
place. But his puyssaunce infynyte is over all / for he governs ye things
the which ben in the oryent / and those the which ben in the occydent / and
generally all the world / and therefore a man says that he is all time and all
things. Master knows god all things. My child / ye. for in likewise as he
is all puyssaunt also he is all knowing and all seeing. Master in what manner
made god the aungelles. My child he them made fair and shynynge and without
body and full of meruaylous bounte and saiges for to be his special mynystres.
Master how sinned the aunthe commandment of god. Master wherefore deceived
the devil them. My child / by envy for he was full of sorrow of that ye they
should obtain his place in paradyse the which he had lost by his pride.
Master in what form tempted the ennemy them. My child / the devil appeared
unto them in the form of a serpent telling them that if they ete of that
fruit they should know as much as god. Master wherefore ne created god the
men confermed in grace as the aungelles. My child god would that the men were
semblable unto him as all things to take of him / god would that all were
borne of Adam. Master why had he not made them yt they might not have sinned.
My child to the end that they had the more of merit. Master how had they
engendered in paradyse terrestre. My child as thou sholdest put thy^ one hand
with in thyn other without any delectacyon. Master how had these women chylded. My
child without any doloure and with out ordure. Master how had they be in paradyse
terrestre. My child as a generacyon gone one after the other. Master where is
paradyse celestyall. My child it is in the tenth heaven the which is above all
the other heuens and is cleped the heuyn Imperial for as much as it is more
clear and more subtle in substance / and more fair than all ye other / In
the which ben ye holy men and women of paradys enbraced with the love of our
lord. Master wherefore made god man and woman when he knew well yt they should
trespace his commandment. My child it was for his pleasure so to do for to
show his infynyte might / and unto to the end yt he were praised serpraysynge
god and in demanding of his mercy of whom we should take example / and by
reason we should do it more sooner than the beestes that ne have wit ne
understanding / seeing the great graces that god unto us has done the which
ben made unto his semblaunce and redeemed with his precious blood / and the which
gives unto us too much of good in this world. In such wise yt all the
beestes plants / trees / herbs / land / and see / planettes / and sterres /
and all other things ben made for to serve unto the man unto his prouffyte and
vtylyte / and yet he has lent us the realm of paradyse if we will of ye
which ye leest glory surmounteth all the Joys of this world. By the which
my child ye man is we le to blame the which mysknoweth his creature the
which so much of grace to him has done seeing that the beestes the which ne
have wit ne understanding / him love and thank in demanding pyteously his
right dygne mercy Master where was Adam create. My child he was create in
bron and after was put in to paradyse terrester. Master what thing is in
paradys terrestre / and where is it My child it is a place delectable in the
oryent over ye mountains of egypt wherein ben trees of diverse virtues / and of
such there are that who so eteth of them he shall never have honger / and of
other by nature shall never dye. Master where was the woman created. My child
she was created in paradyse terrestre / but the man was create without for be put
wtin in possessyon. Master wherefore sinned the man and the woman. My child by
the decepcyon of the devil and by their folysshe thinking trespassed and
honored / for all things loue^ god in their bey^ge and also for they know
well yt there shall be yet many persons of more greter merit and holiness as if
they had not little sinned / as saint Johan baptyst and ye appostles and
dyscyples of our lord and many other for as witnesses the scripture right
happy is he yt may do ill / and does it not when he may. Master how long
abode Adam and Eve in paradys terrestre My child from the morning till unto
ye hour of noone / for at the.iij. hour Adam put the names in ye things /
and about mydday they sy^ned / and at none they were banysshed / and at such
hour dyed Ihesu christ. Master in to what place yede Adam wha^ he was put out
of paradys terrestre. My child he yode in to ebron where he was create / and
there engendered he sons and daughters whereof we ben all comen where he wept
long time his sone Abell ye Cayn killed by envy. Master sith yt the devil
tempted Ada^ and eve why were they so greuosly punisshed. My child for that /
ye they mystoke ye commandment of god for to obey to the persuacyons of ye
devil / and that they ne held them content with god that so much of grace unto
them had given. By the which they sinned in.iij. manners. That is to
understand in pride wha^ they mystoken ye commandment of god. And in
couetyse when they were not content of ye / that god unto the^ had given / and
in the sin of the mouth in etynge the fruit that god them had defended.
Master when yt he repented him. and also did great penance wherefore was he
not restablysshed after his death in his first estate. My child for as much as
ye penance was not suffycyent to ye reparacyon of all those ye he had put from
paradyse by his sin wherefore it was necessary that the second person in
trenyte yt which is the blyssed sone of god made the reparacy on for him / and
how be it that the blyssed god is ever more merciful he is ryghtwyse and
raysonable.

Master wherefore sent not god an angel for to by humayne lygnage. My child
for as much that if the angel had redeemed the man / he had been subgecte unto
the angel and god has made the man to be in thestate of aungelles / And also
it was conuenable sith the man had done the sin that ye man him repaired /
and also my child thou sholdest know and understand that the blyssed sone of
god in propre person would repair the health and sin of man and to bear the
penance and to suffer death and passion right dolorous for him and to humble
him to take our fragylyte and nature in the womb vyrgynal for to show the
great affection and the great love that he has toward us the which he made
unto his se^blaunce. Master wherefore ne made god that an angel took nature
humayne. My child for these causes that I have now telled the / and also for
none angel ne other creature ne had puyssaunce to open paradyse but god al
only / and it was close unto ye man by his trespace / wherefore it was of
necessyte that the son of god were sent down here allow for to redeem nature
humayne / and for to open him paradyse And know thou that he had in him two
natures. That is to understand nature dyuyne / for he was and is very god /
and nature humayne / for he was and is very man / and for as much vaynquysshed
he the devil the which had vaynquysshed the man and opened paradys and was of
the lygne of Adam and did for him penance. Master wherefore ne took the fader
and the holy ghost nature humayne as well as ye sone. My child for that / ye
the sone is the semblaunce of the fader and grants unto him all things by
the which it was a thing conuenable that the sone all only drew unto him
the man for to draw him unto his fader above in paradys.

ye dyscyple.

ye master

Master wherefore would god be borne of the vyrgin Mary. My child god made the
man in four manners. The first was without man and without woman as Adam. The.ij
was of a man without woman as Eve. The iij. was of the man and of ye woman as
we ben Now was to make the iiij. manner the which is of ye woman without man as
is Ihesu christ. And ye other reason is such for in like wise as the death came
in earth by the woman the which was Eve. Also the life came in to the earth by
the woman. That is to know the vyrgyn Mary the which us has borne the fruit
of life eternal. Master how chyldedshe. My child she chylded without pain and
without doloure and abode entyer vyrgyn / and pure / and clean from al spotte
before the chyldynge / at the chyldynge / and after the chyldy^ge as the glass
through the which ye son passes without making therein any opening. But for
as much as god would hold the order of nature he abode nine months in the
womb vyrgynall / and he ne walked incontinent that he was borne. Master at
what hour was he borne. My child he was borne at mydnyghte / and at that
hour appeared in the sky a sterre much fair and clear that it was merueylous
to behold / the son was fair as the gold / and peace and unity was
thoroweout the world / and obeyed unto one only prince the which was named
Caesar / and at that hour the dombe beestes spoke and ydolles of the sarazyns
and paynyms fell to ye earth Master wherefore took he the gifts of the three
kings. My child for in taking the gold he showed you he was king almighty /
and by the ensence ye he was very god. and by the myrre very man / and ye
king the which bare ye gold was called Balthazar / and Jasper bare the myrre
/ and Melchyor bare ye ensence. Master in how many manners ben our sins
pardoned. My child they ben pardoned us in. v. manners. First by the
sacraments of holy church the which ben.vij. that is to know baptym /
co^fyrmacyon / confession / the order of preesthode / the sacrament of the
awter / the sacrament of marriage / and the vnccyon / but baptym is the first
and yt the which is most clenly puts out the sins / and after baptym /
confyrmacyon and confession ben the most necessaryes. Secondely our sins
unto us ben pardoned by almesdede. Thyrdely by orysons / and by fastings.
Fourthely by pardonynge unto our enmyes. and fyfthely by charity. Master ben
all our sins pardoned by baptym. My child ye / for by bapty^ we ben as men
unto Jesus christ in doing hy^ this homage / and we ben delivered from the
seruytude of sin. Master wherefore ben they baptized ye which ben borne of
them ye ben baptized / and also ye children the which have nothing offended.
My child if any paast were corrupt with venym all ye breed ye which of it
should be made should be venymous and corrupt. And for as much as our forne
faders were corrupt by sin they and all their lygnee were banysshed out of
paradys terrestre / and unto them were shytte the gate of paradys celestyall
the which ne may be opened unto the man / if he ne be first baptized as
witnesses the holy scripture. and how be it that the fader and the mother ben
baptized ye suffyceth not unto the child for to be baptized / for when a man
him baptyseth / nature comune ne baptyseth him but all only the person
pertyculer / Wherefore it is of necessyte yt we ben al baptized in pertyculer
Master wherefore ne named god yt all were baptized to be saved. My child it is
not the defaute of god that all ne ben baptized / for he has given unto every
man and woman lyberall arbytre and free will that to do. Also baptym should be
made of free will and without constraynt for if god constreyned the man to be
baptized he had not his lyberall arbytre / and so all his baptym had no merit.
Master wherefore espouseth not man now his cosynes as in ye au^cyente law. My
child it is for to encreace love between strangers / For those the which ben
of blood loves each other enough more than these other / Wherefore it behooves
for to put love and charity where it is not / and the other reason is such.
For the children had two primites togyders as to be sone and neuew wherefore for
honest it was ordained to make marriage between estraungers / but in ye old
law men espoused the women of lygnage and it was for to multyplye and to
increase ye world. Master wherefore was Ihesu christ baptized. My child he
was cyrconsyzed for to accomplysshe the old law. and baptized for to begin
the new law and for to she we his great humylyte in gyuynge us example that we
all should be regenerate by baptym. Master Wherefore is baptym in water My
child for ye water is contrary unto fire / wherefore for to quench ye said
fire of sin we ben baptized in water. And in likewise as the water wassheth
all ordures and fylthes. Also the baptym wassheth all sins / and god them
establysshed in water for as much as ye water is comune over all the world to
the end yt a man find ye sooner matter of ye said sacrament to the end yt none ne
may excuse him yt he ne could find whereof that he might make him to be
baptized or that he might have. Master what word ought a man to speak in
baptym. My child a man ought to say thus. I baptyse the in the name of the
fader / and of the sone and of the holy ghost amen. In putting three times of
water upon the heed of him that a man baptyseth / and so may they say in all
languages / so yt it be in good believe and in good intenco^n and other words
the which ne ben of the necessyte of the said sacrament. of baptym. Master
was it a thing reasonable that god ye fader gave so noble thing as is the sone
for to by again so caytyf a thing as is ye man. My child in that us shows
god the fader the great love that he has unto creature humayne Master sith yt
god has sent down here allow his sone by so great charity and for to redeem
ye humaynes wherefore did men to him so much of pain. My child Judas him
betrayed by couetyse. Pylate him condemned for dread to lose his office / and
the Jews him put to death by envy. Master wherefore deyed Ihesu christ on the
tree of the cross / My child for as Adam sinned by the tree of life / Also god
him would bye again / by the tree of the cross and you sholdest know that by
the four parties of ye cross the which shows all the world / it is again
showed unto us that ye death of Ihesu christ was suffycyent for to bye not only
nature humayne / but al so all the universal world if it had be lost Master
how long abode Ihesu christ in the earth deed / My child he there abode.xl.
hours. And when we say that he arose the third day / and that in three days
is not.xl. hours thou sholdest understand that he dyed the friday at ye hour
of noone / and. all the saturday he was deed in the holy sepulcre the which is
the second day / and the sunday after he arose right erly / and for as much
as the course of nature is renewed at mydnyght and the day / in taking one
party of the day for all the day entyer. Master why der yede the soul of
Ihesu christ when he was deed My child he yede in to glory toward god the
fader in yeldynge him thanks and praysynges in demanding him the holy souls
the which he had redeemed by the merit of his holy passion / the which thing
god him granted. Than opened ye soul of Ihesu christ the which was conioynte
with ye deite the gates of paradys the which had been shytte by long time unto
all humayne lygnage / and the saturday about the hour of mydnyght he descended
in to hell and brake the gates and yede to vesyte his good friends. That is to
understand the souls of ye holy ancient faders the which gretely him
desired and them delivered from the prison of the lymbe withal the holy
souls the which have meryted paradys by their holy works / and this fair
company mounted in to heaven and them presented unto god the fader the which
them received benyngnely and them puts in to the realm of paradyse in ye
places and syeges that the cursed aungelles lost by their pride. And he
delivered not the souls of the dampened as Judas / and of the cursed rich man
dyues and of many other / but them left in hell / in pain and in tourment with
all the deuylles without gyuynge them any comfort where they ben yet and shall
be for ever. And on the sunday before the son rysynge returned the soul
unto the body of Ihesus that lay in the sepulcre / and rose from death unto
life / Master / wherefore arose not he as soon as he was deed. My child for a
man had little presumed that he had been deed / and he would begin to renew the
world on the sunday by his resurreccyon. For at such an hour all ye world
began to be. Master where was he after his resurreccyon / forty days be fore
his ascencyon. My child he was in paradys terrester. with Helyas and Enoch in
enstructynge them / yt which was done as when he appeared. Master how many
times appeared he. My child / he appeared first unto Joseph of barmathye yt had
buried him the which for so doing was put in prison. After unto his mother /
after to ye blyssed Mawdeleyne / after unto ye.ij. pilgrims coming from the
holy sepulcre / after unto saint James the which ne would ete till yt he had
seen him. After unto saint Peter / after to the two pilgrims yt which went to
the castle of maulx / after he appeared unto his dyscyples ye gates shytte /
after unto saint Thomas when he put his hand in the side of our lord Ihesu
christ / after unto his dyscyples in the sea of Tyberyon / and so my child you
should understand yt our lord Ihesu christ appeared.xii. times before yt he
ascended in to heaven. Master who ascended in to heaven with him. My child the
souls of the blyssed the which than by their merytes were saved / and also
great multitude of aungelles of heaven the which him accompanied in syngy^ge
melodyously and yeldynge thanks unto god Master wherefore abode he.xl. days
to mount in to heaven after that he was risen. My child for ye that he gave
great pain.xl. hours when he abode in the earth unto his friends and dyscyples
wherefore he would conforte them.xl. days / yt is one day for every hour in
tokenynge yt for pain he gives great Joy / and also he did it for to
conferme them in ye holy faith / as saint Thomas and other / unto whom he
appeared vysybly. Master what is that to say / yt the sone is set on the right
hand of his fader. My child it is to say that the humanyte is in glory with
the dyuynyte. Master in what manner and form ascended Ihesu christ in to
heaven My child he styed in to heaven in such form and manner as when he him
transfygured before some of his dyscyples in the mountain of Tabor that is to
understand yt he had the arms stretched and lift up in heyght / and his face
shynynge as the son. And his vestymentes were white as snow / and a fair
and clear cloud descended from heaven / and it closed round about hy^ and so
mounted in to heaven in such wise yt they lost the sight corporal of him.
Master wherefore is the sacrament of the awter made of breed and of wine My
child for as the grain of the corn has been beten and flayled and had the
sede cloue^ In likewise the precious body of Ihesus was beten and scourged /
and had the side opened / out of the which issued blood and water / wherefore
men put of water unto the said sacrament. And as the wine lepeth from the
grape by force of ye wryngynge in the pressoure. In likewise the precious blood
of Ihesus lepte from his precious body on the pressoure of the cross / and it
was not establysshed of the flesh ne of the blood for a man may have horroure
to drink blood and to ete flesh / but it was establysshed of bread and wine
/ that is the most comune refeccyon that is / and also the breed and the wine
ben ye most comune and the most prouffytable for to nourysshe ye body. In
likewise the sacrament of the auter is the most comune and the most
prouffytable refeccyon for to nourysshe the soul Master how shall we
understand that it is the body of Ihesu christ and his precious blood under
the kind of breed and of wine. My child as the breed and the wine that thou
eatest and drynkest convert them in to thyn own body and in to thyn own
blood. In likewise the sacrament of the awter the bread and the wine saying the
holy words by the will of god / also changes them unto the precious body and
blood of Ihesu christ. and also he would do it for the great love that he has
in us he would evermore be with us. And it is his power yt to do / as of nothing
he has made all ye world the which is a more great thing. Than my child yt
sholdest believe steadfastly and without doubt for his pleasure was it to
instytute in such wise. And how be it that thou see it not corporally / for
a body gloryfyed is inuysyble you haste the more of merit. For faith is none
other thing but to believe ye thing yt he sees not.

The master

The dyscyple.

Master / what say ye of them ye which receives the said sacrament in
mortal sin. My child / they crucyfye of new ye sweet Ihesu christ and hy^
receives unto their dampnacyo^ Master the priest that is in mortal sin /
may he sacre and admynyster the body and blood of Ihesu christ. My child ye /
for the sacrament ne empeyreth / ne amendeth by the condycyon of the priest /
as the son when yt it shyneth upon foul things and stynkynge lesseth not
his clerete / but the priest it does unto his dampnacyon / and if he be without
sin it is unto his salvation. Master how long abides ye body of Ihesu
christ in the womb of him the which him receyuethe. My child he there
abides as long as the substance of the breed there may abide vndegested and
no more / but thou shall understand that god there is and also abides
evermore with them ye which ben in thestate of grace. Master / when many
prestes syngeth mass / the body of christ is it over all / My child / ye /
For god is and may be over all as thy soul the which is hole in every party
of thy body Master should a man hate the ill. My child a man should hate
their cursednesses and folyes and not to do ill as they done / but we should
love our nature / for we ben all the sons of one fader and of one mother and
bought and redeemed with one self blood / and if they do the any wrong thou
sholdest pardon them and pray for them unto the example of Ihesu christ the
which prayed for them that him crucyfyed and put unto the death. For it is the
work most merytoryous that we may do. Master wherefore have ye ill so many of
gods and of prosperytees in this world. My child there is not so ill in this
world but yt sometime does some good deed. And for as much as man did never
any good deed but yt it were recompe^sed / ne never did ill but that it be
punysshed And for this cause god them sends of great gods and prosperytees
in retrybucyon of their good deed. and so unto them gives puyssaunce and
auctoryte upon ye good to the end yt the good ben proved by them / and sometime
god sends of trybulacyon unto the ylle to the end that they amend them / and
if they do it not nevertheless yt shall be in dymynuycion of their sins yt
they should have and suffer in hell. Or they shall have encreasynge of other
great goods temporels but god gives of trybulacyons and aduersytees unto ye
good for to prove them as unto Job / and unto Thobye to the end yt they
dyspraysed the vanytees of this world / and that they should not forgete their
creature and that by their merytes in taking all in pacyence they may have the
glory of paradyse. and sometime god them gives of goods to the end yt they be
the more charytables and that they augmenten in glory in paradys. The good
dies sometime anon to the end that they empeyre not for to avoid the perils
and temptacyons the which ben in this world / and also ye good lives sometime
longely for to increase them in bounte / and to the end that by their good
example and doctrine the ill may amend them / and also the ylle dies anon
sometime for to make these other ill aferde to the end that they amend them /
and sometime the ill lives longely for to prove the good / and also for god
taryeth yt they should amend them / and so yt should understand my child yt
the opinion of some doctoures is yt ye mercy of god is so great yt he suffers
evermore ye man to dye in ye best estate and purpose yt he may find him. for
god will not ne also suffers not ye death and da^pnacion of a man / but wylleth
that he co^uerte hy^ and live eternally in paradys / and how be it that many
dies sodey^ly and without hauy^ge space to confess them and to do penance and
satysfacco^n How be it unto such purpose may they dye and in so great
contrycyon of heart yt god them takes unto mercy. Master shall the rich and
the poor be egallye guerdoned and rewarded. My child of as much as they be
the more sage and the more dygne of as much shall they be ye better rewarded
when they shall be good and when that they shall mow be ill of as much shall
they be the more grievously punysshed. Master may god do ill. My child / nay
/ for how be it that he be all puyssaunt / nevertheless it is not intended
that he may do things contrary unto rayson and that they ben Impossyble to be
Master wherefore suffers god yt the beestes have so much of pain / and also
they have not deserved it My child it is sometime yt by the sin of ye man the
vengyaunce of god falls upon the beestes and upon these other goods to
the end ye he amend him or for to prove hy^ as Job. And also than beestes ben
made to sustain and to nourysshe the man by the which they ben unto his
subgeccyon. And also for all things should serve unto that whereunto they be^
ordained / as the bridge yt which is made to pass / or to go over. In
likewise my child god it suffers to the end yt thereby we take example / for
sith that ye beestes suffers so much of pain for their poorly fe corporal
/ we should well more traucyle and take pain to get the life eternal of
paradys in ye which a man shall live eternally. Master knows god wheder a
man shall be saved or dampened before that he be borne. My child / yes / not ye
god it does in entencyon for to dampne him / for god ne dampneth him but the
man dampneth himself with out any constreynt but of his own will the which is
at his own lyberall arbytre or fre will. As we se the boterflye the which of
him self and of his propre will him brenneth in the candell. And how be it yt
the said boterflye is sometime scalded with the fire of the candell in such wise
that often he falls unto the earth / also he ryseth again ye best wise he
can. and with all his power he puts him self again in the fire of the
candell all holly that he there abides / notwithstanding that he sees well
the daungere. Also done those the which dampneth them self / for how be it
that they se and know the danger yt therein is / and also that they ben often
scalded by trybulacyons and aduersytees to the end that they convert them and
that by inspyracyon dyuyne they have some remors / how be it for that they
cease not till unto ye that of their own will and without any co^straynt they
put them so deep in the fire that they there abide and shall never go forth.
And how be it that god will of simple will yt all men be saved and has one so
great a gift as the realm of paradys without any merit / and by such wise
my child know you that god has made the man not to the end that he be dampened
but to the end that by his holy operacyons in suffrynge pacyently trybulacyons
and aduersytees / and in resystynge and fighting valyauntly against the devil
/ the world and the flesh / he may merit to be saved. Master those the
which ben predestynate to be saved may they be saved without deseruynge it / and
to traueyle therefore. My child / nay / for god knows well that by their
merytes and traueyles they shall be saved. And in likewise may a man say of the
dampened. Master sith yt those ye which ben predestynate to be saved may they
not be dampened and those the which should be dampened may they be saved / what
avails it else so much to travail, for to have paradys or hell. My child
if you be predesty nate to be saved in the glory eternal you ne sholdest increase
thy pains in purgatory / and to less thy glory in paradys by fault to do
well / and if you be predestynate to be dampened you ne sholdest therefore evermore
live in sin / but you sholdest evermore enforce the for to do well / and to
do penance for to less thy pains in hell and for as much as you know not
whereunto you art destynate / you should always think on the better pertye / that
is to understand ye god the has made unto his semblau^ce / and has bought
the with his precious blood for to save ye and not to da^pne the. Wherefore my
child you should evermore do good deeds and to fle the ill and know you my
child that god the has given wit and vnderstandy^ge reason and fre will and
lyberall arbytre to chose the good or you ylle to the end that you have not any
cause of Ignourau^ce or of Impuyssau^ce Master what say ye of them ye which
never hereth ye commandments of god ne none they done. My child the men ben
made unto ye image and unto the semblau^ce of god to the end yt they hy^ love
serve / and dread and therefore if they know not their creature in this world
he ne shall know the^ in the other / ne yet by their Ignorance they shall not
be excused but more sooner accused / for ye Ignorance excuses not ye sy^ne
Master if a child were nourysshed in a wood and he had never herd speak of
the faith of Ihesu christ shall he be dampened if yt he dye in such wise. My
child it is a thing to believe yt god makes reuelacion unto every person of
ye faith of Ihesu christ by techynge of man or by reuelacion dyuyne or
otherwise / and if he go against the said reuelacyon know yt ye he shall be
dampened. Master ben ye souls made from ye begy^nynge of ye world: My child
nay / but god the^ creates all ye days and them puts in ye bodies of ye
children wtin ye womb of their mother yt is to understood unto men at.xl. days
after their co^cepcyo^. Master what avails us confession. My child it is ye
second baptym. For in likewise as by baptym all sins ben perdoned. In
likewise by ye virtue of yt sacrament of co^fessyon all our sins ben perdoned
/ for as much as a man knowelegeth his detaute before god or before his
lyeutenau^t for god loves more obedience tha^ sacrifice / for obedience is
mother of all virtues. Master avails more penance done by enioynynge of ye
co^fessoure than penance done by will. My child if thy confessor ye has
enjoined in penance one pater nt^ all only / and you leave it to say an hole
sauter you synnest / and you shall not acquyte ye of thy penance / but if you
saydest the pt^ nt^ ye which to the was enjoined / and you leuest to say the
sawcer or other many fair orysons / yt you say by sy^ple will you shall not
sy^ne / but you shall acquit ye of thy penance / for as I have told ye more
better is obedyence done to our lord than does ye sacryfyce. Master what
avails co^trycyon at ye point of death. My child those ye which abides the^
to repent till unto ye hour of death ben trechoures unto our lord as ye
trechoure and ill payer yt promytteth to pay at a certain term but he would
that the term should never come / and for this matter and cause he makes a. M.
trecheryes unto his creature to the end that he ne pay him so sone or never /
and of the other part saint Luke says ye god is not well paid of him ye
which him pays of that thing yt he ne may no longer hold. How be it / it
is written that at what hour yt the sinner shall declare his sin in great
repentance and contrycyo^ that it unto him shall be pardoned. But my child it
is a right great peril to abide him to repent / for than a man is so troubled
that a man ne knows himself ne none other / for as says ye psalmyst. (Qm^
no^ est in morte q^ memor sit tui: in i^ferno au^t quis co^fitebitur tibi. That
is to say / ye as ye deed man has no remembrance of god / and that it is no
time him to repent and to confess his sin when that a man is in hell for ye
sentence of god is given. Than my child you should repent and confess ye when
you have time and space / and you sholdest not tarry till to morrow / for you
know not wheder you shalt deye to morrow or sooner.

Master sith that ye sin of pride is pardoned by bapty^ wherefore deyeth those
ye which ben baptized. My child the good deyeth to the end that they ben taken
from the trybulacyon of this world / and they be crowned in the realm of
paradys / and the ylle deyeth by their sins to the end that they be put from
the Joys and delyces of this world / and ben in great doloure punysshed
eternally in hell. Master what noyeth ye sodeyn death unto the man. My child
yt man the which dies suddenly / so that he be in thestate of grace he gooth
in to paradyse or in to purgatory to acco^plysshe his penaunces / and unto him
the sharp death is merytoryous against his sins venyalles and unto ye
dymynuycyon of ye pains of purgatory and unto the augme^tacyon of ye glory of
paradys / and if he dye suddenly in mortal sin the sodeyne death him puts
in as much as he is vnpourueyed and without confession ne repentance taky^ge /
than he is dampened eternally / and by this and for this cause my child thou
should be evermore ready for to deye in keeping the from sin / for thou
know not when ne of what death you shalt deye. Master what avails it a man
to be buried in ye church yard. My child if he be in purgatory he is the
sooner delivered as well by the prayers of the church as of his kynnesmen and
friends the which vesyteth his sepulture in praye^ge god for him / And often
it happeth yt the chyrcheyardes be^ sanctified by ye bodies of some saints yt
there be^ / and prays for them / whereof if those yt there ben buried ben
saved they be ryt Joyful when their bodies ben with the bodies of other saints /
but if they ben dampened it prouffyteth the^ nothy^ge. For ye good deeds yt men
there done for the^ ne may help them Master what manner of life is ye most
excellent and best for to make his salvation. My child to have a true
affection of true love in our lord in seruy^ge him and honoury^ge with all his
heart and in eating ye breed yt thou have Justly and lawfully gotten by ye tra
/ uayle of thy body as witnesses ye psalmyst the which says. (Labores manuu^
tuarum qr ma^ducabis. etc. That is to say that you shalt be right happy if you
eat the labor with thyn own hands whereunto it is showed the yt you ne
sholdest use of the gods yt which by the or by thine be gotten falsely / but
you should yield them if you know unto whom / and to use of them the which
ben Justly and lawfully gotten.

Master he ye which is in mortal sy^ne may he be long without co^myttyng
sin. My child nay / For as one good deed draws an other. In likewise one
evil draws another / for so the devil makes of ye man the which is in
mortal sy^ne as a man does of a be yt he ledeth by ye top where it seems
him best. Master whyder go ye souls of them yt ben deed. My child the souls
of the Innocents ye deyeth without baptym gooth unto the lymbe the which is
a chamber of hell where they ne have Ioyene heaviness / for they have nothy^ge
meryted / but for as much as they ne be purged from orygynal sy^ne by baptym
they ben put from paradys / and from the vysyon of god / and the souls of
them the which ben baptized the which dies in thestate of Innocence gooth in
to paradys all right. and the souls of them the which deyeth in thestate of
grace and without sy^ne where if they have sinned and if they have done penance
suffycyent in this world gooth all right in to paradyse / and ben in glory
after ye / that they have meryted by their holy works / and the souls of the^
ye which have had contrycion and dyspleasau^ce of their sins and ben
returned unto god in cryenge him mercy that they have not acco^plysshed their
penaunces in this world gooth in to an other part of hell named purgatory and
there they accomplysshe their penaunces and ben purged of their sins / and
that done they go in to the glory of paradys / And ye souls of them the
which dies in one only mortal sy^ne or many gooth in to the depnes of hell
where they ben punysshed after their deseruynge / and the souls of ye Jews
and of the mescreauntes the which deyeth in ye estate of Innocencye gone in to
a part of hell with the other children the which dies without baptym / but the
souls of the other Jews and mescreau^tes yt have wit and vndersto^dy^ge
goth in to hell with the dampened Master in how little time ben ye souls delyuerd
fro purgatory. My child some there abides more longely than other after as
they have deserved. for some ben delivered at the end of.vij. days / and
therefore makes a man the semell otherwise called the recorn in maky^ge prayers
and almesdedes for their delyueraunce / for gretely unto them may puffyte the
prayers and almesdedes ye is done for them. These other ben delivered at the
end of.xxx. days / and therefore is made the trentall. The other ben delivered
at the end of one year / and therefore is made the years mind / and these
other abides there by many years and by long time after yt they have deserved
/ and therefore make men remembrance every year of them / and when they ben all
purged and that they ben delyuerd as by their penaunces acco^plysshed / as by
our prayers and oraysons / they go all right unto the glory of paradys. Master
in what place is paradys My child there are.iij. manner of paradys. that is to
wit paradys celestyall / paradyse terrestre / and paradys spyrytuall. Paradyse
celestyall is above all the heuens in the which is god and all the saints
holy men and women as I have said before / paradys terrestre is in the earth
toward the oryent / and paradys spyrytuall is anenst god and to love hy^
perfytely and yt is over all In yt paradys ben our good aungelles the which
sees and loves god. Master where is hell. My child there are.ij. manner of
helles / yt is to wit hell spu^all and hell corpall / hell spu^al is over all
where ye souls and ye cursed angels ben in pain and torment be it in earth
or in ye see / and this may be in many places / as we read of a soul yt was
tormented with a flage of yse yt a bishop delivered by.xxx. masses / who was
bound to be there long time. Hell corpal is in ye myddle of ye earth as ye
carnell of an apple is in ye myddle of ye apple and is a great cave blak and
dark in which ben iiij. stages ye one above ye other. At ye first stage is ye
place wherein were the holy souls of the holy faders au^cye^tes and of them yt
by their holy life and co^uersacio^ have meryced the realm of paradys the
which our Lord Ihesu christ delivered when he dyed on ye tree of the cross
and now there is none / For at that time were all delivered. At the second
stage is purgatory wherein ye souls the which should be saved goth to
acconplysshe their penance the which they have not accomplysshed in this
world in their life In the third stage ben the souls of the Innocents the
which deyeth without baptym. And in ye.iiij stage the which is the most low
in depnes ben ye deuylles and the souls of the pore and miserable dampened.

The dyscyple

Master what pains have they ye which be^ in purgatory.

My child they ben tourmented with ye fire of hell much more hoter than the
fire materyall of this present world in co^paryson against a fire painted upon
a wall / and they ben there bound with chains of fire al brennynge so
sperkelynge yt a man ne can speak it. In the which place some ben there more
punysshed than these other / and there abide more lo^gely than ye other after
as they have deserved. Master what pain is there in hell. My child there are
so many diverse pains and tourmentes yt there is none entendement humayne the
which can co^prehende ne ymagen as of fire stynkynge and right brennynge of
todes / serpents / dragons / and of all foul and cruel bestes and of deuylles
enraged and wode the which never ben weary for to beat and tourment the poor
and miserable dampened / but evermore ben for too begin in such wise that the
leest pain of hell surmounteth all ye pains of this world / but ye one is
more punysshed than the other after their desert / and at the day of Judgment
their pain shall double for than they shall arise and shall be dampened in body
and in soul. Master what pain have the souls of ye Innocents ye which
dies without baptym. My child they ne have pain / ne doloure / ne Joy / ne
gladness. For they never did good nor evil / by the which they have not
meryted to have any good / ne to have any evil and how be it ye the place
wherein they ben be dy^me and derke / All be it there is nothing the which
them greueth / and when ye day of Judgment shall come yt they shall rise they
shall be of the aege that our lord Ihesu christ was when he dyed on the tree
and all ye other. Also ye said children not baptized shall be co^tente with ye
ordinance of god / and than shall return again in to their said place without
ever to have Join heaviness no more than you have of that / ye thou have no
wy^ges for ye apertayneth unto ye birds and not un men / or as you have when a
king or any great prince dies and you shalt not succeed his realm and
syngnourye for thou know well you art not he the which should enheryte /
Also they ne should enheryte ye glorious realm of paradys for they ben exyled
by ye sin of Adam and of Eve / of the which sin they have not ben purged
by baptysm. Master those of paradyse se they those of hell. My child ye / and
yt unto them is a great encreasynge of glory when theyse the pains yt they
have escaped whereof they thank god without ceasynge / and also ye dampened sees
the saved in paradys as we have in the gospel of ye cursed rich man Dyues the
which saw ye soul of the poor lazare in the bosom of Abraham in paradys /
ye which thing is to them a great encreasy^ge of their doloure and anguysshe
when they see the great gods spyrytuall that they have lost by their sins
and by their neclegence / and after ye day of Judgment as the bodies of the
saved shall be gloryfyed they shall se ye dampened corporally / but the dampened
ne may se them corporally. Master ben the saved wroth of the pain of the
dampened. My child they that been in paradys would well that those ye which ben
in hell had so well lived when they were in this world that by their holy
works they had been saved with them. For without ceasynge they pray for the
humaynes living wtin this present world / But sythen that they by their
cursed life and by their sins they be dampened for ever these of paradyse
neither ben heavy nor dyspleasaunt. For in paradyse there is not of heaviness /
nor of dyspleasau^ce of any thing. But all Joy / myrthe / and gladness
without end. Master the ancient taders suffered they any manner of pain in
the lymbe of hell My child / nay / but all only that they were hold in
derkenes and in captyuyte. And were put from the vysyon of god and abode
evermore their delyuerau^ce. Master what knowledge have ye Just ye which ben
in paradys. My child they know the good and their merytes and of the cursed
also / and the cursed knows wherefore they ben dampened / and knows as we
that thing that they see and feel. And those of purgatory ne knows nothing
of this world / if if be not by reuelacyon of angels the which them
conforteth or of the saints of paradyse. These of paradys shows them when
they will / and unto whom they will / but the dampened shall never come forth of
hell till unto the day of Judgment that they shall come to take again their
bodies and to here the sentence of the sovereign Judge / and after they shall
reforne in to hell from whens they shall neuermore return. And if it happen
sometime yt it seems unto us that they show them it is but ye devil the
which shows him unto their semblaunce / if it be not by the suffraunce of
god that they show them sometime unto some holy person as god it will by his
miracle as men says of many / but it is not at their will ne they be not
eased of their pains. For they here evermore their hell with them / and so
they ben evermore in hell. Master how say ye of these women the which says
that they them se in the air of these feyryes / and of these gobelyns the
which the^ calls elues and many other things. My child the women ben most
varyables and more light of believe than men / and therefore was Eve tempted
before Adam. For ye ennemy thought well yt when he had won her yt she should
help him to wy^ne Adam / and therefore the devil showed more sooner his vysyons
unto women than he did unto men / how be it that some men of little faith
there ben often deceived / and of as much yt some women ben of more light
believe of as much ye more the devil shows of vysyons unto the^ in their
mind for to draw them from the faith of Ihesu christ / and thou sholdest
understand that these old wytches the which says that they go on the
saturday fer from their howses / or that they do or se things meruaylous yt
they ne do nothing / but by the great fawte of faith yt they have and by
their folysshe believe and for as much as they ben in sin / for they ben
ydolatres and without faith the devil unto them shows those folysshe vysyons
in their entendemente for the better to bring them unto his line / for in
truth else they remeue not from their place no more than does a stone /
and their vysyons ben semblables unto them of a man the which is drunk unto
whom it seems the house torneth under his fete by the which he falls / and
all the house ne the earth remeue not. In like wise the devil them shows
these vysyons in their entendemente / and also the devil him shows in form
and semblaunce of some personage the which they know yt should be deed.xx.
or.xxx. years past or in form and semblaunce of some of their neighbors /
and shall speak to them famylyarly as it were themlselfe to the end yt they
believe him the better / and that he deceive them the more lightly. but it is
nothing / but it is ye devil himself the which him shows unto them in body
fantastycall as for to de^eyue them / and also makes he yt it unto them seems
yt they go in to a meadow grene full of fair flowers unto whom they make great
chere. But it is nothy^ge / for they ne ben but yllusyons made by the enemy
of nature yt he puts in their entendement / and it seems them somtymes ye
they enter in to an house the gates shytte and that they take the gaders of a
child and eteth them and gooth in to ye celler and dry^keth as much of the
best / and of that deed they go away with out ye / that ye child has any ill /
and that ye wine is nothing ye less in ye tonne the which is a thing
Impossyble / for all ye sorcyers of the world ne all ye deuylles ne can make
pass a right great body humayne by a little clyft / ne enter wtin a house /
but ye he have open passage for to enter / ne to draw ye entrayles fro ye body
of a child without killing or hurtynge it / and when it shall be deed they can
not areyse it / ne they can not draw ye wine of a ton^e without ye there be
less of one drop / for they ben works ye all only ben unto the puyssaunce
of ye sovereign creatoure / Wherefore my child you should put no faith unto
their sorceries and deuyneme^tes / for they ne ben but false Illusyons made by
ye ennemy of nature yt he so^tymes shows some things for to come ye which
he knows by some co^iectures as I have told ye before in speaking of ye
science of ye devil / and sometime ye devil unto them shall show a theft in
say^ge the truth to the end yt they believe ye better in him / and yt the
malfactoure be ye more defamed / and also shall say often truth to the end yt
he be ye sooner believed wha^ by his false reuelacyon he shall accuse some holy
and devout personage / of whom he ne may be otherwise avenged / and for this
cause a man ne should believe them / for they ne be but Illusyons and false
vysyons of the ennemy ye which ne does but lie for to deceive the man / and
also a man ne should believe such people / for ye devil has not any
puyssau^ce upon ye man without so be ye god him suffer / and unto the regard of
the feyryes the which men says were wont to be in times past / they ne were
men ne women naturalles but were deuylles ye which showed themself unto ye
people of ye time for they were paynyms / ydolatres and without faith / and the
said feyryes changed them in to many fourmes / as of an horse / or of a dog /
or otherwise ye which is Impossyble unto nature but ye devil may well show hy^
in many manners and change ye body wherein he shall be put and in taky^ge ageyn
an other of an other form a you may change thyn habyte in taking ye habyte
of a relygyous man / or of a woman / but unto the truth all the wytches of
the world ne all ye deuyls of hell ne can change one kind in to an other /
as a man in to a dog / or a dog in to an ass / for it is Impossyble unto
the^ yt to do / wherefore you may well thy^ke yt these feyryes yt in such wise
showed them in diverse fourmes and ky^des ne were men ne women / ne other thing
natural but were deuylles yt in such wise showed them / and ye which put them
in their ydolles and spoke and said some things for to come by some
co^iectures / as by ye Influences of the bodies celestyalles / for otherwise ye
devil has no knowledge of things for to come and by this mean ye said
feyryes said yt ye people were destenyed ye one unto good yt other to ill after
ye course of heaven and of nature / as a child borne in such in hour and at
such a course / he was destenyed to be hanged or drowned / or yt he should be
rich or poor or yt he should wedde such a woman / ye which things ben
false / for the man has in himself lyberall arbytre and fre will to do good
or ylle in such wise yt if he will he ne shall do thing wherefore he should be
hanged, ne yet put him in ye danger to be drowned / ne also he shall not mary
a woman but if he will and so her destynacyons shall be false. By these reasons
a man should put to no faith / for as says the psalmyste. (Dir sapiens
dn^abitur astris). That is to say / yt the wyseman should have lordeshyp above
the sterres and planettes / For he shall not govern him after his sensualyte
and inclynacyon natural / ^ut he should govern him wisely by reason folowy^ge
the good and eschuynge ye ylle / for the will of man ^s so free yt nothing ne
may make it vnfree / and if ye man should do good or ill by force against his
will he ne should have lyberall arbytre / and so his life should have no
merit / the which thing is false and against the faith / Wherefore my child
you ne should believe it. It is also defended upon ye pain of death and of
dampnacyon eternal / and in regard of the ^e words and of these sperytes and
elues / and also of many other vysyons yt men say yt they se by nyt they ben
often deuylles yt put them in form of some deed body in faynynge his voice to
tempte ye person of some thing / for as says ye psalmyst. (Spiritus vadens
et non rediens). yt is to say yt after yt ye soul is departed from ye body she
gooth unto ye pla^e where she has deserved without ever toretome till unto ye
day of Judgment / if it be not by great necessyte / and great miracle / as we
read of lazare and of many other / but elues / gobelyns / and helquins yt
which men se by night / as men of arms trottynge on horseback with great
assembles / they ben deuylles the which ben among us yt which shows them
in such a form and in many other fourmes as of a dog / of an horse / of a
tree / or of a stone / and in many other fourmes for to tempte the man of some
vice / and for to make him err in the faith / and somtymes these deuylles
comes unto the stables and fyndeth ye horse and tourneth all that the which
was above vndneth by derysyon of the man and for to tempte him / and sometime
they unbind the little thyldren and them casts from the cradell for to make
the fader and the mother wroth and often kill the children wha^ god it suffers
/ for the sin of ye fader / or of the mother / or for to prove them as he did
Job when he suffered that the devil him did so many of ylles / and of
tourmentes for to preue him in his great pacye^ce for without ye permyssyon of
god they have no puyssaunce / but ben as the hang man the which without the
bidding of ye Judge ne may hang ne beat any evil doer. wherefore my child
thou sholdest return yt unto god and unto the saints and to live holyly as
says the psalmyst. (Non timebis amore nocturno. That is to say thou shalt not
dread of chose folysshe vysyons by night. For they ne ben but Illusyons made by
the enemy as it is said. Master may the ennemy be constrained to come by
words or by signs. My child nay / if he ne will / but they ben the
cou^tenaunces yt he has with those yt ben of his sect ye which in saying some
words / or in maky^ge (...) or cara^^^es thither ^keth that / that he
demands / to the end yt he them hold the better in his line.

Master what say ye of these dremes My child you should take no head unto them
for they ne be but vysyo^s of some things on yt which a man has thout or
seen before waki^ge / and a man dremeth often of yt ye which is semblable unto
his complexyon. Master how know ye prophets tho dayyes yt: ye they saw by
dreme. My sone yt was not by dremes all only / but it was by ye reuelacyon of
god / for with the vysyon they had an ymagynacyon and believe especyal in the
bounte of our lord that / ye thing that they had seen in slepynge came.
Master sith ye god dyscended in earth for to save ye sinners wherefore ben they
dampened. My child there is not so great a sinner in the world yt and if he
reknowelege his sin and cry god mercy with good heart but yt he be perdoned by
ye merit of the does and passion of Ihesu christ / but those ye will not
knowledge their sin but ben obstynate till unto ye death / know you that they
ben dampened eternally for god ne saves the sinner the which will not save
himself / and also paradyse is not deserved by sin but it is lost. Master
sith yt god deyed for our sy^nes wherefore ben we baptized. My child for ye
baptym is the homage yt we owe unto our lord Ihesu christ by the which all
our sins ben pardoned and in such wise ordained he it as tells ye gospel
that says thus. (Quicu^que baptisatus fuerit. That is to say / who so shall be
baptized shall be saved / and he yt is not shall be dampened. Master how many
persons shall be saved. My child there shall be as many saved as there fell
of the cursed aungelles of paradys by their pride / for the men and ye women
ben made for to be in their place / and for that cause is ye ennemy so enuyous
against man. Master from whens came the first ydolatres My child they were
first found in abell the which is now called babylon the great and there
shall ye anthecryst be borne and there was ye toure with ye gyauntes the which
is of xl. stages. There reigned ye first king of this world the which men
called Neron the which caused to be made an image of Appolyn / and commanded
all those of his realm that they should do him sacrafyce and worship him and
in likewise did they the which came after him in such wise yt when some
great princes were deed their successoures caused to make of images
meruaylously rich in ye name of their predesessoures / and made their
subgettes to adoure the^ / and to do sacryfice and were called ydolles in to
whom ye devil entered and spoke and told the^ many of abusyons and so did
they of greece unto their king / and they of rome unto Romulus as men fy^de by
the wryty^ges and au^cyent chronicles.

depiction of master and discipleMayster where for ne made god that man ne
should ete but one time i^ a weke My child ye honger is one of ye passions yt
we suffer by ye sy^ne of ada^ / and so we have eueri day honger: and thyrste /
cold / and heet / and many other passions to the end yt we travail always for
to thy^ke on our needs and of our neighbors / to the end yt by our travail
and labor contynuall we have ye more of merit / for if ye man had not of
necessyte he should have no care to travail / but he should be evermore in
slouthe / and should not know what good were worth / and also he should
mysknowe his creatoure: And how be it that the great lords and gentylmen and
other rich trauayleth not corporally / All be it they travail spyrytually
evermore. That is to understand in their understanding and will in having
evermore desire to get / for he ye most has and more would have of as much
is it the more great / and when you hau^ confessed all thy sins whereof thou
remembered y^ thou should cry god mercy with good heart in great contrycyon and
dyspleasaunce / and in demanding of thy confessoure yt which is ye
lyeutenaunt of god absolucyon and penance / the which you should accomplysshe
entyerle unto thy power in great reverence. and thou should keep the from
sin as much as ye may / specially during the time of thy penance Master
unto whom should a man confess hy^. My child unto a priest dyscrete and wise
the which knows what it is of sin / and who has it not / and who that can
dyscerne between the sin mortal and denial / for who so confesses him unto
priest not knowing and Ignouraunt puts his soul in great te adventure for
right often ye confession is nothing worth. Master may a man confess him to
any other but unto his curate. My child if thou be in a strange country you
may confess the unto hy^ that you will / And if thou be in thy parysshe and
thou will not confess the unto thy curate the which is Ignouraunt / or yt thy
sin touch his person / or yt he show thy confession whereby there might
come any sclaunder / or by many other reasons thou should demand license / and
if he will not give it the thou may take an other of thyn own auctoryte. But
if thou confess the unto them the which have the power and the puyssaunce of
the bishop / or of ye (...) as be many great clerks and great prechoures /
thou may do it without lysence of thy curate / so that you be confessed unto
thy curate one time in the year / you may confess the else where as often as
thou will your license.

Master how and fro whe^s shall the Anthecryst come. My child he shall be
borne in babylon of a cursed man and of a cursed woman the which shall be of
the lygnage of Dam / and of ye womb of his mother he shall be full of the cursed
speryte and shall be nourysshed and confermed in enchauntementes and shall be
emperor of all ye world / and shall put the people under him in four
manners. That is to understand the princes and other rich / and covetous by
gifts / for he shall have by his enchauntementes all the tresoures hid in
the earth. The poor by great dread and rygoure of Justice / for he shall make
them grievously to be martred. The clergy by conning whereof he shall be full /
For he shall conne ye vij arts and all the other scryptures. and ye devout
persons by tokens and by miracles yt shall be meruaylous. For he shall make ye
fire to dyscende yt shall brenne his enmyes before him / and also he shall make
ye deed men to arise / not truly / but ye devil shall enter in to ye bodies
of some dampened and the deuylles shall bear them / and anon make them to speak
by his enchau^tement and to walk as if they were a ^ue / and shall reedyfye
Ihrlm and there he shall make most has in thinking / and so my child none
ne may live without pain and travail / but every man has much to do in his
right.

Master what be tokeneth ye mysteryes and cermonies that me^ make unto the
church. My child they show us good example / and we figure the old
testament and the new and our lord Ihesu christ is loved in the church at
the hours of maty^s for at such hour he was taken of the false Jews and
led unto ye great priests of the law / as it is written in the hours of the
cross / at pryme / for at such hour he was led and brought before Pylate
where he was falsely accused and vylanously scourged at the third / for at
such hour he was crowned with thorn and clothed with purple by derysyon and
was cladde with a white robe in ye house of Herod by great mockerye / at the
sexte / for at such hour he was hanged and nailed on the cross at noone /
for at such hour he dyed on the tree of ye cross / at euensonge time / for
at such hour his precious body was taken down from the cross and anointed
with precious oyntementes / and at co^plyne / for at such hour he was buried /
and thou shalt understand that in the mass unto us is fygured ye death and
passion of Ihesu christ by ye aulbe ye white robe where with he was cladde / and
by the chasuble the robe of purple and men say the pystle on the right hand /
for it is the token of the good life the which ledeth unto the right hand of
paradys / and men read ye gospel on the lift hand / for by the lift hand
unto us is sygnyfyed sin / for the gospel is the most strong and of most
great virtue / and therefore it is put on the lift hand for to defend us
against sin / for a man should evermore put the most strongest against ye
party from whens comes the strokes / and the images well hydden in showing
ye god and the saints of paradys have abhomynacyon of our sins and to speak
well there ne is cermonye but yt it show unto us some great mystere. Master
how should a man confess him. My child you should first examyn thy conscience
in recordynge the places where you haste ben and how thou there have lived / for
there ne is thing that better does to thy^ke of sins as to record the
places where a man has be / and in so doing you should examyn thy conscience.
First of thy five wits naturalles. That is to know of thyn eyes / of eeres /
of hands / of atouchynges / of the mouth / of the nose and of al thyn heart.
Secondely also of the vij. mortal sins / and of their branches the which
ben.vij / yt is to understand / pride / couetyse / envy / ire / glotony
lechery / and sloth. Thyrdely of ye.xij. artycles of ye faith yt ben contained
in the creed. Fourthly of the.x commandments of the law the which our
lord gave unto Moses. Fyfthly of ye.vij works of mercy if you acco^plysshe
them when you may well do it. Sextely of ye.vij. sacraments of the holy
church if you ne have had in them perfyte believe / And seue^thly of the.vij.
cardynall virtues / if you has had them in the and kept as thou art bound to
do. and that done you should go to confess the with great humylyte and contrycyon
and dyspleasaunt of thy sins / in having ferme purpose to committee them no
more / for otherwise thou repentest the not. And when thou shalt be before thy
confessoure in great humylyte confess unto him all thy sy^nes entyerly / and
clearly that he understand it in telling him all the form and manner how and
wherefore thou have committed them / and also thou should tell the time and the
place if thou remember it for if thou sin the holy days / thou sy^nest more
grievously than on the werkynge days and if thou sin in place hallowed thou
synnest more than in an other place / and in confessing the you should hold
the order of confession in telling by order thy sins as thou have them
recorded before to the end that thou forgete not / and so thou should tell all
unto thy confessoure / for if thou leave one unto thy wyttynge for shame or
otherwise thy confession is none / for it is not entyere / Ne also thou ne
should depart thy confession in telling the one half unto one confessoure /
and the other half unto an other confessoure / For also it is not entyer and
hole / aad it is nothing worth / but thou sholdest confess and shryue the
entyerly unto one confessoure of all yt / yt you may remember / How be it if
after thy confession thou remembrest some thing thou may well confess the
unto an other / but yet thou shall do better to return unto the first if thou
may. Also my child you should confess the cyrcumstaunces of thy sy^nes in
telling that ye which has moeued the unto sin / the form and the manner
that thou have holden in co^myttynge thy sin / and the ill the which comes
unto an other and unto thy self. Also you sholdest confess the of ill examples
that thou haste given unto an other by thy sin and also thou shalt confess
the of will and consenting that you have had / and of the pain that you haste
taken for to committee it / for who so consents to sin all only if it be
mortal / he synneth mortally as witnesses the holy gospel.

ye master

ye dyscyple

Also my child you should tell ye dignite and proximyte of the person with whom
thou have commyttes the sin as if the were a vyrgyn / or a relygyous woman /
or married or thy kynnes woman / or a comy^ woman without namynge her otherwise.
For in thy confession thou sholdest not confess the of the sy^ne of an other
ne dyffame her / but thou should all only tell her estate for to declare the
gretenes of thy sin / for of asmoche as ye person is dygne in whom the
sin is committed the beginning of the world with all the deuyls. And (...) is
done our lord Ihesu christ and all his holy aungelles and archau^gels shall
mount with the good in to ye glory eternal af paradys. And ye cursed so shall
descend in to hell with all the deuylles from whens they shall never come ne
depart / but shall be evermore in pain / doloure / and heaviness in ye fire of
hell perdurably. Master which ben those yt shall be dampened. My child yt
shall be the Jews / and mysbeleuers and the cursed crystyens that shall deye
in mortal sy^ne without repentance. And men shall se clearly at ye day of
Judgment ye conscience the one of ye other / whereby every man shall give
Judgment of himself and in this manner shall be known all the good deeds and
the ill. For a man did never any ylle ne sy^ne be it never so secret / but yt
than it shall be clearly seen and showed openly before god and before all the
world. Master what ben ye Joys of paradys. My child they ben so right great
yt a man ne can tell them. For the saved shall se god face to face and shall
know all things as the aungelles. The bodies of the saved shall be clear and
shynynge as the son / they shall be incontinent where they will be as ye
thought the which incontinent is borne thither where it lyketh. They shall have
no shame to be all naked the one before ye other for they shall be all cle^sed
fro sy^ne and shall be so co^fermed in ye grace and in ye love of our lord yt
they may never sy^ne more ne have any evil thout / they shall ne have ho^ger ne
thyrst / for they ne ne shall be more subgectes to ye influe^ces of ye planettes
meanly yt also makes ye degestyo^ unto ye body humayne but shallbe there
above incorruptybles and and fed of the grace of god / they can not cease
to yield graces and praysynges un to god of the great mercy that he unto the^
has done. And to speak shortly the Joys of paradys ben so great that there
ne is entendement the which them can comprehend / For if all the goods / and
all the Joys and gladnesses the which ben / was / and shall be in the wor^
were all to gyders yt should be nothing unto the co^paryson of the leest glory
of paradys. For all the Joys of this world ben transytoryes / and also
passes as smoke. But the Joys of paradys ben perpetuelles and without end.

depiction of master and discipleMayster how many ordres of aungelles ben in
peradys. My child there be nine The first order is called the order of
seraphy^s the which is ye most highest / The second of the Cherubyns. The
third is of the thrones / The fourth of the puyssaunces The fyfth is of the
princes. The syxte of the seygnouryes: The seventh of the vertus. The eight of
the.ix. ordres as lords above their servants archaungels. And the nynth of
ye aungelles the which is most low. and all the saints holy men and women of
paradys ben above them Master have we every of us his good angel the which
keeps us: My child every one has his good angel the which him defends
from the ylle and styreth him to do well / and so had our lord Ihesu christ
of good aungelles for to mynyster unto him. And the Anthecryst shall have one
to keep hy^ from doing of so much ill as he may well. And ye au^gelles ben of
ye last and most low order yt is called proprely the order of au^gelles as I
have now told the. Master wherefore loses ye moan sometime his clerenesse. My
child the moon has none other light but that / yt the son unto her gives /
so it happens often that the earth is found between ye son (...) and the moon in such wise that ye son ne may give her clerenes / and than she is all
black / for ye earth shadoweth her But when the earth is not dyrectely between
them / but some part all only than is she clear in as much as the son
mayse her / and when the earth is nothing between them than is she clear / for
there is nothing between them. And for that cause has the moon ever the
back toward the son. Master what thing is the bow of heaven the which we
se in the air. My child they ben the beams of the son the which meddle
them in ye matter of the moon yt which is thycke yt which takes four
colors yt which ben dysposed to receive many and diverse colors after ye
nature of herbs and of ye place where they grow. Master fro whe^s comes the
wyndes / thondres / frostes / snowes / raynes / dewes / and such semblable
thing. My child al these things comes of some vapoures the which aryseth
from the earth in heyght by the virtue of ye son / of yt which some ben
dry / and the other moist and when such yt which ben lift up till unto ye
mean regyon of ye air yt which is right cold they ben made thycke and begin
to drop / and from thens comes the rain. And when ye cold is gretely
destraynynge above so they assemble and congeleth / and from thens comes the
hayle / and when these drops falls here allow / and fyndeth this bace
region of ye air cold, as in winter they also congele meanly ye wy^de the
which is cold and from thens comes ye snowes / and this dew is made of the
self vapoures / yt which when they dyscende upon the earth / and there
fyndeth cold they convert them in to water. But when these vapoures ben dry
and light they arise up more hye unto the third regyon of the air the which
is hot / for it touches the regyon of the fire in such wise when the
vapoures dry yt these clerks calls exalacyons passes in the air and
meteth the one with ye other / the most strongest cadereth ye most weykest by
the virtue of the son and of the moon / and from thens comes the wyndes /
and when these exalacyons passes in mountynge by the mean regyon of ye air
the which is right cold they meddle them with the cloud and closes them wtin
ye cold: and the he^^ of ye son stryketh bre^ny^gely between these clouds
in such wise yt these exalacyons hot yt ben enclosed wtin ye clouds will go
forth / but they ne may for ye cloud is cold and thycke ye which holds the
