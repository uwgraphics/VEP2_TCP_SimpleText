THE NAKED WOMAN, OR A RARE EPISTLE SENT TO Mr. PETER STERRY Minister at
WHITEHALL;

Desiring him to show the Causes or Reasons of his silence, in that he neither
by his Ministerial Office, charged the Magistrates that were present to
redress, nor so much as showed any sign of grief or detestation, as became a
sincere Christian;

Against that most strange and shameful late Act of an impudent woman, in the
midst of his Sermon on a Lords day at Whitehall Chapel, concerning the
Resurrection, before the chief States of this Nation.

A satisfactory Answer he returned; which with a loving acception thereof, are
here also printed; very worthy the observation of all, both sexes and degrees
of People in these Nations.

Prove. 7. 25, 26, 27. Let not thine heart decline unto her ways, go not astray
in her paths, for she has cast down many wounded, yea many strong men have
been slain by her: her house is the way to Hell, going down to the chambers of
death. LONDON Printed for E. Blackmore, at the Angel in Paul's Churchyard, 1652.

The PROLOGUE to the impartial Reader.
THe causes wherefore I write to this Preacher are three in number, the first
is, That all the wars of the three Nations were not only contrived by the
special advice and means of the Lordly Preachers, who both lived in stately
Palaces, and were the chief associates of Kings; but likewise all along these
troubles, they whiles they had any power and authority remaining on their side,
gave special directions to their inferior Preachers for blowing the bellows
to the fire of contention, by continual railings and threatenings in their
Pulpits; although many of those temporizers have been, and are still in fatter
Benefices, than they were even when they used all their flatteries, both with
cap in hand and bowed knees, to those their Lords and Masters; yea and though
diverse of them have not ceased from conspiring against the present State,
whereof one was made exemplary, as there was one likewise of the Prelates to
all the rest.

The second is, That whatsoever digressions, false doctrines, and unjust
applications, either the superior or inferior sort of those self-seeking men
were pleased to deliver in public, from such texts of Scripture, as they
commonly used (or rather abused) to serve their present occasions, even to
alienate the Peoples (...)ctions from truth and godliness to falsehood and
wickedness; and so by that and other deceitful means at last, to unjust and
unnatural Wars, there was no man of whatsomever degree (who was then called a
Subject) throughout all the three Nations, that durst upon pain of his life,
yea and estate too, if he had any, oppose the meanest of those Clergymen in
that place, and at that time, I mean, immediately after they had finished their
Sermon, although it pleases God to give all the men of any Church absolute
liberty to oppose as need does require, 1 Cor. 14. 29, 30, 31. So that
whatsoever expressions those hirelings uttered in their Pulpits, were generally
received both by most of the vulgar, and all the profane multitude, even better
oftentimes than if they had been the Oracles of God: and as for the learned
Nobility, Gentry, Judges, Lawyers, Physicians and chief Citizens, who for the
most part had more illumination than sanctification, verily their lands,
possessions, riches and great trades, yea and fear both of Persecution and want
of those their perishing gods, proved like as many gaggs to stop their
deceitful mouths; as that young rich man menti^ned in the Gospel, who alleged
that he had kept the whole Law of God from his youth, and yet lacked the doing
only of one thing, did choose rather to leave Christ* than to do that thing,
though it was as subject to perish in the using, as he himself was in his
mortal condition.

And the third cause is, That seeing after three months patient expectation,
either of some course or other to have been taken concerning the presumptuous
attempt of that shameless woman in this Letter mentioned, or at least some
well-affected parties to have written their minds unto this Preacher therein,
he being the mouth of that high Assembly; I to supply the last and least of
these defects, though not in the measure I could wish, but in the manner I am
(through divine Providence) abl^, (being all those months sick, as yet I am
not well) have thought it a part both of my Christian duty, and as a
well-wisher to this Commonwealth, even to write unto him, both for mine own and
many other peoples satisfaction, yea and undeceiving of all the three Nations,
even to know the causes or reasons of his silence and negligence, both in so
pertinent a time, and so urgent a business as is here treated, he being the
only man who might, if not to have prevented, yet to have gotten remedied both
whatsoever was amiss then, or has, by means and occasion of the very same his
silence and negligence, occurred since.

Therefore, as upon other occasions both of enormities, defects and extremities
of some peoples carriages, I have, through Gods assistance, used my best
endeavors according to my liberty, in witnessing against such irregular
things; Even so through the same assistance, I have here concerning this
matter, done the like to this Preacher, who of a hundred I would not have
expected, that any such absurd act should have so publikly escaped his censure:
and so much the rather, in that he was not only interrupted on his stage, from
acting his own part, whereby all his Auditors for a time became spectators of
the other impudent act, but carefully attending likewise what after his so long
silence he would express: I wish that the matter here written, as it is both
illustrated and compared with others of the like nature, may sink so deeply
both in his heart and all theirs whom it does especially, or may any wise
concern, that they may not only repent both publicly and privately for this so
heinous and notorious an offense to God and his People, but likewise all the
rest of their days bring forth such fruits worthy amendment of life, that
through Gods grace they may learn to walk in the way of wisdom, christianity,
modesty and sobriety. Farewell.

THE NAKED WOMAN* OR A RARE EPISTLE SENT TO Mr. PETER STERRY Minister at
WHITEHALL, etc.
Mr. Sterry,
ALthough neither I know you, nor, I suppose, you me by face, yet in regard
that I always hoped better things of you, in that you served the late worthy
Lord Brooks, than of many others of your profession, and that there is a
strange report of a very barbarous act, or misdemeanour of very high nature,
which has lately occurred, where you, by your Ministerial office, might have
charged those that had power, to have timely redressed; and it is confirmed by
many credible persons, whereof some were both eye and ear witnesses; which is
no less grievous to the Godly, than ridiculous to the wicked; I am therefore
the more earnest to entreat you by these lines, that you will be pleased to
declare unto me, by your direct answer in writing, the true causes or reasons
of your silence, which is usually taken for consent seeing you only filled up
the room of your Pulpit, much worse than any mere or bare cipher, which
although of it self it signifies no value of any thing, yet it makes most of
all the figures about it, to betoken a far greater value than they would
without it, whiles a signifying figure is not in place of it; for you made all
the well-affected about you, yea and of all these united Nations much worse,
both through grief and evil example of that your silence and negligence,
besides the strengthening of the wicked in that respect, you being esteemed to
have been far more conscionable, than to have been so utterly careless in
doing such a needful point of your duty, as it does seem to many even to be a
conniving with such a brutish and vile attempt, both at such a solemn time, and
in such an eminent place, which indeed does greatly endanger your reputation,
in that you was the only man then appointed, or at least allowed to be the
mouth, pastor, overseer, and watchman of that honorable assembly; howsoever, I
conceive you both was and are there in the general or common way of the
National practice, and not according to the constitution, purity, sincerity,
nor order of the totally separated Churches mentioned in Christ's glorious
Gospel, See Romans 7. 4, 5, 6. 2 Cor. 6. 17, 18. and Rev. 18. 4, 5, 6. with
abundance of other places, which would be tedious to express.

Again, to go another way to work, both for the better searching the depth,
trying to find out the secrecy of this most barbarous attempt, in such a
civilized Nation, chiefly by the spiritual illumination of the Gospel, and
that must be by serious consideration of all the circumstances so pretermitted,
and not regarded, but smoothed over by your silence; neither King Solomon the
wisest of mankind, nor any other writer of the Scripture, did ever forbid any
wise or discreet man, to speak in time and place convenient, if they have a
lawful call, charge, or office to that purpose, but only all fools whatsoever
or whosoever they be, and that because they lack wisdom and discretion to
discern between good and evil; and I am confident that its a greater and more
inexcusable fault for a wise and discreet man to be silent, when in the
dutiful discharge of his office, he ought of necessity to speak, than for a
simple fool when he should hold his peace, even freely to deliver his mind,
although it should not be pertinent to the matter in hand; for the one may do
both much good, and hinder much evil, by his timely, discreet and wise speech,
as Hushai did to King David, but the other can do little either good or evil,
by his unadvised and frivolous speech; for the first has not only a call
appropriated to his function to speak, but likewise wisdom, discretion,
moderation, conscience, reason, and it may be religion also, all concurring to
enable him; whereas the second is destitute and void of all these gifts and
graces, yea, and cannot by any kind of human endeavors reach to the true
understanding of any such precious favors. But the same divine Author speaks
sometimes of those wicked fools, who having too much knowledge, though little
true wisdom, do use it as a weapon of unrighteousness, even to offend the
almighty and great God of whom they received it, in that they are thereby as
much enabled as they are willing to offend his people, which he always
accounts, as an injury done to himself.

Moreover, by the way, it will be no less needful than seasonable, to show an
Example very worthy (I suppose) both of your, mine own, and all men's
observation, not for a day, a week, a month, a year, but whiles we are in this
mortality; I knew a man about 30 years ago, that being an older teacher (I
think) than you are in years, who being all his time until the last year of
his life (to my best remembrance) in so high esteem for the excellency of his
gifts, and gravity of his conversation too, (so far as man could discern) that
King James often hearing him, and his name being Master John Hall, did call him
Master John All (sine aspiratione) meaning, that the true copy of all the
knowledge, memory, learning, expression, and diversity of gifts requisite in a
preacher of the word, which were respectively in all others of that nation at
least, were fully registered and found in him alone, saving only the shortness
of his tongue, whereby the ripeness of hs memory, and speediness of his
delivery did precipitate and outrun many people who were of dull or slow
apprehension; but he proving at last, when persecution began to arise for the
Gospel (never being acquainted with the feeling, but only with the hearing and
reading thereof before) to be such an open hypocrite and hireling, that he
quite left those his simple sheep, by whose yearly Fleeces he was very richly
and constantly maintained with all his family, as their Pastor above forty
years space, even when both the great Woolf himself, and all his hungry
followers, came to tear and devour them to pieces

Yet a little while afterward, when his Conscience began to be wakened for his
most heinous sins, and receiving (I hope) a little blink of Christ's joyful
countenance, as Peter who also denied him in another case had in the hall of
Caiphas, and he being ashamed to be seen any more in the streets, if he had
been an universal Monarch, he would have given the whole world for license
only to have preached one Sermon more on a first day in that most eminent City
of the Nation, and chief high-place thereof, unto which he was externally
advanced, and that (as may in regard of his great earnestness afterward appear
to be well conjectured) to have asked forgiveness publicly both of God and all
his Flock, for his so sinful, undutifull, and ungrateful both offending his
infinite Majesty, and them, and that merely for fear to incur the indignation,
or (at worst) the persecution of a finite and perishing Majesty, even by
leaving and exposing them to the arbitrary will and lust of that implacable
enemy, that he might impose upon them all the gross Popery both transacted
between him and the Pope long before that time, and intended to have been begun
there, and then, both by the military and all other witty aid of that nature,
after they had embraced the same, even to have brought it with a high hand
here, they being always (by their travels abroad) expert in wars, and this
Nation in long peace, and out of use until of late years; which business
because he was not able to effect in his own days, therefore, even as King
David gave his Son Solomon charge to deal with Joab and Shimei after his
death, so he left his Son to prosecute that Romish design to his utmost power
after he was gone; and in reference thereunto, upon his and the Bishops of both
Nations urging that gross Service Book in that Nation, until the rest of that
poysonable stuff should have followed, all the cruel Wars throughout all the
three Nations, which have been almost ever since, have proceeded.

Furthermore, it may be upon good grounds imagined, that this ancient Preacher
not only intended to have given his best advice to his Flock, as his last Will
and Testament, even to stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made
them free, and not to be entangled again with the yoke of bondage: but likewise
as touching his own grievous failings, to have entreated them, That they would
be pleased (out of their tender compassion toward his everlasting weal) to
add their fervent prayers to his, for mercy and reconciliation to him, through
a lively faith laying hold on the all-sufficient merits of Jesus Christ, before
he should go hence and be seen no more, and to have besought them, that as
they hoped to be saved at the great day of Retribution, never to make his nor
any other men's wanderings their examples to reiterate and follow, but
altogether as so many terrors (like Sea-marks or Beacons set on Rocks) for
ships to avoid and eschew: And concerning the event of what great diligence his
friends and acquaintances (howsoever very numerous and powerful) did use, to
have obtained the License before mentioned, both of superior and inferior
powers, they being often reproved for so high an attempt, which then was so hot
in prosecution; after they were long delayed, at last, they were absolutely
refused: whereupon in great grief, but I hope with such godly sorrow as through
Christ he found mercy, God himself favorably accepting the will for the deed,
and private repentance, when public is hindered by man, he finished his course.

By whose example, even from the beginning to the ending of his Ministry, all
of us, yea the best of us, have very great need to observe, that we ought not
upon any kind of terms, preferments, promises, bribes (now called gratuities)
fears, terrors, threatenings, losses, yea or persecution it self, though
inflicted in the highest degree, that either Satan or his Instruments can
devise, to deny Christ before men, and that by walking contrary to the purity
of his Gospel, if we any wise aim at the glory of God, and salvation of our
own souls, at the great day of his glorious appearing, and confessing us
before his heavenly Father* but to work out our salvation in fear and
trembling, and to make our calling and election sure by well-doing, chiefly in
performing all and whatsomever our duties, both spiritual and temporal, to our
utmost in due time, even whiles it is called to day, and not boast off until
to morrow, because we know not what a day may bring forth; for time is one of
the most precious jewels under the Sun, and upon the well or ill spending of
time depends Eternity either of weal or woe.

But to conclude all these first particulars tending to the dehortation of all
people from such a shameless attempt as is here with great detestation
witnessed against, and insist also in another sort thereof, before we adhere to
the matter it self, wherein I shall be as brief as is requisite; if King
Solomon who wrote by the inspiration of the Spirit, did not only say, That a
word in his place is like Diamonds of gold set in pictures of silver, but
likewise did direct every man who has received knowledge, either to do or
devise any temporal work for the benefit of the Commonwealth, not to delay the
same, but to accomplish it with all their power; then how much more ought those
who are entrusted with any kind of charge, to perform their duties to their
utmost, chiefly when they are either spiritual, or tend to any spiritual use?
Yea, and he also gives such a strong reason as can admit of no opposition; For
(says he) there is neither work, nor invention, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in
the grave whither thou go.

And as in one respect, modesty be sufficient to make any sincere Christian
both very much grieved and perplexed, only to mention that most presumptuous
and impudent act, both for matter and manner as it came to pass, even by one
of the female sex, whose duty was to have been most shamefaced, chiefly as it
tends to open, universal, avowed and allowed wickedness; though I know by
undoubted proof, that all such absurd things, are utterly abhorred by diverse
both of those Worthies that sit at the helm, and of those also who under God
defend them by the sword: so in another respect, howsoever necessity may seem
to require an expression both of the matter and manner thereof, because the
same may be a special means to move both that strange-like woman, and such
others as be guilty, either of that shameless act, or the like, unto a godly
sorrow, for I hear there are many sprung up of late in and about this sinful
City; yet in regard of the wicked and profane sort, who (as Solomon says) make
a mock of sin, its far more expedient (as I conceive) that it be henceforth
concealed, than any more, chiefly in Print, revealed, even to avoid imitation,
as its said; there was no particular law made, forbidding any man to kill his
Father, but in general, that no man should do any murder: And that Sir, you
and I may know one another mind, in order to the satisfaction both of me (who
in stead of a better, do here write unto you for that purpose) and of many
thousands of others, who have only heard of your name in that particular, and
daily after so long delay, do ardently expect the same, yea, and doubtless will
be very ready henceforth both to speak and respect of you according as you
shall be able and willing to clear your self by your punctual answer,
concerning your so countenancing with silence, such a notorious evil, as I
much doubt if any record can parallel.

Again, you know its upon divine record, That Queen Vasthi the wife of King
Ahasuerus (though a Heathen as well as he) so preferred her modesty, sobriety,
and chastity above all other earthly things she could lose, that she absolutely
refused at an inconvenient time to humor the King her husband so much, as to
vouchsafe to come unto that incomparable Feast, when he was merry with Wine,
amongst the midst of his chief Princes, Nobles and People, though in a very
solemn manner he himself sent not only his chiefest Officers, but likewise the
Crown-Royall for her, even to show his Princes, Nobles and People her beauty,
for she was fair to look on; and doubtless had the richest both jewels and
ornaments, as well as apparel, wherewith to deck her self, that the world
could afford, her husband being so great a Monarch, that he had a hundred seven
and twenty Provinces under his jurisdiction and command, yea and of such a
noble and ingenuous disposition likewise, as appeared concerning his
unrequired, but not undeserved thankfulness to Mordecai* though he was both a
stranger to him, and one of another Nation as well as Religion: all which
modesty, sobriety and gravity of this worthy Queen, yea and discretion also in
observing fit times and seasons, as Solomon says there is to all earthly
things, do so much the more aggravate the evil of that most impudent and
presumptuous act, which had not any the least reason or warrant, and far less
any call to do it, as this famous Queen had to have appeared in a most
magnifick order and manner, before her husband and King: so that both that
shameless woman's presumption (of whom we speak) and your silent beholding her,
even like other spectators, whereof many looked far more on you, than her,
admiring much that you by your Ministerial charge, and being also in the
Pulpit and middle of your Sermon, yea, and none other then having authority to
speak, how you in your conscience could both in so needful a time, so eminent
a place, and upon so urgent an occasion, be so negligent in the discharge of
that your duty as well as the delivery of your Sermon it self, which also you
being forced to forbear, during the time and presence of that shameful
spectacle, was the more free to have expressed your mind concerning her
mis-behaviour.

For you as well know as I can express, that you ought to have used the best
and speediest means, by the most pertinent and moving expressions you could,
both unto the Magistrates and chief Military Officers there present, even for
justice of such a presumptuous and shameless woman for so barbarous and
uncivil an action, as both at so solemn a time and in so eminent a place, she
so unhappily, and I fear too exemplarily brought to pass, if it be not as
exemplarily punished; by which strange kind of disturbance not only your self
had intermission in the midst of your Sermon, but likewise all the honorable
Auditors discredit, by such a base opposition: for although you saw some
well-affected people remove her, without any the least of your aid,
encouragement, yea or allowance, so much as a bare word; yet (as I said) you
being the only man that was set there to speak, it was your duty so to have
confirmed that their worthy act of removing her, that you should have given
them charge likewise by virtue of your own Ministerial charge, to have kept her
close and safe from any escape, until the matter had been exactly tried, and
so much the rather, that the like in our days at least, never occurred.

And if such enormities be not permitted where there are neither civil
Magistrates, nor temporal punishments, without the highest spiritual censures
that can be inflicted, even in any totally separated Church from all kind of
antichristian worship, worshippers, officers, Government, maintenance and high
places; then ought not such gross, vile, and presumptuous enormities, to be
condignly punished in a national Church, where they pretend to have as
lawfully the spiritual sword, as they have the temporal? and so much the
rather, in that this absurd act came to pass in one of the chief assemblies of
this Nation, even by one member both of your own Church, and Commonwealth
before your eyes; and as touching the particulars which by your silence were
omitted, in that the party by occasion of that your negligence was not kept,
but escaped, (even to the shame of all concerned therein,) they are these. 1
She ought to have been to sure custody committed, until the matter had been
thoroughly examined, and not (as she was half an hour) for the fashion sake,
until she put on her clothes, even most likely by means of some either of her
own friends or favorers of her evil ways. 2 She ought to have been demanded
both what were the reasons and intentions of that her so presumptuous,
impudent, and barbarous attempt? 3 Whether such kind of lascivious and
licentious carriage, be the custom of the company where she uses to walk? 4
With what Company she walks? 5 How long? 6 Whether or no she was sent by
them? 7 If not, then by whom? 8 If by none at all, then did she not run unsent?
9 What her name was? 10 If she has a husband? 11 If yea, what his name was? 12
where he dwells? 13 And if he and she live together? So that by knowing these
or most of these particulars, both the neighbors where they dwell, and others
who would have visited her in her imprisonment, might have possibly in short
time declared diverse things which her self would have always obscured: But it
passes all expression, both the multiplicity and diversity of evils (as was
said in the Preface) which have come to pass in these distressed Nations, both
before and during these destructive wars, as well by the silence of hundreds o^
your profession, and not pressing the best things, as by their most vehement
urging the worst, the Lordly sort, for the Bishoprics and Deanries, and the
inferior sort, for the Tithes and other antichristian forced maintenance.

And as the Apostle Paul writes to the Church of Corinth, It Is reported (says
he) that there is fornication amongst you, and such fornication as is not so
much as named among the Gentiles, even that one should have his fathers wise;
so upon such an abominable account, as unto which that Sodom-like act tends,
though not expedient to be here mentioned, not only a man may have his own
mother or sister, but a woman likewise her own father or brother, even like the
brute beasts of the field, which not being made according to the Image of God,
but only subordinate to serve the use of man, are not capable of law nor
reason: so that it may be no less grievously than truly said, to the sin and
shame of this Nation, yea and scandal both of profession and reformation, that
besides lascivious apparel (which shows a licentious life) there be many
such strange spectacles as this shameless act, now a days both in City and
Country, to be seen day and night, as (I suppose) the like was never since the
innocence of our first parents, neither in these Nations nor any others, in the
days of the Law nor Gospel, where there was no extremity of cold to be
endured, or either skins or figtree-leaves wherewith to be covered: and that
especially in such sad days of blood, terrors, tears, sighs, groans,
depopulations and desolations; yea and for any thing I could ever hear, (for I
was never to see) the like shameless spectacle has not been so publicly and
impudently showed nor acted in all the vile shows, and whorish masks, (where
many thousands of pounds have been spent in one night) even to provoke God to
wrath, and mankind to wickedness, amongst the grossest either heathenish or
Popish Tyrants of these Nations in former times, and not a little at Whitehall
Palace before these Wars, even where this vile act came to pass, which would
be a great shame to express. Only upon the 17th day of the 5th month called
July 1652. being the first day of the week, a bold woman of about 30 years old,
sober in her speech, came in a most Strumpet-like posture, mocking you, and
that your Sermon of the Resurrection, and all that honorable Congregation,
consisting of the chief States of this Land, who were conveened neither to hear
nor behold any sports, masks, plays, shows, yea nor to fulfill sinful lusts,
as multitudes both of inferior Soldiers and others do frequently in carnal
Whore-houses; yea, nor to hear the word of man, but as it is indeed, the
blessed and good word of the almighty, great, dreadful, and only wise God;
howsoever by the means of Satan, and his great Deputy, that man of sin, and
child of perdition, to the great offense of his divine Majesty, and all that
love the Lord Jesus in sincerity, it be for the most part delivered both in
unseasoned earthen vessels, like King Ieroboam's Priests, and high places also
like his, yea and most of all the ordinances administered as well to the
profane, as other both ignorant and unfit persons, who only make a mere show,
but quite deny the power of godliness.

It is yet more seriously to be considered by occasion of this lewd-like woman's
escape, through your not being so zealous even in word, as Phineas was in deed
for God and his people, in getting her punished (if you be not of her mind, and
that she came thither by consent, as I hope your answer will clear) the rest of
that diabolical sect, are not only since that time much more hardened,
strengthened and encouraged to proceed in their professed wickedness, both of
renting constituted Churches, and making Gods word of none effect by their
infernal inventions; but likewise their arrogancy and presumption do reach
now unto such a height, (and so much the higher by thus escaping and mocking
Gods Ordinances, his solemn day, and both man's authority and presence in
keeping thereof) in that they have begun to beat Ministers out of their pulpits
in London, even on that solemn day which he has sanctified and appointed for
his divine worship.

Thus by your negligence and deficiency in using the means to have had justice
done in due time, which I verily believe the State or Magistrates would not
have refused upon that Strumpet-like woman, who durst be so bold in out-facing
shame, even on the Lords day in the forenoon and midst of your Sermon, to come
in such a posture which is a shame to express, and publicly offer such a vile
disgrace, provocation, contempt, yea and (as it were) a defyance to God, his
ordinances and people, you (so far as I can learn, until I see your answer)
and which is also the opinion doubtless of multitudes who never heard of you
before, are by your silence and negligence the isntrumental cause that all of
her mind and faction are not only waxed both more audacious, outrageous and
numerous, but likewise do think themselves to be more confirmed and allowed,
thus by outfacing Authority to proceed in their wickedness, than ever since we
heard that there was any such miscreants in this valley of tears, according to
that worthy saying of Solomon, Eccles. 8. 11. Because sentence against an evil
work is not speedidily executed, therefore the heart of the sons of men is
fully set in them to do evil.

But in order to a redress, I am confident, that if those wanton people, who
almost like those of old that sat down to eat and drink and then rose up to
play, were as scarce both of food and raiment as many of Gods dear children are
in these long and toylsom days of affliction (to them, howsoever they be
prosperous to others) and not only they put to work and labor, with exact
overseers to take a strict account of them daily, and that in such sure places
as Bridewell in all the Counties of these united Nations; but likewise all
Thieves that cannot be proved murderers, who usually boast, (even which is too
evidently true,) that they care far less for a quarter of an hours hanging,
than to work and labor a months time, and so the putting of such to death is
so far from proving to be warrantable or good, that not only the practice
thereof offends the Majesty of God, in that it crosses his sacred word, but
it never comes to any successful period: for is there not constantly
(notwithstanding all such indirect means using) a number of both sexes executed
both every month at London, and at every Sessions and Assizes in the Countries
throughout all the three Nations? so that there is no amendment by using that
most unwarrantable and uncharitable means of man's devising: Therefore if the
remedy before mentioned of both these evils for recovering those parties in
their respective degrees and demerits were wisely and discreetly used in all
these united Nations, doubtless it might prove very effectual, both to abandon
the lasciviousness of the one sort, and besides the obedience in that respect
to Gods revealed will, it would save the precious lives of the other, which
though one Judge can take, who perchance is guilty himself of a thousand times
greater offenses, yet those lives cannot be restored by all the Judges of the
world, as the stolen goods may in some considerable time by work and labor, be
to the owner recovered, and so the party released.

And if this most charitable, easy, profitable, needful, virtuous and
commendable means were thus tried, there would not only much glory redound
thereby to God, by obeying his word, and great advantage by their industry to
the whole Commonwealth; but likewise there might be an Army of above an hundred
thousand men, always trained, prepared, and in readiness upon all occasions
for whatsomever either Sea or Land services, throughout all the three Nations,
either against foreign Invasions, or intestine Insurrections; and that by
choosing out all the best affected and trained from among them at all needful
times, who after they have been broken off from their wonted both associates,
idleness and practices, might in some considerable time, prove as good
soldiers under discreet and expert Commanders, as any who are at present in
those services of the three Nations: so that neither any more pressing of
householders, nor sound of drum for volunteers should be used, but those
prisoners happily reduced from being malefactors to be both manufactors and
soldiers, yea and many of them to be also well informed in the sincere ways
of God, from which like lost Sheep they have far strayed; thus should these
Nations be patterns of such godly and virtuous works to all other Nations, who
have not already the use and practice thereof, which yet we want.

Verily, all honest men (who are most subject to be deceived, they charitable
judging the best of others to be like them, as I have dearly bought some
experience both in that and other kinds) did expect, that when all the
Playhouses in London were quite discharged, and also that great Timber barn in
the Palace of Whitehall it self demolished, which was erected for the vile
exercises of masks and plays, and those to be always in the night season
(even crossing the Ordinance of God, which he has appointed for people to
rest, and in the day to travel) yea and the deluge of Gods temporal
judgments were so abundantly powered out in these bloody, cruel, durable and
destructive Wars throughout all the three Nations for the great abominations
and crying sins thereof, even when they were ripe for the sickle, and by which
the former State being quite overthrown, there remained no more excuses of any
intestine opposition, to hinder a thorough and full Reformation, both in
matters spiritual and temporal; so that long before any foreign troubles
began there might and should have been far better seed, proceeding from a godly
sorrow, not only sowed but sprung up, that there might have been a joyful
reaping before this time, than any more such of the Enemies tares (though of
other kinds, as he wants not a magazine of temptations as God has of
judgments) to have been either in our own days or the posterities, which now
do begin of fresh so to spring up and flourish, that if they and their blossoms
be permitted to bear seed and ripen until another harvest, then doubtless the
last error will be worse than the first, for that will highly provoke God in
his justice, to power out both more remarkable and inevitable judgments than
the former.

We have upon holy record for our learning, or at least for rendering us the
more inexcusable, abundance of examples, whereof for avoiding prolixity, I will
only mention two of the most pregnant and pertinent, as both times do change,
and we also change in them, some being advanced to the skies, and others
humbled to the ashes; the First is, That because the people of Sodom and
Gomorrah, who being overcom by four Kings, and through Gods providence in using
Abraham and his Family as his instruments both to destroy those Kings, and
bring back the prisoners and spoil of those Cities, did not walk answerable
unto such undeserved favors, but did wax much worse in all kind of
voluptuousness and wickedness afterward, than ever they themselves, or those
their friends and neighbors who were destroyed before their eyes; did not the
same righteous God then punish them to the full, even by an extraordinary
extirpation of them all, saving one Family, from off the face of the earth at
last, as both he did the whole world in the days of Noah, and the Amalekites
for their cruelty to his own own people, in their distress? which wonderful
visitatious are sufficient enough to terrify us and all posterities from
following those wicked people in their most heinous sins, if our hearts were
not hardened (I much fear) as both theirs and and King Pharao's were, unto the
day of destruction: So that the Sodomites slight punishment at first, by so
many thousands, who doubtless, were as guilty as the rest, being freed,
(according to the Lords usual remembering mercy in the midst of his judgments)
and yet that so great and undeserved mercy to those who so much enjoyed it, not
being in any the least measure regarded, but rather their hearts so much the
more hardened, presuming if such another visitation should come again, that
they should have the like escape; and upon that false ground they most
ungratefully and undutifully, (not at all considering the goodness of God
toward them,) both increased and multiplied all their former abominable
wickednesses: and therefore it may be justly said, that that gentle visitation
by so many thousands of as guilty people as the rest escaping which at first in
much mercy they had, was no preservation, and far less any allowance of them
either in their former or latter abominations, whereby in the least either so
suddenly or at all to have grown secure, and much less to have proceeded in
wickedness; neither was the victory which God gave them over their enemies,
any sure token of his favor to them above their brethren in evil whom he had
destroyed, but it was rather a reservation of them, unto a more general,
inevitable, complete, remarkable, and extraordinary judgment.

And the second Example is, that when certain men told our blessed Savior of
the Galileans, whose blood P^lat had mingled with their sacrifices, he answered
and said unto them, Suppose ye that those Galileans were greater sinners than
all other Galileans, I tell you, Nay, but except ye repent, ye shall all
likewise perish? Or think ye, that those 18. men upon whom the Tower in Shilo
fell and slew them, were sinners above all that were in Jerusalem, I tell you,
Nay, but except ye amend your lives, ye shall all likewise perish?

Sir, I could even in this most rare accident, as well as in other matters
which are frequent, much enlarge my self, both from the word of truth, and
occurrences in our own days, yea and besides the dear buying of some
experience in other kinds, I have not been at small both charges and travels,
besides other great losses and troubles of persecution, in being driven by
wicked men with my Family, oftentimes from our habitations and possessions,
even from one Nation to another, whereby to gain some experience also in this
kind; For I have not only been diverse times Excommunicated in National
Churches by the Priests of the high places, and their Lords, the late Bishops,
even for witnessing against their manifold evils, either by word, writing, not
countenancing their antichristian worship, or refusing to maintain them in such
indirect courses, by paying Tithes or other exactions, which they call duties,
they neither being Christ's servants, nor content with his wages, although I was
not a member of any National Church these 35 years, which is about the half of
my few and evil days; but likewise I was once Excommunicated in a Church in
London, where I was a Member indeed in obedience to Gods Word, which I esteemed
to be of total separation from all kind of such evils, and to walk in the
order and purity of the Gospel, even because I protested first against the
owners of a disorderly boy between 3. and 4. year old, whom both they and all
other their confederat members saving one, allowed (as it seemed) to trouble
the exercise, both on first days, fast days, and other days of weekly meetings,
for the space of diverse months, I being the oldest in years of any Member
saving one Woman, who had no liberty to speak, and for which as I heard by one
of themselves, that if I insisted to have such peace, silence and order
observed, that they had resolved I should be Excommunicated. Secondly, because
I witnessed against the evils of diverse false doctrines which were by Samuel
Chidley one of their Teachers delivered, and by the ignorant members received.
And Thirdly, because I both discovered, and after private dealing with him
brought famous Witnesses to prove many heinous sins against him, for which he
was cast out of Worcester house from the States service, which I both procured
for him, taught him, and kept him in it two years, after he was deposed, until
he got great riches, and notice of discoveries, to my own great prejudice,
through his deceitfulness, and the best recompense I received for all I was
Excommunicated, which as one of Gods chief Ordinances, he and his Confederates
most unjustly used, as a weapon of unrighteousness, whereby to execute their
malice against me, even to their own sin and shame, for as Solomon says, As
the Swallow and Sparrow by flying do escape, so the curse that is causlesse
shall not come.

And besides all these, whereof I have the particulars, and many other worthy
matters ready for the Press, I and my Family once, even upon an occasion also
of a Sermon, where there were about 2000 people gathered to a Fair near
Greenwich, where we had a house and dwelt in the Summer time, and we being a
long time warned according to the penalties then imposed, to come unto the
antichristian worship of that high-place, where there was a high Altar erected
for the late Queen, at last went thither on that day which is unjustly called
St. Lukes day, before the eyes of all those Kentish and other Malignants,
although to our great damage and danger of our lives, both in tearing the
Surplice to pieces, and witnessing to the full all their spiritual evils,
without either fear or favor, as that faithful Prophet whom God sent from
Judah to Bethel, did deliver his Message against King Ieroboam's practice, in
offeriug sacrifice there, contrary to the word of God, so that his salt did not
lose it is savor, but still contiuued good.

But in regard I affect brevity, howsoever I be oftentimes driven otherwise,
either for conveniencie or necessity, and that it would be needless to carry
water to a spring, as it must be sometimes carried to a Pump, (though I have
had for many years, diverse both higher and greater matters in debate with the
chiefest of your profession.) I therefore conclude with those precious words of
the Apostle Paul to the Philippians, 4. 8, 9. Whatsoever things are honest,
whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are
lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, or if
there be any praise, think on these things. Those things which ye have both
learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do, and the God of peace
shall be with you, in whom I desire to be

From my house this 19th of the 8th month called October, 1652. it being that
great Brick house with the Barn, at the North end of Soho in the fields,
straight up Hedge lane from Charing Cross: where I expect your answer in
writing, within a fortnight, that for general satisfaction it may be Printed
with this Letter, which after the time is expired, I intend to do howsoever*
Yours as you are his, and do clear your self in this, DAVID BROWN.
SIR, I would have written to you so soon as I heard of this business, were it
not, that I have been sick ever since, as I was a little before.

For Mr. Peter Sterry Minister, at his Lodging in Whitehall.



THE ANSWER TO THIS EPISTLE.
SIR,
YOu charge me in your Letter for being in the Pulpit, and being silent there
at the time, when a very great offense was committed in the Congregation. You
all along take that for granted, which is altogether a Mistake, namely, that I
understood the present Fact. Wherefore to remove this Mistake, and to inform
you rightly, will be at once your Satisfaction, and my Vindication. Upon this
account I shall give you a plain Narration of those passages, which relate to
my self.

I was in the midst of my Sermon, when I saw at one end of the Chapel a great
disturbance among the people, with a sudden fear. I cast my eye on the other
end, where I saw in the midst of the crowd a Woman as I guest b^ her head, bare
to the middle of her back, the rest of her being hid from my sight in the
throng: Hereupon I turned to the disturbed people to quiet them, by telling
them, that there was no danger, that it was a mad-woman only that occasioned
the Stir.

No other imagination upon that sudden glance entered into my Spirit. Before I
could again turn my eye toward that place, the Woman was suddenly carried out
by Soldiers, who always keep a court of Guard close by the door of the
Chapel; It was when I came down out of the Pulpit, that I first was acquainted
with the Truth of that Story, which for the monstrousness of it seemed
incredible to me, until it was confirmed by many hands.

Sir, I appeal to those who hear me in public, how far in a constant course
upon all occasions; how far after a more particular manner in the first Sermons
which I preached after that enormous Scandal, I have declared my self against
the heinous evil of such Practices, and those corrupt Principles which lead to
such Practices. I do not therefore think it needful for me to say more in a
private Letter, seeing I say so much, so frequently in Public.

I had much rather, that the good savor of my Name should arise freely from
the precious Ointment of Christ's Love in his Providence, of the Spirit of
Christ in my Life, in my Doctrine; than from my own Endeavors concerning it.
Only, as a Christian, I have thus far taken this care to give to you, who are a
professed Brother in Christ, that satisfaction which you have desired from me.

Having therefore kindly thanked you, for that zeal to the glory of our Lord
Jesus, for that respect and love to me, which you express in yours Letter;
Praising you for the heat of your affections, so far as you are careful to
join it with Light, I commend you to the grace of God, and rest

October 31. 1652. Your faithful Friend and Servant in Christ. Peter Sterry.
For Mr. David Brown at the New great Brick house, at the North end of Soho in
the Fields, straight up Hedge lane from Charing Cross.



The EPILOGUE, to Mr. Peter Sterry, Minister, being cleared of that negligence
wherewith he was charged.
SIR,
I Have received your Answer to my Epistle, whereby for mine own part, as one
honest man should trust another, I am sufficiently satisfied, even as I was
also of a discreet Military Officer, who at the same juncture of time commanded
the guard, when the impudent woman before that high Assembly appeared; and I
hope, that all the people of these united Nations, who have either so much
christianity as to trust a Christian, or wish in other matters to be trusted
themselves, or have heard, or may happen to hear or read of this business, as
it is in this small volume both questioned and answered, or have been otherwise
informed, yea, or have so much moderation and discretion as to submit unto such
circumstances as are grounded upon reason, cannot choose but rest likewise
satisfied, even with those probable causes or reasons of that silence,
wherewith in the Epistle you are so strictly charged, which are in your answer
so evidently expressed; yet, that no man mistake me, I do not profess to speak
or write infallibly, but trust every honest man, as I would be trusted by all
honest men: for revealed things belong to us, but secret things to God, and
therefore it is justly said, That man judges by outward appearance, but God
judges righteous judgment.

Howsoever as King Solomon says, He that rebukes a man shall find more favor
afterward, than he that flattereth with his lips, and that a reproof enters
more into a wise man, than a hundred stripes into a fool, Prove. 28. 23. and 17.
10. so the truth and validity of both which parables I have found, by that
discretion, moderation and affection, yea and both thankfulness and
commendation, which (out of your ingenuity) you are pleased in your modest
answer to use and express toward me, though a very weak instrument of God,
for the peoples satisfaction and your good, according to the first words of
that divine Author, Pro. 15. 1. howbeit I charged you as a most negligent
Christian, even to the very utmost of my evidence, which from diverse famous
people I heard, and so far as to them in such a tumult appeared.

And as concerning the difference of your judgment or practice from the
separated Churches, mentioned in the New Testament, whereof I gave you a hint
both in the beginning and midst of what I wrote, a few words being sufficient
to the wise; so still in brief, I wish from my heart, seeing the most sincere
Christians, do but know, practice, believe, and prophecy only in part, that
none of all our endeavors, who are but weak in respect of others, may tend in
the least to the quenching of the Spirit, or despising of prophecy, but to
prove all things, hold fast that which is good, and abstain from all appearance
of evil, chiefly by exact obedience to Gods heavenly call, even in coming
quite out of Babel, touching no unclean thing, and offering all our gifts and
sacrifices in Sion, which is the perfection of beauty, where God has promised
his own glorious presence in the sincere practice of all his holy Ordinances.

For (to speak impartially, which we are bound always to do) as those who
come short of the mark, have very great need to strive forwards, and forget
what is behind; so have they as great need who stand very near it, always to
take heed* lest they should fall backwards from it: so that I argue not for any
immunity, in regard of stability concerning total separats, though I conceive
that to be the very height of Religion; but that all who have the title of
Christians, may both attain thereunto, and persevere therein without apostasy
or decling* See Heb. 10. 26, etc. and 2 Pet. 21. 22. Which excellent duties if
we could but fervently desire to perform, and earnestly beseech God for the
gracious assistance always of his blessed Spirit, to strengthen and lead us
into all truth; then doubtless, as Paul prays for the Church of the
Thessalonians, The very God of peace would sanctify us wholly, and preserve
our whole Spirit, soul and body blameless until the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ, in whom I rest,

Your faithful friend to serve you in all duties of love, David Brown.

FINIS.
