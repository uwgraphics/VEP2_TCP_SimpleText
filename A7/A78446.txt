THE CENSURE OF THE EARL OF BERKSHIRE, By the LORDS IN PARLIAMENT.
Also the great Oneals landing in Ireland, with a Commission to kill and slay
the English and Scots there, and after to come into England against the
Protestants here.

Likewise a true Relation of the Earl of Essex his advancing forward with his
Forces against the Cavaliers: With the manner of Baron Walters being taken and
rescued again by the Cavaliers etc. five of them being slain.

THe honorable House of Parliament taking into consideration the great number
of Delinquents that are now in this Kingdom, many of them sheltering
themselves under his Majesty's protection, and diverse others that have been
lately taken and brought up to London, and imprisoned, resolved with all
convenient speed they could to proceed legally against them, provided that
their proceedings against them should not interrupt the great and weighty
affairs of this Kingdom; and thereupon on Wednesday last, being the
foureteenth day of this instant month of September, according to an Order of
the House of Peers, the Earl of Berkshire, being prisoner in the Tower, was
brought to the Bar, and examined concerning his coming into the County of
Oxford to a place called Watlington, with some other persons of quality, with
an intent to put in Execution the Commission of Array, and to seize upon the
Magazine that lay in that town. Whereupon the said Earl pleading that
although he thorough the want of a right information concerning the state and
condition of things as they now stand in difference between the King and
Parliament, had most unfortunately been drawn away from the service of the
House for a time, yet he made many protestations and declarations of his most
sincere and hearty desire and endeavor to serve the Kings Majesty and
Parliament in any thing that might be thought acceptable; and humbly submitted
himself to their Lordships. After which (he being commanded to withdraw) their
Lordships had some private debate of the matter, and considering that it was
the first action that was undertaken by his Lordship of that nature, and that
he had raised no forces, he was called again into the House, and upon his
humble submission, as aforesaid, he was enlarged out of prison, but confined to
his own house, and is to appear again (at the pleasure of the Lords) upon
six hours summons.

Upon the fifteenth day of this month at a Conference of both Houses, were
read the examinations of four men upon oath taken at Plymmouth, signifying
that the great Oneale that has been beyond sea many years, is now landed in
Ireland, and has brought over with him diverse ships laden with men and
ammunition, to aid and assist the Rebels in Ireland, and that they said they
had received a Commission from his Majesty under the broad Scale of England, to
kill and slay all the English and Scots in that Kingdom, that should resist
them: and that when they have done there, they have the like commission for
England, but the Parliament have another opinion of his Majesty, and hope that
if any such Commissions are, they have been obtained by some sinister means
without the knowledge or privity of his Majesty, Sir Endimion Porter (not being
a sworn Officer, and one that is disaffected to the King and Kingdom) having
for diverse months together had the custody and possession of the great seal
of England.

Great cause therefore had the L. Keeper to make some excuse for himself, by
signifying unto the Parliament, that those illegal Commissions and
Proclamations lately sent forth under the great Seal, were not passed by him,
and although in that respect he hopes for favor, yet it is probable that now
he repents he had not followed the example of the Bishop of Chichester, Lord
Keeper of the Great Seal in the time of Henry the third, who when the King
sent to him for the Seal, he refused to deliver it to his Majesty, but
resigned it up into the hands of the Parliament, thinking it most proper, that
those which had power over all causes, should likewise have the disposing of
the Great Seal of England. But I shall not further insist upon this point,
therefore I will return to the next particular of my discourse, because in
these times men rather delight in novelties, then in antiquity, and these times
require that men should rather study how to save their heads, then to turn
over books.

The Cavaliers persisting in committing many great outrages in Leicestershire,
Nottinghamshire, and other parts of this Kingdom, the Parliament have sent
Letters and Instructions to the Earl of Essex, Lord General of the Army, to
advance his Forces from Northhampton, to march into Leicestershire, and from
thence into Nottinghamshire, for the settling of the peace of the Kingdom,
carrying a petition with him from both Houses of Parliament in behalf of
themselves and the whole Kingdom, declaring that they have no intent to levy
war against his Majesty, but desire the peace of the Kingdom, the
preservation of the true Protestant Religion, the Laws of the Land, the
Privileges of Parliament, and the liberty and Propriety of the Subject,
against those evil Counselors and Actors that go about to violate and
overthrow the same.

On Saturday last, being the tenth of this instant month, Baron Walter, being
a great Delinquent, was taken at Broadway in the County of Worcester, by the
means of one M. Stevens, a very religious man, being chief, Constable, and in
regard the Sabbath was then approaching, he was kept all that night and all day
on sunday at the said Stevens his house: but (notice thereof being presently
given to the Cavaliers which came that night out of Oxford, they came on sunday
night to the said town of Broadway, and beset the said Stevens his house, and
demanded that the said Baron should be delivered unto them: which being denied,
they set upon the house, threatening to beat it down: but the said Stevens
having some muskets in his house which had been taken from the lord Lovelace,
began to charge upon them out of the windows, and killed four or five of
them, and perceiving that they could not enter the house without the hazard of
many of their lives, they presently set fire on his barnes, stables and
outhouses, and burnt them down to the ground, which put the country into such
terror and amazement (not knowing the number of the Cavaliers, nor what
strength they had, fearing lest the whole town should have been fired by them)
that many of them began to intercede that the Baron should be delivered unto
them: whereupon, with condition of their departure without further injury to
the town, he was delivered unto them: after which they went toward Worcester,
and have plundered many honest men's houses in the country, and seized on their
arms: and it is credibly reported, that they have entered into Sergeant Wilds
house at Droit (a worthy Member of the House of Commons) and have plundered the
same.

FINIS.
