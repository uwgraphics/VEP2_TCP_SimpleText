To the Reader.
GOd the auctour of all goodness (gentle Reader) has diversely bestowed his
manifold gifts on sondrie men: whearby, as in ending any great or effectual
enterprise many are called, some for learning sake, some for knowledge, son
for experience, and some for strength to supporte ye brunt of the chardge:
which all tend to none other end, but to conclude the matter determined with
good effect. Even so our savior Christ to save man, (which is diversely bent
to go astraye) has sent fourth his several instruments sundry wies to call
him. Principally by that inestimable Iuell his infallible word, and the
wourthye learned preachers of the same, now flourishing? (God be praised
therefore.) Otherwies by men of knowledge, seen in the liberal Sciences, and so
covertly correcting vice by moralized sentences very expedient. Otherwies by
some that has through folly fallen into dangers, and by his infinite mercy
(their madness perceived) returned* which do from their own experience tell to
frail youth such dangerous success in their fond atte^ptes: as some
thearby: are persuaded, and leave their precogitate purpozes. And otherwies by
those that will boldly begin, foolishlie follow, and unadvisedly accomplish
their intended enterprise: And thearby make them selves, through vntymelye
Death or other myschiefe: terrible examples to the rest. And all alludeth none
other thing, but by persuasion, terror or example, to knit ye body of ye
Church of god to ye worthy bed thereof, our savior Christ. I am no divine: I
would to God I were. To take upon me the name of learned: I dare not. Of
experience: age will not let me speak. But the tragical history following, may
wourke a terror to all youth: rashly and of themselfes tatte^pt any thing.
Note (loving friend) the matter succeding is of two English lovers, both young,
of lynage like substau^ciall enough, married by ye parents consent of equal
troth in keeping the honorable bed of matrimony undefiled, what should I say?
both virtuous and loving: and yet their doings not prospering. I must think
good Reader, but I leave ye judgment to God, yt he was offended, because they
both at first sight, rashly, unadvisedly, unknown, and without friends
consent, durst thrall themselves in the desire of unclean lust (but I must
term it cleanelie, Cupides flama) and did not call upon God, for ye metenes of
the match, nor saught parents consent, till (had the same been never so
unmeet) they must have granted. Or else ye love grown from folly, and thought
from love, would have wrought the lovers ends. If thou be a parent, that reads
this same, look vigelantlie to thie frail child, least thearby thou wourke
thine own sorrow as in the end of this history. If thou be a child, of
what age soever thou be, thie Parents or Guerdians living, read over the
same, and think thine intent can be none bonester, then theirs that minded
chaste wedlock, thine entrance no better, then by friends consent, thie
succession no better the^ to win honor in the defense of thie prince and
contrie: but thy end may be better, then accused for treason, faltes, to
receive thie mortal wound, or die, as he or she did. well, think that the
falt was comytted at first because without the fear of god and friends
corsentes craved in the beginning, they durst love, and in themselfes contract
marriage. And so consequently, as the falt at first was don: the punishment at
last was wrought by him that leaves nothing unpunished which is not repented.
Beware the like. I have promised to set at large, a thing of more effect, and
greater moment: which shall not long be behind. But this have I begoon with,
as with an instrument to whet my knyfe, to cut my pen clean to cause it to
wright the more pleasau^tlie, playnelie, and profitablie to the. Accept my good
will, and stay thie judgment til thou know mine intent, and deem the best
till then.

Farewell. (?) Ber. Gar.

TO THE READER.
Within the raged rock, the vapors cold,
to small effect, collects a waters course:
so weak at first: as scarce it dare be bold,
to spread abroad, the new obtained fource.
Ere long grown to some strength: abroad does goo,
and shows it self to those that have delight:
to see the same although it cannot so,
keep on the course: for some that have dispight.
At last fed by the hedde, from whence at furst,
it (weakelie) came, finds fourth a channel deep:
and then though rancour swell, or Envy burst,
the puysaunt fource, the channel still does keep.
And good for most, does work his own defense
not harming any, of purpose or pretense.
Even so my Muse
FRom right dull head, and vnapproued brain,
with heart amasde, and color pale of hew:
has hear set out, the doleful end of twain,
that loved long, whose fates are yet to rewe.
If this attempt may escape the gnawing field,
of hateful spite, (not able to resist)
no doubt at all, thear is: that she shall yield:
when wourthie wourkes, her weakness shall assist.
whearin she means, ere long to walk at large,
and then within that comely channel deep:
(This ended ones,) to take a greater charge,
and thearin still soch decent order keep:
As then a whit, she will not doubt nor fear,
the cruel wight, may let the passage hear
Of this my Muse.
The tragical history of two English lovers.
WHen that the boustrous Borias,
and Hiemps horie frost:
By just return of Lady Ver,
their pinching power had lost:
That lady staide the fine of March,
in comely course and hew:
And left her seat to Estas then,
and bad the Pryme adewe.
Then Aprell entered in by kind,
with sweet and sugared streams:
And daily dect the earth again,
through aid of Phoebus beams.
Then Tellus seemed to tryme her tire,
to welcome Estas gaye,
Each fragrant flower freshlie smelles:
and in leapes lusty May.
Whearin each thing does joy by right,
that kind has wrought by berth,
And also those that cressiue are:
as Trees and roots in earth.
What then has power or strength at all?
what is it that has might?
But Ioyouslie, will show it self:
as Nature geues delight.
In this sweet month a virgin fair,
by birth of gentle blood:
Her feauter fourmed passing well,
her stature tall and good:
In whom no shape at all did want,
that heart or Iee might seek:
Ne cold Appelles for his life,
depaynt or draw the like.
Whose youth sent fourth her lyuelye heart,
with such a pryncely pace:
As none that saw her, but must judge:
she came of wourthie race,
Her tire was tryme, yet sobre to,
not common in these days:
Of all the rest who saw her then,
did judge her wourthie praise.
Ths piece, before Pigmalion
her like cold grave or carue:
Though he wear living now again,
Ten thowsande times would starve.
Aboutes the fields with equal Feeres,
in decent order set:
As if Diana had been theare:
a comely course did fet.
Whearin (by chance) a wourthie wight,
did salve her in that place:
Their joy and iesture both wear such:
non had the better grace.
A man he was, in age but young,
of state both big and tall:
A face he had effemynate,
scant any bearde at all.
In whom thear wanted not the thing,
that kind cold shape or give:
Fair Absolon cold never die,
so long as he did live.
And Nature gave to him a grace,
so sobre and so trymme:
As who so did delight a man,
must needs delight in him.
A world it is to see how far,
some other some excel:
Scant Tullyes style not my rude pen:
the dyfference can tell.
But groase shall be my Simile,
since eloquence I lack:
He passed more the common sort,
Then white excels black.
Yet as they met, they parted tho,
their gestures said fare well:
Their faces showed their fancyes pleased
no wourde between them fell.
The maid kept on her stealing steps,
so did her mates each one
The young man fet a soking sigh,
his heart was almost gone.
Alas what hap have I (said he)?
what means this suddeyn stroke?
Oh Cupide now, thie dreadful Darte:
my craised corpse has broke.
His ruddie chekes were changed pale,
he plucte his bonnet low:
He mused much, that he should love,
the wight he did not know.
Nor whear she dwelt, nor whence she came
nor any of her kind:
Nor yet what way her course she bent,
nor whear her home to find.
Oh cruel boy that thus sholdst strike,
and bring him into thrall:
That was not yet an hour ago,
the freest man of all.
He seemed now, to wring his hands,
that carst did feel no grief:
And homewarde gat with quaking steps
deuoyded of relief.
Then Phoebus began shut up his beams
then darkness made it night:
Then pleasures none at all were seen,
but by the candell light.
And then this fair and famous dame,
thought time to go to bed:
Wheare flowing fancyes followed her,
renewing in her hedde.
What wight he was that should salute
her in this comely wise:
She beat her brain, and of that man,
she lay and did devise.
And viewing in her waking head
his gesture and his face:
His comely shape did brewse her breast
and fancy found him grace.
What wantes in him (quod she) that I
this present day have seen:
Are not his virtues wondrous
his years fresh and grene.
Right happy wear the dame in dead
that might obtain the grace:
In wedded bed and folded arms,
thie body to embrace.
With that she sought to set a side,
soch phansies and to sleep,
But Venus sparks, which grow full great
began toward her heart to crepe:
And Cupide caught his Bow in hand,
and drew the string so far:
As losed ones, the shafte and hedde
against her heart did Jar.
Then loking up, she saw that none,
was in her chamber bye:
She felt what stroke she had received,
no sleep cold toche her Eye.
Then came she unto Venus thrall,
and thus began to pray:
Most mighty gods of them all,
give ear what I shall say.
I am become thie servant that,
before did never love:
Soch fervent force, thie son has used
on me his power to prove.
What conquest shall he get by this,
though I through sorrow die?
No praise at al: thus on a wretch,
his force and power to try.
But if thou will cause this thie son,
again his bow to bend
And from the same with equal force,
an other arrowe send,
Into his heart, within whose breast
my heart does rest and shall
Then will I say thou art a Judge,
and iustest Judge of all.
So, living shall I him attain:
Or else we both shall dye:
Or at the least he shall not laugh,
when care both cause me cry.
Thus lay she waking all the night.
He spendes his time in tears.
They both are stricken with one Darte.
the one, the other fears.
He doubts of her, She fears him,
See here of love the fource:
Yet want of knowledge sunders them
they can have no recourse.
The weary night wears thus away
Aurora shows her light
He leaves his bed, he walks abroad
of her to have a sight.
No gate he sees, but he lokes in
no window wantes his Eye
No Lane, no Streat, no Place at all
whearin he does not pry.
And walking thus from morn to night.
and foodeles coming so:
Retournes into his restles bed,
repleate with care and woo:
The lady as her love does mourn,
so likewies mourns she:
Her stomach fades, her flesh does fall,
she is as sick as he.
The mother marks the daughters plight
with sorrow of her mind:
And of the sickness of the child,
she seeks the cause to find.
But secreat covert love (alas)
So perceth flesh and fell:
As death might break her heart, but she,
those secreates, would not tell.
Her mother who had ones been young
and felt of Cupides sting:
Did feed her child, wih tender wourdes,
and poysing every thing:
Mine own (quod she) discloase thine heart,
and root of this thie grief,
To hidden sores, the sikmans talk
must bring the first relief.
To wourke on the by medecins Art,
before thie case be known:
Thie death: my bayne, thie fathers fall:
to gether should be sown.
Thou art my child, and from my life,
Thie life did first proceade:
Oh seek not then, by silence thus,
To shred my fatal threade.
Fair child, (and then she kissed her mouth,
Her tears did moist the ground
Disclose thie grief, least lack of talk,
Thie mothers Joys confound.
Why wepest thou? oh why do thou weep?
redobling thus my woo:
The maid looked up, but could not speak,
a trance did take her so.
The dolfull dame calls fourth the Nurse,
who first did weane the child.
And stryuing both, the loathsome life,
the sense again does yield.
And then with heavy heart and tears,
she leaves her daughter so:
And with right woeful waylyng sobbes
unto her spouse does go.
Oh Sir (quod she) so long as we.
have lyud together hear:
So just a cause did not compel,
my grief and griping cheer.
Our daughter man, our only joy,
and Iuell of our age.
With sickness is full sore oppressed,
each part of her does rage.
And mortally I fear and doubt,
she stricken is with death.
So pale, so wanne her visage is,
so short she draws her breath.
The Father who did tender her,
a man both sage and wise,
said to his wief, then for her health,
some mean we must devise.
And not this rage as you begin,
it tokeneth little wit:
And to our state and horye hears,
a thing right far unfit.
Go to her yet with good advice,
and give her time to pawse.
Mark when her pain, does grieve her least,
then learn thereof the cause.
The Mother who already had
endeavored with her might,
As you have heard, of this her grief
to know the cause aright:
To god again was half dismaide
it grieved much her mind:
But yet to pleas her husband with
an errande she did find.
And coming to the chamber wheare
her daughter sick did lie
A thousand covert means she saught
The root thereof to spy.
Her skillful tongue with smiling talk
said to her daughter than:
See here thie mother, how she cares
To help the what she can.
That thou art sick, to true it is
the cause thereof discloase:
Tell me thie grefe my darling dear,
some trust in me repose.
Or if the root of this thie care
from the does hidden lie
The manners of thy painful pangues
to me with speed discrie
The daughter viewde the mothers face
which cloase by her did stand:
She threw her arm out of the bed
and took her by the hand.
Oh you, from whence this corpse of mine
(said she) did take relief:
No lengre will I hide from you
the manner of my grief.
Soch ardent heat does bourne my heart,
as it is parching dry.
And floodes of fylthie frosen Ice
enrowndes it by and bye.
Thus hot, thus cold, thus dry, thus drowned
I lie hear in mye bed:
Loo hear you know my grief, and yet:
I nere the better spedde.
But how I came by this disease
the lord (not I) does know
Content you then, your daughters mouth
no more to you can show.
With that the virgin tournd her self
she sighed very sore:
Her wourdes did falter in her mouth
her tongue cold talk no more.
What heaps of grief the mother felt
in hearing this discourse
Deame you that Parents are by kind
with pytte and remourse.
And if that she poor heart (alas)
was drownde in sorrow than
Note that it was a mothers part:
who thearfore blame her can?
But she full warelie did witholde
her secret hidden grief
Her inward care she covered still
she saught her childs relief:
And spoke thus to the aged Nursh
my true approved friend
In whom I have affied most,
and will until mine end
My daughter and your darling dear
of trust to you I leave:
Of trust again with all my heart
good nursh do her receive.
Nursh thou art old, and I am not young,
what think thou her^ disease?
What best is for her appitite?
what will her fancy please?
Madame (quod she) if age and wit,
wear equal in my brain.
This your demand could I disclose,
and ease your daughters pain.
But age to much, to little wit,
in women old we find.
But since it pleases you to ask,
I will disclose my mind.
I fear least that the sparks of love,
are kindled in her breast:
And then (sweet heart) the lord does know,
how sore she is oppressed.
Then must be learnd somewaies with whom
she so bewrapped is,
And warely must you grant or not,
Take good advice in this.
For if she be in Cupids thrall,
as you and I wot near,
(Then is she in her golden pryme,
Of age full sixtene year)
And having choase her self, a mate,
and doubting your good will.
The doleful doubt within her breast.
may sone your daughter spill.
Therefore a mean there must be found,
by some that she loves well:
That may provoke by circumstaunce
her, all her mind to tell.
Which thing by her once uttered,
and to your wisdom known.
Then of the herbs to ever her,
the seeds are surely sown.
Good Lady blame not mine advise,
love causes me to speak,
and only love and your request,
makes me my mind to break.
And one precept (if I may term
my folish sentence so,
Take from my mouth, and mark it well,
before you from me go.
If you do like the choice that she
unto her self has made:
To grant it then you need the less
to doubt or be a fraide.
But if the match be so unmeet,
as she may chance repent.
Yet may you not in rigrous sort.
deny her your consent.
For as the falling drops of rain,
which from the gutters gone:
In length of time, and falling often,
does pearse the marble stone,
That else by sodeine seas or floods,
ne mighty streams at furst:
By rigor nor by force at all,
would yield it self to burst:
So wise men have long time of love.
the like oppinion held:
That love in time may be represt,
but will not be expelde.
Lo here, you hear my fond advice,
my small approved skill:
Accept it as a woman's tale,
proceading of good will.
And as you leave with me your child,
so I the same receive:
And that nothing shall want in me,
I trust you shall perceive.
I give the thanks good gentle Nursh,
for this thy sound advise:
Thereby I trust my daughters health,
my joy and all shall rise.
And unto your discrecion,
to know my daughters mind:
I leave the order and the ways
some parfect means to find.
Hear with the mother goes away
the nursh sites by the child,
The nursh is grown an oratrice.
her tongue is smothelie field
The maid lokes up, the nursh it spies
Oh swetehart says she than:
That God ones send you quiet health
that helps every man.
Comaund even what you may devise
Your head or heart to please:
What nursh (quod she) do hold your tongue
your talk does me disease.
Less wourdes to her that is so sike
and much more quiet, rest
(Me thinks your age should teach you wit)
that, for my state were best.
The nursh thus nypped to the brain
she had no wourde to say:
A sobving sigh the maiden fette,
and tournde her head away.
Now all the while the maiden thus
with pangues lase sore distressed
Her love (that second Troylus)
was near the less oppressed.
But all effebled was his strength
his mirth was grown to move
His flesh was fallen, his iointes wear weak,
he could scant rise alone.
Yet every day in order dew
by starry light he roase:
And ceased not to seake his chance
till night the day did cloase.
Who first had seen so fair a face
and now seen him again
Had been his heart more hard then flynt
must yet bewail his pain.
For they that love do know, (else none)
the heat of Cupids fire:
And love can see, and none but love
this dolfull man's desire.
Who, for to ease his heavy heart
his lewte would often assaye
Yet, ere his fyngers, spast the freates
the knew not what to play.
Then would he prove, by wonted voice
some sollemne song to sing:
The notes whearin he wont rejoice
does now but sorrow bring.
Then from his quyuer would he take
and say to bend his Bow
Whearof the string he cold not stire
his strength was brought so low.
Then of each thing he had delight
he called to his mind:
But all his joys did turn to grief
no comfort, cold he find
For that which erst in other cares
did move him some delight
In this his greatest grief of all
did wourke him most dispight.
Thus when he saw that every hap,
whearin he wont to joy:
Was now converted to mishap
and Fortune looked acoye:
And that his life was nigh fordoon
and had no health at all:
He thought to prove by medesins art
what might to him befall.
And to his friend a man expert
a Doctor in that art:
He gat him then in secret wies,
and thus discloasde his heart.
A man I was of late (quod he)
and past my time in sport:
as fits my youthful years yet
though cares do cut me short.
A blisfull life I led a while,
I had that did me please:
So have I now, but what alas?
That may me most disease,
In covert words thus could I couche
my grife, and so to prove
your skill: but what avails that,
my sickness came through love.
But whom I love, or what she is,
the gods not I can show:
A heavenly thing, unmeet for me,
I think she be to know.
And where I saw her once in deed,
(my wits do serve so well)
Or dreamde of her, I stand in doubt,
of truth I cannot tell.
But this I know, alas and shall
by dream or else by deed:
I that of late was like a man,
am now become a weade:
In sleep, nay: slomber as I lie,
I see her face to face:
I go to her with loving chere,
To me she comes a pace:
I crave her love: she graunts it me,
her heart I do desire,
I give to her my heart and that
is all she does require.
The match is made, we clap our hands
she is my wedded wife:
I wake with joy and find her not,
I then repent my life.
The seeming joys within my sleep,
does grow to perfect care,
My brackish tears do weat my cheeks,
and sorrow is my fare.
Like joys as I within my sleep,
could never lover tell:
Like pains to mine, when I do wake,
were never felt in hell.
This is my grief, and I of it
do feel the passing smarte:
Do help me now, and if thou can,
I have disclosde my heart.
Or if without recovery,
thou iudgest this my woe:
To rid my life prepare some thing,
and give me ere I go.
And all the substance that I have.
I give the for thine hire:
Save unto her my heart I yield.
whose heart I do desire.
And when that I am dead and gone,
this only do I crave:
This Epitaph that thou would wright
in steel upon my grave.
Not Troylus lies here (god knows)
that Crossed looud so well:
But here lies one, that in true love,
did Trollus far excel.
My Testament thus have I made
my friend, thy cunning try:
and else do help my heavy hap,
or grant that I may dye.
Whiles in this rage, this worthy wight
stood wringing of his fist:
One knocked at the Doctors door,
and every thing was whist.
The latche was loose, a shade was seen,
the door began to unfold,
A woman entered in thereat,
the Doctor thought her bold.
she brought an vryn in her hand,
wherein she praide to know
The Doctors skill and eke that he
some way to health would show.
Fair wife (quod he) stay here a while,
while I do with my friend,
conclude our matter now begone,
which almost is at end.
And then wherein mine art and I,
may satisfy your mind,
That in me is to do you good,
right reddy shall you find.
And then he said unto the man,
full strange is your request,
content you with your pain a while,
and I will do my best.
To morrow come to me again,
Do follow mine advise,
Thereby I trust your sore shall swage,
your health again shall rise.
Till then set fancies clean a side,
let trouble not your hedde,
Endeavor to the most you may,
to rest in quiet bed.
The lover thus left of his talk,
he gate him thence alone,
His weary legs did bow for fainte.
his heavy heart did groan.
What heaps of grief, he felt this night,
no lover but may guess:
But I because they move my tears,
the same do here repress.
Then to the Doctor does the Nursh
present the vryn thoe,
and to his closet, from the hall,
the Nurshe and he does go.
And after certain words, he takes
the vrynall in hand,
She prays by his learning that
the vryn might be scande.
With persing eye and skillfull brain,
he does the state pervse:
He warmes it by the fire again,
no pains he does refuse:
And viewing every circle there,
did note the substance to,
and could not find that neded ought
for Phisikes art to do.
But skillful learned men can often
by circumstance prevail:
And cause the rude Propositor
to ask, and tell the tale.
Dame quod the Doctor to the Nursh.
I think it be your will:
And eke the cause why you did come,
to know herein my skill.
Note, of the corpse of every wight,
both feminyne and male:
A thousand secret maladyes,
the inward part assail.
Which at the first this famous art,
that I do here profess,
By certain rules infallibly,
does give a certain guess.
As when the lyghtes, the longes, or spleen,
or else the noble heart:
The kidneys, reigns, or to be short,
what other inward part,
For lack of moisture sicate wax,
through moisture else do rot.
(For raging grief in man is not
but either cold or hot)
Then by the sickmans vryne straight
expert men have a rule:
(As I) I speak not bostingly,
by practice and by scoole,
Whereby we know what inwardly
within the corpse does rain,
Whereof procedes the maladye,
what eke will ease the pain.
The Ellymentes are four, whereof
we mortal men are made,
And contraries they be each one
as justly may be said,
As fire, water, earth, and air,
whereof, if one abound,
Above the rest: then in the corpse
no perfect health is found.
Thus twice two are the Ellymentes
three principalles again,
There is in man: to wit, his heart,
his liuour, and his brain.
Now every chief and princely part
which principalles we call:
To pourging places have of right,
to pourge themselves withal.
The brain behind the sickmans ear,
does pourge his secret grief,
The heart does through the Armeholes send,
gross humors for relife.
The lyuour somewhat lower stoopes,
and sends to the grindes,
That noisome to the blood, or else,
unto it self it finds.
And hereuppon is found the rule.
that we Physicians use,
The circumstaunce within this state,
I perfectly peruse.
But often when naught but parfect health,
is seen within the state,
Death is become unto the sick.
a fellow walking mate.
And therefore we that learned be
professing Phisickes art,
Do judge when least is seen in state,
that most does gripe the heart.
Of trothe then said the Nursh to him,
of all that ere I herd,
Your knowledge does surmount the rest,
your connyng is preferde.
For as you sayethe silly wenche,
that did this water make,
Would seem as she no sickness had
and yet does never slack
Her panges, her pains, her freting fits,
her deep and deadly smart,
Which will ere long, in sonder shred
her young and tender heart.
And if it be not sparks of love,
that does the same possess,
What it should be I promise you,
I have no wit to guess.
Nursh quod the doctor you have told
that I did mean to tell.
You show a skillful aged head,
I like your words full well.
Her vryn shewth she is but young,
and youth does work by kind,
That youth from youth unto it self,
a youthly mate should find.
Then mean you not quod aged Nursh,
to give her some receate,
Of these her pangues, and burning plague
to cole the freting heat.
No Nursh, love never yet did burn
with heat of such effect:
But cold fourth with the Patients heart
as straungely did infect.
Then, if to quench her burning heat,
cold surops I should give,
When course does come by cold ye know,
how should she longer live?
What then is your advice? (quod she)
a remedy to find,
Naught else but that you suffer her,
in rage to have her mind:
Nor do you alter what she says,
where it be wrong or right,
But feade her fansy still that way,
wherein she does delight.
Whereby I trust in time her health
to her again shall grow:
If not (good Nursh) this is my house,
let me the danger know.
And I besides these fixed rules,
perchance, some way can find:
But Nursh you know not all at first,
some shall remain behind.
Nursh boweth now the crooked knee,
Nursh geues the Doctor thanks:
Nursh homewardes packes with better chere
and to her Lady prankes.
And I dare say that in seven year,
which passed last before:
The silly Nursh applied her not
to study any more:
Then now she ginnes to do (poor soul)
in these her latter days:
To set the Doctors conning out,
and give him worthy praise.
The gentlewoman old (god wot)
that staide her coming home,
Took grief because the Nursh did leave
her child so long alone.
And looking out did spy from far
the fast unwonted pace,
Of aged Nursh she could not choose,
but muse at it a space.
Which when she saw she did reject
her first conceived color:
And gave good ear to Beldame Nursh
now sworn the Doctors scollour.
Nursh gladly would have told the tale,
which erst she did pretend,
But that with haste, her breath made short
her sentence would not end:
Which often begone not ended tale,
did much the Lady flight:
Who said, good Nursh take time enough,
begin thy tale aright.
These passhons which I see in thee,
that trip thy tongue so sore,
To double still my sorrow, and
do make my grief the more.
Good Lady (yet with shaking voice)
the Nursh began to say:
Mourn not at all, all shall be well,
this is a happy day.
I have been with the skilfulst man,
that ever learning taught:
Who at the first (the water seen)
your daughters grief has saught,
And says that other malady
is in her body none,
But Cupids darte (I wene he said)
It was that made her moan.
I craude of him some remedy,
of it to kill the ire,
He said that quiet government,
would soonest quench that fire.
If not, he chargde in any wise,
I should return again,
And he by Phisike, or some art,
would quench her raging pain.
This is the some, let me alone,
your daughter yet to rule,
For I am grown the conninger,
by seeing Phisiks scoole.
The mother which to hear these news,
with joy was fully freight,
(Her craysed child left with the Nursh)
went to her husband straight.
To whom she wisely opened
the dolor of the maid,
In all that ever she could see,
or was by Phisike said.
To whom also the vryn was
by Nursh committed to,
What diet was prescribed, and
what else he meant to do.
Then to the doctor in the morn,
to send was his request.
This was the fathers own device,
This pleased the mother best,
Thus now the day is spent and gone,
The doctor goth to bed.
Wheare like a friend the sicmans sore
he calls to his hedde.
And altogether he does not
forget, the maidens state
Because his friends, and her disease
wear both of equal rate.
And calling to his memory
the yongemans woeful race:
Whearin he had most ruefully
abode nighten wekes space.
What torments, and what tossing fites
his friend lay tombling in
His brackish floodes fell from his eyes
and so embrewd his chyn.
Whereby he showed his nature good,
and how he would have borne
His neighbors cross, for care whereof
his beard he would have torn.
But reason stepped before his will
aduising him to take:
That way that best might help his friend
and so his sorrow slake.
And not to cast away the man
that else could not recure:
In doing to himself this wrong
which he would now procure.
To reason wislie he did yield
and vowed he would not shrink
But that he would to aid his friend
do all that he might think.
Then calde he to his mind the tale
that Reason did him tell:
And eke the dolor of the maid
he marked very well.
Perchance it is the will of god
(quod he) that I should do:
That which he charge no man else
in copling of these two
He loves more then fervently
but whom he does not know:
She takes of love as bytterly,
toward whom she cannot show.
A lykelyhoode by this appears
I can none other deem
But that the one to others use
is kept I must exteme.
Thus tossing still his trobled brain
to wourke his neighbors health
Dame Nature sent out subtell sleep,
which caught his heart by stelth.
And then within two hours space
fair Lucifer the star
Which plainly telth to every thing
Aurora is not far:
Began gloriouslye to deck and show
her self within the skies:
Which he that long had watched for it,
(the ardent lover) spies.
And therwithall he starteth up.
and clothd himself so fast:
As to the Doctors house he ronnes
his points untrust for have.
He gaspeth then, his breath was short
he would have knocked at door
But have had made his members faynct
he had thearto no power.
But when his strength and memory
returned back again
He wayeth not the Doctors rest
no yet regardes his pain:
But through a broken querell that
He, in the window spide:
Awake (alas) your friend is hear
he to the Doctor cried.
Who fourthwith roase, and let him in
and showed a friendly face:
As frendely is to comfort friends
in soch distrestfull case.
Oh loving friend the sickman said
each thing does wourke me spite
How much above all Natures course
has been this yerksome night?
I think the signs, and planetes to
and all and every star
Which in the air, are fixed or moeue
against my life do war.
And yet unhappy hated life
that from me will not fly,
And cursed art thou cruel Death
that wilt not let me dye.
And cursed to I claim the time
whearin beginning was:
Of spousall twixt my parents, and
did after come to pas.
But be you cursed evermore
and hateful to the earth
The day of my nativity
the hour of my bearth.
In which if that the living lord
should justice do aright
No Son, nor Moan, should show it self,
no Star nor other light.
How good had nature been to me
If borne I had been dead?
Or stopped had my wesen been
when first I tasted bread.
Or when my feeble fyngers first
did toche or handle knife
How cursed was mine arm alas
it did not rid my life?
Why granted not my fortune foul
a Cockatrice had been
A present to my tender sight
the first that it had seen.
Why not among the Caniballes
were spent my years fresh
Who in my sickness would have kilde
me and have eat my flesh?
Or else among the tyrant Turks
I had been captive caught:
And then that dolor and that grief
had now my quiet wraught.
The poets feign in heuie hell
sometime is quiet rest:
But I in earth from time to time
am more and more oppressed.
Why Venus, art thou cruel blind?
or seeing wilt not see?
Or first thou still and laughest at
the wrong thou do to me.
Or does thie cruel son, and thou
together both conclude:
In hating young men's quiet state
their senses to delude?
What stay (quod the Physician)
what means your frantique brain?
What booteth this indecent talk?
What eases it your pain?
So long have I given ear, to you
as doutfull was my mind
Wheare you of humane nature wear
or else of brewtysh kind.
Is there no god at all think you?
how do you banne and curse?
Or do you think in him is not
tamende or make you wourse?
But if you cannot pacify
your rigor and your thrall,
Do seek some other friends advice,
come not to me at all.
I joy to see your helthfull bliss
I grieve to see your pain:
And shortly hope recovery
shall yet return again.
If you can take this quyetlie
till God do send you rest:
He tourneth always commonly
the hardest to the best.
And where you judge that in the world
none has so hard a hap,
What? is thear anny always may
sit in good Fortunes lap?
No: happy is that man, and blessed
at last that may aspire
And after many trobled days
obtain his hearts desire,
Your tender years cannot guess
how far it is vnmeate,
For witles youth before the sour
to feel, or taste the sweat.
What Iuell does a man esteame
that he does lightlye get,
Somoche as that by endless cost
and travail he does set?
Or what is that, which easelie
comes to a man alone
But that again, as soddenly
does pas away anon?
Mark well, and way within your head
that hard obtained grace
Forever cleaves to a man
to death will give no place.
How much then are you bound to God
that wourketh for the nones:
That all your cares together come
to end your greues at ones?
Content your careful heart awhile,
within a month and less:
On my reprofe, I warrant you
Your cares shall turn to bless.
And he shall grant you your desire
so that you sarue him well:
And all the grefes that gripe you now
will utterly expel.
The lovers plants were watered
in joy of this device
He yielded him both hand and heart
unto his friends advice,
Rejecting of his folly clean
and womanly complaint
And hoping after good success
which long had had restraynt.
Thus talk, which makes the time seem short
does drive the time away:
The Stars begynnes to hide themselfes
it waxes parfect day.
The Doctor shakes of sluggish sleep
and geues himself to rise
And wills the yongeman lay him down
and follow his advise.
A quiet sleep perchance may catch
your tomoch trobled hedde:
Unrestful men sometime take rest
in vnacqueynted bed.
To bed he goes warm covered,
and falls straight a sleep:
The Doctor leaves the sleping soull
unto the lord to keep.
Perchance the hope of blosfull joys
which he did trust should come
Did cause so sweet and soddeyne sleep
through all his powers to run.
Perchance it was the soddeyne joy
that warmde his heart and breast
And other parts, that wear half dead
and brought them so to rest.
Perchance the new unwonted joy.
that now was in his brain
Did cause this sound and restfull sleep
through want of wonted pain.
But likest is that nature would
to show her power give rest
To him that not in three months space
did sleep in quiet nest
I leave the cause to learned men,
that thearin have more skill
And to the matter I began,
I must return and will.
The Doctor leaves the sick a sleep
and glad he is thearfore:
He steals from his chamber, and
he stands at his door.
Wheare scantly he had tarried
the eight part of an hour,
But aged Nursh he spied from far
come from her masters bower.
Which thing he would not seem to see
he looked an other way,
Till Nursh with courtesies two or three
began to the Doctor say.
Your good advice (good gentle sir)
that you to me did tell:
My master and my lady both
through me perceive it well.
And wish that they had long ago
sought out your dwelling place:
Your counsel and your learned help
to ease the woeful race:
That she these three months space has roon
of whom you saw the state:
But now good folk they deem with tears
your conning comes to late.
And I have cause to sobbe and wale
asmoch as anny she
Because her never parting pain
my weping eyes do see.
This night (alas) this wicked night,
I thought her heart would break
For sounding sighs, and soking sobbes
nolde suffer her to speak:
But lie and weep, whose tender tears
have so embrend her chekes:
As Hellins husbands never was,
the dolefulst of the Greeks.
Now scarcely can she draw her wind
and by and by she cries:
As though she meant thearbie to perce
the high and hugie Skies.
The racking of her sprites thearwith
does seem to rent her heart:
And I pooer soul (aye me alas)
look when she should depart.
But this causde not my cumming now
my master does require,
And that you would come see the sike
with heart he does desire.
Good nursh your master may command
I yield me to his will,
He shut his door, and with the Nursh,
he goes to prove his skill.
The Nurshe does bring him to the house,
she tells her master straight:
and fourth he comes and welcomes him
for whom he long did weight.
With sober wourdes, and comely chere,
tone greetes the other then:
Their meting was not woman like,
they met like sober men.
The fathers fained cheer, not straight
showed fourth his inward grief:
Nor by and by bewailde his child,
his words were not so reefe.
But thus began his witty talk,
now sixtene winters past:
accompting from the tenth of March,
which was amongst us last.
My dame gave up, and took her leave
of young wifes wisshed suit,
And brought me out a daughter, as
the end of all her fruit.
In whom I ioyed very much,
I had no wenche before:
But for her grace, and virtues sake,
I ioyed much the more.
Yet sons I had, that might have proeud
good men, a four or five:
Death took them all, I was content
that she was left alive.
In whom I ioyde for virtues sake,
and parents duetye to:
As natures will becomes a law,
and forces men to do.
Now do you see, that god has wild,
such fate on me to fall,
She is become, my son, mine heir,
mine only child and all.
And sike she is, and very sick,
the lord him self does know:
Your counsel and your help I crave,
your conning eke to show.
But what does mean my witless words?
why do we lingering stand?
He wild the Doctor walk with him,
and lead him by the hand,
Into a chamber princely decte,
yet wondrous close and tight:
So as the watchers had their wills
to have it dark or light.
There lay the heavy penciue child,
there sat the mother sad:
There wanted naught, by money might
or frindship else be had.
And when the mother knew by Nursh
and by her tatling talk,
That he the learned Doctor was,
which with her spouse did walk,
She rose, and leaft her weary stool
and did salute him then,
with such a welcome as was mete
to welcome friendly men.
Who could eftsoon, with equal grace,
salute the dame again,
And also search, to show the Sire,
the daughters grief and pain.
Her beating poulsies, he began feel,
her temples and her feet,
And other such demonstratiues,
as apt he thought or meet.
And said unto the heuye maid,
Good heart thou art oppressed:
with painful pangues and freting fits,
which god torn to the best.
Then to the parents both at once,
the Doctor began to say,
Though I be bold yet bear with me,
I pray you go your way:
And let me talk a little while
with this your child alone,
Who will perchance, the franker speak,
if that you both were gone.
They went, and he returned back
to the diseased child,
And took her by the hand again
with countnaunce very mylde,
And said to her swear heart I see
your to much troubled brain
will not permit your tongue to talk
without excessive pain.
Therefore apply your ear to me,
which am your faithful friend,
though yet unknown, the truth shall try
my travail in the end,
And if you list that I shall say,
the secrets that I see
some token that you are content,
vouch safe to show to me.
With that she lickt her parched lips,
and faintly did she say:
Good sir speak on your mind to me,
I know no cause of stay.
Well then (quod he) I ask no more,
but that you hear me talk,
And blame me when disorderly,
my tongue or word shall walk.
Hear does the subtell Doctor now,
tell fourth the sickmans tale:
And finding both their states alike,
thinks thereby to prevail.
Not yet (quod he) two days ago,
this iollye ancient mate,
(Appointing to the aged Nursh)
did bring to me your state.
Whereon my conning earnestly,
and learning I did prove,
I must be plain, your state did show
your grief did grow by love.
Then toward the cares continuance,
I did adiecte my mind,
And that it was night three months old,
my certain rule did find.
And searching by that argument,
the plannet and the day,
I fourthwith found (good Lady mine)
that in the midst of may:
By walk or talk, or otherwise,
you sought your most delight,
And therein lost your liberty,
by twinke or sodeine sight.
Now, if my rule be certain still,
as it was wont be sure:
Confess to me: and doubt you not,
I shall your pains recure.
This heard did set the senses so
within the virgin odd:
As else she thought it was a dream,
else thought she him a god.
Whose perfect persing eye and skill,
so could detect her wound:
And therwithall twixt joy and care,
she fell into a sound.
But he whose praised skill (god wot)
exteamd it of no weighte:
Did almost use no force at all,
yet did releue her straight.
And then with fixed eye and face,
with color pale and wanne,
With shaking flesh and quaking joints,
her tale she thus began.
Take from my castles mouth (says she)
which is thrice double furde.
By means that not this sennightes space,
no talk my tongue has sturde,
This feeble folish answer, that
from such a place shall fail:
Full rightlye have you told the truth,
my cause my care and all.
And you that can by skill find out
so secret hidden grief,
My thinks again your praised skill
may find out my relief.
Well says the doctor since you have
to me discloasde your heart,
Conceive in me no doubt at all,
for I will do my part.
And this much by my knowledge I
dare to you hear auowe,
That every grief which you have felt,
shall torn to pleasure now.
For Fortune has been much your friend,
The constellacions tell,
And he on whom you set your love,
Loves you again as well.
A man he is of noble blood,
and has each lygnament,
Of nature, and in favor stands,
of every Ellyment.
His Father dead, he is his heir,
and Fortunes darling to,
You blame your chance, and what can more
good Fortune for you do?
And if you will, I will discloase
this to your parents sight:
and you shall see your dearling to
this instant present night.
Would god (quod she) right chierfully
that these your words were true:
Then of my long and pinching pain
at all I do not rue.
The Doctor called then the Nursh
in sober wise and mylde,
And wills her pray the parents both,
come now and see their child.
She ronneth straight: they come in haste,
no let does cause them slaye,
And fourthwith in the childs be half,
the Doctor gins to say.
Good Sir in all extremities,
the cause must first be known:
And then with lesser care and toil,
the grefe is overthrown.
When I came first you said to me,
one only child you had:
Whose languishing extremity,
did make your hartfull sad.
You wild me know, and if I could,
the cause of her disease:
you wild me use my skilfulnes,
her piersing pain to ease.
Thus have I done, and this I ask
of you, as of my friend,
To hear my tale, and grant good will
your daughters pain to end.
There is within this mile and less,
an heir that you do know:
Of noble blood, and worthy state.
his name I need not show.
Whose parents of continuance.
have louede your parents long:
And you must love the man again,
or else you do him wrong.
He loves your daughter passing well,
and she loves him again,
And both they are extremely sick,
and love does cause the pain.
Your daughter you have well brought up,
at home she learnt to wurke,
(As fits a maid,) but travail has
showed him both Jew and Turk.
His so dispended youthful days,
did cause Oblivion black,
By distaunce of the place and time,
their memories to rack:
And pull the face of tone of them
so far from tothers sight,
As childish knowledge twixt them twain,
was so deuoyded quight.
yet was it equal chance to both,
at once to mete in field,
Where Cupides stroke, unknown to them,
causde tone to other yield:
Which done they both do get them home,
in this their overthrow:
They love (alas) and yet their love
does neither of them know.
This has been grief to both their hearts,
hereby they have been tried,
Hereby their frindships and good wills,
both plain and true is spied,
Hereon does hang the helthfull state,
and dolor of the maid,
hereon, as on a procke or crutch,
the sickemans life is stayde.
Which hard and when the parents saw
whereto they both were bent:
They ioyed at the happy match,
and gave their cloase consent,
Although they warely did hold back
their words within their bound,
Least by their suddeine joy, their child
might suddein death have found.
And thus said to the doctor then,
We thank you for your talk,
and paynfull travail, and do pray
that he and you would walk,
At pleasure when you list to come
to this our simple home,
And welcomer then you shall be
this day there lives none.
And cause I would not have you think,
but I your pains regard.
Have hear (quod he) here is five pounds
accept this small reward.
Now was the parents inward care,
somewhat in better rest,
The maiden late that cursed her self,
does think her fortune blessed,
and other household talk was not,
within that house that day,
But that the woer might him self
come, every one does pray.
Now are the servants all and some,
calde fourth unto their charge,
Now to the beawtie of the house,
each thing is set at large.
Now does the mother with the child,
consult of every thing,
And how they might best welcome him
that should the Doctor bring.
I leave to tell the virgins joy
the half I cannot think:
Much less then can I speak the same
Or wright with pen or ynke.
Did not Eneas stealing steps
wourke to poor Dido wrong?
Did not alas Penelope,
think her Vlyxes long?
Then think the lady lengre thought
to see whom she loeud best
Whose pryncely presence only might
perform her quiet rest.
The Doctor that thus wrought his feat
with joy returned back:
And doubted much the sickman should
or this some solace lack.
But when he came unto his house
and chamber wheare he slept
And did perceive that all this while
a quiet sleep him kept
He took things oderyferous
soch as he did suppose
Were comfortable to the sick
and cocht them near his nose.
And with soche things as he thought mete
he made a mess of meat
Which he thought best was for the sick
when he did wake to eat.
And least that in unwonted sleep
some danger might be found:
His conning hands did take his Lute
and thearon began to sound.
The armonye wheareof, and eke
the savor sweet did make
The weight of sleep to wear away
and causde the sick to wake.
The noise did cause his eyes look up
thearwith he felt the smell
and thought him self in Paradise
they pleased his powers so well.
How now? quod the Physician
have I not done you wrong?
Or feel you not some injury
by sleaping over long?
No, no, quod the distressed soul
I think that I was blessed,
When first through you, and your aduyce
I laid me down to rest.
And so I pray the living lord
From danger you to keep:
As I the more am quieted
by this my sugared sleep.
Oh, that my mind were quieted
as this my body is:
Who then but I most happy man
should feel most happy bliss?
First must you learn to creape (quod he)
then after must you goo
Then after may you ride or roon
the course of things are so.
First has a quiet sleep refresht
your weak, and yele brain.
Now feed on this which I have made
let not your stomach frayne
And consequently shall appear
what pain and heuie plight
That I poor soul have ventured
to bring you to delight.
The man as in a rage for joy
conceued soch a trust,
As first the broth and then the meat
into his throat he thrust.
And thearwith loking up in have
and gasping yet for wind
Said to the Doctor specelye:
now let me know they mind.
You have (quod the Physician)
conceived your grief by love,
By love again texpell the same
It is in you to prove.
Then would you not think all your time
to be expended well?
To learn wheare she which has your heart
does at this instant dwell.
And thearwithall to bring you so
into your ladies grace
As frankly you may talk your mind
unto her face to face.
And that with joy she ioyouslie
in your should take delight
Would not think you this blisfulnes
avoid your sickness quight?
Thrice happy wear I happy man
to that then answered he
If that my mortal eyes might ones
these happy tyndinges see.
Then should I think my friendly fate
texcell, all others far
And farther to then brightest son
does pass the darkest star.
Then would I say good Fortune had
ones tornd her whele about
And plaste him equal with the best
that carst she had shut out.
The happy life of Priamus
before the siege of Troy
For aye should then be shaded quyte
by means of this my joy.
Then would I these so happy days
above those days extol
Whearin the happy Hercules
enioyde the lady Eoll.
Then Saturn put from princes throne
to prison and to pain:
And after set by Jupiter,
in kingly state again:
Was not so heigh advanced yet
by fortune and her grace
Nor half so heigh as I should be
to see my ladies face.
What happy man might ever say
that he had his desire:
So much as I, if I may to
my ladies love aspire.
If that I might assueredlie
so stand in Fortunes grace
What wrong has all my paynfulnes
don me this quarters space.
None other, but that suddeyn bliss
should not my heart anoye
Good Fortune sent a prepratiue
to mittigate my joy.
Then in my dreadful dollour, and
the midst of all my strife
My Fortune fair has sent to me
my most desired life.
Well then (quod the Physician)
go put on some attire:
And come to me in comely sort
you shall have your desire.
And then in token of the troth
that I to you professed:
I will not fail to show you her
I know that you love best.
And that in soch a decent sort
as can pursue none ill
I mean with both the parents and
else, all the friends good will.
Oh, happy heavenly Fortune that
so suddeynly can change:
Oh that thou can so friendly be
and yet can seem so strange:
Now, he that erst did curse himself
his fate and all did banne,
Of all the rest that live and joy
accomptes him happiest man
And he that as half buried,
went stooping to the ground
Now as a courtly gentleman
in comely sort is found
Not roysting as the roysters use
not gallant in the sight
Nor wear his doings prodigal
ne yet in niggerdes plight.
Whiles in this comely clenlynes
the lover thus was dressed
The parents house was trymmed up
the Doctor and the rest.
The silly sick releued dame
putes on the same attire
Which she did wear, when Cupid first
did set her heart on fire.
The mother that would trymmer have
the daughter ganne to blame
For leaving of her better weeds
and doing on the same.
Nay, mother, says the smylyng child.
sins thus I have been tossed
I will find out my liberty
in weades that I it lost.
I do reserve your pleasure yet
and yield me to your will:
Naie Daughter, at your liberty
do change or wear them still.
The frolike father he comes in
he sees that all is well
Hark says the mother whose at gate?
does no man hear the bell?
The aged Nursh that stands in hope
the wyshed gestes were come
Steps out before the rest a pace
and to the gate does roonne.
Whear when the sees the Doctor and
with him so trym a wight:
Right comely she salutes them both
most joyful of that sight.
The master was enquired for
within he was, she said
That they might speak with him forthwith
the learned Doctor praide.
Gone is the Nursh, and tells the sire,
and dame, what gestes were theare:
I came straight way the father says:
desire them come near.
Now stands the young man amarous
in hope of his relief
Though doutfull passhones of the mind
does shiuer yet his teeth.
Down comes the courtly gentleman
and friendly does embrace:
The Doctor and the woer to
and staieth so a space.
To whom the Doctor thus brake fourth:
the friendship and good cheer
Which of your wourship I received
the last time I was hear
Does cause that I and this my friend
though to your cost and pain,
Do find the means (I warraunt you)
to visit you again.
Good cheer, alas why say you so
you slander me ywis
But welcome are you both to me
to soch cheer as it is.
Oh that the muses which do dwell
on Hellicon the hill
Or learned Pallas would step fourth
to aid my froward will.
Or that the learned sisters three
which pas all other men:
Would take upon them but a while
to guide and rule my pen.
Then should you hear how pleasantly
in short and sugared verse
The passing joys of these two folk
my conning cold rehearse,
How to the mother aged Nursh
does give the man a praise
Above the rest which with her eyes
she saw in all her days.
How that the mother, ere she saw
the man, or ought was done:
In token of her inward Joy
did name him for her soon.
How that the silly virgyn could
no lengre time abide,
But with her knife did piers a hole
whear through her love the spied.
And then how many sundry joys
replenysshed her heart,
And eke the yongemans blesfull state
before I would depart.
But sins that in so surging Seas
I dare not hoyse my sale,
I must in baser sort (god wot)
tell fourth a rudes man's tale.
Your welcome said the gentleman
much better is to me,
Then gold, or else without the same,
the greatest cheer should be.
Thus courteous wourdes, were spent apace:
emonges this friendly men:
and from the hall, the father wild
them to the parlour then.
Whear was the aged gentlewoman
whear sat her daughter to:
Whear one embrast the other as
the manner is to do.
Whear as the father with the Nursh
of purposes began to talk
And toward the aged mother does
the Doctor gin to walk.
The gentleman said merelye
sins hear are women three
And two already are in talk,
the third is left for me.
And toward her makes, a stately course
her tender lyps he kissed.
Her fingers that wear fair and long
encloasing in his fist,
In secreat sort he uttered then
his long unquiet rest
To her (who axt) cold not deny
but that she loved him best.
Oh happy man that have found out
the mean to quench thine Ire,
And happy dame that Fortune has
enricht with thy desire.
Who now may joy but you alone?
who is so justly glad?
as you that have your hearts desire:
whose friends good will is had.
The Nursh about her business goes,
the father walks aside,
But still the younger couple do
in talk together bide.
Their talk and tales does pleas them both,
loath are they to depart:
And changing colors therwithall,
bewraies the joyful heart.
It grows fast toward supper time,
the mother eke does pray,
The Doctor and the woer to:
that they would come away.
Unhappy harmefull voice thinks he,
it is that does depart
Two bodies so ycopled that
they both have but one heart:
He thanks her yet, for manners sake,
and yeldes him to her will:
That would have sold his supper feign,
in talk to tarry still.
The father and the mother both,
the woer and the maid:
The Doctor and a friend or two,
at supper hear are staide.
And first with some solempnitie,
the woer he is fet,
And other Gestes in order due,
the father he does set.
Here does he play the Husshers part,
and can the office quyte:
His wife he plaste at upper end,
and set his daughter right
against the man in whom good wenche
he knew she ioyed much,
And he as much in her again,
their linked love was such.
No question need demanded be
of diet and of meat:
There wanted naught that might be wished,
but stomakes for to eat.
The parents stomakes, joy had filde,
to see their daughter glad,
And joy again as ioynouslye
the lovers filled had.
The rest did feed right merely,
and then began to talk,
as common is at every feast,
where Bacchus wares do walk.
The father to the Doctor drank,
the mother to the geast
that reason taught by perfect skill,
did love her daughter best.
With all her heart, I say she drank
to him in cup of gold,
Who pledgde the dame, and to the child
to drink he was as bold.
Thus merry wear they every one,
Right glad and well apaide,
And she I think most glad of all
that almost nothing said,
Whose joyful, kind, and loving heart,
her pashons could not hide:
But that which might not from the mouth,
from heart and eye did slide.
Now looked she up full chierefully,
and then within a while:
Her color chaungde from white to red,
and then again did smyle,
on him to whom by happy chance,
she thought her holely bound,
By whom again her secret thoughts
with spedy slight were found.
Wherewith the father did break out,
in decent sober sort.
and that they all would hear his tale,
he did his gests exhort.
They all attentively gave ear,
their tongues and talk were still
Applying them with might and main,
to here the fathers will.
Who now his secrets does detect,
in plainest sort he can,
and looking on his daughter, thus
his sober talk began.
This maiden which you know right well
mine only daughter dear,
Has choase this gentle gentle man,
unto her only fear.
And he again (I know not how)
does in my daughters sight
conceive his chief felicity.
his comfort and delight.
Of tender years is the man,
my chielde is young also,
And youth by aunshent saw is said,
to reason is a foo.
Of worthy parentage he is,
of noble blood by birth,
His parents friends to mine always,
approved to the death.
His manners and behavior,
are comely as you see:
His presence and his parsonage)
delightful unto me:
Endewed with possessions,
enricht with land and fee,
Not wanting ought that comelye is,
in such an one to be.
My childish daughter is not ritche,
well qualited nor feire,
Nor else wherein such one should joy,
but that she is mine heir.
And I an aged thriftles man,
and like enough to spend
my goods, and eke possessions,
before my life does end,
Then to so rich a gentleman,
to match so poor a wife:
Is but a mean to kendle cause
of endless care and strife.
Except you may vouchsafe good Sir,
a poor man's child to take,
And of my daughter far unmeet,
your wife and fellow make.
Which if you do undoubtedly,
the argument does prove,
Your coming is of perfect zeal,
and but for puer love.
Which if (your direct answer made)
I find you that way bent:
My wife has so persuaded me,
you shall have my consent:
And when my Ladies life and mine,
by death are once bereft:
you may account the same your own,
if any thing he left.
The Doctor would have answered,
whose talk the lover brake,
And did reject all bashfulnes,
and to the father spoke.
Right worshipful, my duetye is,
to term you so by right,
Because of long continuance,
you are a worthy knight.
To whom again of right I owe
a childly duty to:
As friendship, and your daughters love,
enforces me to do.
You know your daughter loves me,
and I love her again:
And yet in doubt you stand to make
the match betwine us twain.
Although you can on my behalf,
ympute none other lack,
But that not many aged years,
depend upon my back.
Age is a gift of nature that
she geues to many one,
Wit coming by the deytie,
is given by god alone.
As Salomo^ was parfect wise,
a child yet by his years,
And Daniell in judgment seat,
and infant as appears.
Do you not read that Joseph to,
in youth discresion had,
Refrainyng foul adultery,
him self but yet a lad.
A thousand more, but that I will
not trouble you a whit:
I could expres in youthful years,
had sage and sober wit.
Again, an ancient proverb is,
with men that are full sage,
that wit sometime in youth appears,
and always not in age.
I speak not herein bostingly:
or that I would have thought,
that I my wisdom should commend,
or that my wit wear ought:
But that I would seem orderly
to answer to your tale,
and that to mine and her excuse
mine answer might prevail.
And to my parents wourthines,
and state of noble blood:
mine never were so worthy yet,
but youres were as good.
And where you say my friends and youres
in amytie were knit:
I seek to tie a suerer knot,
and not to break it yet.
And that my person and my self,
are pleasant in your sight,
you cause me thereby to rejoice,
and in my self delight.
My rents and my possession,,
and all my lands and fee,
as equal are unto your child,
as they are unto me.
To whom me thinks you have done wrong
in such sort to disgrace
a wight with worthy qualities,
and eke so fair a face.
I did not seek your heir (god knows)
I sought this worthy dame:
whose just desert already craves,
an everlasting fame.
As for your riches and your wealth,
I pray the lord increase:
And Nestors life I wish to you,
tenioy them al in peace.
And me thinks that a meter match,
you saw not in your life
Then to so wild a gentleman,
to give so sad a wife.
and how can I by any means,
a greater Iuel take:
Then to receive and keep for aye,
a wise and sober make.
The which if you bestow on me,
your deed it self does prove:
that you resolve your sorrows both,
and knit the knot of love.
And do this answer absolute,
within your head conceive
That either I must have my heart,
or you my life receive.
Wherewith he set a decent pawse,
and therewith began to smyle:
and craved license of the dame,
toward her to talk a while:
Who lyked so the former tale,
the woer had begone:
as so much more to glad him bad,
say on my loving son.
My father (quod the gentleman)
I speak as I would have:
with your consent, I thank you both,
to me your daughter gave.
You sitting by, me thought your face
your willing heart did show:
And with his words your ioynct consent
on me you did bestow,
The maid, whose good behavior
has staide her words as yet:
by clasping of her fingers fast,
did seem the knot to knit.
And I that seek your child alone,
and crave none other good:
Receive her so unto my wife,
with all my heart and blood.
And if that this construccion,
be parfecte say you then:
unto my hungry heart and mind,
with free consent Amen.
With that the parents first began,
and then all at the board,
and standers by, said all amen,
there was none other word.
Oh joyful sentence thus proclaymde
oh this obtained grace,
that has with soch, and so much care,
been sought so long a space.
Now does the fair and friendly beams
splendiferous and bright,
Of smyling Fortune show themselves
in this desired night.
Now sorrow does absent her self,
and joy possess her rome,
Within those hearts, which not long since
did think them nere their dome.
Now every man does well commend
the fresh and filed wit,
Of him whose chierfull comely talk,
does fill their ears as yet.
Now lacks nothing think they all,
byt that the maiden fair:
should frankly speak her inward thought,
and so her mind declare.
Wherewith her countnaunce began to change,
she lifted up her eyes,
The ruddie color in her chekes
eftsoon begone to rise.
Quod she unto her father then
and so unto the rest
The day of my natyuitie
the hour to was blessed
Whearin my young, and youthful sight
did pres and was so bold
This firm and faithful lover true
at first for to behold:
Perchance some hear may think it is
a rude and rashfull part:
A maiden in soch wies and sort
thus to declare her heart.
Well next unto this gentleman
this bargain does me touch:
Whose love to me is not so great
but mine to him as much
To whom again I yield myself
obedient at demand,
And wedding ones solempnised
his only to comaunde.
He has discloasd his honest mind
again I for my part
In recompense, for his reward
do give to him my heart.
And yield him franckly with the same
my free and true consent
my faith and all vnfaynedlie
until my life be spent.
Hear might I name the humble thanks
that he his lady gave,
Hear might I tell the sundry thoughts
the gestes emonges them have,
Hear might I show the parents mirth
their firm and fixed joys.
The householdes talk ye neighbors wourdes
and else a thousand toys.
But you have heard the long discourse
held all this supper space:
Then note the evening so is spent
deep night draws on apace.
The ^^^ers are ycopeled
(...) ^uery thing is well
The ^^^her poyncteth in the morn
(...) ^edding day to tell
The banquetes are in order due
by servants taken up:
And every gest does take his leave
that then and thear did sup.
The new betrothed son in law
his reverence don does part
And takes with him his wifes good will
and leaves with her his heart.
If that the parents ioyed now
who thearfore can them blame?
Or what should let the lovers but
that they should do the same?
And why should not the happy man
lead now a pleasant night
Whose happy hap had clean berefte
him of his sorrow quyte.
I will not show the conference
that now in secreat is
Betwixt the Doctor and the man
nor think upon their bliss.
And with the maidens merry state
I have no mind to mel
Because my head cannot conceive
nor pen express it well.
But yet the blysfull night does bate
the chierfull day draws on
The lover thinks in Fortunes grace
somoch as he is none.
For sooner had not wished day
expelde the mantell blak
And eke the pitchie clouds of night
the air had on her back
But straight way he would get him up
and gave himself to rise
That he might of the wedding day
with his new Sire devise
Now would he go, it was to sone:
then would he stay a while.
And phansies still that did renew
did former thoughts exile.
When reason would not suffer him
from thence so soon depart
He fixed his head and beat his brain
on her that had his heart
And gat him to the window which
did open toward the home
of her, in whom he did delight
that had his heart alone.
And by the winds which hitherwardes
their flieng force did bend
unto his lady, al his thoughts
in covert he did send.
Now would he wish he wear a cloud
and by and by a star:
Or other thing he wayde not what
that fource had from so far:
Of her to have a sight in whom
he long had pleasured so
Or else that time (alas) were come
that he himself might go.
He wished that merry Marcurie
might send unto him wings
And else that longd to Poets art
he named a thousand things
Or that he had the dulcet voice
of Nightingale or Lark:
Or that in musickes armonie
he past each other clarke
Or that he at this present time
more dry then Tantalus
Had both the conning and the harp
of famous Orpheus.
First would he use his wished wings
and thither take his flight
Whear of his lady he were sure
in bed to have a sight.
And then his princely Poets art
should in right conning verse
Unto his lady and his love
ten thousand things rehearse:
That yet for lack of lucky time
himself cold not discloase
Nor his so secreat matter durst
to any man repose.
Whearin, if Poets fyled verse
should seem to her to long,
The rest in conning armonie
should finish with a song.
Then to her whom he wronged thus
so long awake to keep
(As Orpheus did the dampened souls)
his harp should bring a sleep.
As he poor soul, whose joyful heart
nolde suffer to take rest
Did always beat his brains on her
that now he loved best:
So did the famous wourthie dame
with firm and fixed mind
Seek out this long and wakefull night
a thousand ways to find,
Whearby she most might pleas the man
or him most high advance
That Fortune thus had made her mate
by good, and happy chance.
The lovers brains thus occupied
he casts up his eyes
Unto the craysed clouds of heaven
from whence he playnelie spies
The horse of Phoebus chariot
begins their course to ronn
and shows universally
their gloabe or golden son.
Which sight this ardent gentleman
does hear his warraunt make
And thearuppon his journey does
unto the father take.
And eke does pray the Doctor to
even as he has begoon
To go with him and be his aid
till his attemptes were won.
Fast toward the fathers mantion
these friends together go
Their errand is, and they seek out
the wedding day to know.
Whear when they came the father was
the mother and the maid
Which on the coming of those guestes
had all this morning stayde
If that the Doctor welcome was
unto the parents, know
That then the lover welcome was
unto his wife: I trow.
What neade I tell the breakefast which
they had provided hear?
What boteth of the cost to speak
or of the royal cheer?
Or of the sugared sententes
the mother did express
Thereby to wourke her son in law
the greater cause to bless.
What vaileth of the gold to talk,
the plate, or of the rent,
Which thear was seen, or by the Sire
might yearly be spent?
What neade I to express the heap
of gold and massy muke
The father did appoynct the child
in token of good luck.
What neade I name the loving toys
betwixt the lovers fell?
But wish the long continuance
of those that loved so well.
What vaileth that I should at all
hear play so fond a part
as might detect how each of them
enjoyed the others heart
Should I declare how in the one
the other had delight?
No, no, I will not wrong them so
but thearof claim them quyt.
Nor from the fathers answer will
defer you any lengre:
Who naemd the wished wedding day
the twentyth of Septembre.
And show you, how they and their friends
be glad and do rejoice:
To see so good succession.
had in so mete a choice.
Did Venus think you joy at all
when she the apple had?
Did not her promys Paris joy
and made his heart as glad?
Does every lover with his love
content himself right well?
Then let them joy, a little while
whose joys I cannot tell.
And talk we nothing of the toil
the turmoyle and the race
The friends had hear to compass things
With in so short a space.
Nor of the letters wear sent out
the kindredes to enuite
Think not at all, for of the same
my pen no wourde shall write.
But pas we over fourtene days
which spedely were spent
The fyuetenth was the wedding day
set by the fathers stent.
In which of meare necessity
I must make some discourse
Though that the Muses in my need
of me have no remourse,
The happy long desiered day
gins scarce to show her light
Ne yet the air had scant vnlewst
the mantell of the night
Ne had Aurora stretched her arms
her slombres of to throw
Ne had the skies alhydden yet
the stars which erst did show.
So sone as had the gentleman
put sluggishnes to flight
And left his restles bed whearin
he rolled all this night.
Up calls he then his saruingmen
and wills their help to raye
Their happy master happily
in this most happy day.
Each thought that came unto his head
but mirth and joy did bring
He dreameth on mount Hellicon
he hears the Muses sing.
Now is he set in Fortunes lap
each thing does come aright,
And all his trobles and his cares
are now deuoyded quyte.
And somoch more to glad him with
came to his window then
A set of violles conninglye
plaide on by conning men
Whose parfect play was uttered
with soch a skillful grace
As he did think himself in heaven
or in a bettter place.
He thrust his hand into his purse
and what he thearin found:
Out of the window, for their pains
he threw it to the ground.
And wild them that they should fourthwith
the rather for his sake
convey them to his fathers house
and so his wife to wake.
Whose best they hastly did obey
whose mind they did fulfill
Whose praise of lyberalitie?
they do comend and will.
Whear when they come, they suddeinly
such music did resounde
As if Appollo from the heavens,
has sent it to the ground.
Wh^arwith they looked out for joy
that slept, not long before:
The Shepherd showed his teth, and said
that Pan was at the door.
The virgin whom the mother would
not yet have left her bed,
No longer could abide in couche,
but needs must show her hedde.
The father and the mother roase,
the melody was such,
As who had heard the conningest,
might there have hard as much.
Of noble nature was the Sire,
and music did regard,
And gave the Minstrelles for their pain
a royal in reward.
The minstrelles that so sone could not
forget their gotten gain,
Do think in all their lives they not
bestowed a better pain.
And so drew on right chierfully
the fresh and pleasant day:
which seen did the musicians
fast pack themselfes away.
No sooner were they gone from thence,
but then the lover came,
In whom I dare auowe to you,
was nothing out of frame.
In sober garment clenly clad,
without respect of cost,
His lent like chikes had got again,
the flesh that erst they lost.
Whose comely salutacion did
his Lady so ymbrace,
As they that saw it could but muse,
and wonder at his grace.
The parents did receive their son,
in such a worthy wise,
as who that would have wished a thing,
could better not devise.
The mother took him by the hand,
and lead him round about:
To see the order of each thing,
within and eke without.
And how she meant that all should be
in order did him tell,
The wourst whereof he could not mend,
nor scarce could wish so well.
Thus whiles she vewed every thing,
the day ganne fast to grow
and Titan began his golden beams,
from the southeast to throw:
Whereby he saw that slippery time
away began to slide:
And that the matrons of the town
came in to dress the bryde:
And that the townish maidens did
about the gates gin flock:
His heedie head could not less deame,
then it was eight a clock.
From thence he then retired back
unto his mantion straight:
Where did right worthy gentlemen
a number for him weight:
Who greted him, and praide the lord
to keep him from anoye
And of the bargain he should make
to send him endless joy.
He thanks them all, and stoopeth often,
he vayleth cap and knee,
and who that used him courtlyest,
no courtlier was then he.
One of his servant he hid send
to church from him away*
To see the order of each thing:
and how did wear the day.
And whiles that servant so was sent
the rest a roo right fine
presented all the gentlemen,
with wafer cakes and wine.
Himself brought forth a standing piece
of gay and glistring gold:
Ympleat with right good ypocrace,
and drank to young and old.
Then did retourn his man again,
whose reverence made and done
said to his master, time was now
for service was begone.
Wherewith the master with some speed
and yet in order to:
Returned back unto his wife,
as manner is to do.
With such a sort of gentlemen
pursuyng at his train:
So well ymatched with their likes
in order twain and twain:
As erst not in an hundredth years
the like could be espide,
to weight upon a gentleman
in honor of a bride.
So sone as they were come in sight
night to the fathers door,
a sort of semely Seruitures,
of purpose set therefore
Eftsoon do go by course arowe,
from first unto the last
presenting them with fancyes made
of purpose for repast.
And eke that gentle Iem, the bride,
trymd up in her attire:
As to her birth but decont was
and this day did require,
In humble sort did show her self,
and in right hearty wise,
Did yield them all as hearty thanks,
as could her heart devise.
To church does then the bridegroom go,
and all the rest array,
And for the coming of the bryde,
not one but all do stay.
Who forthwith comes out in deed,
in such a fined frame:
As if of purpose it were done,
to win eternal fame.
First was her countnaunce comely set,
her eyes were fixed full sure,
Her face was fair, her cherry chekes,
her beawtye passing pure.
Her breast out in a decent sort,
not proud at all she bare:
Her hear was loose, and on the same
a Cronet paest she ware.
The color of her hears did seem
to those that did behold,
as if that nature had them drawn,
of bright and burnisht gold.
The length thereof again is such,
as some did make to muse:
How well so young a woman might
so rare a Jewel use.
Next that aboutes her neck at least,
more then five double fold:
With diamondes and with Saphiers set,
she ware a chain of gold.
Whereto a pendent tablet was
of such excessive price,
As how I should esteem the same,
surmounteth my devise.
Above the which a partlet was,
of carved work so rare,
As through the workmanship thereof
each Jewel showed fare.
Her kirtell was of satin white,
embrodred very rich
with silver, and her gown was black
plain velvet with a stitch.
About her wast, a chain of gold
the girding place possessed,
And at the same did Iuels hang,
as rich as was the rest.
Upon her arms the sleues did with
the partlet so agree,
as all together did delight,
the lookers on to see.
What should I say? nothing but well
could then be seen in place:
But of the rest the trimmest was
her gesture and her grace.
And proper two young gentlemen,
in satin semely clad,
To church did lead her, and her hands
within their fingers had.
If that this merry morning thus
did every man delight,
I think it pleased the husband well,
the Lady and the knight.
Well, as she was, to church she goes,
pursued with a train
of ladies and of gentilles such,
as not the world can stain.
Where with the fearful minister,
did see so fair a face:
half doubtful in himself he thought
Diana was in place.
And looking on the man again,
in trembling and in fear:
What god (thought he) shall I now match
unto this gods hear.
But all his fond amassed sprites,
at last returned back:
The peoples sight did aid his powers,
which suddein fear did rack.
and then with manly voice he says
as comely as he can:
Who geues this bride (quod he) unto
this Jolly gentleman.
One stepped forth right worshipful
appointed for that part,
And said I give her to his use,
to thee with all my heart.
Now spoken are the wedding words
Now take they hand in hand,
Now is the wedding ring put on,
a firm and suer band.
Now all the folk within the church
which scarce can stand for thronge:
Cry unto god in perfect joy,
they may continue long.
whose decent doings in this day,
the church did so adorn:
and none that saw the same had seen
the like since they were borne.
Now flies there wafers in the church,
now Iunkets go about:
and some with wine are washed so
they hardly can get out.
The husband with the former train
does get him home before:
And staith the coming of his wife
within her fathers door,
And then two aunshent worthy knights,
the brydegromes kinsmen to
In honor of the bride stepped forth,
and thus much service do.
By either arm they take her theare,
and homewardes lead her than,
And at her fathers door do yield
her to her wedded man.
He thanks them all with hand and heart,
and takes her by the fist:
Whose tender lips before them all
is by the husband kissed.
And first he does inuit his gests
that are of worships state,
And then of his familiars
spied by him at the gate.
Besides a worthy company
of states and Ladies gaye,
that long before invited were
against the wedding day.
What should I wright? ye bride brought home,
the gestes are comely set:
Where plenty was, and mighty store,
of things were hard to get.
Where nothing wanted, that the mind.
the head, or heart might wish,
No venson wild, no dillicate,
no flesh, nor yet no fish:
No pleasant talk, no change of wine,
nor dainty dishe at all,
The want whereof might hurt the feast,
or might the worship gall
The trompets sounded pleasantly
the Cornets to were herd:
but always were the vtolles and
the lutyng men preferred.
The warbling voice of queresters,
with aid of singing men,
The conning songs, the subtle note,
which were right common then.
The multitude confessed, their likes
they never heard before,
For had Amphion been alive,
he could have done no more.
Hear bid the Bridegroom serve the bride
The Bride unto him drank,
He did her pledge and with his heart
right humbly did her thank.
What should I say the pleasure that
each pleasant heart had found,
Not only filde the empty skies
but did again resounde,
and flewe from friend to friend so fast,
as every man was glad,
And in so great a multitude,
no frowning look was had.
Well thus the dinner ended is,
Thus some do fall to talk,
and some to ease their filled gorge,
about the field do walk.
Some then do cast the bar and some
do give their self to leap,
And every man where he does like
does healpe to mende the heap.
Some dance, some sing and some again
each maistery does prove,
And some do talk of martial feats,
and other some of love.
And so the after none is spent
so supper time comes on
And every gest at supper is
in order set anon.
The Bridgrome has his office left
he will no longer weight
The knight the lady and his wife
ones set, he sytteth straight.
And as their fare at dynner was
so fare they now again
But that the supper Iunketes were
the better of the twain
It, semde that Ceres cater was
and Bacchus brought them wine
And Eosops self had supt with them
somoch thear was and fine.
But yet the married cople were
more joyful to each gest
then meat, or drinck, or armonie
of Music, or the rest.
Scant had they supped and their meat
in order taken away
But drome stroke up, and in came light
more brighter then the day,
So rich in tire, so crooked fact
with soch disguysed gear
I think no man had seen, as do
the gay torchbearers wear.
As for the rest the company
cold not remember when
In all their life's that they had seen
so tryme dysguysed men
They lokt about the parlour then
and did themselfes advance,
And matched themselfes with ladies fair
and gave themselfes to dance
And he that was most conningest
in daunsing tricks so tried
Set fourth himself and by the hand
did take the famous bride
They marched on, they striued all
who might excel the rest
And every one thought in himself
his connig was the best.
So spent they there an hours space
in daunsing and delight
Right Joyful to themselfes it was
right pleasant to the sight.
Then hugie heaps of gold they threw
out of their box, on board
And thearwithall a bale of dyce
with mum and not a word,
Of gentlemen thear was a route
that kept themselfes in store
To play with them, it was their wills
the stays but thearfore.
The maskers luck was very good
Mum, mum, they all do cry
The brom strikes up, aboutes the house
the money gins to fly.
They leave their play, the gin to dance
about the house arowe
They take their banquet or repast
and thence again do goo.
Thus now the wedding day is past
the wyshed time coms on
That toil is left, and wearines
and every man is gone.
The bride with matrons sad and wise
within her bed is laid
Who tastes of every Iunket, and
thearwith do leave the maid.
And so the wedded husband is
brought to his wedded wife
Which long he had desired, now
the end of all his strife.
They both have that which they can ask
naught else they can require
He has his wife, and she her spowse
the end of her desire.
The cheer does yet continue still
a nine or ten days space
In which no empty rome at all
is in the fathers place.
In end whearof the courteous man
right free of heart and purse
Does recompense the servants all
and eke his friend the Nursh,
In so lardge and so ample wies
as they them self did muse
That so base folk, so rich a man
with larges so should use.
And to his friend the Doctor does
for all his friendship give
An annual fee, right worth his pain
so long as he does live
Which donn from parents house they draw
to Manor of his own
And lead their lives most pleasauntly
in his well stored home.
Whearin the wedded folks have joy
a quarter of a year
Soch as few wedded men or none
cold ever yet come near
Oh cruel cankred fortune that
can heave a heart so hie
And to the same, will yield a cause
of slipping by and bye
Oh that thou can so flatter men
with granting their desire
And wilt not suffer them to cleave
to that they do aspire
To whom in all thie life almost
thie friendship do thou show?
But when he thinks him saefst of all
has then his over throw.
What is he ever lived yet
and did the thoroughly try?
But rather then to give the thanks
may vengeance on the cry.
How did thou Priamus betray
through Paris flatring dream?
How did thou all his children slaie
and spoylde him of his Realm?
How Titan did thou first advance
by berth the king of Creete?
How after did thou him suppress
under king Saturns feet?
How Saturn did thou eke begile
and Titan cause again
To put him from the Realm of Creete
to prison and to pain.
How then also poor Titan was
by Jupiter undone:
His Realm by Saturn repossest
his kingdom ouerroon.
How then did Saturn seek to slaie
King Jupiter his friend?
Which Jupiter did Saturn kill
his father in the end.
Oh Fortune did thou ever yet
advance a man on earth
Which if he did affie in the
had not vntymelie death?
Even so thou have extolled hear
these silly two thearfore
As feling now the bitter sweet
might wourke their woe the more.
Now has my pen expressed hear
in vain, a sort of tooyes
Of lovers sytes, of youthful hearts
and of their wyshed Joys
Which after tornes from ill to worse
as time in order wears
You shall hear all, and if I can
express them, for my tears.
As Venus has been all this while
the cause of mirth and woe
Betwixt these two which vows their faith
from other shall not go.
So now the Marshall planets do
begin to fall at far,
And noble Mars enclines the hearts
of Princes unto war
Now winters force begynes to fade
the springtyme grows on
The regions cold, the hugie frostes
within a while are goon.
Now, Ver, the nursh to every thing
does in her pleasant mead
Give sap and moyster, and to men
yeldes new and pleasant blood
Now those whose currage winters force
late had appalled quyte
Recept of fresh and recent blood
encorageth to fight.
The youth which winter made right gl^d
to lead a quiet life
Do now rejoice to talk and hear
of war and cruel strife
Nothing is talked of in the town
But means to understand
Which way tanoye the enemy
by water and by land
The princes preparacion
his care and all his toil
Is how to save his honor and
to give his foe the foil
Whearfore are valiant Champions
saught out both nere and far
To strength the frontires of the Realm,
To furnyshe eke the war
Old stagers are from Garrisons
calde forth and set at lardge
And of the vnapproued men
have regiment and charde
Young gentlemen of lyuelyhode
and eke of courage to
Are called out to try themselfes
their devour then to do
And he advanced, was preferde
always before the rest:
that else by strength, or else by slight
cold show his courage best
Whearwith this strong tale gentleman
did every thing assaye
And from the most, or rather all
did bear the praise away
And so the Bruyt, did straight resounde
into each Capteyns ear
As none like him in towardelines
nor manhood did appear
His living straight, his forwardnes,
so sone also was known
As was his strength and manlines
by flyeng voices blown.
Hear whispering talk of Capteyns is
from one to other herd
They pry on him, they mark him well
his doing is preferde.
At last two of the worthiest, of
the Capteines that were theare
Did leave the rest and toward the man
ganne fast to draw them near
And somoch more tyncorage those
that else wear thear in place
Right courteously, they did salute
and eke did him embrace
Comending him in wourthie wies
that thear had done so well
And of their graund comyssion
gins thus their tale to tell.
Theare is attempted now (quod they)
against our noble prince
Such wars as in our fathers time
were not, nor never sins
So covertly compacted, and
that in so close a wise
As may the secreat enemy
with head or heart devise
And would not have it known at all
until they had begoon
What their intent or meaning is
ne what they will have done
Our valiant prince thearof his mind
his purpose to has bent
Their malice and their minded force
to tame and to prevent
Of purpose now his navy, with
all other ships, are made
Right reddy when he shall comaunde
their untrue to enuade.
And so they fully occupied
in buesie war at home
shall quayle their courage, and their lust
that else abroad would rome.
Whearfore we have comyssion
that capteyns long have been
To chose out other Capitayns
and soldiers to bring in.
In fine, we see your manlines
we know your living lardge
We wyshe the prince, ten thousand had
so apt to take a chardge.
So meet such matters to attempt
with Soldgers care to mell,
So like to take the same in hand
and like to end it well
We thearfore, in the name of God
and in the princes to
Comyt two hundredth men in chardge
to serve him under you.
And captain over them you are
they are your servants all
Prepare you then in reddines
to serve when time shall call,
Thearwith the gentleman does speak
in sobre wies and sade
Your chardge is over great for me
in years yet a ladde.
The Romayne Capiteins very grave
were grown in years sore
And children had no chardge at all
who are unmeet therefore.
Mars will have lusty men in deed
their princes quarelles fight
But Capiteins old more grave then rash
should give to such their light.
I not deny, but fortune does
sometime on bold men smyle
But if their wits, not rule their strength,
how frowns she in a while:
I have to serve my prince, my will,
my heart, my hedde, my hand:
my boddy and my moving goods
my chatels and my land.
But what should in my princes right,
these things awhit prevail:
If want of skill in all attempts
my forward will should quayle.
Well since the higher powers to you
did this commission make,
And that your countnaunce does declare
my scuse no place will take:
I yield me to the will of god,
and to good Fortunes grace:
And now cast of my wedding tire,
to run a solgers race,
The captains which upon his talk,
their staying did depend,
His answer made, did take their leave,
and did his wit commend.
Lo hear the wavering whele of fate,
see where she fawneth best
She sends troubles of the mind,
she hates now his rest,
Who lately thought, his cares were past
his joys were permanent,
His troubles now beginning are,
his happy days are spent.
Now leaves he of his pleasant tales,
he changes here his talk:
His songs are turned into cares,
a captains course to walk.
Now horse, now armor, he prouides,
and all municions to:
That to a captain does pertain,
and is in him to do.
Now gins he break his dolfull chance
unto his loving wife,
who rather then to spare her spouse
would chose to loase her life.
Which heard, from bright and bloddy red
her cheeks wax pale and wan,
With secret sobbes, and tears enough
her wayling rale began.
Sweet heart, what falt in me is found*
what trespass have I done,
what does alas constrain your heart,
your weded wife to shoon.
Have I unawares committed ought,
my loyalty to break,
which in so sharp a sort you seek,
on me poor wretch to wreak.
Have I unseemly done the thing
in decent for a wife?
If ye correct your own, sweet heart
with loss of lymme or life.
And part not from your promise thus
let me not languish so:
Do change your mind, reuert your heart
bend not your self to go.
Yet am I she you wedded late,
yet does my beawtye last,
yet have I perfect confidence
your fancy is not past.
Let not then such ungentleness,
in noble heart appear,
To leave a woman desolate,
in less space then a year
What, think with what extremity
our fixed love begonn,
and god forbid, with such swifte foot
the race thereof were roon.
Alas, good wife, (then quod the man)
my tears nill let me speak,
and yet your wondrous weighty words
constraines my heart to break.
Think not mine own, alas think not,
that I do from you go
For any falt I find in you
accuse your self not so.
And from the heavens I pray the lord
to let his vengeance fall
on me, if I conceive in you,
mistrust or falt at all.
and eke the hungry earth unfold
her discontented Iawe
and swallow me, even yet a live
into her mighty mawe,
And all the plagues that ever were
on earth, or ever shall
let light on me, I ask not one
but I demand them all:
If I do not account of you
as much as ere I did,
and that your love within my heart,
in wonted wise is hid.
again you never did the thing,
but pleased my desire,
and eke the sparks of love in me,
are grown to perfect fire
This do a spark, thus fervently,
because you should have trust,
That I am youres not to change,
until I turn to dust.
Nor then: if it be possible
the dead to have his will
I mean to false my faith at all,
but to be youres still
But now, the prince has need of men,
and so it does befall,
That Fortune sore against my will,
a captain does me call.
You know good wife as well as I,
the consequents of ill,
That daily does beride on those,
which either dare or will,
Their princes hestes to leave undone,
to satisfye their mind,
All men may see they reap the sour
that seek such sweet to find.
Then since to sue it booteth not,
nor will come to avail,
and to resist does hinder much,
and nothing does prevail.
Consent that I my duty show,
in best wise that I can,
Since that my princes pleasure is,
to place my like a man.
My carcas may the prince command,
my heart is youres still,
Your heart again the emptye place,
within my breast does fill.
Then since it is but for a space
that we shall thus depart,
And that we have with fixed faith,
ychaunged heart for heart:
Content you hear to stay awhile,
with manly heart possessed,
and I with youres in the field
will shift and do my best.
Think how good Fortune has of late,
shewde us her favor bright,
Perchance she means to honor us
by guyding me a right.
Often have we seen as great a show
of battle as is this,
where frindship has prevented Mars,
and wrought the princes bliss.
Ne does Bellona always strike,
whereas she list to lowre,
But often geues them the sweet,
to whom she shows the sour,
And often the wight that she does warn,
to warlike weary pain,
she does ere long give golden rest,
and eke aboundaunt gain.
Also in field has many one,
as far unlike as I
God honor in a month or two,
and kept it till he dye.
And therefore whether war pursue
or peace toward us be pressed,
grant your goodwill that I may be
as forward as the rest.
You have (then quod the gentle wife,
discourst your matter well,
yet ner the less my grief is such
as not my tongue can tell.
But since there is no remedy,
as reason you do show,
To him, I cannot keep at home,
I must give leave to go.
And I the wofulst wretch alive
must with Penelope
keep in my restles bed alack
whiles you do pass the sea.
And since you say you leave with me
your heart, and mine again
do take with you: it must then be
one stroke between us twain.
Therefore as love between us is
and so continue shall
Let neither happy luck nor chance,
nor ill to you befall.
Nor other fortune what it be,
that happens to your hand,
but by your letters I your wife,
the same may understand.
By promise he does grant to her
her sorrowful request
and of his mind in sober talk
declares to her the rest.
And afterward he does provide
to make his ensign, silk,
The half whereof as red as blood
the rest as white as milk.
Which ended once with such devise,
as all men might it know:
There under began he muster then,
his solgers on a row.
His old lewetenaunt expert was
his sargaunt and the rest:
And who did well, he for his time
was equal with the best.
His muster book was furnished,
his clarke does what he can,
He knows not the Capteins guyle
he wants not a man.
His number full, his furniture
prepared for the nones,
They all imbarkt, do take the sea
the war groth on a tones.
His wife, amongs a hugy sort
which this gay sight did glad
beheld the same even with the heart
that wailing Dido had,
when false Eneas did her leave
at Carthage in her bed,
whiles he the falsest man a live,
the town and city fled.
And so they take their loathsome leave
as woeful Troylus did,
with wailing words and tears enough
when Crossed from her rid.
And whiles they cannot speak for woe,
and sorrow of the heart,
The anchor weyde, the ship aflote,
they kis and so depart.
The sailors do hoyse up the sails,
a right forwynd does blow,
The main, the top, the myssen, and
the sprite sail all arrowe.
The soulgers do the netting deck,
the Pilot takes in hand,
the rother, and an other soundes
to escape both rock and sand.
The Bark is in her princely pride,
her ordnaunce do discharge,
Their force wherein discried is,
their puissaunce set at large.
All men are merry in the ship,
each man him self does prove:
But he alone who cannot chose,
but think upon his love.
And she again good soul does stand
upon a mountain hie,
Still viewing the unhappy Bark,
so long as she might spy,
The hull, the mast, the top, the sail,
or any part at all,
and then does this upon her knees
behold the skies and call.
O Thou the everliving god,
do speed the course a right,
of yonder bark, and do the men
from drowning danger quyght.
And as thou art a god I know
most constant true and just,
Do help my love as I alone
in the do put my trust.
Let Neptune stay the sourging Seas,
Let Eolus not blow,
Nor grant that they conioynctly do
their force or rigor show.
Nor yet that any ennemy
with them do fight or strive,
Before they in their wished port,
do luckely arryue.
With pensive thoughts she rises thus
and leaves her prayer so
and she the wofulst wight alive
unto her home does go.
Where when she commes and mysseth him
whom she does most desire,
Then weping does she wail her chance,
then puts she of her tire
and with the worst she may find out
her comely corpse is cladde,
And never did she mourn so sore,
but now she is as sad.
She spends thus the doleful day,
the night coms on a pace,
She goth to bed, and of her spouse
fyndes there the empty place.
Her stomach straight appaleth so
such sobbes from her do starte,
As with her tears, to bleare her eyes
and seem to rent her heart
she calls to her memory
her happy time of late
The thought whearof does so much more
augment her heuie fate.
Not Father can nor Mother may
appease the daughters grief
Nor friend can comfort her distress
her sorrow was so reefe.
Hear gins she now to curse the man
that she does love so well
Untrue (she says) thou art alas,
why do thou thus rebel,
Against the laws of God? by which
tho did auowe to me,
Forever: not so short a space
my constant spouse to be.
And will thou leave thie lady thus
and will thou from me go
And will thou now absent thie self
and will thou leave me so
And can thou now lie from the bed
that thou did so desire
And can thou wourke my woe this wise
and prove thie self a liar
And dare thou false thie fixed faith
and thine affied trust
And dare thou now, thou have obteynd
thus prove thie self unjust.
In faith I thought the Sea should first
by waters want be dry
And that the soon should eke forswere
the hie and hugie sky:
Or that an other Phaeton
should serve in Phoebus torn
And that the fyery footed horse
both sea and shore should bourne:
Before thou woldst without a cause
with me thie wife be wroth,
Or cruelly have left me so
and so have broke thie troth.
In faith sins that it is in dead
and I to true it try
I will no more believe thie wourdes
before the day I die.
Nor shall thie fawning letters help
thie treason to excuse
whereof thie present absence does
thie loialtie accuse.
Well well thou show now thie kind
thy doings do declare
that only men in woing time
do flatter and speak fair
Thus in her great extremytie
each Ioynct in her did shake
And faynctnes made her stay a while
and then again she spoke.
What am I warth and cruel wretch
or brutish beast by kind?
Thus with my true and constant love,
soch raging, faltes to find.
Who for him self or his defense
in absens cannot speak,
Why do thou then, oh wilful wench
thie radge and anger break
On him that is thie husband and
thie love and only fire
Allotted by the living lord
even to thie hearts desire
Was he not pressed by princes power
full loath he was to go
Oh cruel carle how can thou then
in absence blame him so
Did not his sobbes his sightes, his tears,
that trickled down his eye
His wayling voice, his gryping grief
his doulfull noise and cry
Which did (against his will) break forth
when he did hence depart
Express unto the (oh thou beast)
his true and constant heart?
Coldst thou at any time at all
conceive with in thie mind
But all soch greefes as gripte thie heart
like place in his did find?
Unjust thou art, (oh folish girl)
unfaithful and untrue,
Vnwourthie art thou of the man:
Now give thy heart to rewe.
That thus did sclaunder thie true love
so sore without a cause,
How can thou crave the aid of love
a rebel to her laws.
Ah cruel wretch that shewst thie self
vnwourthie breath or life
Would God thou had the murderer
or else the cruel knife.
That well might hear revenge by right
thie lover and his truth
And for thie skilles sclaunder sake
might bring thie self to ruthe
Thus whiles the lady languyshed
his former talk and sin
against her lord, her mother does
to see her child come in
Whom she does find so ruthfully
with tears beweped so:
As, whear she might return again
or to her daughter go,
she stands in doubt: her heart does fail
the tears, break from her eyes
she kepes in covert all her cares
and to her daughter cries
What daughter? what does mean this grefe?
what is it wourkes thie pain?
Is all thie pleasure so sone past?
is care krept back again?
Alas, shall never this mine age,
nor these my horie hears.
Nor these my mystie eyes, behold
the but bewept with tears?
Good daughter guide thie self awhile
do not torment the so:
Thie love does love the passing well
let folish fancies goo.
Who in the world has God enricht
with fortune or with fate
Somoch as thou? to whom is linkt
a man of soch estate
As neither storm nor worldly woo
no flame nor yet no thondre
No sea, no flud, nor other let
from the can keep a sondre.
A lengre time, then princes cause
alone does keep him back
Yet nay the less his heart is thine
though thou his boddie lack
Then homewarde come with me, mine own
reject thy careful mind
And as I pleasure in the much
some comfort in me find.
My soon, thy spouse, that faithful man
the fates will guide by right
Ere long, he will send us good news
his hand begins to wright
What cause have thou to morn at all
sins that thy lord is well
His voyage past, his chance is good
soch will his letters tell.
Oh, blame me not, good mother, said
to her, her daughter dear
If I the loss of soch a spouse
so greatly dread and fear
For neither has the Gretian dames
nor Troyan ladies found
Nor yet the hungry earth her self
nor yet the cloddie ground
Received, so just and true a man
as I have for my part
Whose truth (alas) so tried is
as now does rent my heart.
I sit alone, my thinks the seas
are grown in such a rage
By Eolus his whorling blastes
whose rigor will not swage
As he with sourgies heaued to heaven
the ship does straightway fall
The wallowes then do hide the bark
the water drowns them all.
Then straight I see him in his arm
how strongly he does fight
Hear has he slain a gentilman
thear has he killed a knight.
This crown by him ycracked is
that boddie does he part,
Then coms a traitor at his back
and thrustes him to the heart.
Should not these things increase my care?
Should not mine eyes that spy,
My husband slain before my face,
provoke my heart to die?
Alas pooer wench the mother said
alas poor lover to:
Thie fancy wills, but reason not
comaundes, the thus to do.
If every thing thou can conceive
in head, does work thee grief
Then thrice so many hedes again
can bring thee no relief.
Come come, come come, come home with me
come to thy fathers house
Come glad thie mothers heavy heart
Till tidinges of thie spouse,
Shall joy again thie ioyles sprites,
and give the quiet life
That coldst not yet this twelve months space
avoid invented strife,
Now reason wourkes and nature to
the daughter does comaunde,
In this a thing so requysite
tobey the dames demand
They homewarde bend to fathers house
the time they would begile
Which princes cause, and mortal war,
do keep him on exile.
Naught wants hear that mirth may make
the daughter has her will,
But always does the husbands want
the daughters playnct fulfill.
So as no joy nor joyful thing
but does augement her care
And somoch more because she will
her corsey not declare.
Whiles in this great perplexity
this young and tender wight
bewayles her husbands absence thus
as she may do aright:
The noble man the lover true,
is tossed upon the seas,
Now at the will of Eolus,
and then as Neptune please.
At last with weary course and pain,
this weather beaten Bark,
does of the haven desiered so,
epsy a certain mark,
Now mates the master cries a pace,
good news to every man,
Haw Jack thou scuruy lowsy boy
go tap and fill the can.
Be merry masters drink a pace,
now make we all good sport,
our voyage almost ended is,
I see the wyshed port.
Wherein by force we mean to land,
as we have done the like,
by help of god, and by the force
of bended bow and pyke.
Then joy each man within the ship,
their sport is for a king,
and hey, how, ioly rombelowe,
the sailors all do sing.
Here might you see what solgers seek
and how they toss and toil,
on sea, a shore, and every where,
to come to saque and spoil.
But he alas alone good man
whose mind does bring to sight
his mylde and true companyon,
his comfort and delight:
In secret place does stay a while,
and wypes his flowing eye,
Till often wiping of the same
does all the moyster dry
Then secretly he sends fourth
a groan unto the skies
Which from his faithful heart fourthwith
unto his ladies flies.
And then he shows him self abroad
right pewsaunt on the deck
And says unto his solgers all
obedyent at a beck
My mates my friends, my brethern dear
my fellows all in field
Next God my prince, and wife you are
to whom my heart I yield
Yen is the place you see it well
Whear we must prove by strife
How most toppresse our enemy
how least to harm our life.
I am your own assuredly
both head both heart, and hand
I crave of you but willing hearts
by me at need to stand
Which if I find I swear to you
that none of you shall lake
Whiles I have land or liuelihod
or clothing to my bak.
These wourdes ones past, they swear to him
if he had cause to try:
He should perceive, not one, but all,
with him would live and die.
Glad was the captain of soch men
glad was the solgers eke
The haven to enter in best wies
they all a means do seek
The ennemy does show his face
like to the forest boar
the cannon and the culuer shot
about their ears do roar.
The skirmish enters very hot,
yet does the bark prevail
and in they go not losing ought,
but tearing of their sail:
Wherewith they are in quietness,
the entering brunt is past
and they into their wished port
are now arrived at last,
The mariners that babred sore
with strained voices cries,
Saint George, Saint George to borough and
they so do pearse the skies.
The enemies perceive therewith,
their purpose they had lost,
They find that scantly will their gain
bear half their toil and cost.
and then they leave their rigor since
they can no more prevail,
and do forthink the time they spent
which came to none avail.
Well, night groes on a pace, and they
that can find out their nest,
Forgetting toil, with merry mynds
do give them selves to rest.
The worthy captain yet thinks on
his fair, and famous wife:
Which is his gods and to him,
much sweter then his life.
Now takes he paper in his hand,
to wright that he does think:
Which reddy is and pen also,
but has no whit of ynke.
Then with a quill he makes him
a Launcet very fine:
and with a phillip pricks his thombe
the point is made so kine,
wherout does spring the bloddy drops
so fast as he can wright,
and serves his fyled pen to print,
that could his head indight.
Theffect whereof ensues hear:
my wits I will assaye,
His princely proase, in this rude verse
to tell you as I may.
Mine own, to you your own does hear,
his hasty letters send,
Least scilence should accuse his troth
and so he might offend.
Of paper had I store enough,
my pens did eke abound,
But to express my state to you,
no drop of ynke was found.
But that could not my faith a whit
nor promise from you stay,
For I to show my dewty, did
find out a another way.
And cause I knew my letters would
provoke you some delight,
See here my shift which only was
with blood the same to wright.
I left your sonnye sight with tears,
and Neptunes realm possessed,
where till we came to happy haven,
we felt but little rest.
And when we saw the port or place.
wherein discharge we must,
In despite of the enemy
therein our bark we thrust,
And though by force of fighting foes,
and turmoyle we were tossed:
The lord be praisd, we gat the haven,
and yet no man we lost.
And other news have I not now,
but that I would hear tell,
That you my love be still in health,
then must I needs do well.
wherein I pray you satisfye
my hungry mind and heart,
and letters still, for letters shall
my writting hand reuart.
Farewell my heart, fare well my life,
fare well mine only make,
Though rude my letters be, yet do
accept them for my sake.
Commend me to your parents both,
commend me to your frindes,
Comend me to your self again,
and thus my letter ends.
This letter to a messenger
he did deliver straight,
That did convey the same to her,
he made it of such weight,
Which when she saw, the bobbling blood
wrapped warm within her breast,
Her teeth did cut the string in twain,
she could not be in rest,
Until she saw theffect and did
the letters over read,
Then was her mind well quyeted,
then was she glad in dead,
Then to her mother stepped she up,
with wild and staring look,
For joy she could not speak a word,
but took to her the book.
At last, lo hear quod she madame,
se what my love does wright,
to me, to you, and to my Sire,
that grave and aunshent knight.
It gladdeth me I promise you
more then my tongue can tell,
Now mother be we merry all,
my husband is so well.
For now my joys are permanent
my cares are voyded quyt,
Oh happy hand, and honest heart,
that can such letters write.
Alas, alas, yet said she then,
these letters do not show,
where he be slain, since he them writ,
how might I do to know.
Then spoke the witty mother thus
and aunswerd her again,
I think no comfort comes to the,
but does renew thy pain.
What dotest thou oh foolish girl,
or art thou worse then mad?
Does every thing discomfort thee,
that ought to make the glad?
Thy husband is in perfect health
his letters so does show,
These phancies then before to late,
seek from your mind to throw.
and wright to him right cherefully,
let him not see you sad,
This shall in trouble comfort him,
and this shall make you glad.
What take to you, your pen and ynke,
and satisfye his mind,
He wrytt to you his letters first,
let him your answer find.
The daughter therewith did relent
her former foolish part:
And writ to him to this effect
even from her piersed heart.
Thou art mine own thou say mine own,
and I am thine again:
Oh cruel sea, how can thou cut
a boddy thus in twain.
Great have I had to hear of thee,
thy letters did me good,
Yet have thou done some wrong to me,
to write them with thy blood.
No dewty do thou owe to me,
I am thy servant pressed,
should not my heart serve the because
I find thou love me best?
I sorrow that my sight did cause
the to depart with tears,
and Neptune for his churlishnes,
a cankerd carle appears.
And if I had the power that has
the mighty Jove above.
He should repent thoffence he has
done unto the my love.
For I do love the passing well,
and will do during life,
which promise may compare with hers
that was Vlixes wife.
And if I break the same Oh lord,
then let thy vengeans fall
on me, and every plague that is,
bestow them on me all.
But yet how could thou, when thou sawst
the port in warlike case,
possessed with a woman's heart,
give charge to such a place.
Thou did me wrong to venture so,
yet may I not the blame:
For better is to venture life
then end with Cowherd shame.
and I am bound to thank the that
no sooner camst to rest,
but unto me thine own thou did
discloase thy secret breast.
I am in health and have no cause
now thou art well to morn,
Save that I think thine absence long:
and crave thy quick return.
Till then, I pray the lord defend,
thy most desired life,
and send thy happy presence once
unto thy loving wife.
Thus has your own more then her own
at large her mind expressed,
and sendes you thanks from parents and
from kindred and the rest.
Farewell my heart, my strength my power,
my comfort and my trust,
whose lover whiles I live I am,
and after death I must.
The messenger that brought the bill,
bears answer now again,
and frankly is contented for
his travail and his pain.
No sooner comes he to the place,
or piece where battle lies,
But straight this worthy gentleman
the messenger espies,
upon the rampires of the wall,
with pike in hand most stout,
and who that presses to come in,
he and his men keep out.
Now here he slaith a scaling man,
now theare he geues a stroke,
Now this man's neck, now that man's leg,
is by his puysaunce broke
And as in this extremity
he deals blow by blow
whereby the stoutest enemy
his force and puesaunce know.
So since he wrote the letter last,
so stout he was in fight,
as just desert for virtues sake,
has dubbed him a knight.
His ensign that of late was gaye
the colors fresh and new,
now part is torn, and part is burnt,
it looks of other hew.
And he that trick and trymly went,
they wot that know the trade,
his armor burst, his coats are torn,
and he a warrior made.
Well, nothing yet remains so long,
but ends at the last,
So night comes on, they cannot see,
the battry, ends in have,
The trompets sound, on either side,
they looked for retreat,
Some wipe their faces sprent with blood,
and other some with sweet
Here one dismembered of his leg,
for Surgens help does cry,
Here one would have his paunch sowde up
here dead some other lie.
Now dromes strike up and gin to call
each solgers to his band,
Now both to know their loss and gain,
each captain takes in hand.
Now though this champions service was
right equal with the best.
His gain is great, yet was his loss
as little as the least.
Whiles thus he stood, in Fortunes grace
much more then other did
He thought upon his secret friend
which in his heart lay hid.
And wished of all the gods of love,
that he could think or name,
that they would by their deities
some Ingin for him frame:
Whereby he might when son went down
with his sweet heart devise,
and be again upon his charge
ere Phoebus list to rise.
Thus wavering thoughts possessed his brain
his passhons were at strife,
whiles that the long desired man,
brought letters from his wife.
The sight whereof made him fourthwith,
more joyful and more glad
Then if he half the Regiment
of fair Europa had.
He read his lovers passions
her constancy he spies
The joy whereof did cause his tears
to trickle from his eyes
What should I say in blisfulnes,
he does account him than
much more, and far beyond the state
of any wedded man.
Now does he please the messenger
and then he does resort
unto the meriest company
he fyndeth in the forte.
Now mournig wedes are cast away
he joys in musikes song:
which erst in heavy state of mind,
had languished full long.
Of pleasant matters he does give
his conning hand to wright,
Such as to her his learned hedde,
most gladly does endyte.
He leaves of his painted proase,
he wrighteth now in verse,
Such as my skilles pen pretends
verbatim to rehearse.
Take from thy husbands happy hand,
my true and loving wife,
The joyful tydinges which report
the end of absent strife.
And harken to thy lot whereby
the marshall gods prefarre,
the worship and the worthy fame
which I have won by war.
For never came there chance at all
that brought me to unrest,
but grew from good to better still,
and ended with the best.
Oh heavenly happy fate and time,
wherein I first was made
a man of war, a solgers guide
the princes foo to fade.
For never did I yet in arms
encounter wight at all,
But either yielded to my grace,
or took his fatal fall.
Wherefore my darling dear, and Iem,
some men do judge by right,
That thou art made a Lady, and
that I am made a knight.
and I my self will come to the
and that ere many days
A parle has concluded peace
to god give all the praise.
And I shall once again, my self
my loving wife possess:
and thou thy spouse, my lamp of life
with equal joy and bles.
And we that found our selfs agreeud
with parting pains of late,
with lucky lot ere long time pas
shall mete with merry fate.
My heart till then take thou and hand,
my senses all and some,
and couch them where thou thinks it mete
until my self do come
whereof there shall be no delay
(if death my life not tryp)
a longer time or further space,
then with the foremost ship.
Till then content thy careful mind
till then think on me to:
as I of thee my lot alone
have done and still will do.
Fare well mine own, fare well oh sweet
my comfort and my joy,
Mine aid, my helper, and my hope
my succor in anoye.
Take pains no more, do hold thy hand
enforce not the to wright,
for ere thy letters can reuert
my self will be in sight.
And let my letters to thy frindes
my hearty thanks allude,
But I to the do give as much,
and so I do conclude.
With flying foot these tidings came
unto this Ladies sight,
who never erst did feel like joy
like comfort nor delight.
For not the thing upon the earth
that kind has wrought with molde,
Or moyned is beneath the ground
no not the fynest gold
No pearl, no Iem, nor iuelles ritche
so much could glad this wife,
as did the letters which resounde
the husbands health and life.
For with the sodeine sight thereof,
the crystal streams did flow
even from her yuery eyes, and heart
and thence in order show
The secrets which she sought to hyde
amidst her modest mind,
The like whereof, would christ each man
might from his wedlock find.
But since it is a thing as rare
as Phoenix is, to see,
such women in this world to live,
let her alone for me.
And speak we of the parents joy
that do joy in the man
as much as any father may,
or any mother can.
And how that they preparaunce make
against the knights return,
and how they incence and perfumes
in every corner bourne.
And how the wedding bed is made,
and else to make it short
There wants naught but him alone
whom they would have resort.
Alas how often would the wife
go view and see the skies,
and make the craysed clouds of heaven
with every wynd that flies.
Alas how often looks she up,
to steples and to faynes,
how often does she mark the driftes
of moysty mysts and raynes.
And all to view the wyndes that would
send home to her again
the man that she desired most
whose want was all her pain.
Alas how long in vain she looked
for that that would not be,
For that again, the gods had vowde
her eyes should never see.
Oh dismoll day, oh dampened dome
so fast that followst on,
So soon as were the letters sent,
and was the bearer gone:
Who may discloase the dreadful darte
without haboundant tears?
Or who not drownde in brackish floddes
may tend to it his ears
My heart does fail, my senses shake,
my hear upright do stand,
and eke to wright the same, my pen
does queuer in my hand.
Oh that when first I did pretend
this dreadful dome to wright,
My brain had been, so dull as not
a word it could endight
Or else that all the fayry gods,
which Poets feign have skill,
had lept at large, and set their hands
to aid my forward will.
and then no doubt but tears ynow
and wayling words would be
To mourn the mortal chance alas,
which shall not stay for me.
No sooner were, the letters gone,
which you have hard he sent
unto his love, nor sooner was
the bearer that way bent:
Then was an accusacion
against the knight ymade
by envy and by traitors gylte
his worship to enuade.
and that in such a shameful sort
as would amaze each ear,
The fond and false affirmed tale
with heavy heart to hear.
Which heard the knight could crave no less
but that in his behoof,
his foe that had accusde him theare
might thereof bring some proof.
And did allege by lawful rule
before the Piers that sat,
and also by dame natures law,
which did affirm it flat,
That heinous was thoffence of him
that should his life assail,
with lesinges false which god forbid
should therein ought prevail.
And thereof claymd again some proof
before his face to hear,
that could (as he knew well none could)
him thereof witness bear.
The Judges deemd this just demand
good reason in their sight,
But when the prince a party is,
how hard is then to quight
The Lamb, that does the wolf pursue
that seeks only blood,
as is the knight sought here (god wot)
by him that nere did good.
Who said for answer what is he
that treason does pretend?
Or else against his princes laws
him self by force does bend?
That will make privy any wight
unto his wicked way?
Except to such from whom he hopes
of succor and of stay.
But this I say and eke will swear
and will by combat try,
that he to prince a traitor is
and ought for treason dye.
And on this proof I offer hear
my gauntlet in the field,
and have no doubt before you all,
to force the traitor yield.
And this I think be proof enough
for Mars demaundes no more
wherefore I do accuse him still
a traitor as before.
Then said the knight unto his foo
untrue, thou art unjust.
and tomuche on thy manhood dust
put thine affied trust.
And first unto my Piers I speak,
no ly my tongue shall tell:
For if I do, I p^^y the lord
my soul may burn in hell.
So clear I am from traitors gylte
or damage of my prince:
as is the child this night brought fourth,
and scarce has sucked since.
If dead, if word, if thought at all
to such effect I put,
From joys in earth, and bliss in heaven
good lord my body cut.
But false thou falsely do accuse
my troth, and I will try,
thy combat (Charle) hear is my glove
and I do the defye.
And in the living lord my god
I have affied trust,
the and thy malice to subdue
in this my quarrel just.
The plaint and answer both is hard,
alleged by these twain,
and eke the dreadful blooddy oath
before the Judge is taken,
In which they both do stoutly swear
by god that is of might,
His oath is true (but yet olorde)
thou know which is right.
No thing remains but to appoint
the bloddy battles day,
and eke the place wherein to fight
whereon the judges stay,
At last the judgment is given up,
and only four days taken,
wherein the dreadful darte of death,
is tried between these twain.
In which time they do seek which way
with corrage them to arm.
and eke do practice fence, thereby
to work their foe more harm.
And in such fight the manner is,
they know that see the same,
Two have a man of either side,
which frenchmen fathers name,
And are for manhood chosen out
and equal frindes they be,
whose office is, between the foes
an equal match to see,
That not the one in armor clad
the other naked sail
Nor yet in odds of edge, or length
their weapons do prevail.
But all their carke and travail is,
and subteltie to seek,
That equal be the match and that
they both be armd alike.
Such two there are appointed hear
and men in deed they be
as apt to take such thing in hand
as ever man did see
So neat to proyne the place wherein
this battle must be tried,
So skillful eke the plot to choose,
the wethers to deuyde.
That who so saw, their perfectnes
would theirein take delight
as much as solgers wont to do,
to see such combat fight.
The day draws on, the one in red
as fierce as forest bore,
comes in, to challenge blameles blood
as he has done before
and at his back his father stands
as I before discride,
and ioinctly both, the knights repair,
and stay they do abide.
Who with his battle father comes,
his foe theare to despite,
and eke to show his giltles heart,
is clothed all in white.
The boustrous battle here begins
their strokes are passing sore,
The odds of men, the lokers on
do very much deplore,
For why? the one a Ruffyn old
in whom no drop of blood
there ever was: that did enforce
or move him unto good:
The other was a famous man,
though young a worthy knight,
Such one as did the bloddy man
for virtue sake dispight.
Oh lord with cruel strokes how often
do they encounter hear?
how roundly does the one lay on
that does the other bear?
How many do with weping eyes
as they may do full well,
Lament the churlish chance alas,
that theare that day befell:
And eke bewail the harmfull hap
of those that here did try,
their manhod and their mighty force,
whereof the one must dye.
How were the hearts of some apalde,
how do some other quake,
to see the bluddy blows were given
which only death must slake.
And those that loeud their prince and realm
had hear no power to chose
But to bewail the deaths of those
the Realm was like to lose.
Alas when blood on either side,
had blinded so the face
of those did fight, as by their piers
they parted were a space,
And proyned were as is the guise,
buf to renew their breath,
how sharply does the one again
pursue the others death?
Oh cruel fight thus held, and sharp
whose stripes are dealt so sore,
as still the wished victory
hanges doubtful more and more.
Unhappy thrusts that then were thrown
and sore did hurt the knight,
But yet the traitors harm was such
as he no more could fight.
Then prostrate lying in the ground,
thus to the knight he spoke,
Not of desert but of despite
at first this quarrel brake.
Wherefore before this company
I do the mercy cry,
and claim the cler, and grant my self
most worthy for to dye.
Oh lord the thundering noys that flewe,
with skriches shrill and hye,
From mouths of men, to him in heaven
that guydes the starry sky.
And gave him thanks, that he had causde
the truth thus to be known,
and that the guylty man was by
the guyltles, overthrown
Wherewith the knight forgave the falte,
yet paid to him his dew,
and with his sword he thrust him in
and so the traitor slew.
Amazd I am here to express
the second cry and shute
that joy did make to pass the mouths
of all the famous rowte,
That looked on and praised god
that he was rid from blame,
whose lust desert did claim by right
to be the child of fame.
Whose golden trump did sound full far,
how did the knight him try,
and how he causde the traitor so,
by puissaunt arm to die.
It comes to the Ladies ear,
what act her knight had done,
how that in fight he slew his foe,
and kept his honor wone.
Which wrought in her and all her friends
such perfect joy and bless,
as now they thought them selves cut of
from care and heaviness.
For fame not yet had spread abroad
the knights most cruel wound,
nor how in chair he was brought home,
nor how he ganne to swound,
Nor how that present night alas
that famous man did dye,
Nor how his solgers and his frindes
like children roar and cry:
Nor how he is brought to the church
with mourning of the dromes,
Nor how the knight is brought to grave
with mighty shot of gonnes.
Nor how his ensign trayled is
with sorrow on the ground,
Nor how nothing but sobbes and tears
in all the town is found.
This rests dead, they joy a pace,
they shoot at other mark,
until the coming home (alas)
of the unhappy bark.
Then is this tidinges told at large,
to soon the lady hears,
Her heavy heart noulde let her speak
nor could she shed her tears:
But straight she casted up her sight
unto the clowdy sky,
She set a groan which rent her heart,
and therwithall did cry,
unto that god from whom does glyde,
the golden glistring son,
From sight of whom no wight at all
has power him self to shonne.
And said, oh mighty king of gods
oh thou that lieust for ay,
Impute it not to me for sin,
that love does force me say,
Did thou not give to me a man
that nature did adorn
with gifts of grace, that did excel
the rest that ere were borne?
The secret substance of the soul
in him did eke habounde
And nothing but thy fear and grace,
within that man was found,
And that I should the virtues touch
which to the body long,
Did thou not send him health olorde
and maedst his body strong.
And deckst him with each honor that
this world might to him yield,
and sentst him worship, which he won
by stretched arm in field.
How could thou then in fragrant youth
amidst his honor got,
By traitors hand let him be slain,
whom could no Treason spot?
Ah, that I wretched wight have cause
with the thus to dispute,
whom all the world, no saint nor devil
is hable to confute.
What? should I curse my fate oh lord?
or rather crave to dye,
Or should I piers the mighty heavens
with hye and hugye cry,
Since that my cursed chance is such
as neither can I have
my love alive, nor yet my self
be buried in his grave
Well, well, oh lord remyt my sins
even through thy mercy most
wherewith she stretched fourth her arms
and yielded up the ghost.
Much strogling was but none avail
her senses all were gone
Her lymbes were stiff, her body straight
as cold as marble stone.
Thamased mother saw this chance,
and ruthfully she spoke
To this effect did I poor soul
all this preparaunce make.
Then let the world and those that live
if aught be left, take all,
and for thy mercyes sake good lord,
send me my fattall fall.
Let me not live, and lead my life
a barren wife in age,
Nor yet to ronn the rufull race
of rigours that do rage
But since thou have in soddeine sort
bereft me of my son,
And of my daughter to, whose lives
had yet long race to run,
And that I can, nor may not ask
their lives again to have
Grant at the least that I may be
a fellow in her grave.
And so our boddyes may again
in coffyn jointly lie,
That like as she by me did live,
so I by her may dye.
Herewith her face did wax full pale,
her body began to faint,
and easy was, god knows to spy
how death could her attaint.
She shriked out, and said oh death,
I feel thy force begins
Oh god, for Christ's sake do grant
forgeunes of my sins.
Wherewith she did give up the ghost,
as did her child before,
her fatal threde was shride in twain
and she could live no more.
For neither could their force nor might
no bowing down nor pain
revoke her trance, nor bring to her
her lothed life again.
The father saw, that he had lost
his daughter son and wife,
Would feign have dyed, but yet does last
his heavy hated life.
The servants and the neighbors all
and many men unknown,
do taste the doleful heaviness,
that these their deaths have sown.
In aunshent howshold tomb the dame
and child Sepulture have,
and many conning Epitaphs
is set upon their grave.
And those that knew them every one
and sees the siers unrest,
Do judge of both, the wemens hap
in sorrow was the lest.
God grant him quiet life to live
his cares away to pluck,
God send each love so true a heart,
yet lord some better luck.
Finis.
