His Majesty's Answer to a Message sent to Him by the House of Commons,
concerning Licenses granted by Him to persons to go into Ireland.
HIs Majesty has seen and considered the Message presented to Him by the Lord
Compton and Master Baynton, the 19th of March, 1641. at York, Touching such
persons as have been Licensed by his Majesty to pass into Ireland.

Though He will not insist upon what little Reason they had to suspect that
some ill-affected persons had passed into Ireland, under color of His
Majesty's License (Inferences being slender Proofs to ground belief upon) yet
He must needs avow, That for any thing that is yet Declared, He cannot see any
ground why Master Pym should so bouldly affirm before both Houses of
Parliament, That since the stop upon the Ports by both Houses against all Irish
Papists, many of the chief Commanders now in the head of the Rebels, have been
suffered to pass by his Majesty's immediate Warrant; For as yet there is not
any particular person named that is now so much as in Rebellion (much less in
the head of the Rebels) to whom His Majesty has given License;

And therefore according to His Majesty's Reply upon that Subject, His Majesty
expects, That His House of Commons publish such a Declaration, whereby this
mistaking may be cleared, That so all the World may see His Majesty's Caution
in giving of Passes; and likewise, That His Ministers have not abused His
Majesty's Trust, by any surreptitious Warrants.

And lastly, His Majesty expects, That henceforth there be more Wariness
used, before such public Aspersions be laid, unless the Grounds be beforehand
better warranted by sufficient Proofs.

Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill. 1641.
