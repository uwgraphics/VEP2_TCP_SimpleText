The Cavaliers DIURNALL written by Adventure, Most perfectly collected
(peradventure) For any man's Reading, that will Venture.

GReat Matters and Businesses of State being obscured from mine eyes, kept from
mine ears, and hid from my understanding and knowledge, by which means I am
incapable of all such things as I am ignorant of, which makes me unwilling to
follow the fashion of the Writers of these Weekly times, either to wander in a
wit-wooll-gathering way of Newes-catching every day abroad, or to study the
Art of making Intelligences at home; therefore such Mercuriall Informations
which I relate, I do verily believe the Readers may believe (if they will:)
Howsoever, I now not yet much out of the common Road of our perpetual
Diurnall-Mongers; for (as they have showed me the way) a long tedious Preamble
is a great help to fill and stuff out a short sheet of Paper: for which
Causes aforesaid, I will be as Moderate in my Intelligence, as Perfect in my
Occurrences, and as True in my Diurnall, according to that Moderation,
Perfection, and Truth, which appertains to this following Narration.

THis day the best and good News from his Majesty is, that he is in good
health (which God continue) yet he is not well pleased with the Troubles and
Perturbations of his People and Kingdoms: It is to be unfainedly desired of
all good and true Christians, English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, French, or any
loyall-hearted subject whatsoever, that there were (or may be) a Right
Understanding, Accommodation, and true Reconciliation betwixt his Majesty and
the High Court of Parliament. It is thought, that his Majesty's next Remove
will be from Holmby; but when, or to which of his Houses, is to me unknown:
His poor servants do not care how near, or how soon his Majesty comes; I
mean, many who are aged, and in extreme want, who have not any means of
subsistence; such as have, according to their Oaths and Duties, attended on
his Majesty's Person; and such, indeed, as never bare Arms in these unnatural
Distractions; such as are Friendlesse, Moneylesse, Harbourlesse, and
Helpelesse; and such as may be easily known by their bare Attire and thin
Faces.

It was certified, that this day there were diverse people scattered in most
parts of his Majesty's Dominions, who do detest the name of Peace, but da^e
not look War in the face: it is thought meet to put all such in the front of
an Army, that by the adventurous brunt and shock of a Battle their Valors
may be tried. It is expected, that Nabal has more wit then foolishly to ask,
who is David? Nor will Shimei bark so loud as he did once, and too often;
Libertinisme shall no more be nick-nam'd, and called Christian Liberty; Want
and Wantonness do seldom harbor in any one person: but it is concluded,
that Detraction and Sedition are not so inseparable, but that the one treads
upon the others heels.

News came, that Abington Fair was this year on their Weekly Market Day,
Monday, the eighth of March; where (amongst many rich Commodities, of Rattles,
Hobby-horses, Knights and Kings of Gingerbread, and such Rarities of Art and
Nature) there were Pamphlets of small price and less worth; some Reverend
Ballads, with some Grave Volumes of Astronomica^l Predictions, such as Erra
Pater, Adam Fowle-weather, and such like. There was one (with the rest) a
namelesse Book and Author, which reported str^nge things, past, present, and
to come: but as past things are gone, because we have little hold-fast of any
thing good for the present, I present you with the future. The said Book
speaks of an ancient woman of Banbury, named Good-Wife Quiet, the daughter of
a Woollen-Baker in Coventry-Blue, at the Sign of the three Snow-balls in warm
Water: This woman was said to have a Wooden Stone at her Door, and a great
Iron Peare-Tree in her Backside; by these strange Marks and Signs she was
known: Her Prophesies and Predictions foretold, That Peace would bring
Plenty; That Hypocrites are Dissemblers; That Tyrants want Mercy; That
Treachery shall wrong Truth; That one Thief shall hang another; That Dotage
shall be turned back, and transformed to Nonage; That mean men shall be
changed into men of Means, and that men of Means shall be strangely
metamorphosed into mean men; That honest plainedealing shall be in such
plentiful abundance, that it shall go a begging up and down the Streets,
and Charity be so cold, that she would be glad to be hanged in a Chimney
Cornor; That Milk should not be as dear as Muscadine; and that by Geographie
and Geometry it might easily be proved, that if it were a mile from the
bottom of Shooters Hill to the top, then by true dimension and measure it was
another mile from the top to the bottom. These Observations, with many others,
are in the said dangerous Book, of which perhaps you may hear further
relation in the next.

This day it was reported by the Carrier (of Middleborough in Monmouthshire)
that the Pope was turned Anabaptist or Brownist; but I wish the Brethren to
beware how they trust him, for he speaks Latin (the Language of the Beast)
and it is to be feared, that all the Rites and Ceremonies of the Romish
Catholic Religion will not easily be swopt out of his Conscience.

The Cardinal Bembus wrote to the Archbishop of Toledo, to signify unto him
what grief there was in Rome for the inconstant wavering of his Holiness; the
States of Italy are troubled with it, Poland is molested, France is disquiered;
Bohemia, Hungaria, Austria, and many parts of Germany are doubtful, that old
Sects and Heresies may rise, and new Schismatic Opinions breed; England is
weary of them, and heartily desires, as they have one good God, so one good
Religion, and one good King, Charles, who is the same we have and hope for.

There is great hope that Ireland will be at Peace, before the Papists and
Protestants do agree in matters of Faith; and that the Protestant true
Subjects will lay down Arms, when the Romish Catholics shall lay down
theirs: Howsoever, many of the Rebels there will be forced to live in Boggs,
wear thinsoal'd Brogues, and eat Shamracks, if they be not more obedient, and
at peace amongst themselves the sooner. And by certain Letters from the Irish
Rebels lately sent hither, they declare themselves to be resolved, That as long
as they live, there shall be a greater number of Thieves amongst them then of
true men.

I might (if I ought) and I could (if I would) relate how a great Seahorse was
cast upon Dunsmore-Heath, with strange News in his fore-hoofe, on the near
side; but because the Relation is grounded upon Uncertainties, and thereby I
might abuse my Readers with Untruths (as many Occurrent Mercury makers have
formerly done) I will Moderate my Intelligence, till such time as Time gives me
more certain Notice.

It was concluded this day, That what man soever that had not any Foe or
Enemy, that every such person should assure himself to have no true friend;
and that as Mischief is often painted over with a show of Good, or as a Wolf
is like a Dog, so is a Flatterer so like a Friend, that a man must have a
clear insight to see his inside.

Also it was this day agreed, That because many humourous Sectaries cannot (or
will not) frame their Opinions according to Gods Word, therefore they will do
what they can to frame Gods Word according to their Opinions: Like as the
Carpenters in the Isle of Lesbos, whose Rules and Squares were made of Lead,
whereby they could bend the Rule as they pleased; so that if the Timber would
not frame strait to be measured by the Rule, they had the Art to make the Rule
crooked to the form of the Timber: so all the Papists, Heretics, and
Sectaries, would make the Scriptures as a Lesbian Rule.

This day news came, that the Foot-Post of Stepney was dead; and that after
his decease, he desired one of the Churchwardens of Wapping to invite all the
blind men and women in the P^^ish to see him buried in Christian Burial, with
his head Nor^hw^rd, and his face down-ward: His Place is ^o^ ye^ disposed of.

It was concluded by the (...) of ma^y honest men, that Pamphleters and (...)
were the firebrarnds of (...) you may sooner find a Beggar without (...)
Diurnall without Lies: (I am afraid that this (...) S^eet which you are now
reading (...) in the fashion, that it wants impudence to say, Not Guilty)
Howsoever, theirs and this may be cried in the Streets, and for want of wisdom
they may be regarded. Amongst these walking Statione^s, (whose Authors wits
have commonly but one Sheet to Lie in weekly) one of the best and most current
of these uncurrant Occurrences and Curranto's, is one Pigge, I know not where
he had his Intelligence, either from Aleppo or Mexico (for all the four Winds
were his Messengers) he has been eclipsed at least five quarters of a year,
and in his room are sprung or sprouted out a swarm of Mercuries, with as many
heads as Hydra, and as many varieties as words; such as, Mercurius
Gallobelgicus, Britaunicus, Hibernicus, Aulicus, Diutinus, Caelicus, Aquaticus,
Rusticus, Candidius, Civicus, Infernalis Hibernicalis, Post, and Mendacius,
etc. It is the good pleasure of many honest men, that all the Mercuries may be
sublimated and qualified with Fasting-Spettle; which is by interpretation, that
for every malicious Lie they write, they should fast one Meal: by which
means, the number of them would either be thinner, (or look thin.)

In the time of the Great Alexander, there lived an ignorant Poet named
Cherrillus, who daily did write such Halting, Impotent, Lame, Ridiculous Lines
(or Verses) that Alexander gave him a Pension, to make him forbear Writing. So
it is thought convenient, that all our weekly Newes-making Mercuries mouths
may be stopped or bung'd up (with a Graves-end Toast) with some Competencie, to
eat and live upon; or else, if there be such a thing in England as the
Good-Behaviour, it is convenient that they were all bound to it.

And as concerning the truth of this my Diurnall,the Reader needs not make any
question of it; for it will be quickly perceived by any man of Reason, that
this which I have written is so like many of the former Authors Works (in this
kind) as if they had been all whelps of one Litter, all made of purpose to no
purpose, but to show, that we (Ink-Squitterers, and Weekly
Teeming-Pamphleters) are fellows that can hear News, though our Ears were
lost (for the Pillorie does not bite so often as the Rigor of the Law may
inflict) for which Causes, it is desired that we had all done, before we were
all undone.

The News that is before written may be read without danger, and it is hoped
(or expected) that no man of Judgment, Wit, or Reason, will trouble himself
much in searching the Truth of it; The Author did not sneake and sculke in
Westminster Hall for his Intelligence, but it was brought home to him in his
Chamber, from whence he has sent it to you and your Grave Considerations.

FINIS.
