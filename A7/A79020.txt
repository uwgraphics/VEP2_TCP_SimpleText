BY THE KING. Majesty's Proclamation forbidding the tendering or taking of a
late Covenant, called, A solemn League and Covenant for Reformation, etc.
WHereas there is a Printed Paper, entitled, A solemn League and Covenant for
Reformation, and defense of Religion, the Honor and Happiness of the King,
and the Peace and Safety of the three Kingdoms of England, Scotland and
Ireland, pretended to be Ordered by the Commons in Parliament on the twenty
first day of September last, to be Printed and Published; Which Covenant
though it seems to make specious expressions of Piety and Religion, is in Truth
nothing else but a Traiterous and Seditious Combination against Us, and against
the established Religion and Laws of this Kingdom, in pursuance of a
Traiterous Design, and endeavor to bring in foreign Force to invade this
Kingdom: We do therefore straightly Charge and Command all Our loving
Subjects, of what degree or quality soever, upon their Allegiance, that they
presume not to take the said Seditious and Traitorous Covenant. And We do
likewise hereby forbid and inhibite all Our Subjects to impose, administer, or
tender the said Covenant, as they and every of them will answer the Contrary at
their utmost and extremest Perils.

Given at Our Court at Oxford, this ninth day of October, in the nineteenth
year of Our Reign.
God save the KING.
OXFORD, Printed by Leonard Lichfield, Printer to the University. 1643.
