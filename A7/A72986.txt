AN ADMONITION To all such as shall intend hereafter to enter the state of
matrimony godly, and agreeable to Laws.
FIrst, that they contract not with such persons as be hereafter expressed, nor
with any of like degree, against the law of God, and the laws of the Realm.
Secondly, that they make no secret contracts without consent and counsel of
their Parents or Elders, under whose authority they be: contrary to Gods
Laws, and Man's ordinances. Thirdly, that they contract not anew with any
other, upon divorce and separation made by the Judge for a time, the laws yet
standing to the contrary.

Marriage is Honorable among all men, and the bed undefiled: But Whoremongers
and adulterers God will judge. Heb. 1.3.4.
To avoid fornication, let every man have his wife; and let every woman have
her husband: he that cannot contain, let him marry, For it is better to marry
then to burn. 1. Cor. 7.9.
Unto the married I command; not I, but the Lord: Let not the wife depart from
her husband: But if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled
unto her Husband. And let not the Husband put away his Wife. 1. Cor. 7.10.11.
Leuitici. xviii. and xx. None shall come near to any of the kindred of his
fleash to uncover her shame: I am the Lord.

1 IT is to be noted, that those persons which be in the direct line ascendent
and descendent, cannot marry together, although they be never so far a sunder
in degree. 2 It is to be noted, that Consanguinitie and affinity (letting and
dissoluing Matrimony) is contracted as well in them, and by them which be of
kindred by the one side, as in and by them which be of kindred by both sides. 3
Item, that by the Laws, Consanguinitie and Affinity (letting and dissoluing
Matrimony) is contracted as well by unlawful company of man and woman, as by
unlawful marriage. 4 Item, in contracting betwixt persons doubtful, which be
not expressed in this Table, It is always sure, first to consult with learned
men in the Laws to understand what is lawful, what is honest and expedient,
before the finishing of their Contracts. 5 Item, that noe Parsone, Vicar, or
Curat, shall solemnize Matrimony out of his, or their Cure, or parish Church
or Chapel: and shall not solemnize the same in private houses, nor lawless
or exempt Churches, under the pains of the Law, forbidding the same. And that
the Curate have their Certificates, when the parties dwell indiuers Parishes. 6
Item, the bands of matrimony ought to be openly denounced in the Church by
the Minister, three several Sundaies or Festival days, to the intent, that
who will or can aleadge any impediment, may be heard, and that stay may be made
till further trial, if any exception be made there against it, upon sufficient
caution. 7 Item, who shall maliciously object a frivolous impediment against a
lawful Matrimony, to disturb the same, is subject to the pains of the Law. 8
Item, who shall presume to contract in the degrees prohibited (though he do it
ignorantly) besides that the fruit of such copulation may be judged unlawful,
is also punishable at the Ordinaries discretion. 9 Item, if any Minister shall
conioyne any such, or shall be present at such contracts making, ought to be
suspended from his Ministry for three years: and otherwise to be punished
according to the Laws. 10 Item, it is further ordained that no Parson, Vicar,
or Curat, do preach treat, or expound, of his own voluntary invention, any
matter of controversy in the Scriptures, if he be under the degree of a
Master of Art, except he be licensed by his Ordinary thereunto, but only for
the instruction of the people, read the Homilies already set forth, and such
other form of doctrine as shall be hereafter by authority published. And shall
not innouate or alter any thing in the Church, or use any rite or ceremony,
which be not set forth by public authority.

Canterbury, Primate of England, and Metropolitan.
