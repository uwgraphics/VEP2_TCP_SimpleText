The Preface to the Reader.
HEre is published a Piece, not to be matched in Antiquity; a Collection, not
so much of Letters, as of the mysteries of Government, the wisdom, and manage
of Public businesses in the late Reigns, where the great Ministers of State
are presented naked, their Consultations, Designs, Policies, the things done by
them, are exposed to every man's eye, as they were brought forth by themselves.
The most famous of all Modern Historians glories in the helps and advantages he
had above all men else to write; He came (so he tells us) prepared and
furnished from the Cabinets of Princes, Strada.
be had seriously perused, and sifted their Letters and Orders; the Letters of
the Illustrious Persons employed by them, the private Commands, Dispatches, and
Instructions of Embassies; Debates, and Resolutions of Councels, without which
all History must be lame and imperfect.

This was the way to make the causes of actions as visible as their effects,
and without which all Diligence and Faithfulness else will do little. Much of
the History of the last years of King James, and beginnings of King Charles may
be here read. Here the height of the mighty Favorite the Duke of Buckingham
may be taken; The Arts and Subtleties of Spain, of the Conde Gondomar, and the
English-Spanish Party are discovered; the Journey into Spain, breach of the
Spanish, overtures for the French Match, for the renewing Leagues with the
enemies of the Spanish Pride and Universality; the carriage of the
Imperialists, French, Netherlanders, and other Concurrents of those Reigns, are
exactly Related: with the Practices of our home- Roman Catholics, and growth
of those who were here called Puritans then; the Secrets of the Court and
State; without any false gloss to writhe, or streighten, to deprave or
extenuate, with more truth and sincerity, then all the Annals can show; where
Passion and Interest sway oftentimes too much, and the cleanest hand makes
blots and stains, carried away with Love or Hatred, to the side or man. Here
are no snares set to catch or inveagle any man's judgment, all things are left
clearly to their own worth and Reputation.

E. of Sommerset to K. JAMES.
BY this Gentleman your Majesty's Lieutenant, I understand of some halt you
made, and the Cause of it, at such time as he offered to your Majesty my
Letters. But soon after, your Majesty could resolve your self and behold me
nothing so diffident of you, but in humble language petitioning your favor;
for I am in hope, that my condition is not capable of so much more misery, as
that I need to make my self a passage to you by such way of intercession. This
which follows after, I offer your Majesting though not as to your self, for
upon less motive you can find favor for me: Now I need only move, not plead,
before your Majesty, as my Case does stand, for what I seek to have done,
follows upon what you have already done, as a Consequence and succeeding
growth of your own act. But to the effect, that your Majesty may see that
there is enough to answer those (if any such there be) as do go about to
pervert the exercise of your Power, and to turn it from its own clear
excellency, for to minister unto their passions: I have presumed to this end to
awake your Majesty's own Concelpt upon this subject, which can gather to it
self better, and more able defenses in my behalf upon this view; for though the
acts of your mercy which are not communicable, nor the Causes of them with
others, as derived from those secret motives, which are only sensible and
privy to your own heart, and admit of no search or discovery to any general
satisfaction, and that under this protection I might guard my particular
sufficiently; yet my Case needs not hide it self, but attend the dispute with
any, that would put upon it a monstrous and heavy shape. For though that I must
acknowledge, that both life and estate are forfeit to you by Law, yet so
forfeited, as the same Law gives you the same power to preserve, as it does to
punish, whereby your Majesty's higher prerogative does not wrestle with it, nor
do you infringe those grounds by which you have ever governed; so as the
resistance is not great that your Majesty has, for to give life, and which is
less, in the gift of estate, for that the Law casts wholly upon your self, and
yields it as fit matter for the exercise of your goodness. Once it was your
Majesty's gift to me, so it may be better not taken then a second time given;
for it is common to all men for to avoid to take that which has been once
their own. And I may say farther, that Law has not been so severe upon the
ruin of innocent posterity, nor yet Cancelled, nor cut off the merits of
Ancestors, before the politic hand of State had contrived it into those
several forms, as fitted to their ends and government. To this I may add, that
that whereupon I was judged, even the Crime it self might have been none, if
your Majesty's hand had not once touched upon it, by which all access unto
your favor was quite taken from me. Yet as it did at length appear, I fell,
rather for want of well defending, then by the violence or force of any
proofs: for I so far forsook my self, and my Cause, as that it may be a
question whether I was more Condemned for that, or for the matter it self which
was the subject of that days Controversy. Then thus far nothing has
appeared, wherein your Majesty has extended for me your power beyond the
reasonable bound, neither does any thing stand so in the way of your future
proceedings, but rather make easy the access of your Majesty's favor to my
relief.

What may then be the cause, that Malice can pitch upon, wherefore your
Majesty should not proceed for to accomplish your own work? Aspersions are
taken away by your Majesty's letting me become subject to the utmost power of
Law, with the lives of so many of the offenders, which yields the world
subject of sorrow rather then appetite to more blood, but truth and innocence
protect themselves in poor men, much more in Kings. Neither ever was there such
aspersion (God knows) in any possibility toward your Majesty, but amongst
those who would create those pretenses to mislead your Majesty, and thereby
make me miserable. If not this (whereof the virtue, and use, was in the former
time and now determined) there is not any but your pleasure. It is true, I am
forfeited to your Majesty, but not against you by any treasonable or
unfaithful act. Besides, there is to be yielded a distinction of men as in
faults; in which I am of both under the nearest degrees of exception; yet your
Majesty has pardoned life and estate to Traitors, and to strangers, sometimes
the one, sometimes the other; Nay to some concerned in this business wherein I
suffer, you have pardoned more unto, then I desire; who as (it is reported) if
they had come to the test, had proved Copper, and should have drunk of the
bitter Cup as well as others. But I do not by this envy your favors to any
person, nor seek I to draw them in the yoke with my self, but applaud your
Majesty's goodness, m. Sir W. Elvish.
being in that respect in a nearer possibility to come at me. Besides this, to
Elvish your Majesty has given estate, which is a greater gift then life,
because it extends to posterity, who was the worst deserver in this business;
an unoffended instrument might have prevented all after-mischief, who for his
own ends suffered it, and by the like arts afterward bewrayed it. To this I
may add Tresham in the Powder Treason, Sir Lewis Tresham.
upon whose successors I do not cast any of his infamy, yet he preserved
himself to posterity, so as what he, or others such as he, have defrauded by
the arts of Law, and whom their own unfaithfulness made safe, I have much ado
to hold by ingenuity, and Confidence. How may it be that because I distrusted
not your Majesty, or because it returned in your power from whom I had it, it
is in danger to be broken or dismembered. Let me hope that there is nothing
which by favor may be excused, or by industry might have been avoided, that
will fail me, where your Majesty is to determine. It is not I who thus put
your Majesty in mind importunely: It is he that was your Creature, it is
Sommerset, with all your honors, and envious greatness, that is now in
question. Kings themselves are protected from the breach of Law by being
Favorites and Gods anointed, which gives your Majesty the like privilege over
yours; Dr. Dunne.
As I took from Dr. Dunne in his Sermon, that the goodness of God is not so
much acknowledged by us in being our Creator, as in being our Redeemer; nor in
that he has chosen us, as that nothing can take us out of his hands, which in
your Majesty's remembrance let me challenge, and hope for: For the first
accesses of favor, they may be ascribed to ones own pleasing themselves, but
that appears to be for our sakes and for our good, when the same forsakes not
our civil deserts. This redemption I crave, not as to my own person, but with
your benefits once given; nor do I assume them very deep, for I have
voluntarily departed from the hopes of persion, place, office; I only cleave to
that which is so little, as that it will suffer no pairing, or diminution.

And as in my former Letters, so by this I humbly crave of your Majesty not to
let the practices of Court work upon your Son the Prince, not fearing your
sufferance of my loss in that particular so much, (for I cannot lose it, but
willingly all with it) as for to take off the Stage, that which in the attempt
may prove inconvenient. And consider I pray your Majesty, that my hope in
desiring to pass these had times, was to be restored to my fortunes; others
are made unhappy by me, if otherwise, and then I lose my end. I speak of
impairing, of changing, or supplying, as of any other way, all such
alterations, and ruin, are alike, without I be worthy of your gift, and that I
can be worthy of all, that Law can permit you to give, or cast upon your
Majesty by a more nearer title, as it does by this; I shall account them equal
evils, that leave nothing, or a patched and proportioned one, changed or
translated from one thing to another.

But if your Majesty have any respects to move you to suspend your good
toward me; let that which is mine rest in your own hands, till that you find
all opposite humors conformed to your purpose. I have done wrong to my self,
thus to entertain such a doubt of your Majesty; but the unrelenting of
adversaries, which when you will have them, will sooner alter; and that all
this while I have received nothing of present notice for direction, or to
comfort me, from your Majesty, has made me to expostulate with my self thus
hardly. For God is my judge Sir, I can never be worthy to be; if I have these
marks put upon me of a Traitor, as that tumbling and disordering of that
estate would declare the divorce from your presence, lays too much upon me,
and this would upon both.

I will say no farther, neither in that which your Majesty doubted my aptness
to fall into, for my Cause, nor my Confidence is not in that distress as for
to use that mean of intercession, nor of any thing besides, but to remember
your Majesty, that I am the Workmanship of your hands, and bear your stamp
deeply imprinted in all the characters of favor; that I was the first plant
ingrafted by your Majesty's hand in this place, therefore not to be unrooted by
the same hand, lest it should taint all the same kind, with the touch of that
fatalnesse; And that I was even the Son of a Father, whose services are
registered in the first honors and impressions I took of your Majesty's favor,
and laid there as a foundation stone of that building; These and your Majesty's
goodness for to receive them, is that I rely upon. So praying for your
Majesty's prosperity, I am in all humbleness

Your Majesty's loyal servant, and Creature, R. Sommersett.

The Lo. Chancelour Bacon to the Lords.
If it may please your Lordships,
I shall humbly crave at your Lordships hands a benign interpretation of that
which I shall now write; for words that come from wasted spirits, and an
oppressed mind, are more safe in being deposited in a noble Construction, then
in being Circled with any reserved Caution. Having made this as a protection to
all, which I shall say, I will go on, but with a very strange entrance (as may
seem to your Lordships at the first) for in the midst of a state of as great
affliction, as I think a mortal man can endure, (honor being above life) I
shall begin with the professing gladness in some things.

The first is, that hereafter the greatness of a Judge or Magistrates, shall
be no Sanctuary, or protection to him against guiltiness, which in few words
is the beginning of a golden world.

The next, that after this example, it is like that Judges will fly from any
thing in the likeness of Corruption (though it were at a great distance) as
from a Serpent, which tends to the purging of the Courts of Justice, and
reducing them to their true honor and splendor. And in these two points God
is my witness (though it be my fortune to be the anvile upon which these good
effects are beaten and wrought) I take no small comfort. But to pass from the
motions of my heart, whereof God is only Judge, to the merits of my Cause,
whereof your Lordships are only Judges, under God, and his Lieutenant; I do
understand, there has been expected from me heretofore some justification, and
therefore I have chosen one only justification instead of all others, out of
the justification of Job, for after the clear submission and Confession, which
I shall now make unto your Lordships, I hope I may say, and justify with Job
in these words, I have not hid my sin as did Adam, nor concealed my faults in
my bosom. This is the only justification I will use. It rests therefore that
without fig leaves, I do ingenuously confess and acknowledge, that having
understood the particulars of the charge, not formally from the house, but
enough to inform my Conscience and memory, I find matter both sufficient and
full, to move me to desert the defense, and to move your Lordships to condemn
and censure me. Neither will I trouble your Lordships by singling out
particulars, which I think may fall off. Quid te exempta juvat spinis de
millibus una? Neither will I prompt your Lordships to observe upon the proofs,
where they come not home, or the scruples touching the Credit of the Witnesses:
Neither will I present unto your Lordships, how far a defense might in diverse
things extenuate the offense, in respect of the time, or manner of the gift, or
the like circumstances, but only leave these things to spring out of your own
noble thoughts, and observations of the evidence, and examinations themselves,
and charitably to wind about the particulars of the charge here and there, as
God shall put in your minds, and so submit my self wholly to your piety and
grace.

And now that I have spoken to your Lordships, as Judges, I shall say a few
words unto you, as Peers, and Prelates, humbly commending my Cause to your
noble Minds, and magnanimous affections.

Your Lordships are not only Judges, but Parliamentary Judges, you have a
farther extent of arbitrary power, then other Courts: and if you be not tied to
the ordinary course of Courts, or presidents, in point of strictness and
severity, much more in points of mercy and mitigation. And yet if any thing I
should move might be contrary to your honorable and worthy ends to introduce a
reformation, I should not seek it. But herein I beseech your Lordships to give
me leave to tell you a story. Titus Manlius took his sons life for giving
battle against the prohibition of his General. Not many years after the like
severity was pursued by Papirius Cursor the Dictator against Quintus Maximus,
who being upon the point to be sentenced, was by the intercession of some
principal persons of the Senate spared; whereupon Livie makes this grave and
gracious observation, Neque minus firmata est disciplina militaris periculo
Quinti Maximi, quam mirabili supplicio Titi Manlii, The discipline of War was
no less established by the questioning only of Quintus Maximus, then by the
punishment of Titus Manlius. And the same reason is of the reformation of
Justice; for the questioning of men of eminent place has the same terror,
though not the same rigor with the punishment. But my Case stays not there,
for my humble desire is, that his Majesty would take the Seal into his hands,
which is a great downfall, and may serve I hope in it self for an expiation of
my faults.

Therefore if mercy and mitigation be in your Lordships power, and do no ways
cross your ends, why should I not hope of your favors and Commiserations?
Your Lordships may be pleased to behold your chief Pattern the King our
Sovereign, a King of incomparable Clemency, and whose heart is instructable
for wisdom and goodness. You well remember, that there sat not these hundred
years before in your House a Prince (and never such a Prince) whose presence
deserves to be made memorable by records, and acts, mixed of mercy and justice.
Your selves are either Nobles (and Compassion ever beats in the veins of
noble blood,) or Reverend Prelates, who are the servants of him, that would not
break the bruised reed, nor quench smoking flax.

You all sit upon a high Stage, and therefore cannot but be more fensible of
the changes of humane Condition, and of the fall of any from high places.
Neither will your Lordships forget that there are vitia tomporis, as well as
vitia hominis, and that the beginning of reformation, has a contrary power to
the pool of Bethesda; for that had strength only to cure him, that was first
cast in, and this has strength to hurt him only, that is first Cast in; and
for my part, I wish it may stay there, and go no further.

Lastly, I assure my self, your Lordships have a noble feeling of me, as a
member of your own body; and one, that in this very Session, had some taste of
your loving affection, which I hope was not a lightning before the death of
them, but rather a spark of that grace which now in the Conclusion will more
appear. And therefore my humble suit to your Lordships is, that my voluntary
Confession be my sentence, and the loss of the Seal my punishment, and that
your Lordships will spare any farther sentence, but recommend me to his
Majesty's grace and pardon for all that is past. And so, etc.

Your Lordships, etc. Francis St. Alban Can.

Five Letters more of my Lord Bacons.
Bacon to the King, July 31. 1617.
I Dare not presume any more to reply upon your Majesty, Lord Keeper Bacon to
his Majesty.
but reserve my Defense till I attend your Majesty at your happy return, when
I hope verily to approve my self not only a true servant to your Majesty, but
a true friend to my Lord of Buckingham, and for the times also I hope to give
your Majesty a good account, though distance of place may obscure them. But
there is one part of your Majesty's Letter, that I could be sorry to take time
to answer; which is that your Majesty conceives, that whereas I wrote, That
the height of my Lords Fortune might make him secure; I mean that he was turned
proud, or unknowing of himself. Surely the opinion I have ever had of my Lord
(whereof your Majesty is best witness) is far from that: But my meaning was
plain and simple; that his Lordship might through his great fortune, be the
less apt to Cast, and foresee, the unfaithfulness of friends, and the
malignity of enemies, and accidents of times. Which is a judgment (your
Majesty knows better then I) that the best Authors make of the best, and
best tempered spirits, Vt sunt res humana; Insomuch as Guicciardine makes the
same judgment (not of a particular person) but of the wifest state of Europe,
the Senate of Venice, when he says their prosperity had made them secure, and
under-weighers of perils. Therefore I beseech your Majesty, to deliver me, in
this, from any the least imputation to my dear and Noble Lord and friend. And
so expecting, that that Sun, which when it went from us, left us cold weather,
and now it is returned toward us, has brought with it a blessed harvest, will
when it comes to us dispel and disperse all mists, and mistakings.

I am, etc.

Lord Chancellor to his Majesty, 2. Jan. 1618.
It may please your most excellent Majesty,
I Do many times with gladness, and for a remedy of my other labors, revolve
in my mind the great happiness which God (of his singular goodness) has
accumulated upon your Majesty every way, and how Complete the same would be, if
the state of your means were once rectified, and well ordered, your people
military, and obedient, fit for war, used to peace, your Church illightened
with good Preachers, as an heaven of Stars, your Judges learned, and learning
from you, just, and just by your example, your Nobility in a right distance
between Crown and People, no oppressors of the people, no overshadowers of the
Crown, your Council full of tributes of Care, faith, and freedom, your
Gentlemen, and Justices of Peace, willing to apply your Royal Mandates to the
nature of their several Counties, but ready to obey, your servants in awe of
your wisdom, in hope of your goodness; The fields growing every day by the
improvement and recovery of grounds, from the desert, to the garden; The City
grown from wood to brick, your Sea-walls or Pomerium of your Island surveyed,
and in edifying; your Merchants embracing the whole compass of the World,
East, West, North, and South; The times give you Peace, and yet offer you
opportunities of action abroad: And lastly, your excellent Royal Issue
entayleth these blessings and favors of God, to descend to all posterity. It
rests therefore, that God having done so great things for your Majesty, and
you for others; You would do so much for your self as to go through (according
to your good beginnings) with the rectifying and settling of your estate and
means, which only is wanting. Hoc rebus defuit unum. I therefore whom only
love, and duty to your Majesty, and your royal line, has made a Financier, do
intend to present unto your Majesty a perfect book of your estate, like a
perspective glass to draw your estate near to your sight; beseeching your
Majesty to conceive, that if I have not attained to do that, that I would do
in this which is not proper for me, nor in my element, I shall make your
Majesty amends in some other thing in which I am better bred.

God ever preserve, etc.

The Lord Chancellor to the Marquess of Buckingham, 25. March, 1620.
My very good Lord,
YEsterday I know was no day; Now I hope I shall hear from your Lordship, who
are my anchor in these floods. Mean while to ease my heart, I have written to
his Majesty the enclosed, which I pray your Lordship to read advisedly, and to
deliver it, or not to deliver it, as you think Good. God ever prosper your
Lordship.

Yours ever what I am. Fr. St. Alban. Canc.

The Lord Chancellor to the King. March 25. 1620.
It may please your most excellent Majesty.
TIme has been, when I have brought unto you Gemitum Columbae from others, now
I bring it from my self. I fly unto your Majesty with the wings of a Dove,
which once within these seven days, I thought would have carrried me a higher
flight. When I enter into my self, I find not the materials of such a tempest
as is come upon me. I have been, as your Majesty knows best (never author
of any immoderate Counsel, but always desired to have things carried suavibus
modis. I have been no avaritious oppressor of the people. I have been no
haughty, or intolerable, or hateful man in my conversation, or carriage. I have
inherited no hatred from my father, but am a good Patriot born. Whence should
this be? for these are the things that use to raise dislikes abroad.

For the house of Commons, I began my Credit there, and now it must be the
place of the Sepulture thereof. And yet this Parliament upon the Message
touching Religion, the old love revived, and they said I was the same man
still, only honesty was turned into honor.

For the Upper House, even within these days, before these troubles, they
seemed as to take me into their arms, finding in me ingenuity, which they took
to be the true straight line of nobleness without Crooks or angles.

And for the briberies and gifts wherewith I am charged; when the books of
hearts shall be opened, I hope I shall not be found to have the troubled
fountain of a corrupt heart, in a depraved habit of taking rewards to pervert
Justice, howsoever I may be frail, and partake of the abuses of the Times.

And therefore I am resolved, when I come to my answer, not to trick my
innocence (as I writ to the Lords) by Cavillations, or voidances, but to speak
to them the language, that my heart speaks to me, in excusing, extenuating,
or ingenuous confessing; praying God to give me the grace to see to the bottom
of my faults, and that no hardness of heart do steal upon me, under show of
more neatness of Conscience, then is Cause.

But not to trouble your Majesty any longer, craving pardon for this long
mourning Letter; that which I thirst after, as the Heart after the streams, is,
that I may know by my matchless friend that presents to you this letter,
your Majesty's heart (which is an abyssus of goodness, as I am an abyssus of
mercy) toward me. I have been ever your man, and counted my self but as an
usufructuary of my self, the property being yours. And now making my self an
oblation to do with me as may best conduce to the honor of your Justice, the
honor of your Mercy, and the use of your Service, resting as

Clay in your Majesty's gracious hands, Fr. St. Alban. Canc.

Magdibeg to his Majesty.
May it please your most excellent Majesty,
I Make bold after a long silence, to prostrate my self before your Majesty,
and being the Ambassador of a great King, that counts it an honor to style
himself your friend, I do beseech you to afford me that justice, which I am
sure you will not refuse to the meanest of your Subjects.

At my first arrival into this your happy Kingdom, I was informed by the
general relation of all that had recourse unto me, that one here (who had the
title of Ambassador from my Master) did vainly brag that he had married the
King of Persia's Niece, which kindled in me such a vehement desire to vindicate
my Masters honor, from so unworthy and false a report, that at my first
interview with him, my hand being guided by my duty, I endeavored to fasten
upon him a Condign disgrace to such an imposture. But the caution that I ought
to have of my own justification, when I return home, bids me the more
strictly to examine the truth of that which was told me (whereon my action with
Sir Robert Shirley was grounded) and to have it averred in the particulars, as
well as by a general voice. Therefore I humbly beseech your Majesty, that out
of your Princely goodness you will be pleased to give such order, that this
point may be fully cleared. Wherein for the manner of proceeding, I wholly and
humbly remit my self to your Majesty: And this being done, I shall return home
with some measure of joy to balance the grief which I have, for having done
ought, that may have clouded your Majesty's favor to me. And so committing
your Majesty to the protection of the greatest God, whose shadows, and elect
instruments, Kings are on earth, I humbly take my leave, and rest, etc.

The Copy of a Letter written by his Majesty to the Lord Keeper, the Bishops
of London, Wynton, Rochester, St. David's, and Excester, Sir Henry Hubbert, Mr.
Justice Dodderidge, Sir Henry Martin, and Dr. Steward, or any six of them,
whereof the Lord Keeper, the Bishops of London, Wynton, and St. David's to be
four.
IT is not unknown unto you, what happened the last Summer to our trusty and
welbeloved Counselor, the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, who shooting at a
Deer with a Crossebowe in Bramzil Park, did with that shoot, casually give the
Keeper a wound, whereof he dyed. Which accident (though it might have happened
to any other man) yet because his eminent rank and function in the Church has
(as we are informed) ministered occasion of some doubt, as making the Cause
different in his person, in respect of the scandal (as is supposed,) we being
desirous (as it is fit we should) to be satisfied therein, and reposing
especial trust in your learnings, and judgments, have made choice of you to
inform Us concerning the nature of this Cause, and do therefore require you to
take presently into your Considerations, the Scandal that may arise thereupon,
and to certify Us what in your Judgments the same may amount unto, either to
an irregularity, or otherwise. And lastly, what means may be found for the
redress thereof (if need be) of all which points, we shall expect to have your
Reports, with what diligence and expedition you may.

Dated at Theobalds, October. 3d. 1621.
The Archbishop of York to King James.
May it please your Majesty,
I Have been too long silent, and am afraid that by silence, I have neglected
the duty of the place it has pleased God to call me unto, and your Majesty to
place me in. But now I humbly beseech, that I may discharge my Conscience
toward God, and my duty toward your Majesty. And therefore I beseech you
Sir, to give me leave freely to deliver my self, and then let it please your
Majesty to do with me as you please.

Your Majesty has propounded a Toleration of Religion, I beseech you to take
into your Consideration, what your Act is, and what the Consequence may be. By
your act, you labor to set up that most damnable and heretical doctrine of the
Church of Rome, the Whore of Babylon. How hateful will it be to God, and
grievous to your Subjects (the true professors of the Gospel) that your
Majesty who has often defended, and learnedly written against those wicked
heresies, should now show your self a Patron of those doctrines which your Pen
has told the world, and your Conscience tells your self are superstitious,
idolatrous, and detestable: Also what you have done in sending the Prince
without Consent of your Council, and the privitie and approbation of your
People: For although Sir, you have a large interest in the Prince, as the Son
of your flesh, yet have your People a greater as the Son of the Kingdom, upon
whom (next after your Majesty) are their eyes fixed, and their Welfare
defends. And so slenderly is his going apprehended, that believe Sir, how ever
his return may be safe, yet the drawers of him unto that action, so dangerous
to himself, so desperate to the Kingdom, will not pass away unquestioned, and
unpunished.

Besides, this Tolleration you endeavor to set up by your Proclamation, it
cannot be done without a Parliament, unless your Majesty will let your
Subjects see, that you now take unto your self a liberty to throw down the
Laws of the Land at your pleasure. What dreadful Consequence these things may
draw after, I beseech your Majesty to Consider.

And above all, lest by this Tolleration, and discountenance of the true
profession of the Gospel (wherewith God has blessed us) and under which this
Kingdom has flourished these many years) your Majesty does draw upon the
Kingdom in general, and your self in particular, Gods heavy wrath and
indignation.

Thus in discharge of my duty to your Majesty, and the place of my Calling, I
have taken the humble boldness to deliver my Conscience. And now Sir, Do with
me what you please.

Next of all, in order, follow the Letters that passed between the King and his
Agents, about the Spanish Transactions. The first Letter written, per anonymum,
brings news of the Princes arrival.
The Copy of a Letter sent from Spain, concerning the Princes arrival there,
etc.
I Presume his Highness being now returned, you may by Conference have such
choice, and free relations of his proceedings in Spain, that I may well hold my
Pen, (it being not privileged with that freedom that the tongue is) yet to
comply with that constant obligation I purpose still to owe you, I will write
something, and point at some passages, where others perhaps may not so
punctually inform you.

The Prince's coming hither seemed not so strange, as acceptable, and pleasing
unto all. The Common sort expressed it by extraordinary shouts, and
acclamations of joy, offering, and marrying the Infanta (as it were) presently,
by public voice, as having won and truly deserved her, by so brave an
adventure. The King and State studied how to do him all the honor that might
be: The first decree that the Council of State made, was, that at all occasions
of meetings, he should have the precedencie of the King. That he should make
entry into the Palace in the form of State, as the Kings of Spain do in the
first day of their Coronation. That he should have one of the chief Quarters of
the Kings House for his lodgings, one hundred of the Guard to attend him, all
the Council to obey him, as the Kings own person. All prisoners were released,
the new Proclamation against excess in apparel revoked, and sundry other
arguments of joy. But a wonder lasts not but for nine days.

This universal joy was grounded upon hopes, that the Prince came not only to
fetch a wife, but also to make himself a Catholic. Say you so?
The Pope incited him hereunto by Letters, which his Nuntio delivered. He sent
a charge to the inquisitor general, to use all possible diligence herein. Many
processions, and shows were made to stir him. But they soon saw how
improbable it was to win him, For which God be thanked.
how amongst all his servants there was not one Catholic about him: what
slight esteem they made of the Churches, and Religion here; some committing
irreverent, and scandalous actions in the Kings own Chapel, so that they began
to behold the English with an ill aspect, to inveigh against the Conde de
Gundomar, that he should inform the King and State, that the Prince had a
disposition easy to be wrought upon to be made a Catholic. Add hereunto the
ill offices that the Irish do, who to preserve themselves in the Spanish
pension did prejudice the business, by casting aspersions upon the English,
the misinformation of the persecution in their Country, and in England
notwithstanding being here, and the abuse of the Ambassadors servants in
London.

When the Prince came, there wanted nothing for the final consummation of all
things but the dispensation, which came two months after. And whereas it was
expected to come absolute, and full; it came infringed with Cautions and
limitations, viz. That the Infanta should not be married till matters in
England were in perfect execution; that in case the King of England could not
give sufficient security, the King of Spain himself should swear, and undertake
the oath for him. Hereupon a Junto of Divines was appointed to determine
hereof, Whether the King might do this with a safe Conscience or no. These
Divines went gravely and tediously to work; which put the Prince upon that
impatiency, that he was upon point of departure. When at last the business
came to a resolution, and so the Match was publicly declared. The Prince had
then often (though publicly) access to the Infanta, the King being still
himself present, and in hearing. After this a Ratification was sent for from
Rome, but the Pope dying in the interim, and the new Pope falling suddenly
sick, it could not be speedily procured. For want of this Ratification there
was no Contract made, and the Prince himself seemed not to desire it. A little
before his departure, the King and the Council of State, with the Patriarch of
the Indies, the Prince-Prelate, after the Bishop of Toledo, (who is under age)
swore to all the Capitulations, so that the Prince seemed to depart well
satisfied. The King brought him to the Escurial, and a little before his
departure, the King and he went into a close Coach, and had a large discourse
together, (my Lord of Bristol being in another Coach hard by to interpret some
hard words, when he was called.) And so they parted with many tender
demonstrations of love. A Trophy of Marble is erected in the place where they
parted. Many rich Presents were given on both sides. The Prince bestowed upon
the Queen the biggest Crown Pearl in the world between two Diamonds. He gave
the Infanta a rope of Pearl, and an anchor of great Diamonds, with many other
Jewels. He has been very bountiful to every one of the Kings house, and all
the Guard. Never Prince parted with such an universal love of all. He left
every mouth filled with his Commendations; every one reporting him to be a
truly Noble, discreet, and well deserving Prince. I write what I hear, and
know, and that without passion, for all he is the Prince of my Country.

My Lord of Buckingham at first, was much esteemed, but it lasted little; his
French garb, with his stout hastiness in negotiating, and over-familiarity
with the Prince, was not liked. Moreover, the Council of Spain took it ill,
that a green head, should come with such a superintendent power to treat of an
affair of such Consequence, among so many grave Ministers of State, to the
prejudice of so able and well-deserving a Minister as my Lord of Bristol, who
laid the first stone of this building. Hereupon his power was called in
question, and found imperfect in regard it was not confirmed by the Council.
Thus the business began to gather ill blood between Olivarez, and him, and
grew so far out of square, that unless there had been good heads to piece them
together again, all might have fallen quite off the hinges. He did not take his
leave of the Countess of Olivarez, and the farewell he took of the Conde
himself was harsh; for he told him, he would be an everlasting servant to the
King of Spain, the Queen, and the Infants, and would endeavor to do the best
offices he could, for the concluding of this business, and strengthening the
amity between the two Kingdoms; but for himself, he had so far disobliged him,
that he could make no profession of friendship to him at all. The Conde turned
about, and said he accepted of what he had spoken, and so parted.

Since his Highness departure, my Lord of Bristol negotiates closely, he is
daily at the Palace to attend the Infanta, and he treats by means of the
Countess of Olivarez.

There is a new Junto appointed for the disposing of the Infanta's affairs, and
we hope here, that all things will be ripe against the next Spring to bring her
over. And so I rest, etc.

From Madrid. 30. September. 1623.
His Majesty's to the Earl of Bristol, Jan. 21. 1625.
WE have read your Letter addressed to us by Buckingham, and We cannot but
wonder that you should through forgetfulness make such a request to us of
favor, as if you stood eavenly capable of it, when you know what your
behavior in Spain deserved of Us, which you are to examine by the observations
We made, and know you will remember, how at our first coming into Spain, taking
upon you to be so wise as to foresee our intentions to change our Religion, you
were so far from dissuading us, that you offered your service, and secrecy to
concur in it, and in many other open Conferences pressing to show how
convenient it was for us to be a Roman Catholic, it being impossible in your
opinion, to do any great action otherwise; how much wrong, disadvantage, and
disservice you did to the Treaty, and to the right and interest of our dear
Brother, and Sister, and their Children; what disadvantage, inconvenience, and
hazard you entangled us in by your artifices, putting off, and delaying our
return home. The great estimation you made of that State, and the vile price
you set this Kingdom at, still maintaining, that we under color of friendship
to Spain, did what was in our power against them, which (you said) they knew
very well. And last of all, your approving of those Conditions, that our Nephew
should be brought up in the Emperors Court, to which Sir Walter Aston then
said, he durst not give his Consent for fear of his head; you replying to him,
that without some such great action, neither marriage nor peace could be had,
etc.

Lord Conway to the Earl of Bristol. March 21. 1625.
My Lord,
I Received a Letter from your Lordship dated the 4th of this month, written in
answer to a former, which I directed to your Lordship by his Majesty's
Commandment. This last Letter (according to my duty) I have showed unto his
Majesty; who has perused it, and has commanded me to write back this unto
you again. That he finds himself nothing satisfied therewith; the question
propounded to your Lordship from his Majesty was plain and clear, Whether you
did rather choose to sit still without being questioned for any errors past in
your negotiation in Spain, and enjoy the benefit of the late gracious pardon
granted in Parliament, whereof you may have the benefit; or whether for the
clearing of your innocence (whereof your self, your friends, and your followers
are so confident) you will be contented to wave the advantage of that pardon,
and put your self into a legal way of examination for the trial thereof? His
Majesty's purpose hereby is not to prevent you of any favors the Law has
given: but if your assurance be such as your words and letter import, he
conceives it stands not with that public and resolute profession of your
integrity, to decline your trial. His Majesty leaves the choice to your self,
and requires from you a direct answer, without Circumlocution, or bargaining
with him for future favors before hand.

But if you have a desire to make use of that pardon which cannot be denied to
you, nor is it any way desired to be taken from you; His Majesty expects, that
you should at least forbear to magnify your service, and out of the opinion of
your own innocence cast an aspersion upon his Majesty's Justice, in not
affording you that present fullness of liberty and favor which cannot be drawn
from him, but in his own good time, and according to his own good pleasure.
Thus much I have in command to write unto your Lordship, and to require your
answer clearly and plainly by this Messenger sent on purpose for it. And so,
etc.

The E. of Bristol to the Lord Conway, 4. March. 1625.
My Lord,
I Received your Letter of the 25. of February, and therein a Commandment from
his Majesty, and in his Majesty's name to make a clear and plain answer,
Whether I desire or rest in the security I am now in, and to acknowledge the
gracious favor of his late Majesty, and of his which now is, who have been
pleased not to question my actions, etc. Hereunto I have labored exactly to
obey, but find that a plain and clear answer cannot possibly be made, until
there be a clear understanding of the thing propounded; so that I may crave
pardon if my answer be not so clear as I could wish it: for I must freely
acknowledge, that I no way understand what is meant by the security I am now
in, whether it be by the present estate I am now in, or not: If it be so, I
conceive a man cannot be under a harder Condition; for your Lordship knows,
that by order my person is restrained, and you were pleased lately to send me
word, that you would not advise me to make use of the liberty which his late
Majesty had given me of coming to London, although that were only to follow
my private affairs, and for the recovery of my decayed health. I stand likewise
problbited to come to the Court, or to the Kings presence, (I pass by my being
removed from all my places, and offices, and wholly depending upon his
Majesty's royal pleasure.) But being a Peer of this Realm, I have not only by
Commandment, been formerly stayed from the Parliament, but of late, my writ
has been detained, as though my honor were forfeited. And this is truly the
Condition I am now in, but I cannot imagine that this is the security intended
I should rest in; but am in hope, that the security intended is, that I may for
the future enjoy the liberty of a free Subject, and the privileges of a Peer
of the Kingdom. Which being so, I shall with all humility acknowledge his
Majesty's grace and favor, and be ready to serve him with all fidelity even to
the laying down of my life, not thinking it to stand with the duty of a Subject
to press his being questioned, since such being the pleasure of his Sovereign,
it were not in the power of any subject to avoid it. But in case his Majesty
shall be pleased to bring me to any legal trial, I shall most willingly and
dutifully submit my self thereunto, and doubt not but my innocence in the end
will be my best Mediator for his Majesty's future favor. And in that Case I
am a suitor that my Writ of Parliament as a Peer of this Realm may be sent unto
me, and that my present repair to London may not displease his Majesty; As for
the pardon of the 21. Reg. Jacobi, which you mention, I should renounce, but
that I know that the justest and most cautious man living, may through
ignorance or omission offend the Laws, so that as a Subject I shall not
disclaim any benefit which comes in the general as it does usually to all
other Subjects in the Kingdom: But as for any Crime in particular, that may
trench upon my employments in point of Loyalty, fidelity, or want of affection
to the King or State, I know my innocence to be such, that I am confident I
shall not need that pardon. I shall conclude with a most humble suit unto your
Lordship, that out of your nobleness, and that friendship that has been
betwixt us, you will use your best endeavors both with his Majesty and the
Duke, that this unfortunate business may be past over, by the renewing whereof
I can see little use that can be made but the adding to a man's misfortunes
already sufficiently humbled; For I am ready to do all that a man of honor and
honesty may do; but rather then to do any thing that may be prejudicial to me
in that kind, to suffer whatsoever it shall please God to send. And so with the
remembrance of my humble service unto your Lordship, I recommend you unto Gods
holy protection, And rest

Your Lordships humble servant, Bristol.
Sherborn Lodge, etc.
Here next follow the Letters of my Lord of Bristol concerning the business of
the Match.
The E. of Bristol to the Lord Bishop of Lincoln, Aug. 20. 1623.
My very worthy Lord,
I Give you many thanks for your Letter of the 23d. of July, by which I
understand your great care of me, by seconding a former motion it pleased your
Lordship to make, of having me reconciled to my Lord Dukes favor, (A thing
which I have infinitely desired) and have esteemed the good offices you have
been pleased to do therein, as a very high obligation your Lordship puts upon
me. But I conceive your Lordship will find that any motion you have made in
that kind unto his Grace has been despised, rather then received with any
thankfulness, or that he has returned you any answer of his inclination
thereunto. For the truth is, my Lord does look down upon my poor Condition with
that scorn and contempt, that I conjecture the very moving of any such thing,
especially under the term of reconciliation, has not been pleasing unto his
Lordship. But thereof your Lordship can make the best judgment by the answer
you received from him. I do but guess thereat, by what I have heard he has
been pleased to say, and the manner wherewith he has used me: Which has been
such, that the Spaniards themselves (which most afflicted me) have out of
compassion pitied me. Yet I may with much truth assure your Lordship, that I
have not omitted toward him either any respect or service that was fit for me
to perform, either toward his person, or the high place he holds in my
Masters favor, or unto his present employment; well knowing how undecent and
scandalous a thing it is for the Ministers of a Prince to run different ways
in a strange Court, but have attended him in all his public audience, and
used in all kinds that respect and observance toward him, that I think malice
her self cannot charge me with an omission. And my Lord, this is the truth,
whatsoever may be said or written to the contrary: It is true, that some four
months since in a business that no less concerned his Majesty and the
Prince's service, then abruptly to have broken off all our Treaty, I was far
differing from my Lords opinion; And thereupon happened betwixt us some dispute
in debate of the business, but without any thing that was personal, and there
was no creature living at it but the Prince, to whose Censure I shall willingly
refer my self. In me I protest it unto your Lordship, it made no alteration,
but within half an hour I came to him with the same reverence and respect that
I was wont to do, the which I have continued ever since, so that I have much
wondered how it comes to be so much spoken of in England, that my Lord Duke
and my self should live here at too much distance. And I cannot find any other
reason for it, but that every body has taken so much notice of my ill, and
contemptible usage, that they think it unpossible for any Gentleman, but to be
sensible of it. But if any one disrespect, or omission from me toward my Lord
Duke can be truly instanced in by any man, I will be contented to incur his
Majesty's high displeasure, and your Lordships Censure.

For the present News here, it is, that the ninth of this Month, the Prince
intends (God willing) to begin his journey for England. And the day before, I
conceive the Contract will be. The Infanta is to follow in the Spring, and the
Prince has commanded my stay here. I know not how things may be reconciled
here before my Lord Dukes departure, but at present, they are in all extremity
ill, betwixt this King, and his Ministers, and the Duke, and they stick not to
profess, that they will rather put the Infanta headlong into a Well, then into
his hands. I write unto your Lordship you see with much freeness, and I
entreat you let it remain with you. And so in much haste I only entreat your
Lordship to believe, that you have not living an honester, nor a true hearteder
a friend, and servant, then

Your Lordships ever to be commanded, Bristol.

The E of Bristol to the Lord Bishop of Lincoln, 24. of September. 1623.
My singular Lord,
I Have dispatched this Bearer my servant Greislie with the draught of the
temporal Articles, which I hope will be to the King and Prince his
satisfaction, and he will let your Lordship have a sight of them.

Since the departure of the Prince, there have every day passed Letters of
extraordinary affection between the King, and the Prince; and the love that is
here generally born unto the Prince is such, as cannot be well believed by
those that daily hear not, what passes both from the King and his chief
Ministers. And to say the truth, his Highness has well deserved it; for in
the whole time of his being here, he has carried himself with the greatest
affability, patience, and constancy, and at his departure-with the greatest
bounty, and liberality, that I think has been known in any Prince in our
times. And I protest unto your Lordship as a Christian, that I never heard in
all the time of his being here, nor since any one exception taken against him,
unless it were for being supposed to be too much guided by my Lord Duke of
Buckingham, who is indeed very little beholding to the Spaniards for their good
opinion of him, and departed from hence with so little satisfaction, that the
Spaniards are in doubt, that he will endeavor all that shall be possible to
cross the Marriage: Wherein certainly they are very much mistaken; For my Lord
cannot but be obliged a servant for any particular distastes of his own to
cross the advancement of his Majesty, and the Prince's service, especially in
a business of so high Consequence as this.

It may be your Lordship will hear many Complaints, and that the Match never
was, nor yet is intended; I beseech your Lordship to give little belief in that
kind, and the effects will now speedily declare the truth, if the fault be not
on our side. It is true that the Spaniards have committed many errors in their
proceedings with the Prince; but the business is now by the Prince overcome,
if we our selves draw not back: For which I confess I should be heartily
sorry, and so I conceive would most honest men; for if this match, and the
alliance with Spain has been so long desired by his Majesty, and that for it
he has been pleased to do so much, and the Prince to take so hazardous a
voyage, if all the same r^^sons are yet on foot, which have ever moved the King
and Prince to wish the match; if to this may be added, that his Majesty has
overcome all the difficulties on his part, and that both he, and the Prince do
stand engaged for the performance of it, as far as Princes can be, God forbid,
that any particular distastes, or misunderstandings (which God knows have
little relation to the business) should be of power to disturb it, especially
now, when the Match is past all danger of miscarrying, the portion, and all
temporal Articles settled, and I hope to the Kings Content, and all other good
effects that could be expected by this alliance in a very fair way, I hope
there will be no cause of doubt in this kind; if there should be, I am sure
that your Lordship would put to a helping hand to keep the business from being
overthrown, since you have done so much for the overcoming of former
difficulties, and the bringing it to the pass it is now in. If there be no
cause of writing this, I beseech your Lordship to impute it to my zeal to the
business, and my freeness with your Lordship, upon whose true love and
friendship I so much rely, as I shall not forbear to tell you, any of my fears.
I hope within 3. days Sir Francis Cottington will be able to begin his journey
toward your Lordship. He will tell you many truths, being on my knowledge, as
hearty a servant and friend as it is possible for your Lordship to have. He has
told me how much I am bound to your Lordship for your love, and favor, and
truly I will deserve it the best I can, and that I think will be only by
loving you, for otherwise I conceive I am like to have little means of meriting
at any bodies hands, yet at your Lordships it may be I may, by being a man of
honesty, and honor; And such an one I will lubour to be, and your affectionate
friend and servant. And so I kiss your Lordships hands.

Madrid, etc.
The E. of Bristols Letter to the Prince, touching the delivery of his Proxy
to the King of Spain.
May it please your Highness,
IN this Letter I shall only speak unto your Highness concerning that
particular whereof you were pleased to write unto me after your departure from
St. Lorenzo, and have presumed to set down exactly the case as it stands. In
what sort a woman betrothed, and post Matrimonium ratum, may before the
Consummation of marriage betake her self unto a religious life; I have likewise
set down unto your Highness all sorts of security, that may be taken before
the betrothing for the preventing of any such course in the parties, that are
to be betrothed. To this your Highness may add any other you can think of,
for that the King, and his Sister, and all the Ministers profess so really the
punctual and present performance of all that is capitulated with your
Highness; That they will refuse no kind of security, that in reason can be
demanded in this behalf: so that your Highness may set down, whatsoever you
think this King and his Sister may do with decency, and honor, and they will
be ready to perform it.

I must now crave leave to speak unto your Highness like a faithful plain
servant, which is, if your Highness pleasure be to have use made of the Powers
you have left in my hands; I no way doubt, but in this particular such
satisfaction will be given, as will appear reasonable to all the world. But if
your Highness desire, that these Powers should not be used, they may be
detained upon other just reasons which will arise in the treaty of the
temporal articles. And I doubt not but the Deposorio's may be deferred for some
few days upon other fair pretexts. But these inconveniences I conceive will
follow. First it will be of great discomfort to the Infanta, who until the
Deposorio's are past, is not her own woman, but must be governed by the
pleasure of the Junto, which I think she is very weary of, neither till then
may she declare her self to be yours, nor Comply with your Highesse in
answering of your Letters, and Messages, and giving you those respects, and
Comforts, which I know she would be glad to do. But if she should any way
judge, that the delay of the Deposorios should arise from your Highness part, I
conceive she would take it most heavily. Secondly, it will certainly raise
great jealousies in this King, and his Ministers, and retard the resolutions,
that are fit to be taken with speed for the putting in execution that which is
capitulated. I therefore offer it unto your Highness wisdom, whether upon the
satisfaction, which they will give in this particular, which will be whatsoever
you can desire; and upon the agreement of the temporal articles your Highness
would upon the coming of the Popes approbation make any farther scruple in the
delivering of your Highness powers; If I shall, I am confident they will not
press it, as not decent for the woman's part to urge the hasting of the
Marriage. But I conceive it will cast such a cloud of Jealousy and distrust
upon the business, that besides the discontent and affliction, which I know it
will give the Infanta (which most works upon me,) it will so disorder the
business, that it will make a stand in your whole proceedings, and
preparations, wherein they now go on cheerfully, and confidently, and I
conceive will punctually perform all that they have capitulated with your
Highness. I dare not so much as give my self leave once to question your
Highness intentions of proceeding to the real effecting of the match, which
makes me desirous that all things may be executed, that may any way retard or
disturb it. Only I shall like a faithful poor servant presume to say thus much
to your Highness; That for diverse years past, I know the King your father, and
your self, have held this the fittest Match in the World, and by a desire of
effecting it, your Highness was induced to undertake that hazardous journey of
coming to this Court in person. In the time of your being here, (admitting that
their proceedings have been in many things unworthy of you.) And that diverse
distastes have grown by intervenient accidents; Now things are reduced to those
terms, that the Match it self is sure, the portion, and the temporal Articles
settled (I hope to the Kings liking and yours) And all other good effects that
could be hoped for by this alliance, are in a fair way. If to these reasons may
be added, That on his Majesty and your Highness part, you have already passed
by, and overcome the main difficulties; and your Highness by your journey has
satisfied your self of the person of the Infanta, God forbid, that either any
personal distastes of Ministers, or any indiscreet, or passionate carriage of
businesses should hazard that, which his Majesty and your Highness have done
so much to obtain, and whereby doubtless so much good, and peace is to accrue
to Christendom by the effecting of it; and contrariwise so much trouble and
mischief by the miscarrying of it. Besides the individual happiness of your
Highness in such a Wife, which the World supposes you infinitely esteem for
her person. And for her Birth and Portion is no where to be matched; And
questionless for her virtue, and settled affection to your Highness deserves
you better then any woman in the World. I humbly crave pardon for writing unto
your Highness in this manner, which I hope your Highness well enough knows,
neither the benefits I have received from Spain, nor their grateful usage of me
upon occasions (nor I protest unto your Highness any other earthly respect)
moves me unto it, but the zeal, and love I bear to your service, for which I
shall ever undervalue any thing, that may concern my self. And therefore I
shall conclude by entreating your Highness, that if you would have things go
well, that a Post may instantly be dispatched back unto me, authorizing me to
deliver the said power upon the arrival of the dispensation, and having taken
fitting security in this particular point. And this I earnestly beseech your
Highness may be done with all possible speed and secrecy; and that the
Spanish Ambassadors may not know that ever there was any suspension made of
the delivery of the powers. In the interim I will find means if the
dispensation come for 20, or 24 days to allege some other fair pretexts for
the deferring of the Deposorios; But herein I desire I may know your Highness
resolution with all possible speed, etc. And so with, etc.

Madrid. Bristol.

The E. of Bristol to the Prince his Highness, September. 24. 1623.
When your Highness shall remember, that your Highness being here in person,
it was not possible in less then a month, to get that dispatched which you
were promised Mr. Secretary Cottington should have carried with him, if your
Highness would have but stayed him 24 hours; I hope you will pardon your
servants although they sometimes mistake in the time, which they limit for the
procuring of the dispatch of business, especially if they depend upon the
dispatches, that are to be procured from them. I have these 10. days had
Greisly in a readiness to depart, having every day expected a resolution from
the Junto. First in point of the portion, and since in the days of payment,
and at last I have received their answer in them both, in such sort as your
Highness will see in the paper enclosed, which is an extract of the heads of
the temporal Articles that we have agreed, although I have only consented unto
them de been esse, until I shall receive his Majesty's approbation and yours:
In the point of the portion, I have had a tough and a knotty piece of work, by
reason that not only the Conde de Olivarez, but all the Junto were absolutely
ignorant of what had passed in the late Kings time, which I foresaw, and that
was the cause that I moved so earnestly at the Escurial, to have the Conde de
Gondomar remain here. They made many presidents to be searched, and found that
the two millions demanded was four times as much as ever was given with any
daughter of Spain in money. They alleged that it would be said, that the King
of Spain was fain to purchase the friendship and alliance of England; that this
would be such a president, as that Spain hereafter must marry no more
daughters. I only insisted that it was a thing, by the last King settled, and
agreed with me, that this King had by several answers in writing to me
undertaken to pursue the business as it was left by his father, and to make
good whatsoever he had promised. And thereupon desired that the original
Papers, and Consultos of the last King might be seen, which very honestly by
the Secretary Cirica were produced, and appeared to be such, that I dare say,
there was not a man that saw them, that doubts of the last Kings real
intention of making the Match. And questionless this had been the usefullest
occasion to have disavowed former proceedings, and I was resolved to put them
to it. But both the King and his Council upon the sight of what had been
promised by his father, presently took resolution to make good the two
millions, only to remonstrate unto his Majesty the vastness of the Portion,
and to desire him to consider how far the King had stretched himself in this
particular for his satisfaction. And therefore, that he would have
Consideration of it in such things for the future, as might be treated of
betwixt them, and their Kingdoms. As for the days of payment, I insisted to
have had half a million upon the Deposories, half a million to be carried along
with the Infanta, and the other million at their Fleets the two next years
after by equal portions. But I have now received the Kings answer in this
particular, which your Highness will see in the enclosed paper; as likewise
what I have done therein by the Copy of the dispatch, which I now write about
it to Mr. Secretary. So not having any thing more to add concerning this
particular, I recommend your highness to Gods holy protection, etc.

Madrid.
The E of Bristol to the Duke of Buckingham, December. 6. 1623.
May it please your Grace,
THe present estate of the Kings affairs requires the concurrencie of all his
servants, and the Cooperation of all his Ministers, which makes me desirous
to make unto your Grace this tender of my service, that if there have happened
any errors, or misunderstandings your Grace would for that regard pass them
over: and for any thing that may personally concern my particular, I shall
labor to give you that satisfaction as may deserve your friendship. And if
that shall not serve the turn, I shall not be found unarmed with patience
against any thing that can happen unto me. And so wishing, that this humble
offer of my service may find that acceptance as I humbly desire, I rest

Madrid. Your Graces most humble servant, Bristol.

The E. of Bristol to Secretary Cottington, Apr. 15. 1623.
Good Mr. Secretary Cottington,
THere is no man living knows better then your self, how zealous I have been
unto the Prince's service, and whilst I thought he desired the Match, I was
for it against all the World. Now the Treaty is ended, the world shall see I
never had, nor will have any affections of my own, but will wholly follow my
Masters, as I have written unto you in my former Letters, and have not these
four months spoken a word in the marriage. If his Majesty and the Prince will
have a war, I will spend my life and fortunes in it, without so much as
replying in what quarrel soever it be. And of thus much I entreat you let his
Highness be informed by you. And I entreat you let me know his directions,
what he will have me do, and how to behave my self, for I absolutely cast my
self at his feet, which I desire to do the first thing after my landing, to the
end that understanding his pleasure, I may commit no error. I beseech you to
dispatch this bearer back unto me withal possible speed, though it be with not
one word more, but what the Prince will have me do, wherewith I shall come muy
Consolado. I understand that I have been much bound to the Prince for the
procuring the 4000 l. to be paid, and for my Pension.

I pray present unto him my most humble thanks: and I confess I have been much
more comforted with that demonstration of his favor, then I can be with the
money. I doubt not but at this time I shall have the effects of a real
friendship from you in this particular. And so desiring to have my service
remembered to my Lady Cottington, I rest

Poitiers. Yours, etc. Bristol.
Postscript.
I Pray move the Prince, that one of the Kings Ships may be presently appointed
to waft me over; For I have a great charge of of the Princes with me.

W. Greisly met me within 10. posts of Bordeaux, and is passed on to Madrid, I
think he shall find the Blandones for his Highness in a readiness, for Mr.
Stone takes care of them, and has the money in his hand.



The E. of Bristol to his Majesty 27 July, 1624.
May it please your most excellent Majesty,
I Hope your Majesty will not be displeased that I continue unto you that most
humble and just suit, which I have often made unto your Majesty, and your
Majesty has been often graciously pleased to promise, which was that I should
be no ways lessened, or diminished in your Majesty's favor, and good opinion,
until you should be first pleased graciously to hear me, and my Cause. And
although your Majesty for just respects, has not been pleased hitherto to
admit me into your presence, which I esteem an infinite misfortune to me: Yet I
hope that time will no way confirm those impressions of displeasure, which I do
no way doubt, but will be fully cleared, whenever I shall be so happy as by
your Majesty to be heard. For I take God to record, that I have faithfully and
honestly served you, and exactly pursued your ends to the best of my
understanding, and abilities. And I do no way doubt but your Majesty will in
the end protect so faithful a servant as I have been, and shall appear to be to
your Majesty. And in the interim my most humble suit unto your Majesty is,
that since I am neither admitted my self, nor any man else will speak any word
in my defense, or justification, your Majesty according to your Justice, will
let nothing that may be said of me redound to my prejudice in your gracious
opinion: For it shall be found, that I will in all things wholly conform my
self unto your Majesty's will and pleasure. So wishing unto your Majesty a
happy journey, and a safe return with the increase of all happiness. I humbly,
etc.

London. Your Majesty's, etc. Bristol.

Here next of all follow diverse Dispatches and Letters from Sir Walter Aston to
the Duke.
Sir Walter Aston to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
I Have received so much comfort by the care which I see in your grace to take
all occasions to honor, and favor me, that I should be glad (if it were
possible) in my affection to your person, and in my desire to serve you, that
your grace might see something in me above what you cold find in any other
servant. What an honest thankfulness can be. I am, and what an honest servant
can yield you, shall be ever vigilant in me to serve you. Since the departure
of the last post (by whom I wrote lately unto your Grace) my Lord of Bristol
has had audience with this King (taking me along with him) to whom his
Lordship represented the King our Masters desire concerning the Palatinate in
conformity to what his Majesty has commanded by his late letters, we are now
soliciting to hasten this kings answer, which we hope we shall shortly send
unto his Majesty, and there is no diligence omitted by my Lord of Bristol, nor
my self (that we can think on) to negotiate such an answer, as may be to his
majesty's good liking. The Dispatches from Rome are not yet come, but by
letters which they have lately received from the Duke of Pastrana; it is
advertized, that all things are concluded, and that he would send them away
within a few days. By my Lord of Bristols Letter to his Majesty, your grace
will understand the resolution, which his Lordship has taken concerning his
proceedings upon the arival of of the dispaches from Rome: his Lordships has
communicated with me his Majesty's Letter, and desired my opinion concerning
the resolution, which he had taken, wherein I have concurred with his Lordship,
not understanding it any way to be differing in substance from his Majesty's
directions; the altering of the day mentioned in his Majesty's letters being
only the changing it from a time when the powers are of no force, to a time
when they may be of use: the putting of any thing in execution in the one time,
or in the other, depending upon his Majesty's, and his Highnesses further
directions. I have hitherto understood, that his Majesty and his highness have
really affected this match, and have labored faithfully to second their
desires with my utmost endeavors. There is none I am sure a better witness
then my self of the affection which your Grace has born unto it, which I have
seen remain constant through many trials. And therefore until I understand the
contrary from your self, I must believe that your desires are the same, which I
have seen them. I must ever speak my heart freely unto your Grace, and confess
that upon the letter which I received from his Highness, and upon the sight of
his Majesty's to my Lord of Bristol, I have been jealous of his Majesty's heart
and his Highness, that they are not that to the match which they have been;
but these are but distrusts of my own, and not foundation sufficient to slacken
or cool those diligences which I daily perform in conformity to his Majesty's,
and his Highness Commands, and to what remains apparent of their desires. I
shall therefore humbly desire your Lordship to open mine eyes, and if I am out
of the way to let me straight, for I have no affections of mine own, but what
agrees with my Masters, and will ever submit with all humility my self, and my
judgment unto his Majesty's wisdom, and faithfully labor to serve him
accordingly to what I shall understand to be his will and pleasure. But until
I know by your Graces favor by what Compass to guide my Course, I can only
follow his Majesty's revealed will; and will once take the boldness to
represent unto your Grace in discharge of what I owe you these Considerations,
which my desire to serve you, forces from me. I do look upon your Grace as a
person infinitely provoked to be an enemy to this match, and believe, that you
have had represented unto you many reasons, showing how much it concerns you to
seek to break it, with all the force you have: But I can neither believe, that
the error of one man can make you an enemy to that, which brings along with it
so much happiness and content unto his Majesty, and his Highness: nor that
your Graces judgment can be led by those arguments, that under the color of
safety, would bring you into a dangerous labyrinth. Your Grace has given noble
testimony, how little you have valued your own safety in respect of his
Majesty's service, and therefore I assure my self you would contemn all
Considerations concerning your self, that might hinder the advancement of his
Majesty's ends. In the proceeding to this Match, there is the same convenience
to his Majesty, that ever has been, there is the same Lady, the same portion,
the same friendship desired, they professing here an exact complying with what
is capitulated, and a resolution to give his Majesty satisfaction in
whatsoever is in their power. From your Grace none can take away the honor of
having been the principal means by which this great business has been brought
to a Conclusion. And whatsoever others may suggest against your Grace, the
Infanta truly informed, cannot but understand you the person to whom she owes
most in this business. Your Grace, and the Conde Olivarez, have fallen upon
different ways, that which concerns the honor of the King our Master, being
different to that, which he understood concerned most his Master, your ends
were both one for the effecting of the Match, and with the Conclusion of it, he
cannot but better understand you. Would your Grace would commit it to my charge
to inform the Infanta what you have merited, and to accommodate all other
mistakes here concerning the proceeding. If your Grace would reconcile your
heart, I would not doubt, but with the Conclusion of the Match to compose all
things to your good satisfaction, and to bring them to a truer understanding of
you, and of their obligation unto you. In what a Sea of Confusions the breaking
of this alliance would engage his Majesty, I will leave to your Lordships
wisdom to consider of, it being too large a discourse for a Letter.

I will therefore only desire your Lordship to consider, that even the most
prosperous War has misfortune enough in it to make the Author of it unhappie:
of which how innocent soever your Lordship is, the occasions that have been
given you, will ever make you liable to the aspersion of it. This I write not
unto your Grace as thinking to divert you from what you are falling into; for I
am confident your heart runs a more peaceable way: but I am willing, that you
should see, that howsoever others should be inclined to carry you into this
tempest, it concerns you, in your care of their happiness, and your own, to
divert them from it. I humbly desire your Grace to pardon this error of mine
(if it be one) which I can excuse with the affection, and infinite desire,
which I have to see you ever happy and flourish.

Concerning my self, your Grace knows my wants, and I doubt not but your Care
is what I could wish. I should be glad when you have done with Peter Wych to
see him dispatched away with some supplies unto me, which I shall be in extreme
want of by Christmasse, my debts besides in England being clamorous upon me for
some satisfaction. I leave all to your Graces care and favor, Ever resting

Your Graces humblest and most bound servant, Wa: Aston.
Postscript.
THe Condessa of Olivarez bids me tell you, that she kisses your Graces hands,
and does every day recommend you particularly by name in her prayers to God.



Sir Walter Aston to the Duke, 15. November. 1623.
May it please your Grace,
MY Lord of Bristol intended to have dispatched away a Post unto his Majesty
this night with the advice of the arrival of the dispensation, which came to
this Town the 12th. of this month, hoping that he should have been likewise
able to have given to his Majesty, and his Highness a clear account of all
things concerning it. But the deliverie of the Queen this morning (who is
brought to bed of a daughter) has stopped all negotiation, and I believe it
will be these two days before he can be ready to send him away. There is no
noveltie (as I yet understand) that is come with the dispensation; there will
be something desired for better explanation of his Majesty's, and his Highness
intentions, and some omissions there are which as they understand was his
Highness intention should have been in the Capitulation, they being promised
by his Highness. But I do not find that these will be any stop to the
business. For they do press my Lord of Bristol very much to proceed presently
to the Deposories. Your Grace shall understand all things more particularly by
the next Post. I do now make the more haste, forbearing to trouble you with
other occurrences, lest my Letters come short of the departure of the Post, as
they did of his who was last dispatched from hence.

I do most humbly desire your Grace to continue the doing me those offices that
may continue me in his Majesty's and his Highness good opinion, and I doubt
not but I shall be ever able to let your Grace see that you have not a more
faithful servant, then he which your Grace has most bound to be so, and that
shall ever remain

Yours, etc. W. A.

The Lord Duke of Buckingham to Sir Walter Aston.
IN your Letter of the 5th. of December, you desire me to give you my opinion,
my ancient acquaintance, long custom of loving you, with constancy of
friendship invites me to do you this office of good will, and to serve you
according to your request. And for your more entire satisfaction, I will
deliver the things in the past and present. You in all the beginning of the
treaty won to your self a good estimation, while you were only at large in the
treaty, and had communication of the passages from the Lord of Bristol, as by
courtesy: and in his absence handled no farther in the treaty of marriage then
by direction from him. When the Prince was there, your carriage gave his
Highness and my self all satisfaction. Now you must give me leave to put you
in mind of the freedom used with you whilst we were at Madrid, and of the
explanation, the Prince made of himself to you by his Letters from St. Anderas.
From which you might observe, the resentment the Prince had of their
proceedings with him. And by his Highness declaration to you from thence, you
might see both his care and resolution not to engage himself into the marriage
without good conditions for the Pallatinate, and Conservation of his honor
every way. My care and my intentions were to move increase of honor to you,
and to recompense by a good understanding to be laid in his Majesty toward
you, which I pursued so soon, as I came to the Kings presence. And the Princes
confidence was so great in you, as he joined you in the Commission, besides he
declared himself to you by his Letters, not leaving you thereby to guess at
his Majesty's directions to the E. of Bristol, which he was to communicate to
you. Now you may think how strange it was to the Prince, and how much I was
troubled (not being able to make your excuse) when your joint Letters made
known, how you had concurred with the Earl of Bristol, to engage his Highness
by prefixing a day for the Deposorios, without making certain the restitution
of the Palatinate and Electoral dignity, the portion and temporal articles.
Which proceeding of yours with the Earl of Bristol was so understood by the
Lords of the Committee, as they took resolution once, to advise his Majesty to
revoke both the Lord of Bristol, and you, upon those grounds, which you will
understand by his Majesty's own Letters, and Secretary Conwayes Letters
written to you with this dispatch. I was not able at first by any endeavor to
oppose the resolution of your revocation, so far had you cast your self into
misconstruction, and given stop to the progress of your own advancement. But
with constant industry and time, I have won this point, of qualifying all ill
opinion of you, and sufferance of your continuing there. So as it will be now
in your power (by your Carriage) to come off without reproof. And I shall hope
to overcome the rest with time, to to bring you again to the condition of
honor and recompense. Being confident that since you see your own error, and
acknowledge it, you will be careful by a stiff and judicious carriage to
warrant all your present and succeding actions. If you think at first sight I
press you a little hard upon this point, you may be pleased to interpret it to
be a faithful way of satisfying your request, and expression of my affection to
have you to do all things suitable to your wisdom virtue and honor, and
according to the wishes of

Yours, etc. G. Buckingham.

The Duke of Buckingham to Sir Wa. Aston.
I Had not leisure in my former dispatch, being hasty to write the reason why
I wondered at, the error you committed in the last dispatch of my Lord of
Bristols and yours; for the matter is, that his Majesty having plainly
written unto you both in his former dispatch, that he desired to be assured of
the restitution of the Palatinate, before the Deposorium was made, seeing he
would be sorry to welcome home one Daughter with a smiling cheer, and leave
his own only Daughter at the same time weeping and disconsolate. And the
Prince having also written unto you, that he never meant to match there, and be
frustrated of the restitution of the Palatinate so often promised, that
notwithstanding this clear Language, you should have joined with my Lord of
Bristol in a resolution of so hasty a delivery of the Prince's Proxy, before
you had received his Majesty's answer to your former dispatch, wherein my Lord
of Bristol urged of his Majesty a harsh answer and direction, and his Majesty
cannot but take it for a kind of Scorn, that within 4. days after ye had urged
his Majesty's answer, ye should in the mean time take resolutions of your own
heads. You may do well, because there is no leisure in this hasty dispatch for
his Majesty to answer my Lord of Bristols last Letter (which will be done by
the next duplicate of this same dispatch) to acquaint him in the mean time with
this Letter, which his Majesty himself has dictated unto me. And so in haste
I bid you farewell.

Yours, etc. G. B.

Sir Walter Aston to the Duke of Buckingham, December. 22. 1623.
May it please your Grace,
I Have committed to the trust and secrecy of this bearer Mr. Clark (whom I
find your Graces faithful servant) certain advertisements to be delivered by
him unto you; which as one that shall (God willing) in all things show himself
your passionate servant, I could no way conceal from you. And howsoever your
Grace may have many advertisements from hence (the relations that come from
England giving occasion to many discourses censuring the Prince, and your
Grace) yet I hope to be so vigilant, that there shall hardly be any resolution
taken by these Ministers which may have any reflection on your Person, that I
shall not one way or other get notice of, and advertize unto you.

I have in all things with so much affection desired to serve your Grace every
way to your satisfaction, that it has infinitely afflicted me, that I should
have done any thing, whereby I might lessen your favorable opinions toward
me, but I hope your Grace has by this time set me straight both with his
Majesty, and his Highness, and restored me to the same place in your
affection, which I have formerly had. Which I am the rather confident of, since
I cannot accuse any action, or thought of mine, that has not born toward your
Grace all possible respect and love. I found by experience here, that the
favor which by your Graces means I received from his Highness, and that
which you were pleased likewise to honor me withal, had raised me many
enemies; And I have reason to fear upon this occasion, there may be some, that
well be busy to do me ill offices with you; but I trust so much upon my own
sincerity, that as I never made any second means unto your Grace, but have
ever singly depended upon the constancy of your goodness to me, finding my
self the same that I have ever been, I make no means to resist such injuries
as others may offer to do me, but continue depending wholly upon that
goodness, and justness, which I know in your Grace, and which I assure my
self will never fail me. I have not been so careless a Servant of your Graces,
as not to have debated over, and over with my self, how far the proceedings or
breaking of the present treaty here might concern your Grace, which I have
discoursed largely to Mr. Clark, thinking them of too large a body to be
contained in a Letter, but I shall in all things submit my self to your better
wisdom; And when you shall please to impart unto me, wherein his Majesty,
and his Highness shall be best served, your Grace shall find in all my
actions, that my affections with all obedience shall run the same way, and that
my proceedings, shall have those respects in them toward your Grace, as you
may expect from your faithful Servant. And so, etc.

Your G. etc. W. A.

The Copy of a Memorial given to the King of Spain, 19. Jan. 1623. Still. Vet.
Translated.
SIR,
SIR Walter Aston Ambassador of the King of great Britain says, That the
King his Master has commanded him to represent unto your Majesty, that having
received so many promises from hence to procure the entire restitution of the
Palatinate, and Electoral dignity to the Prince his Son in Law, He commanded
his Ambassador to press your Majesty with all diligence, that the said
promises might take effect, not as a condition of the marriage, but desiring
infinitely to see settled together with the marriage, the peace and quiet of
his Son in Law, his Daughter, and Grandchildren; and having understood that
this his desire has received an interpretation far differing from his
intention, has commanded him anew for the greater demonstration of the desire
which he has to preserve the good Correspondence with your Majesty, to
declare unto you, that he has not propounded the said restitutions as a
condition of the marriage, but according to that which he understood was most
Conformable with the intention of your Majesty, declared by the Conde de
Olivarez for the surest, and most effectual means to make the amity, which is
betwixt your Majesty's firm and indissoluble, and that there might not remain
any doubt or matter hereafter, that should cause dispute, he has required that
every thing might be settled under your Majesty's hand, desiring it likewise
for the greater comfort of his only Daughter, and for to make the coming of
that most excellent Princess of more esteem unto his Subjects, bringing with
her (besides the glory of her own virtue, and worth) the security of a
perpetual peace, and amity, and an everlasting pawn to his Kingdoms of the
constancy, and real performance of your Majesty's promises, with such
satisfaction to his hopes grounded the said promises, not as a Condition, but
as the fruit and blessing of the alliance. Moreover he says, That the King his
Master has commanded him to make this Declaration unto your Majesty, that you
may know the truth and the sound intentions of his proceedings, with the good
end to which it aims, having renewed the powers, and deferred the delivery of
them only to give time for the accomplishing, and settling that which has
been promised for the satisfying his expectations, and assuring the amity
betwixt your Majesty's Persons, and Crowns; the King his Master hoping that
your Majesty will likewise lay hold of this occasion, which you now have in
your hand to give him full satisfaction in that, which with so much reason he
desires, and therewithal a reciprocal, and everlasting blessing to both your
Majesty's Crowns.

Sir Walter Aston to the Duke, 22. of Jan. 1623. Still. Vet.
May it please your Grace,
HOwsoever upon the arrival of Mr. Greisley, I took the occasion of the
ordinary, the day following to acknowledge unto your Grace the Comfort which I
had received by your Letters; understanding by them the favor which you had
done me, in diverting from me his Majesty's, and his Highness displeasure: I
shall notwithstanding entreat here leave by the same means by which I received
so much happiness to renew my humble, and most thankful acknowledgment unto
your Grace. I most earnestly entreat your Grace to look upon me here as a
servant that loves you in his heart, and that shall faithfully in all things
Comply with what you can expect from such an one, and that therefore you will
be pleased to preserve me still in the way, how I may serve his Majesty, and
his Highness to their Content, and perform toward your Grace those offices of
a servant, which may be most to your satisfaction. For I am now here in a
dangerous time, in the greatest businesses, that have been treated of many
years, and the bitterest storms threatening betwixt these Crowns, that have
been these many ages. I have therefore no hope to save my self without I be
guided by his Highness, and your Graces trusts and care of me.

The Marquess of Ynoisa has lately advertised hither, That he has several
times desired to have private audience with his Majesty, and has not been
able to procure any but what your Grace assists at. It is likewise advertised
unto this King and his Ministers, that your Grace has many meetings with the
Sea Captains, and that your Counsels are how the War is to be made against
Spain. For the avoiding of unnecessarie repetitions, I do here enclosed send
your Grace a Copy of my Letter to Mr. Secretary Conway, wherein you will find
a relation of all things that are come to my hands at this present, that may
any way have reflection unto his Majesty's service. And this is the course
which I intend, and conceive most convenient to hold hereafter with your Grace,
without you command me the contrary. In the said Copy your Grace will find a
discourse of what has lately passed betwixt my Lord of Bristol, and the Conde
of Olivarez in the Pardo. Now that I may more fully discharge my duty, I have
thought fit here to acquaint your Grace, that since the putting off of the
Deposorios at a meeting that my Lord and my self had with the Conde, he did
make a solemn protestation, that if the Treaty of the Match did ever come on
again with effect, it should only be by his Lordships hands, and no other. I
then understood it, and still do, but for a frothy protestation, yet have held
it my duty to advertize it, having passed in my hearing; the truth is, that my
Lords answer was in Conformity to his last in the Pardo, every way rejecting
it, saying, That he had rather be confined to any Town in Afrique, then that
his person should be any hinderance to the Match. Thus forbearing to trouble
your Grace any farther, with my hearty prayers unto God for the continuance of
his blessings unto you. I rest

Your Graces, etc. W. A.

Sir Walter Aston to Secretary Conway, 22. Jan. 1623.
Right Honorable,
BY the return of this Bearer Mr. Greisley, you will understand of the safe
coming to my hands of your dispatch of the 30th. of the last month, with his
Majesty's Letters therein enclosed. I do now herewithal send an account unto
his Majesty of my proceedings upon his Commands, which I do entreat your
Honor to be pleased to present unto him, as also farther to acquaint his
Majesty, that I have already spoken with diverse of these Ministers, and given
them such a declaration of his Majesty's good intentions in the pressing at
this season for the restitutions of the Palatinate, and Electoral dignity unto
the Prince his Son in Law, as I have order to do by the said Letter, but do
find they are here so possessed with the ill relations they receive out of
England, that I with much difficulty can scarce give them any kind of
satisfaction. I have acquainted the Conde Olivarez with the answer, which your
honor, and Mr. Secretary Calvert had received from their Ambassadors
touching their audiences, the Conde himself having formerly acquainted me with
their Complaint. His answer now was, That he understood they had acknowledged
unto your Honors to have received from his Majesty in that point all kind of
satisfaction, but that after you were gone the Marquess of Ynoisa wrote a
Letter to Secretary Calvert, telling him, that he did not well remember
himself, of what had passed at his being there, but had since called to mind,
that he had procured some audiences with the Prince with much difficulty. To
which I answered the Conde, That it seemed the Marquess was very light of his
advertisements, to give such informations as might breed ill understandings
betwixt Princes, and esteem them of no more Consequence, then to forget what he
had advertised with so much ease. Concerning that malicious report here raised
of the Prince's treating a marriage in France. I desire your Honor to let his
Majesty know, that it is advertised hither out of England as a thing so
certain, that there is not a Minister of State (excepting the Conde of
Gondomar) that has not given some credit unto it. I have therefore according
to his Majesty's directions given such declarations touching the author and
believers of it, as your Honor in his Majesty's name has commanded me. I have
likewise received by Mr. Greisly your Letter of the 31. of the last: In answer
of which, all that I shall need to say here unto your Honor is, that my Lord
of Bristol has received your former Letter, acquainting him with his Majesty's
pleasure concerning the same business, from whom his Majesty will receive an
account thereof. This is all that I have to say to your Honor at this present
touching those particulars mentioned in your Letter; I shall now here further
acquaint you with such advertisements, as I conceive may any ways have
reference unto his Majesty's service. My Lord of Bristol, and my self repairing
some few days since unto the Pardo, having conference with the Conde of
Olivarez, his Lordship acquainted the Conde with the Letters of revocation,
which he had received from his Majesty, and withal desired that he would
procure him license to take his leave of the King. The Conde answered his
Lordship, That he had much to say unto him by order from his Majesty, the
substance of his speech was; That they had received large advertisements out of
England, by which they understood the hard measure that he was there likely to
suffer by the power of his enemies, and that the only crime, which they could
impute unto him, was for laboring to effect the marriage, which his Master
could not but take much to heart, and held himself obliged to publish to the
world the good service that my Lord had done unto the King of great Britain;
and therefore for the better encouragement likewise of his own and all other
Ministers that should truly serve their Masters, he was to offer him a blank
paper signed by the King, wherein his Lordship might set down his own
Conditions, and demands; which he said he did not propound to corrupt any
servant of his Majesty's, but for a public declaration of what was due unto
his Lordships proceedings. He said further, that in that offer, he laid before
him the Lands, and Dignities, that were in his Masters power to dispose of; out
of which he left it at his pleasure to choose what estate, or honor, he should
think good, adding thereunto some other extravagant and disproportionable
offers. My Lords answer was, That he was very sorry to hear this language used
unto him, telling the Conde, that his Catholic Majesty did owe him nothing,
but that what he had done was upon the King his Masters Commands, and without
any intention to serve Spain. And that howsoever he might have reason to fear
the power of his enemies, yet he trusted much upon the innocence of his own
Cause, and the Justice of the King, and that he could not understand himself in
any danger: but were he sure to lose his head at his arrival there, be would go
to throw down himself at his Majesty's feet and mercy, and rather there die
upon a Scaffold, then be Duke of Infantada in Spain. On the 16th. of this
month, there was declared here in Council a resolution of this King, to make a
journey to his frontier Towns in Andaluzia, with an intention to begin his
journey upon the 29. of this month Still. Vet. And as I am informed his
Majesty will there entertain himself the greatest part of these three months
following; so that his return hither will not be until the beginning of May. My
Lord of Bristol has sent diverse to the Conde for leave to dispeed himself of
the King, but in respect of his Majesty's being at the Pardo, he has been
hitherto delayed, and has yet no certain day appointed for it: But I conceive
it will be sometime this week. The Cause of the delaying of his Lordships
admittance to the King, as I understand is, that the same day that his Lordship
shall declare his revocation to the King, they will here in Council declare the
revocation of the Marquess of Ynoisa. Howsoever in respect of the Kings
departure, (at which time they use here to embarge all the mules, and means of
carriage in this Town) I believe his Lordship will not begin his journey so
soon as he intended.

All the relations which are lately come out of England do wish them to
entertain themselves here with no farther hopes, that there is any intention to
proceed to the Match; and this advice comes accompanied with such a report of
the state of all things there, that has much irritated all these Ministers,
and let loose the tongues of the people against the proceedings of his
Majesty, and Highness. I labor as much as I can, and as far as my directions
will give me latitude, to give them better understandings of the real
intentions of his Majesty and Highness: but diverse of them clearly tell me,
That I profess one thing, and the actions of his Majesty and Highness (upon
the which they must ground their belief) are differing from it. I shall
therefore here in discharge of my duty advertize your Honor, that they do here
expect nothing but a War, about which they have already held diverse Councels,
and go seriously to work, preparing themselves for what may happen. Which I
desire your Honor to advertize his Majesty, being high time, as far as I am
able to judge, that am here upon the place, that his Majesty do either resolve
upon some course for the allaying of these storms; or that he go in hand with
equal preparations. Having observed in former times, the strange rumors that
have run in England upon small foundations; I have thought it fit to prevent
the credit which may be given to idle relations by advertizing your Honor that
I cannot conceive how any great attempt can be made from hence this year;
howsoever businesses should go. The Squadron of the Kings Fleet (under the
Command of Don Fadrique de Toledo) is come into Cadiz, and joined with that
which Don Juan Taxardo is Captain of. And as I am credibly informed, this King
will have by the end of April between 50. and 60. Gallions at Sea. It is true
that other years the number commonly falls short of what is expected, and their
setting forth to Sea some months later then the time appointed, but there is
extraordinary care taken this year, that there be no default in neither.

The chief end (that I can understand) of this Kings journey being to see the
Fleet of Plate come in, to take view of his Armado, and see them put to Sea.
That which I understand is only left alive of the Marriage here is, that the
Jewels, which the Prince left with this King for the Infanta and her Ladies,
are not yet returned, but it is intimated unto me, that if the Letters which
they shall receive out of England upon the answer they have given to his
Majesty about the business of the Palatinate be no better, then such as they
have lately received, they will return the Jewels, and declare the business of
the Match for broken. I shall therefore entreat your Honor to know his
Majesty's pleasure how I shall carry my self, if they be offered unto me, being
resolved in the mean time until I shall know his Majesty's pleasure, if any
such thing happen, absolutely to refuse them. The Princess some few days
since fell sick of a Calentura, of which she remains still in her bed, though
it be said she is now somewhat better. I will conclude with many thanks for
your friendly advertizements concerning my own particular, which (God willing)
as far as I can, I will observe, and do earnestly entreat you, that you will
please to continue the like favors unto me, which I shall highly esteem of.
And so with a grateful acknowledgment of my obligations, I rest

Your Honors, etc. Wa. Aston.

Sir Walter Aston to the Lord Conway.
Right Honorable,
I Have advertized by former dispatches, that the Parliament here had granted
unto this King 60 millions of Ducats to be paid in 12 years, which with 12
millions which remain yet unpaid of what was given the King at the last
Session, this King was to receive 72 millions in the 12 years next following. I
shall now acquaint your Honor, that there are only 19. Cities that have voice
in this Parliament, and that each of them do send hither two Provadores, (as
they call them here) but these have no power finally to conclude any thing, but
what is agreed on by them is to be approved of by the said Cities or the
greatest number of them before it have the force of an Act of Parliament, and
that therefore there has been all possible art used to procure the Cities to
confirm what has been granted by their Procuradores touching the 60. millions;
and it is here thought that one of the motives of this Kings journey was,
hoping by the authority of his presence to procure the consent unto the said
gift of the 4. Cities which he is to pass by in this journey, namely Cordova,
Sivel, Joen, and Granado, it being here doubted, that the said Cities might
make great opposition to the said grant, notwithstanding his Majesty has not
had such success as was expected. But Cordova which was the first City with
which his Majesty began, has absolutely refused to give their Consent,
letting his Majesty understand, though in as fair and respectful terms as they
could express themselves. That it was a demand impossible for them to Comply
withal. What the success of this may be is doubtful, Cordova having given but
an ill example to the other Cities, and yet it is rather believed here, that
the greatest number of them being under the Command of such as are either this
Kings servants, or absolutely under his dispose, that his Majesty will be able
to overcome the business, and they are now busy how to settle the manner of
the leavie of the said sum by yearly and equal portions.

They having found here diverse inconveniences in their new Government of
Portugal by way of Governors, are resolved to place Vice-Kings again there.
And for to gratify the Emperor have elected for that charge his third Brother
Don Carlos, who is presently to make his repair thither. On the 27th. of the
last month, my Lord of Bristol took his leave of the Queen and the Infanta,
and on the Sunday following being the 29. of the said month, his Lordship
delivered unto me the Powers which his Highness left with him, and those which
have been since sent hither. His Lordship is preparing for his journey, and
says that he is already in such a forwardness, as upon the arrival here of
Mr. Greisley, or any other from England, whereby he shall receive means for the
taking up of moneys here, he will presently put himself upon the way. The Queen
here some few days since fell suddenly ill, and swooned two or three times,
but her indisposition lasted not above two or three days; Her Majesty is now
(thanks be to God) very well again. The King having received advice thereof
intended (as it is said) to come presently post hither, but upon better news,
his Majesty proceeds in his journey, and for any thing that I can understand,
it will be May before his return to this Town.

There are lately thrown abroad in this Town diverse Copies of a Proclamation
pretended to be published in Ireland bearing date the 27. of January last. It
has made a great noise here, and diverse of their Ministers have spoken with me
about it, they conceiving it to be contrary to what has been lately
Capitulated. For my part, I have been able to give them no answer, not having
yet understood from your Honor, nor any of his Majesty's Ministers, of any
such Proclamation. I have seen the Proclamation as it came printed from thence,
and do here enclosed send your Honor a Copy thereof, desiring you that you
will acquaint his Majesty therewithal, that he may be pleased to Command
therein what to his wisdom shall seem fit. To those that have spoken with me
about this Proclamation (having first disclaimed the having had knowledge of
any such thing) I have used discourses of mine own touching the abuses of those
which are called titulary Archbishops, Bishops, etc. letting them understand
here, that if those kind of people have been busy there to plant secretly
their Government, they have far exceeded the favor which was promised them,
and given his Majesty just cause to give order for the reformation.

My last to your Honor was of the 7th. of February last by Albert Rivas, whom
I dispatched with all diligence to you, since when I have received nothing from
your Honor. I shall therefore, etc.

Your Honors, etc. Wa. Aston.

Sir Walter Aston to the Lord Conway, 5th. June. 1624.
Right Honorable,
IN a former Dispatch which I lately made unto your Honor, I sent unto you the
Copy of a Letter, which I then had newly received from the Secretary Don
Andreas de Prada, by which he advertised me, That the King his Master
(according to what I had requested by memorial) had commanded, that all English
Commodities and Manufactures (which I have long since advertized were
prohibited by Prematica's published here for the reformation of abuses) should
enter into these Kingdoms. I have long since performed diverse diligences my
self, both with the Secretary, and President of Castile, for the procuring a
declaration of the said order, being careful to prevent such inconveniences as
the King our Masters Subjects might fall into for want thereof. But having been
tossed up and down between the Secretary, and the President with several
delays, the one remitting me to the other. I repaired to the Conde of Olivarez
(suspecting some novelty in the business) and acquainted him, that upon the
receipt of a Letter sent me from the Secretary Don Andreas de Prada, concerning
the free entrance of English Commodities, I had given notice by a Copy of the
said Letter unto the King my Master of what was therein Commanded, and had
likewise advertised the Merchants that reside in these Kingdoms of the said
Order. I also gave him account of the several diligences which I had performed
with the President, and the Secretary, for the procuring a declaration thereof,
and desired that he would presently command that there might be such course
taken, that there should be no further delays used therein, since I should be
loath to see the King my Masters Subjects encouraged by the said Order to
repair hither with their Merchandises, and fall into inconveniences for want
of notice given thereof unto their Ministers in the Ports. The Conde fell into
discourses far from my expectation, asking me whether it was not free for any
King, in his own Kingdom, to Command his own Subjects to wear what he pleased,
saying further, that the English were not prohibited to bring in their
Commodities, but that the King his Master might command his Subjects to spend
the Bays, and other Commodities of his own Kingdoms, and not to make use of
those that came from foreign parts, as to his wisdom for the good of his
Kingdoms should seem best. That there should be a suspension of the execution
of the said Pramatica's until St. James-tide, and no longer. To which I
answered, That I made no doubt of the power, that every King had over his own
Subjects; notwithstanding where it was articled betwixt two Kings, that there
should be a free admittance of each others Commodities unto their several
Kingdoms, and after a Command should be given prohibiting either of them unto
their Subjects the making use thereof, it could not but be understood a
defrauding and deluding of the Articles, and the true intention of them: but I
told him I came not to dispute this now, for the Secretaries Letter had desired
me to take notice of another resolution, therefore I desired, that there might
be a speedy and public declaration made of what was therein signified unto
me: or if there were any new resolution, that I might understand it. To which
he answered (pretending that he spoke it as a freedom which he used with me)
but came out with it in such a manner, as I saw he was full of it) That the
truth was, that they would proceed here, as they were proceeded withal in
England. That the King my Master had lately given leave to the Hollanders to
transport Artillery out of England, and had denied the like to their
Ambassadors having required it; which was (as he said) directly against the
articles of peace, wherein it was Capitulated, That neither should assist with
any kind of arms the enemy of the other. He said farther, That the English had
taken Ormuh, and there was no satisfaction given concerning that business, nor
appearance of any intention to do it, and concluded, That when the Articles of
Peace should be observed to them, they would do the like. I told the Conde I
had not understood any thing of those particulars which he mentioned, and
therefore could say nothing unto him; neither thought I fit to give him any
further answer, being loath in a business of this importance, where the
Articles of Peace between these Kingdoms are in question, to do any thing at
guess, but to advertise it to the King my Master, and to proceed according to
such order as he shall please to give me. I do therefore entreat your Honor,
that you will be pleased to acquaint his Majesty with what has passed,
wherein I doubt not but his Majesty will observe the distraction, and
inconstancy of their proceedings here at present, in Commanding, what his
Majesty will have found by this Secretaries Letter, and taking presently after
new resolutions. After this language which the Conde has used unto me, I
cannot expect any reason or justice here, and the Merchants have many suites
depending wherein they have received great injuries, whereof I have not
hitherto complained, because I was in continual hope of procuring redress, and
their suites proceeded on, I cannot say as I would have wished, but according
to the style here, and in such manner as they have done in former times. I
doubt not but his Majesty will therefore likewise please to consider what a
stop there is likely to be here of all businesses concerning the Commerce, and
either proceed as occasion shall there be offered, in the like manner, or take
such a Course for settling things in better order, as to his wisdom shall seem
best. I have fince had some overtures made unto me, that the said declaration
shall presently come out, in the mean time I would not wish, that the Merchants
should adventure any thing trusting to their courtesy here. By my last unto
your Honor which was of the 20th. of May, I advertized the advice which was
given hither, That the Galeons, that bring the Plate, were upon the way for
these parts; Since when there is news of their arrival at St. Lucar, excepting
two of them which perished in their journey hitherward, the one sprung a leak
in a calm day, and sunk so fast, that there were only saved 52 men, the rest,
which were about 200. persons, were all drowned, neither was any of her freight
saved. The other was their Admirante, which corresponds with our Vice Admiral,
which likewise sprung a leak, but all the men aboard were saved, and a good
part of her silver. There is lost upon Register in these two Ships three
millions, and it is thought that there perished in them above a million in
silver, and goods unregistred.

Upon order that was lately sent unto the Assistente of Sevil, for the
perfecting the Grant of the Millions to the King by the said City, there being
doubt made whether it was a lawful Concession, or no; The Assistente called
together those, that had voices in the said grant of the said Millions, and
made a speech unto them, wishing a general Conformity to what his Majesty had
desired of them; but the proposition was very distastful unto the greater
number, who little expected to have heard that business revived again. And the
people having gotten notice upon the breaking up of that meeting of what had
been there propounded, in a tumultuous manner ran after the Assistente, who was
returning to his house, and hearing such a clamor behind him, thought that the
people had been disquieted by some accident, and stayed to have appeased them,
but by the curses which he heard, and the blows he received by the stones
which were thrown at him, he quickly found against whom the fury of the people
was bent, and so made all the haste he could to his own house, which at length
he recovered sore wounded, and with much hazard of his life.

The Irish Priests, and others of that Kingdom which reside in this Court,
begin to grow very busy here, and do promise great matters unto this King in
the assistance which his Majesty shall find in Ireland, whenever he shall
please to attempt any thing against that Kingdom; but for any thing I can
learn, there has been as yet so little ear given unto them, that they have not
descended to make any particular offer. But they are treated here with much
Courtesy, Tyr-Connel being made a Page to the Queen, and the rest receiving
good satisfaction. I will be as vigilant as I can to trace out their steps, and
I hope I shall be able to give seasonable advertizement of their proceedings.
Howsoever since secret Councels may be held, and resolutions taken, which I may
miss of; I doubt not but the King our Master considering the present
jealousies, and distastes betwixt these Crowns, will be vigilant to secure that
Kingdom, that there may be nothing neglected upon which they may here take any
sudden advantage. By the English Merchants that reside in Malaga I have
received advice, that 3. Scottish Masters of Ships have lately had a sentence
pronounced against them by the D. of Medina Sidona, wherein their Ships and all
their goods are confiscated, for having brought Holland Commodities to that
Port, and their persons condemned to the Galleys; which notwithstanding their
apellation unto the Council of War here, (which ought to have been admitted
them) was presently put into execution. The same day that I received the
advice, I gave in a Memorial to the Council of State, representing the rigorous
and unjust proceeding against the said Scottish Masters, and desired that they
would send their order, that the Apellation might be admitted, and that their
persons might be presently returned off of the Galleys. I likewise repaired to
the Conde of Olivarez, acquainting him with the proceedings of the Duke, and
was able to give him some examples of diverse Hollanders that had been treated
in the like occasion with far less rigor. Whereupon there is Command given
according to what I have desired; and whatsoever shall become of their goods, I
have a promise from the Conde of Olivarez, that their persons shall be treated
with all Courtesy. It is published by the Ladies of the Palace, that the Queen
is with Child, which has filled this Court with much joy, and her Majesty
has so much better health now upon her being new with Child, then she has had
of the rest, that they are already here full of hopes that she will bring them
a Prince, etc.

Your Honors, etc. Wa. Aston.

The Abstract of a Letter from Sir Walter Aston to the Lord Conway, 17. July,
1624.
HE acknowledges the receipt of his Majesty's Letters of the 27. of June by
Mr. Wych, and is busy in preparing to put those Directions in execution, and
that being done, will give a speedy and full account. The Marquess Ynoisa
dispatched away a Post to Spain from Calice, and by him gave as malicious an
account of his usage at his departure from England, and also of all other late
passages there, as malice it self could have dictated. He omits no libels or
infamous songs, nor spares his own inventions where they may serve to incense.
The Credit they are like to give to their Ambassador, the height of discontent
they are now in, the assurance given them of the weak and mean estate of all
things in England may tempt them to offer the giving us a blow, where we are
weakest. And therefore no necessary preparations for defense to be neglected on
our part. None of their Armado stirs yet, but only 4. Gallions appointed to
accompany for some days the Nova Espagna Fleet that put to Sea the fourth of
this present.

Sir Walter Aston doubts, that the light he has received of the present state
of things in England, and the Arguments to answer their Objections will hardly
be applied to give any satisfaction. (things being in so much distemper there)
And where the best answers on both sides are recriminations, he conceives
little is to be expected but a direct falling out. The cause of their retarding
Mendoza's coming for England has been their desire to see the issue of the
proceedings with their Ambassador. All the Grandees, and principal persons of
Spain are summoned to give their attendance with their arms, which is done by
three Letters. 1. Admonitoria. 2. Apercibitoria. 3. Executoria. The two first
are already set forth. And there is order likewise given for the Battalon to be
in a readiness, which is the same as the Trained Bands in England. This is an
ancient practice there upon suspicion of foreign invasion, or domestique
Commotion. There are leavies new making according to custom, for supplying of
Garrisons; and though these Leavies are greater then usually, yet not much
worthy of note. An Ambassador arrived there for Denmark; his coming being
given out to be to negotiate the business of the Palatinate, and to make
overtures for a Peace with Holland: but if nothing be heard of this in England,
it is not like to be true. A Request presented unto the King by a Consulta from
the Inquisiter general, etc. to procure a Jubilee from Rome for expiation of the
late great Contempt done by a Frenchman to the Sacrament. The King promises to
do it, and he, the Queen, and the whole household will endeavor to deserve it
by fasting, and other duties. In his answer to the Consulia there is a passage,
that intimates his intention of looking abroad with his arms. The Frenchman
was condemned, burnt publicly, and dyed a Roman Catholic. There have been
diverse processions in expression of the general grief for that action. The
King, Queen, his Brothers and Sister, with the Grandees, and the Council went
in procession about the two square Courts of the Palace, where there were 4.
Altars built, one by the Kings care, the rest by the Queen, the Infanta,
Cardinal, Don Carlos, and Dona Maria, who joined in the care of one of them.
The greatest riches of Diamonds and Pearls that were in the Churches
thereabouts, and in the Kings store were presented on those Altars, and were at
ten millions. They intend to dispatch one Jaquesse Brones Secretary of the
Council of Flanders, by post into England to bring Don Carlos warrant to come
away, and to stay Agent in England until the arrival of another Ambassador,
which will not be long. They stay the giving out of the order for the free
admittance of English Merchandises, until they see what will be done with their
Ships in the Downs, etc.

Sir Walter Aston to the Duke, 20. of October. 1624.
May it please your Grace,
I Assure my self that your Grace is very confident, that I have not only
pursued the Complaint which I here made against the Marquess of Ynoisa with
the duty of a Minister in obedience to the King my Masters Command, but as
passionately interested against his person, who maliciously attempted to stain
(if it had been possible) the honor of the Prince his Highness and your
Graces my noblest friend. And certainly my Lord, I should be infinitely
afflicted in not having brought this business to that issue which I thirsted
after, could I accuse my self of having omitted any thing, that might have
sharpened them here against him: But the Conde of Olivarez with a strong and
violent hand has delivered the Marquess from any exemplary punishment, which
would certainly have been inflicted upon him, had he been left to the Council
of State, and without care either of the King his Masters honor or engagement,
has saved the Marquess, and left the envy of it upon his Majesty, if the
King our Master will so please to understand it.

In my last unto your Grace which was of the 24th. of the last month, I humbly
entreated you to procure me his Majesty's leave to return into England for some
few months, which suit I do here again renew unto your Grace. Howsoever in
respect of this novelty in the Marquess his business, I will forbear putting
my self upon the way until I hear of the receipt of this dispatch: since if his
Majesty shall please to give any demonstrations here of his sense of their
unworthy proceedings, I would be loath that those Commands should find me out
of the way: with the remembrance of my duty, I rest

Your Graces, etc. Wa. Aston.

Sir Walter Aston to the Duke the 10th. of December. 1625.
May it please your Grace,
THe Portugal Armado put to Sea on the 12th. of the last month Still. Vet. It
consists of 22. Ships of War, 4. Victuallers, and two small Pinnaces of Advice:
There goes in it near upon 4000. Land Soldiers. From Cadiz I have now fresh
advice, That Don Frederique is still in the Port, with the Fleet which he
Commands, but himself and his men all embarked. That Armado consists of some
35. Ships of War, and about 8000. Soldiers, and both the Fleets are victualled
for 8. months. That of Fortugal had first order to expect Don Frederique at
the Cape St. Vincent, but has since received command to proceed on the
journey. It being now 27. days since the Fleet departed, and this remaining
still in the Harbor, does give me much cause of jealousy: especially
understanding, that they have here advice, (which they give credit to) that the
Troops lately delivered to Count Mansfelt are sent to succor Breda, fearing
(if it be so) that they laying hold of it as a breach of the Peace (which
interpretation I meet with in every discourse) should presently fall with this
Armado upon some part of Ireland. I have no farther ground for this distrust,
then what I have here represented, which your Grace weighing with the
importancy of their enterprise in hand for the recovering the Baya, and the
occasions that will be given them from England, do best know what rigid
judgment to make. Sithence I wrote my other Letter unto your Grace, (which
accompanies this) I understand the French Ambassador by order from the King
his Master, has given account unto this King of the Conclusion of the Match
betwixt the Prince his Highness, and Madam Christiene his Masters Sister.
Whereupon this King, and the whole Court put on Galas: I conceive (howsoever I
have not heard any thing thereof by any Letter unto me) that this is ground
enough to Congratulate with your Grace this good beginning which I shall
affectionately wish may in the success in all times prove a happiness to his
Highness and a particular blessing to your Grace. The Conde of Gondomar has
newly received a Command from the King his Master (signified unto him by the
Secretary Don Andreas de Prada) to put himself presently upon the way for
England, which he has answered he will obey, howsoever I believe he will keep
his Christmasse here. Mr. Butler whom your Grace left here placed with this
King meets often with such discourses in the Palace, that as a faithful servant
to your Grace, he has no patience to bear, which he has reason to believe
will in a short time throw him out of this Court, which he would be glad to
prevent, if he might have your Graces command to return, being infinitely
desirous that your Grace would dispose otherwise of him. I will conclude with
the same suit for my self, there being none that has more need of comfort from
your Grace. I best know, that I have no way deserved any change or decay in
your Graces favor toward me, having not been slow in upbraiding this Nation
with their obligations to your Grace, and their shameful ungratefulness, nor
without a constant, and passionate desire to serve your Grace every way to your
content, if your Graces Commands would but direct me what to do, I do therefore
rest confident of your care and goodness toward me. And so with my prayers to
God to continue his blessings upon you, I rest

Your Graces, etc. W. Aston.

Dr. Williams to the Duke.
My most noble Lord,
IT has pleased God to call for the Bishop of London. I am so conscious of
mine own weakness and undeservings, that, as I never was, so now I dare not be
a suitor for so great a charge. But if his Majesty by your Honors mediation,
shall resolve to call me to perform him the best service I can in that place, I
humbly beseech your Honor to admit me a suitor in these three circumstances.

First, that whereas my Lord of London has survived our Lady day, and received
all the profits, that should maintain a Bishop until Michaelmasse, I may by his
Majesty's favor retain all my own means until the next day after Michaelmas
day; this is a Petition which I shall be necessitated to make unto his Majesty
(if his Majesty by your favor shall advance me to this place) and injureth no
man else in the world.

Secondly, that whereas the Commissioners challenge from the Bishops revenues a
matter of 200. l. per annum, (this Bishopric being already very meanly endowed
in regard of the continual charge, and exhaustments of the place) it would
please his Majesty to leave in my hands (by way of Commendam) one Benefice of
mine, which falls into his Majesty's dispose upon my remove, until it be
determined by the said Commissioners, whether any part of the Bishops means be
due unto the Fabrique. My humble suit is for Walgrave, a Benefice with Cure in
North-hamptonshire, where I have laid out all my estate in temporal Lands.

Lastly, that if it be found, that the Bishop is to join with the
Residentiaries of Paul's in the repair of the Church, his Majesty would
qualify me by a commendam to hold one of my own Prebends, when it shall fall
to be a Residentiarie also; that if I be charged with the burden of
Residentiarie, I might enjoy the profits of a Residentiarie.

These three requests do (I confess) add unto me, but do not prejudice any
one else whatsoever. I submit them and my self to your Honors wisdom, etc.

The names of such Ecclesiastical promotions as I now retain, and will fall to
be disposed of by the King, if I should be removed.

1. Deanery of Westminster. 2. Rectorie of Dinam. 3. Rectorie of VValgrave. 4.

Lord Keeper to the Duke, 27. July, 1621.
My most noble Lord,
AN unfortunate occasion of my Lords Grace his killing of a man casually (as it
is here constantly reported) is the cause of my seconding of my yesterdayes
Letter unto your Lordship. His Grace (upon this accident) is by the Common Law
of England to forfeit all his estate unto his Majesty, and by the Canon Law
(which is in force with us) irregular, ipso facto, and so suspended from all
Ecclesiastical function, until he be again restored by his Superior, which (I
take it) is the Kings Majesty in this rank, and order of Ecclesiastical
jurisdiction. If you send for Dr. Lamb he will acquaint your Lordship with the
distinct penalties in this kind. I wish with all my heart, his Majesty would
be as merciful, as ever he was in all his life; but yet I held it my duty to
let his Majesty know by your Lordship, that his Majesty is fallen upon a
matter of great advice, and deliberation. To add affliction to the afflicted
(as no doubt he is in mind) is against the Kings nature; to leave virum
Sanguinum, or a man of blood, Primate and Patriarch of all his Churches, is a
thing that sounds very harsh in the old Councels, and Canons of the Church. The
Papists will not spare to descant upon the one and the other. I leave the knot
to his Majesty's deep wisdom to advise and resolve upon. A theume fallen into
mine eye (together with the rumor I last wrote unto your Lordship about) has
fastened me unto my bed. which makes this Letter the more unhandsome. But I
will take nothing to heart, that proceeds from his Majesty, or from that King,
who has raised me from the dust, to all that I am. If the truth were set down,
1. That my self was the first mover for a temporary Keeper. 2. That his
Majesty has promised me upon the relinquishing of the Seal (or before) one of
the best places in this Church, as most graciously he did. 3. The year and a
halfs probation left out, which is to no purpose, but to scare away my men, and
to put a disgrace upon me. 4. That my assisting Judges were defired, and named
by my self, which your Lordship knows to be most true: Such a declaration
would neither shame me, nor blemish his Majesty's service in my person. And it
were fitter a great deal, the penning thereof were referred to my self, then to
Mr. Secretary, or the Lord Treasurer, who (if he had his demerit) deserves not
to hold his staff half a year. I do verily believe, they will hasten to finish
this act, before I shall hear from your Lordship, which if they do, God send me
patience and as much care to serve him, as I have, and ever had to serve my
Master; And then all must needs be well. I send your Lordship a Copy of that
speech I have thought upon, to deliver at London upon Monday next at the
Commission of the Subsidies: If his Majesty have leisure to cast his eye
thereupon, and to give direction to have any thing else delivered, or any point
of this suppressed, I would be directed by your Lordship whom I recommend in
prayers to Gods good guiding and protection. And do rest, etc.

The E. of Southhamptons Letter to the Bishop of Lincoln.
My Lord,
I Have found your Lordship already so favorable, and affectionate unto me,
that I shall be still hereafter desirous to acquaint you with what concerns me,
and bold to ask your advice, and council; which makes me to send this bearer to
give your Lordship an account of my answer from Court, which I cannot better
do, then by sending unto you the answer it self, which you shall receive here
enclosed. Wherein you may see what is expected from me, that I may not only
magnify his Majesty's Gracious dealing with me, but cause all my friends to do
the like, and restrain them from making any extenuation of my errors, which if
they be disposed to do, or not to do is impossible for me to alter, that am not
likely for a good time to see any other then mine own family. For my self, I
shall ever be ready (as is fit) to acknowledge his Majesty's favor to me, but
can hardly persuade my self, that any error by me committed, deserved more
punishment then I have had, and hope that his Majesty will not expect, that I
should not confess my self to have been subject to a Star Chamber sentence,
which God forbid I should ever do. I have, and shall do according to that Part
of my Lord of Buckinghams advice to speak of it as little as I can, and so
shall I do in other things to meddle as little as I can. I purpose (God
willing) to go to morrow to Tychfield (the place of mine confinement) there to
stay as long as the King shall please.

Sir William Parkhurst must go with me, who hoped to have been discharged at
the return of my Messenger from Court, and seems much troubled, that he is
not, pretending that it is extreme inconvenient for him, in regard of his own
occasions. He is fearful he should be forgotten. If therefore when your
Lordship writes to the Court, you would but put my Lord of Buckingham in
remembrance of it, you shall (I think) do him a favor. For my part it is so
little trouble to me, and of so small moment, as I mean to move no more for
it. When this bearer returns, I beseech you return by him this enclosed Letter,
and believe that whatsoever I am I will ever be, Your Lordships most assured
friend to do you service.

H. Southampton, etc.

The Lord Keepers answer to the E. of Southhamptons Letter. 2. August, 1621.
My Lord,
I Have perused your Lordships Letter, and that enclosed I return back again.
And doubt nothing of my Lord Admirals remembering of you upon the first
opportunity. Great works (as I hope this will be a perfect reconciling of his
Majesty's affections to you, of your best studies, and endeavors to the
service of his Majesty) do require some time: They are but poor actions, and
of no continuance that are Slubbered up in an instance. I know (my Lord) men's
tongues are their own, nor lies it in your power to prescribe what shall be
spoken for you, or against you. But to avoid that Complacentia (as the Divines
call it) that itching, and inviting of any interpretation, which shall so add
to your innocence, as it shall derogate from the Kings mercy, which (I speak
as I would do before God) had a great cloud of jealousies, and suspicions to
break through, before it came to shine upon you. This (I take it) is the effect
of my Lords exhortation, and I know it ever has been your Lordships
resolution. How far you could be questioned in the Star Chamber, is an
unseasonable time to resolve. The King has waved off all judgment, and left
nothing for your meditation, but love and favor, and the increasing of both
these. Yet I know (upon my late occasions to peruse Presidents in that Court)
that small offenses have been in that Court (in former times) deeply censured.
In the sixteenth of Edward the second (for the Court is of great antiquity)
Henry Lord Beaumout, running a way of his own about the invading of Scotland,
and dissenting from the rest of the Kings Council, because of his absenting
himself from the Council Table was fined and imprisoned: though otherwies a
most worthy and deserving Noble man. But God be thanked your Lordship has no
cause to trouble your head about these meditations. For (if I have any
judgment) you are in a way to demean your self as you may expect rather more
new additions, then suspect the least diminution from his Gracious Majesty.
For mine own part, assure your self, I am your true and faithful servant, and
shall never cease so to continue, as long as you make good your professions to
this Noble Lord. Of whose extraordinary goodness, your Lordship, and my self
are remarkable reflections. The one of his sweetness in forgetting of wrongs,
the other of his forwardness in conferring of courtesies.

With my best respect to your Lordship and my Noble Lady, and my Commendations
to Sir William Parkhurst, I recommend your Lordship, etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke concerning the E. of South-hampton. 2. Aug. 1621.
My most noble Lord,
I Humbly crave your pardon for often troubling your Honor with my idle Lines,
and beseech you to remember, that amongst many miseries my sudden greatness
comes accompanied with, this is not the least, that I can no otherways enjoy
the happiness of your presence. God is my witness, the Lord Keeper has often
(not without grief of heart) envied the fortunes of a poor Scholar, one Dr.
Williams, late Dean of Westminster, who was so much blessed in the free
accesses in that kind, as his Lordship (without a great quantity of goodness
in your self) may scarce hope for. This enclosed will let your Lordship
understand, that somewhat is to be finished in that excellent piece of meacy,
which his Majesty (your hand guiding the Pencil) is about to express in the
E. of Southhampton. It is full time his Attendant were revoked in my poor
opinion, and himself left to the Custody of his own good Angel. There is no
readier way to stop the mouths of idle men, nor to draw their eyes from this
remainder of an object of Justice, to behold nothing but goodness and mercy.
And the more breathing time you shall carve out between this total enlargement
and the next access of the Parliament, the better it will be for his Majesty's
service. Only remember this, that now you are left to be your own
Remembrancer. Of all actions forget not those of mercy, and Goodness, wherein
men draw nighest to God himself: Nor of all Persons, prisoners and afflicted
Joseph's: Celerity does redouble an act of mercy. But why do I turn a Preacher
of goodness unto him, who (in my own particular) has showed himself to be
composed of nothing else? Remember your Noble Self, and forget the aggravations
of malice, and envy, and then forget if you can the E. of Southhampton. God
bless you, and your royal Guest, and bring you both, after many years yet most
happily run over here upon earth, to be his blessed guests in the Kingdom of
Heaven.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke, concerning the Lord of St. Albons, October 27th.
1621.
My most noble Lord,
I Have received your Lordships expression concerning the Pause I made upon the
two Patents. The Proclamation of writing to the Kings hand, and my Lord of St.
Albons pardon. The former I have sealed this morning in duty, and obedience to
your Lordships intimation. The latter I have not yet sealed, but do represent
(in all lowliness and humility) these few Considerations by your Lordship to
his sacred Majesty, wherein let your Lordship make no question, but I have
advised with the best Lawyers in the Kingdom. And after this representation, I
will perform whatsoever your Lordship shall direct.

His Majesty and your Lordship do conceive,

The King pardons in particular words,

The King pardons in my Lord of St. Albon, the stealing away, altering,
raising, and interlining of his Majesty's Rowles, Records, Briefs, etc. which
are more in a Lord Chancellors pardon, then the imbezeling of his Majesty's
jewels in a Lord Chamberlains. And yet the Lord Chancellor Elsmore could not
endure that clause in my Lord of Sommersets Pardon, unless he would name the
jewels in particular.

I see (in his Majesty's great wisdom) these are not regarded. Only I could
have wished, the Pardon had been referred to the Council board, and so passed.
I have now discharged my self of those poor scruples, which (in respect only
to his Majesty's service, and your Lordships honor) have wrought this short
stay of my Lord of St. Albons Pardon. Whatsoever your Lordship shall now
direct, I will most readily (craving pardon for this not undutiful boldness)
put in execution. Because some speech may fall of this days speech, which I
had occasion to make in the Common Pleas, where a Bishop was never seen sitting
there these 70. years, I have presumed to enclose a Copy thereof, because it
was a very short one.

Your Lordship shall not need to take that great pains (which your Lordship to
my unexpressible comfort has so often done) in writing. What Command soever
your Lordship shall impose upon me as touching this pardon, your Lordships
expression to Mr. Packer or the bearer shall deliver it sufficiently. God from
heaven continue the showring and heaping of his blessings upon your Lordship,
etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke, 22. July, 1621.
My noble Lord,
With my truest affections, and thankfulness premised. I do not doubt but his
Majesty and your Lordship do now enjoy the general applause of your goodness
to the Earl of Southhampton. Saturday last he came, and dined with me, and I
find him more cordially affected to the service of the King, and your Lordships
love and friendship, then ever he was, when he lay a prisoner in my house. Yet
the Sunshine of his Majesty's favor, though most bright upon others (more open
offenders) is noted to be somewhat eclipsed toward him. What directions soever
his Majesty gave, the order is somewhat tart upon the Earl. The word of
Confinement, spread about the City (though I observed not one syllable so quick
to fall from his Majesty) his Keeper much wondered at. The act of the Council
published in our names, who were neither present thereat, or heard one word of
the same: yet upon my credit the Earl takes all things patiently, and
thankfully, though others wonder at the same.

Mr. Secretary signed a Petition of one Rookwood a Papist, and prisoner in the
Fleet upon five several executions, that I should grant him his liberty. The
Kings name is used, and the mediation of the Spanish Ambassador. If I breaking
rules so foully in favor of a Papist, (which I am resolved to keep straight
against all men whatsoever) I shall infame my self in the very beginning. If
his Majesty will have any special indulgence in this kind, I expect intimation
immediately from the King, or your Lordship, and no third Person. Your Lordship
will not expect from me any account of Council business, nor the setting at
liberty of the late prisoners. Mr. Secretary is secret enough for imparting any
thing unto me, so as I must remain in a necessary ignorance.

There is a Country man of mine one Griffith, a suitor unto the Court for the
reversion of an Auditors place, recommended thereunto by his Master the Lord
Treasurer. The place is of great Consequence for the disposing of his Majesty's
revenewes. The man is unfit for this, as presumptuous and daring for any place.
Sir Robert Pie says, he has already written to your Lordship, and I doubt not
of your care thereof. Doctor Lamb (the bearer) is a very sufficient, and (for
ought I ever heard of him) an honest man. The King has employed him in
discovery of counterfeit Witchcrafts, in reforming of no ounterfeit, but hearty
Puritanes, and he has done good service therein. If his Majesty (now in our
pure air of Northhamptoushire) do not show him some favor, or grace, either by
Knighting, or by using him courteously, The Brethren (having gotten out their
Yelverton again) will neglect and molest him too unsufferably. God from Heaven
bless you. Remember your Deanerie, and Dean of Westminster, etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke concerning the Earl Marshals place, 1. September.
1621.
My most Noble Lord,
I Beseech your Lordship to interpret this Letter well, and fairly, which no
malice (though never so provoked) but my duty to his Majesty, and love to your
Lordship has drawn from me: both which respects as long as I keep inviolably,
I will not omit for the fear of any man, or the loss of any thing in this
world, to do any act, which my Conscience shall inform me to belong unto that
place, wherein the King by your favor has entrusted me. I received this
morning two Commands from his Majesty, the one about a Pension of 2000 l.
yearly, and the other concerning the office of the Earl Marshal, both
conferred on the Right Honorable the Earl of Arundel. For the former,
although this is a very unseasonable time to receive such large Pensions from
so bountiful a King, and that the Parliament so soon approaching is very like
to take notice thereof, and that this pension might (under the correction of
your better judgment) have been conveniently deferred until that Assembly had
been over. Yet who am I that should question the wisdom, and bounty of my
Master? I have therefore sealed the same, praying secretly unto God to make his
Majesty as abounding in wealth as he is in goodness. But the latter I dare
not seal (my good Lord) until I hear your Lordships resolution to these few
Questions.

Whether his Majesty by expressing himself in the delivery of the Arundel,
that he was moved thereunto for the easing of the rest of the Comissioners, who
had, before, the execution of that office, did not imply, that his Majesty
intended to impart unto my Lord no greater power, then was formerly granted to
the Lords Comissioners. If it were so, this Pattent should not have exceeded
their Pattent, whereas it does enlarge it self beyond that by many dimensions.

Whether it is his Majesty's meaning, Essex, Shrewsbery, and Sommerset, should
refer only to my Lords own Ancestors, Howards, and Mowbrayes Dukes of Norfolk,
who clamed this place by a way of inheritance. The usual reference of Pattents
being unto the last, and immediate predecessor, and not unto the remote, whose
powers (in those unsettled and troublesome times are vage, uncertain, and
unpossible to be limited.

Whether it is his Majesty's meaning, Edward Zouch his in the Court, Sir George
Reinel's in the Kings Bench, and diverse others. All which this new Pattent does
sweep away, being places of great worth and dignity.

Whether that his Majesty's meaning, and your Lordships, Stewards place shall
be (for all his power of Judicature in the Verge,) either altogether
extinguished, or at leastwise subordinated unto this new Office? A point
considerable, because of the greatness of that person, and his neernesse in
blood to his Majesty, and the Prince his Highness.

Lastly, Whether it be intended, great Lord? A power limited by no Law, or
Record, but to be searched out from Chronicles, Antiquaries, Heralds, and such
obsolete Monuments, and thereupon held these 60 years, (for my Lord of Essex
his power was clearly bounded, and limited) unfit to be revived by the policy
of this State.

These Questions, if his Majesty intended only the renewing of this
Commission of the Earl Marshals in my Lord of Arundel are material and to the
purpose. But if his Majesty aimed withal, at the reviving of this old office,
A la ventura, whose face is unknown to the people of this age; upon the least
intimation from your Lordship, I will seal the Patent. And I beseech your
Lordship to pardon my discretion in this doubt, and irresolution. It is my
place to be wary what innovation passes the Seal. I may offend that great Lord
in this small stay, but your Lordship cannot but know, how little I lose, when
I lose but him, whom without the least cause in the world, I have
irreconcileably lost already. All that I desire is, that you may know what is
done, and I will ever do what your Lordship (being once informed) shall direct
as becomes, etc.

That there is a difference betwixt the Earl Marshal, and the Marshall of the
Kings house; See Lamberts Archiron: or of the High Courts of Justice in England

Circa Medium.

The Marshal of England, and the Constable are united in a Court, which
handles only Duels out of the Realm, matters within the Realm, as Combats,
Blazon, Armorie, etc. but it may meddle with nothing tryable by the Laws of
the Land.

The Marshal of the Kings Household is united in a Court with the Seneschal or
Steward, which holds plea of Trespasses, Contracts, and Covenants made within
the Verge, and that according to the Laws of the Land, Vid. Artic. Super Cart.
C. 3.4.5.

We do all of us conceive the King intended the first place only for this great
Lord, and the second to remain in the Lord Stewards managing. But this new
Patent has comprehended them both. This was fit to be presented to your
Lordship.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke. 16. December. 1621.
Most Noble Lord,
I Have seen many expressions of your love in other men's Letters (where it does
most naturally and purely declare it self) since I received any of mine own. It
is much your Lordship should spare me those thoughts, which pour out themselves
in my occasions: But to have me and my assaires in a kind of affectionate
remembrance, when your Lordship is saluting of other Noble men, is more then
ever I shall be able otherways to requite then with true prayers and best
wishes. I received this afternoon (by Sir John Brook) a most loving Letter from
your Lordship, but dated the 26th. of November. imparting your care over me for
the committing of one Beeston for breach of a Decree. My Noble Lord, Decrees
once made must be put in execution, or else, I will confess this Court to be
the greatest imposture, and Grievance in this Kingdom. The damned in Hell do
never cease repining at the Justice of God, nor the prisoners in the Fleet, at
the Decrees in Chancery; of the which hell of prisoners this one, for antiquity
and obstinacy may pass for a Lucifer. I neither know him, nor his cause, but
as long as he stands in Contempt, he is not like to have any more liberty.

His Majesty's last Letter, though never so full of honey (as I find by
passages reported out of the same, being as yet, not so happy as to have a
sight thereof) has notwithstanding afforded those Spiders which infest that
noble House of Commons, some poison, and ill constructions to feed upon, and to
induce a new diversion, or plain Cessation of weightier businesses. His
Majesty infers, (and that most truly, for where were the Commons before Henry
the first gave them authority to meet in Parliaments?) that their privileges
are but Graces and favors of former Kings, which they claim to be their
inheritance, and natural birthrights. Both these assertions (if men were
peaceably disposed, and affected the dispatch of the common bufinesses) might
be easily reconciled.

These privileges were originally the favors of Princes, and are now inherent
in their persons: Nor does his Majesty go about to impair or diminish them. If
his Majesty will be pleased to qualify that passage with some mild and noble
exposition, and require them strictly to prepare things for a Session, and to
leave this needless dispute his Majesty shall thereby make it appear to all
wise and just men, that these persons are opposite to those common ends,
whereof they vaunthemselves the only Pat^^ns. But do his Majesty what he
please, I am afraid (although herein the Lord Treasurer and others do differ
from me) they do not affect a Sessions, nor intend to give at this time any
Subsidy at all.

Will the King be pleased therefore to add in this Letter (which must be here
necessarily upon Monday morning) that if they will not prepare bills for a
Session, his Majesty will break up this Parliament without any longer
Prorogation, and acquainting the Kingdom with their undutifulnesse and
obstinacy, supply the present wants by some other means. Or will his Majesty
(upon their refusal) presently rejourn the the Assembly until the appointed
8th. of Feburary. This course is fittest for further advice, but the other to
express a just indignation. I dare advise nothing in so high a point, but
humbly beseech almighty God to illuminate his Majesty's understanding to insist
upon that course, which shall be most behoveful for the advancement of his
service. In our house his Majesty's servants are very strong, and increase
every day nor is there the least fear of any Malignant opposition. God reward
all your Lordships goodness and affection toward. etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke about Mr. Thomas Murrayes Dispensation, etc. 23.
Febr. 1621.
My most Noble Lord.
I Should fail very much of my duty to his Majesty, if before the sealing of
Mr. Thomas Murrayes Dispensation. I should not acquaint his Majesty
explicitly, and freely, with the nature of this act, f^r differing from any
dispensation in this kind, ever granted by his Majesty, since his happy
coming to the Crown of England. For (to say nothing of the right of the
election of this Provost, which being originally not in the King, but in the
fellows, and now by their neglect devolved unto me, shall be fully and
absolutely at his Majesty's command) the place is a living with cure of souls,
and I am to institute and admit him to the cure of souls of the Parish of Eaten
by the express Letter of the Statute; without admission, it is impossible he
should receive any real or rightful possession of the same. Now that his
Majesty or any of his Predecessors, did ever dispense with a Layman to hold
cure of souls, I think will be hard for any man to show by any warrantable
president, or record whatsoever. And I know his Majesty to he as much averse
from giving any such president, as any Prince in Christendom living this day.
This is altogether differing a Deanery, or an Hospital, which being livings
without cure, have been, and may be justly conserred by his Majesty upon
Laymen with dispensations de non promovendo. If Sir Henry Savil's example be
objected, I answer, (besides that the Queen made Claim to the gift of the
place by Iapse, occasioned through the promotion of the Provost to the
Bishopric of Chichester, whereas his Majesty has no such Claim thereunto at
this time) That Savil never durst take true possession of the place, but was
only slipped in by the Bishop, (who for fear of the Earl of Essex made bold with
the conscience) Ad Curam et regimen Collegii, that is, to the care and
government of the College. Whereas by the express words of the foundation, he
is to be admitted, Ad Curam annimarum Parechianor (...) Ecclesia Aetonianae, to
the Cure of the souls of all the people of the Parish of Eaton. Secondly, I
hold it no Disparagement to Mr. Murray (nor do find him all together averse
from the same) to enter into orders in the reign of a King so favorable to our
Coat, as (Gods name be praised for it) raigns now over us. This will give
satisfaction to all the Church, bring him into this place according to statute,
and the foundation of that dead King, prevent such a dangerous president for a
Layman to possess cure of souls in the Eye, and Center of all the Realm, and
by an everlasting testimony of his Majesty's Piety to the Church of England.
Thirdly, what opinion this Gentleman has of our Church government is better
known to his Majestle, then to me. If he should be averse thereunto, it were
such a blow unto the Church (the number of the Fellows and Students there
considered) as the like were never given by public authority these 50 Years.
Fourthly, howsoever his Majesty, and the Prince his Highness shall resolve
thereof (at whose feet I lie to be wholly disposed) I hope it is neither of
their royal intendments to transfer the Bishopprick of Lincoln upon the
Fellows of that house, who have rashly usurped a Power of admitting their
Provost by any example seen before. Whereas all Provosts as well the Churchmen,
who came in by Election, as the Layman recommonded by the late Queen, were (as
the foundation exactly requires it) admitted by the Bishop of Lincoln their
Diocaesand and Visitor. I hope i^ was Mr. Murraies inexperience rather then
neglect (never deserved by me) that directed them to this strange course;
subscription, and other conformities, to be acted in the presence of the
Visitor, are essentially to be required before he can be adinitted Provost of
Eaton. Lastly, Mr. Murraie has hitherto mistaken all his course. He must be
first dispensed withal (If his Majesty in his wisdom shall hold it fit) and
then Elected first Fellow, and then Provost of the College (if he will come in
regularly, and safely) whereas now contrary to Savils president, he is first
Elected, and then goes on with his dispensation.

All this I most humbly entreat your Lordship to make known to the Prince his
Highness, and as much as your Lordship thinks fit thereof, to his Majesty. I
will only add one note, and so end. It will be no more disparagement for Mr.
Murray his Highness Schoolmaster to enter into orders, then it was for Coxe
King Edwards Schoolmaster, a Master of Requests, and Privy Counselor, to do
the like, who afterward became a worthy Prelate of this Church. I have
discharged my duty to the King, Prince, and the Church of England. It remains
now, that I should (as I will) religiously obey whatsoever I shall be directed
in the sequel of this business.

And so I rest, etc.
Postscript.
MY Lord, Mr. Murray since came unto me, to whom I showed this Letter, and told
him I would send it unto you to be showed unto the King, and the Prince. I find
him willing to run all courses, Priesthood only excepted. If the King will
dispense with him, my Letter notwithstanding, I humbly beseech his Majesty, to
write a Letter unto me, as a warrant to admit him only Ad Curam et Regimen
Collegii, instead of the other words, Ad Curam animarum. I schooled him soundly
against Puritanisme, which he disavowes, though somewhat faintly; I hope his
Highness and the King will second it.



The Lord Keeper to the Duke about the Liberties of Westminster, 6. May. 1621.
My most Noble Lord,
I Humbly beseech your Lordship to be a little sensible of those injurious
affronts, offered without any show of equity unto this poor Liberty of
Westminster. And for Gods sake let me not want that protection, which not your
Lordship only, but the two Cicils, and the Earl of Sommerset, who neither
regarded the Church, Learning, nor Honor in any measure as you do, have ever
afforded every Dean of this Church. When I had (to my thinking) given the
Knight Marshal full, and too much satisfaction, this day a Letter was offered
to the Table (in my presence) violently pursued by the Lord Steward, and the
Earl Marshal, to command this liberty, (which had stood unquestioned these 700
years) to show reason to Mr. Attorney, and Mr. Solliciter, why they prescribe
against the Knight Marshal. A Course (as my Lord President said openly) not to
be offered to any subject of England. It is our Charter, and freehold of
inheritance, to be showed only in a Court of Justice, and at the Kings Bench,
which we are very ready to do. And we may as well be questioned by a Letter
from the Council, for all the Land we have, as for this. My Lord, the
jurisdiction of this place brings not a penny to my purse, but it has brought
much sorrow to my heart, and now tears to my eyes, that I should be that
unfortunate Contemptible man, who for all the King, and your Lordships favor,
and the true pains I take in answer thereunto, must be trampled down above all
the Deans that lived in this place. Nor would it ever grieve me, if I had
deserved it from these Lords by the least disrespect in all the world. I
beseech you for the Churches sake, and your Honors sake to be sensible hereof,
and to know of the Bishop of Winchester, London, Duresm^, Mr. Packer, or Sir
Robert Pie, whether ever any question has been made to this liberty in this
kind. If a Letter had been recorded to question the same, when the Lord Admiral
was Steward, and the Lord Keeper Dean thereof, judge you in your Wisdom what
would become thereof in future posterity, etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke. Aug. 23. 1622.
My most noble Lord,
YEsterday upon the receipt of your Lordships Letters of the 19th. of this
instant concerning the hastening of the business of the original Writs, I sent
presently for Mr. Attorney, and Mr. Solliciter, who were altogether unprovided
for their parts of the dispatch, and are casually forced so to be, because
three several Officers, in whose records they are to search, are now out of
Town, and do not return yet these 7. days. But your Lordship shall not fail to
have all things concluded 3. weeks before the Tarm, and I will (of purpose) put
off all general seeling until it be effected.

In the mean time (your Lordships Letter notwithstanding) it will be nothing
for your Lordships case to have Sir George Chaworth any way interested in this
office of the originals; but I hold it fitter to leave it (as it is in Law and
Equity) forfeited for non-payment of rent in his Majesty's hands; for upon that
issue I do not doubt but my Lord of St. Albons, and Sir George will be content
to hear reason.

I have received extraordinary respects, and expressions from my Noble Lord the
Lord Marquess Hamilton, which does exceedingly comfort and encourage me to go
on, with some more alacrity through the difficulties of this restless place. I
beseech your Lordship (who is Causa Causarum, the first Cause, that sets all
these other Causes of my Comfort in Going) to take notice of the same, and to
undertake this favor to be placed upon a poor honest hearted man, who would
(if he were any way able) requite it. Gods blessings, and the prayers of a poor
Bishop over attend your Lordship, etc.

Postscript.
THe Spanish Ambassador took the alarm very speedily of the titulary Romish
Bishop, and before my departure from his house at Islington, (whither I went
privately to him) did write both to Rome and Spain to prevent it. Sir Tobie
Mathewes.
But I am aftaid, that Tobi^ will prove but an Apocryphal, and no Canonical
intelligencer, acquainting the State with this project, for the Jesuits rather
then for Jesus sake.



The Lord Keeper to the Duke about the Lord Treasurer, September. 9th. 1622.
My most Noble Lord,
THat I neither wrote unto your Lordship, nor waited upon your Lordship
sithence my intolerable scandalizing by the Lord Treasurer, this is the true
and only cause: I was so moved to have all my diligent service, pains, and
unspotted justice thus rewarded by a Lord, who is reputed wise, that I have
neither slept, read, written, or eaten any thing since that time; until the
last night, that the Ladies sent for me (I believe of purpose) to VV^llingf^^d
house, and put me out of my humor. I have lost the love, and affection of my
men, by seizing upon their Papers perusing all their answers to Petitions,
casting up their moneys, received by way of sees, (even to half Crowns, and two
shillings) and finding them all to be poor honest Gentlemen, that have
maintained themselves in my service by the greatness of my pains, and not the
greatness of their fees. They are most of them randed men, that do not serve
me for gain, but for experience, and reputation. And desire to be brought to
the Test to show their several books, and to be confronted by any one man with
whom they contracted, or from whom they demanded any Fee at all; The greatest
sum in their books is five pounds, and those very few and sent unto them from
Earls, and Barons. All the rest are some 20 s. 10 s. 5 s. 2 s. 6 d. and 2 s.
And this is the oppression in my house, that the Kingdom (of the Common Lawyers
peradventure, who have lost I confess hereby 20000 l. at the least, saved in
the parses of the Subjects) does now groan under.

Now I humbly beseech your Lordship to peruse this paper here enclosed, and the
issue I do join with the Lord Treasurer, and to acquaint (at the least) the
King, and the Prince, how unworthily I am used by this Lord; who (in my soul
and conscience I believe it) either invents these things out of his own head,
and ignorance of this Court, or has taken them up from base, unworthy, and
most unexperienced people. Lastly, because no act of mine (who am so much
indebted for all my frugality) could in the thoughts of a devil inearnate breed
any suspicion, that I gained by this office, excepting the purchase of my
Grandfathers Lands, whereunto my Lord Chamberlains nobleness, and your
Lordships encouragement, gave the invitation. I do make your Lordship (as your
Lordship has been often pleased to honor me) my saithful Confessor in that
business, and do send your Lordship a note enclosed what money I paid, what I
borrowed, and what is still owing for the purchase.

I beseech your Lordship to cast your eye upon the paper, and say it aside that
it be not lost. And having now poured out my soul, and forrow unto your
Lordships breast, I find my heart much eased, and humbly beseech your Lordship
to compass^onate the wrong of

Your most humble and honest servant, J. L. C. S.

The Fair and Familiar Conference which the Lord Treasurer had with the Lord
Keeper after some Expostulations of his own, and the issue joined thereupon, at
White Hall, September. 7. 1622.
THere is taken 40000 l. Lincoln, the jurisdiction of Westminster and St.
Martius le Graund; All which have resort to my house by Petitions.

You have your self a share in the money.

Then let me have no share in Gods Kingdom;

l. per mensem.

As true as the other.

You never receive any Petitions with your own hands,

Let the Cloisters at Westminster answer for me.



I never disposed of any since I came to this place,

You usually reverse Decrees upon Petitions.

I have never reversed,

You have 3.

I have no such officer in all my house, which I must respect above Ceremonies
and Complements.



His Lordship (if he have any friends) may hear of such a Cry,

All the Lords of the Council cry out upon you,

I am a wretched man indeed if it be so.

I will produce particular witnesses,

I know your Lordship cannot, and I do call upon you to do it,

J. L. C. S.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke, 21. of September. 1622.
My most noble Lord,
MY Lord Brook diswarning me (from his Majesty) from coming to Theobalds this
day, I was enforced to trouble your Lordship with these few lines. My most
humble thanks for your Lordships most free, and most loving Letter, I do
willingly confess my error, yet still of the mind, that your Lordship only,
who justly taxed it, has made it to be an error. If your love to me had not
exceeded all reason, and desert of mine, my complaints were not effects of
melancholy, but of a real suffering, and misery. I do confess (and rest
satisfied withal) that his Majesty's Justice, and your Lordships love are
anchors strong enough, for a mind more tossed then mine is, to ride at. Yet
pardon me, my Noble Lord, upon this Consideration, if I exceeded a little in
passion, the natural effect of honesty, and innocence. A Churchman, and a
woman, have no greater Idol under heaven, then their good name. And yet they
cannot fight at all. Nor with credit, scold, and least of all recriminate, to
protect and defend the same. Their only revenge left them, is to grieve, and
complain.

My misery I took to be this. I am one of those that labor in his Majesty's
Cole-mines under the earth, and out of sight. My pains from five a clock in the
morning to 10. or 12. at night are restless, and endless, but under earth,
and out of his Majesty's sight. What other men do (or but seem to do,) it is
ever before the Kings face, and if his Majesty will not look on it, if he has
ears about him, he shall be told of it so often by the parties themselves,
that he must hear of it whether he will or no.

And as my service (by this remoteness is hidden from the King, so is it
liable to be traduced to the King, and my relief (as in dispatching the motions
of poor men by Petitions allowable to my orders,) made to be a Grievance to the
Common Wealth. But in all these fourteen days (wherein by the voice of the
City, I have remained a prisoner in my house,) where is that one party grieved,
that has troubled his Majesty with Complaints against me? Only my Lord
Marshal has dealt with my noble Lord Marquess Hamilton, my Lord of Carlisle,
my Lord Treasurer (as your Lordship may soon know by asking the question) to
make a faction to disgrace the poor Lord Keeper, who never dreamt thereof.

Sir Gilbert Haughton has complained to my Lord Treasurer of my men for
taking, ( Hugh Holland was by and heard him;) If your Lordship do but ask him
his reason, I think it will appear how well grounded their complaints be. Upon
those two former Anchors I will therefore rest, and that so far from
Cowardlinesse, that I will either challenge them before his Majesty to make
good their suggestions, or else (which I hold the greater valor of all, and
which I confess I wanted before this check of your Lordships) go on in my
Course, and scorn all these base, and unworthy scandals as your Lordship shall
direct me.

I have sent a Copy of a Letter of mine to my Lord Anan, which his Majesty
has seen, and given his assent it should not be kept private; yet I would
humbly crave your Lordships opinion thereof (by Mr. Packer) before any Copy
goes from me.

I am ever, etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke. 12th. October. 1622.
My most Noble Lord,
I Will speak with the Jesuit to morrow, and deliver him his admonition from
the King, but do send your Lordship here enclosed a Copy, of the Conference
which I procured from him without his privity, only to make his Majesty, and
your Lordship merry. I have also received a Letter concerning the French
Ambassador which I will be ready to put in execution as your Lordships servant,
and Deputy but not otherwise. Yet your Lordship will give me out of that
freedom (which was wont to be well interpreted by your Lordship) to let your
Lordship understand, that I find all businesses of restitution of ships, and
goods thus taken, to have been handled before the Council in Star-cham^^^ all
the reigns of Henry 7th. and H. 8th. without any contradiction of the Lord
Admiral for the time being. But this to your Lordship in secret. I will be very
careful of the Earl of Desmond, that neither his cause, nor your Lordships
reputation shall suffer thereby. And this is the account I can yet give of your
Lordships Letter, save that I humbly expect that answer, which your Lordships
own Luckie hand has promised in the postscript of one of them. I would ease
your Lordship in this place, but to prevent complaint that (peradventure) may
be first invented, and then presented. Your Lordship shall hear of a long
narrative of our Council Table dispatches. That passage of our letter, which
(as it now goes) does hope that his Majesty will spare to confer any suites
of moment in Ireland until the return of the Irish Committee, was a blunt
request to the King, to grant no suites there without our advice. Against this
(concluded in my absence the first day of the Term) I spoke first to the
Prince privately (who allowed of my reasons) then (when the President would not
mend it) at the Table openly, that I did utterly dislike we should tutour his
Majesty, how to grant suits especially in Letters, that are to remain upon
record. My Lord of Cantuar and the, Earl Marshal said, they had many
Presidents in that kind. I answered, I knew they had none but in the Kings
time, and that I wished them (as I do) all torn out of the book and cast into
the fire. I concealed my reasons, which now I will reveal unto your Lordship,
because this is the third time, I have expressed unto your Lordship under my
hand, my dislike of this kind of Limiting his Majesty otherwise then by word
of mouth. First if his Majesty (which we see so often done) shall dispose of
these suites otherwise, here are so many records remaining to malicious litious
men to observe his Majesty's averseness from following the advice of the
Council board.

Secondly, if your Lordship shall procure any suit in this kind here are
records also in time to come, that you cross and thwart the government of the
Kingdom. And I pray God this be but mine own jealousy. The passage in the
Letter with my Prating, and his Highness help was altered, and for fear of
misreporting, I make bold to relate the truth hereof to your Lordship.

My Lords proceeded very resolutely in those reformations, which concerned
other men. The Commission of fees enables the Committees to call before them
all the Judges, as well as their under Officers (which was more then the King
expressed at Hampton Court) amongst whom, the Lord Keeper is one, who from the
Conquest to this day, was never subjected to (...) call of any power in the
Kingdom, but the King and the Parliament. And although I have not one Penny of
Fee, which has not continued above one hundred years, yet for the honor of
the Prime place in the state (though now disgraced by the contemptiblenesse of
the Officer) I am an humble suitor unto your Lordship, that my Person may be
exempted from the command of Sr. Edwin Sandys, or indeed any man else, besides
the King my Master. Otherwise I shall very patiently endure it, but the King
hereafter may dislike it. The Justices of the Peace are also appointed, but (if
the Judges and my-self be not utterly deceived) to no purpose in the world, nor
service to his Majesty. But when their Lordships came to surrender the under
Leivtenantships to his Majesty's hands, whom the Lord President, and I held fit
to be created henceforward by several Commissions under the Great Seal, it was
stiffly opposed, and stood upon, that the King should name them in their
Lordships Commissions only (according to a President in the late Queens time)
that is, the King shall have the naming, but they still the appointing of them.
And now it was pressed, that his Majesty intended not to disgrace his Lords
etc: and your Lordship is to have a Letter from Mr. Secretary to know his
Majesty's mind herein. If his Majesty shall not ordain them to be created by
several Pattents, it were better a great deal they should continue as they do.
I am very tedious in the manner and (peradventure) in the matter of this Letter
I humbly crave pardon etc.

Passages between the Lord Keeper and Don Francisco.
HE was very inquisitive if I had already, or intended to impart.

Because 1. The King had charged him and the Friar to be very secret. 2. The
Ambassadors did not know that he had imparted these things unto me. 3. The
Popes were secret instructions which they gave to the Friar to urge and press
the same points, which himself had done to the King.


He confessed,

He excused the bringing the Copy of that paper unto me,

He having understood, that there was, though a close,

He desired to know if they might rely upon the King,



He said that the Marquess had dispatched three Curreos, if this failed, they
were at an end of Treaty, and the Ambassadors would forthwith return home.

11th. April, 1622.
The Lord Keeper to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
I Received your Graces Letter by Mr. Killegrew, so full of that sweetness, as
could never issue from any other Fountain, then that one breast so fraught with
all goodness, and virtue; Dick Win may write freely, (as he talks) but alas!
what can my wretched self perform, that should deserve the least acknowledgment
from him, to whom I owe so infinitely much more then the sacrificing of my life
amounts to? only my love makes me sometimes write, and many times fear, fondly
and foolishly, for the which I hope your Grace will pardon me. I have been
frighted more about three weeks since (about quarrels and jarres, which now
Dick Greyhams has related in part unto the King) then at this present, I am.
For Gods sake be not offended with me, if I exhort you to do that, which I know
you do, to observe his Highness with all lowliness, humility, and dutiful
obedience, and to piece up any the least seam-rent, that heat, and earnestness
might, peradventure, seem to produce. I know (by looking into my self) these
are the symptoms of good natures. And for Gods sake I beg it, as you regard
the prayers of a poor friend, if the great negotiation be well concluded, let
all private disagreements be wrapped up in the same, and never accompany your
Lordships into England, to the joy and exultation of your enemies, if any such
ungrateful Devils are here to be found: I am in good earnest, and your Lordship
would believe it, if your Grace saw but the tears, that accompany these lines.

I beseech you, in your Letter to the Marquess Hamilton, intimate unto him
your confidence, and reliance upon his watchfulness, and fidelity in all
turns, which may concern your Grace. I have often lied unto his Lordship, that
your Grace has in many of my Letters expressed as much, and so have pacified
him for the time. If we did know, but upon whom to keep a watchful eye for
disaffected reports concerning your service, it is all the intelligence he and
I do expect. His Majesty (as we conceive) is resolved to take certain oaths,
which you have sent hither, and I pray God afterward no farther difficulties be
objected. I have had an hours discourse with his Majesty yesterday morning,
and do find him so disposed toward your Lordship as my heart desires; yet
has been informed of the discontentments both with the Conde de Olivarez, and
the Earl of Bristol. Here is a strange Creation passed of late, of a
Vice-Counteship of Maidenhead, passed to the Heirs Males, who must be called
hereafter Vice-Countesse Fynch. But my Lady Duchess has the Land, and (as
they say) has already sold it to my Lord Treasurer, or shared it with him. I
stayed the Patent until I was assured your Lordship gave way thereunto.

My good Lord, because I have heard, that they have in those parts a conceit
of our church, as that they will not believe we have any Liturgy, or Book of
common prayer at all, I have (at mine own cost) caused the Liturgy to be
translated into Spanish, and fairly Printed, and do send you by this bearer a
Couple of the Books, one for his Highness, the other for your Grace. Not
sending any more unless your Grace will give directions. His Majesty was
acquainted therewith, and allows of the business exceedingly. The Translator
is a Dominican, a zealous Protestant, and a good Scholar, and I have secured
him to our Church, with a Benefice, and a good Prebend. Because we expect every
day the dispatching of Sr. Francis Cottington thitherward, I will not trouble
your Grace farther at this time, but do earnestly pray unto God to bless your
Grace both now and ever hereafter with all his favors and blessings spiritual
and temporal.

And rest etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke, 30. Aug. 1623.
My it please your Grace,
I Have no business of the least Consideration to trouble your Grace withal at
this time, but that I would not suffer Mr. Greyham to return without an
expression of my respect and obligation. I would advertize your Grace at large
of the course held with our Recusants, but that I know Mr. Secretary is
enjoined to do so, who best can. His Majesty at Salisbury having referred the
suit of these Ambassadors to the Earl of Carlisle, and Mr. Secretary Conway,
sent (by their resolutions) some articles unto us (the Lord Treasurer,
Secretary Calvert, Sir Richard Weston and my self) to this effect.

1. To grant a pardon of all offenses past, with a dispensation for those to
come to all the Roman Catholics, obnoxious to any laws made against the
Recusants.

2. And then to issue forth two general Commands under the Great Seal, the
first to all the Judges, and Justices of the Peace, and the other to all
Bishops, Chancellours and Commissaries not to execute any Statute made against
them.

Their general pardon we have passed, and sent unto his Majesty (from whence
it is not returned) in as full and ample manner as they could desire, and pen
it. The other general and vast prohibition. I prevailed with the rest of the
Lords to stop as yet, and gave (in three days conference) such reasons to the
2. Ambassadors, that (although it is no easy matter to satifie the
Caprichiousnesse of the Latter of them) yet they were both content it should
rest until the Infanta had been six Months in England. My reason, if it may
please your Grace, was this. Although this general favor, and connivence,
whereof there are 20. of the Prime Council know nothing as yet, must at last be
known to all the Land: yet is there a great difference between the publishing
thereof A Golpe, at one push, as it were, and that instilling of it into their
knowledge by little, and little by reason of favors done to particular
Catholics. The former course might breed a general impression, if not a
mutiny. This Letter will but loosen the tongues but of some few particulars,
who understand of their neighbors pardon, and having vented their dislikes,
when they have not many to Sympathise with them, they grow cool again, so as
his majesty afterward may enlarge these favors without any danger at all.

Secondly, to forbid Judges (against their oaths) and Justices of the Peace
(sworn likewise) to execute the law of the Land, is a thing (unpresidented in
this Kingdom et Durus Sermo a very harsh and bitter pill to be digested upon a
sudden, and without some preparation. But to grant a pardon, even for a thing
that is Malum in se, and a dispensation with Penal Laws (in the profit whereof
the King only is interested) is usual and full of presidents, and examples.
And yet is this Letter only tending to the safety, the former but to the glory
and insolency of the Papists, and the magnifying the service of the
Ambassadors ends too dearly purchased, with the indangering of a tumult in
three Kingdoms.

Thirdly and Lastly, his Majesty uses to speak to his Bishops, Judges and
Justices of the peace, by his Chancelour, or Keeper (as your Grace well
knows) and by his Great Seal; and I can signify his Majesty's pleasure unto
them, with less noise and danger, which I mean to do hereafter, (if the
Ambassadors shall press it,) to this effect, unless your Grace shall (from
his Highness, or your own judgment) direct otherwise.

That whereas his Majesty being at this time to mediate for favor to many
Protestants in foreign parts, with Princes of another religion, and to sweeten
the entertainment of the Princess into this Kingdom, who is as yet a Roman
Catholic, does hold a mitigation of the rigor of those laws made against
R^nts, to be a necessary inducement to both those purposes, and has therefore
issued forth some pardons of Grace, and favor to such Roman Catholics, of
whose faithfulness and fidelity to the state he rests assured. That therefore
you the Lords, Bishops, Judges, and Justices, (each of those to be written unto
by themselves) do take notice of this his Majesty's pardon, and dispensation,
with all such penal Laws, and demean your selves accordingly, etc.

Thus have I been too tedious and troublesome unto your Grace, and Crave your
pardon therefore, and some directions (which you may cause Sir Francis
Cottington or some other to write, without your Graces trouble) if there shall
apeare any cause of alteration. Doctor Bishop, the new Bishop of Calcedon is
come to London privately, and I am much troubled thereabouts, not knowing what
to advise his Majesty in this posture, as things stand at this present. If you
were shipped (with the Infanta) the only Council were to let the Judges
proceed with them presently, hang him out of the way, and the King to Blame my
Lord of Cantuar: or my self for it. But before you be shipped in such form and
manner I dare not assent or Connive at such a course. It is (my gracious Lord)
a most insolent Part, and an offense (as I take it) Against our common Law (and
not the statutes only which are dispensed withal,) for an English man to take
such a consecration without the Kings consent, and especially to use any
Episcopal Jurisdiction in this Kingdom without the royal assent, and Bishops,
have been in this State put to their fine, and ransom for doing so three
hundred years ago.

I will cease to to be further troublesome and pray to Almighty God to bless
your Grace, and in all humbleness take my leave, and rest etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke, 14th. of October, 1621.
My most Noble Lord,
I Humbly thank your Lordship for your most sweet and loving Letter, which (as
Sir George Goring could not but observe) has much revived me droo^ing under
the unusual weight of so many businesses. Let God suffer me no longer to be,
then I shall be true, plain, faithful and affectionately respectful of your
Lordship, as being most bound unto your Lordship for these so many fruits, but
far more for the tree that bore them, your love and affection.

If your Lordship shall not think it inconvenient, I do beseech your Lordship
to present this Petition enclosed, either by word or writing unto his Majesty,
and to procure a speedy dispatch thereof, because we are to meet on Thursday
next. Also to acquaint his Majesty, that I stumble at the Proclamation (now
coming to the Seal) against any, that shall draw, or present any bill for his
Majesty's signature, besides those Clarks which usually draw them up, by virtue
of their places. It is most prejudicial to my place, the Lord Treasurer, and
the Judges itinerant who are often occasioned to draw up, and present to his
Majesty diverse matters, and especially pardons of Course. It is also too
strong a tie upon your Lordships hands; being intended by his Majesty against
Projectors and Scriveners only. If it shall please his Majesty therefore to
make an exception of the Lords of his Council, and Judges of Assize, it may
pass to the contentment of all men. Mr. Attorney says he meant this
exception, but I find it not sufficiently expressed in the Proclamation.

Also I humbly beseech your Lordship to meddle with no pardon for the Lord of
St. Albons, until I shall have the happiness to confer with your Lordship; the
pardoning of his fine is much spoken against, not for the matter, (for no man
objects to that) but for the manner, which is full of knavery, and a wicked
president. For by this assignation of his fine, he is protected from all his
Creditors, which I dare say was neither his Majesty's, nor your Lordships
meaning.

I have presumed to send your Lordship a true Copy of that speech, which I made
at Westminster Hall at my entrance upon this office; because somewhat was to
be spoken at so great a change, and alteration in so high a Court; And I was
never so much troubled in my life, not how, but what to speak. I humbly crave
pardon, if I have failed in points of diseretion, which a wiser man (in such a
case) might easily do.

With my heartiest prayers unto God to continue all his blessings upon your
Lordship, I rest deservedly, etc.

Postscript.
MY Lord, I find my Lord Treasurer affectionately touched with removing from
the Court of Wards; and do wish with all my heart, he may have contentment in
that, or any thing else, but orderly, and in a right method. Let him hold it
but by your Lordships favor, not his own power, or wilfulness. And this must
be apparent, and visible: Let all our greatness depend (as it ought) upon
yours, the true original. Let the King be Pharaoh, your self Joseph, and let us
come after as your half-brethren. God bless you, etc.



The Lord Keeper to the Duke, concerning Sir John Michel, 8. Aug. 1622.
My most noble Lord,
IN the cause of Sir John Michel, which has so often wearied this Court, vexed
my Lady your Mother, and now flies (as it seems) unto your Lordship, I have
made an order the last day of the Term, assisted by the Master of the Rolls,
and Mr. Baron Eromley in the presence, and with the full consent of Sir John
Michel, who then objected nothing against the same; but now in a dead vacation,
when both the adverse party, and his Council are out of Town, and that I cannot
possible hear otherwise then with one ear, he clamours against me, (most
uncivilly,) and would have me contrary to all conscience and honesty reverse
the same. The substance of the order is not so difficult and intricate, but
your Lordship will easily find out the equity or harshnesse thereof.

Sir Lawrence Hide makes a motion in behalf of one Strelley (a party whose face
I never saw,) that whereas Sir John Michel had put a bill into this Court
against him, and one Sayers, five years ago for certain Lands and Woods,
(determinable properly at the Common Law) and having upon a certificate betwixt
himself, and Sayers, without the knowledge of the said Strelley, procured an
injunction from the last Lord Chancellor for the possession of the same, locks
up the said Strelley with the said injunction, and never proceeds to bring his
cause to hearing within five years.

It was moved therefore, that either Sir John's bill might be dismissed to a
trial at the Common Law, or else that he might be ordered to bring it to
hearing in this Court, with a direction to save all wastes of Timber trees (in
favor of either party, that should prove the true owner) until the cause
should receive hearing.

Sir John being present in Court, made choice of this last offer, and so it was
ordered accordingly. And this is that order, that this strange man has so
often, of late, complained of to your Mother, and now, as it seems, to your
Lordship. God is my witness, I have never denied either justice, or favor
(which was to be justified,) to this man, or any other, that had the least
relation to your good and most noble Mother. And I hope your Lordship is
persuaded thereof. If your Lordship will give me leave (without your Lordships
trouble) to wait upon you, at any time this day, your Lordship shall appoint, I
would impart two or three words unto your Lordship, concerning your Lordships
own business.

Remaining ever, etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
NOw that I understand by Sir John Hipsley how things stand between your Grace
and the Earl of Bristol; I have done with that Lord, and will never think of
him otherwise, then as your Grace shall direct. Nor did I ever write one
syllable to that effect, but in contemplation of performing true service to
your Grace.

I was much abused in the Lady Hennage her Vice-Counteship, being made to
believe, it was your Grace's act, or else I had stayed it finally, (until the
Princes return) as I did for a time. If your Grace will give any directions in
matters of that nature, I can pursue them. My Lord Treasurers sons Wardship is
a thing of no moment at all, and not worthy your Graces thinking of. And in
good faith as far as getting, and Covetousness will give him leave, I do not
see, but that Lord is (since your absence) very respective of your Grace,
especially in your own person, and affairs. I never received any answer from
your Grace concerning the Provostship of Aeton, nor was it good manners for me
to press for the same, because in my Letters I did presume to name my self.
The place is mine to bestow for this time, and not his Majesty's, nor the
Colleges. But I do very willingly reserve the Collation of the same, to be
disposed as your Grace shall please. Yet this will be a sufficient answer to
any former promise, or any reasonable Competitor.

His Majesty (as your Grace best knows) promised me at the delivery of the
Seal a better Bishopric, and intended it certainly, if any such had fallen. My
Charge is exceeding great, my Bribes are very little, my Bishopric, Deanery,
and other Commendams do not clear unto me above one thousand pounds a year at
the uppermost. It has pleased God, that the casualties of my office, (which is
all the benefit of the same, and enriched my Lord Elsmor,) has not been worth
to me these two years past one shilling. It may mend when it pleases God.

I leave all these, and my self, who am your Vassal, at your Lordships feet,
and do rest, etc.

Your Graces, etc. J. L. C. S.
Postscript.
MAy it please your Grace, I troubled his Highness with a long relation of the
Consulto we had about his Majesty's taking of the Oath. Which I had written to
your Grace, and not to his Highness, but that I was frighted by great men,
that I had done his Highness a displeasure in pressing his Majesty's assent
unto the same. And I protest I was so poorly accompanied in my opinion, that I
was truly afraid I had not done well. And therefore I took occasion to write my
reasons at large unto the Prince. Which I heard by Sir John Hipsley from your
Grace was well taken. I humbly thank your Grace, who I know forwarded the same.
And so I perceive by a Letter from his Highness so full of sweetness, as I am
overwhelmed.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke. 6. January. 1623.
May it please your Grace,
DOn Francisco being with me this night, about a pardon for a poor Irish man,
whom I reprieved from execution, at the suit of those Gentlemen of Navarra,
which are here with the Marquess, let fall by a kind of supposition (affirming
the matter to be as yet in the womb, and not fully shaped, and digested) words
to this effect.

That if the King of Spain should make a double marriage with the second
Brother of France, and his Sister, and bestow the Palatinate as a Dower upon
his sister, in what case were we then? I answered, That we should be then, in
no worse case (for ought I knew) then we are now: but that Germany might be in
a far better case. Peradventure it was but a word let fall to terrify me
withal.

But your Grace may make that use of it, as to understand the language, if your
Grace shall hear any mention thereof hereafter. I am very glad, and do give God
thanks par le mejora de su hijucla hermosissima. And do rest, etc.

Surely the French Ambassador is secret and more suspected then formerly by
the People.

Mr. John Packer to the Lord Keeper, 21. January, 1623.
May it please your Lordship,
SInce my coming hither, finding my Lord at good opportunity, I have acquainted
him in what perplexity I found your Lordship at my coming from Westminster, and
upon what reason. And though I am sorry I can make no comfortable relation of
his answer, yet because it so much imports your Lordship to know in what
terms you stand, I could not conceal it from you, being agreeable to those
reports your Lordship has already heard, saving that his Grace told me, he
does not seek your ruin (as some others had related) but only will hereafter
cease to study your fortune, as formerly he has done; and withal added the
reason, that your Lordship has run a course opposite to him, which though he
had cause to take ill at your hands, yet he could have passed it over, if it
had been out of conscience, or affection to his Majesty's service, or the
Public good, but being both dangerous to your country, and prejudicial to
the cause of religion (which your Lordship above all other men should have
labored to uphold) he thought, he could not with reason continue that
strictness of friendship, where your Lordship had made such a separation,
especially having diverse times out of his love to you, assayd to bring you into
the right way, which once you promised to follow; but the two last times you
met in Council, he found, that you took your kue just as other men did, and
joined with them in their opinions, whose aim was to tax his proceedings in the
managing of the Princes business. But instead of laying it upon him, they did
no less, then throw dirt in the Princes teeth. For either they would make him
a minor, or put the refusal of the Lady upon his Highness, and to lay an
aspersion upon his carriage there. His Lordships Conclusion with me was, that
for any carriage of his, he desires no other favor, but that the greatest
Council in England may be judge of it, and the like he wishes for other men's
actions. Yet I did what I could to persuade his Grace to expostulate the matter
with your Lordship, which he told me, he would no more do, having done it
already, but found no other satisfaction, but that by your practice you
rejected what he had said, and besides, divulged what had passed between you,
as he evidently perceived meeting with it among others. Whereby you gained
only thus much, that they esteemed of you, as of a man fit, by reason of your
passion, to set all on fire, but held you not worthy of trust, because you,
that would not be true to him, would never be so to them.

My Lord, this is a part I would never have chosen, but being imposed by your
Lordship, I could do you no better service then faithfully, and plainly to
discharge it, leaving the use to your Lordships wisdom, and ever resting

Your Lordships most humbly at command, J. P.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke. 2. Feburary, 1623.
May it please your Grace,
NOt presuming to write unto your Grace being so offended at me, but resolved
with sorrow, and Patience, to try what I was able to suffer, without the least
thought of opposition against your absolute pleasure; his Highness has
encouraged, and commanded the contrary, assuring me (which I cannot repeat
again without tears) that upon his credit, your Grace neither did, nor does
conceive any such real distaste against me, but did only suspect I had
conceived his Highnesses mind in that full manner, which his Highness himself,
is now fully satisfied. I did not. In the which error, and mistake of the
Prince his resolution, for want of conference with your Grace, or some other, I
did (as I freely confessed) offend his Highness, but not your Grace at all.
Being ever resolved to stand, or fall (though diversified in opinion) Your
Graces most faithful and constant servant. I humbly therefore beseech your
Grace first to receive back this enclosed Letter of Mr. Packers, and to burn
the same, then to receive my soul in gage and pawn.

1. That I never harbored in this breast one thought of opposition to hurt
your Grace from the first hour I saw your face.

2. I never consulted (much less practiced) with any Lord of that Committee to
vote on the one or the other side.

3. I do not know that Lord in England, that has any design against your
Grace, and when I shall know any such, whosoever it be, I shall be his enemy as
long as he continues so unto your Grace.

4. I do not know (nor do I believe,) but that your Grace stands as firm in his
Majesty's favor, and in his Highness as ever you did in all your life.

5. I never made the least show of siding with any opposite Lord unto your
Grace, and I defy any man, that shall avow it.

6. I never divulged your Graces, or the secrets of any man.

In the next place, I do most humbly and heartily crave your Graces pardon, for
suspecting (that is the utmost of my offense), so true, real, and Noble a
friend. Yet that I may not appear a very beast, give me leave once to remember
and ever after to forget, the motives, which drew me so to do. And I will do it
in the same order they came into my head.

1. Your Graces charge upon me at York house, that I was a man odious to all
the world.

2. Michels Voluntary Confession, that my Lord Mandevil showed him a Letter
from Spain, avowing, that the first action your Grace would imbarque your self
in, should be to remove me our of this place, which the least word of your
mouth unto me, is able to do.

3. A report of the Venetian Ambassador, that amongst others, your Grace
intended to sacrifice me this Parliament to appease the dislike of immunities
exercised toward the Catholics.

4. Your Graces motion unto my self concerning my place (which now I absolutely
know proceeded out of love) at White Hall.

5. A most wicked lie, that one told, he heard your Grace move his Highness to
speak unto me to quit my place, after your Graces professions of friendship to
me.

6. Mr. Secretary Conwaies and my Lord Carlile's estrangednesse from me, which
I suspected could not be (for I ever loved them both) but true copies of your
Graces displeasure.

I have opened to my truest friend all my former thoughts, and being fully
satisfied by his Highness how false they are in every particular, do humbly
crave your Graces pardon, that I gave a nights lodging to any of them all.

Although they never transported me a jott further, then to look about how to
defend my self, being resolved (as God shall be my protector) to suffer all the
obloquie of the world, before I would be drawn to the least ingratitude against
your Grace. All that I beg is an assurance of your Graces former Love, and I
will plainly profess what I do not in the least beg or desire from your Grace.

1. No Patronage of any corrupt or unjust act which shall be objected against
me this Parliament.

2. No defense of me, if it shall appear I betrayed my King, or my Religion in
favor of the Papist, or did them any real respect at all, besides ordinary
complements.

3. No refuge in any of my causes, or clamours against me (which upon a false
supposal of your Graces displeasure may be many) otherwise then according to
justice, and fair proceeding.

And let this paper bear record against me at the great Parliament of all, if I
be not in my heart, and soul, your Graces most faithful and constant poor
friend and Servant.

His Highness desires your Grace to move his Majesty to accept of my Lord
Says commission, and to procure me leave to send for him. Also to move his
Majesty that my Lord of Hartford may be in the house, accepting his fathers
place, and making his protestation to sue for his Grandfathers, according to
his Majesty's Laws, when the King shall give him leave. His Highness, and my
Lords do hold this a modest and submissive Petition.

His Highness upon very deep reasons, doubts whether it be safe to put all
upon the Parliament, for fear they should fall to examine particular
Dispatches, wherein they cannot but find many Contradictions. And would have
the proposition only to aid for the recovery of the Palatinate. To draw on an
engagement I propound it might be, to advise his Majesty how this recovery
shall be effected, by reconquering the same, or by a War of diversion. This
will draw on a breach with Spain, without ripping up of private dispatches. His
Highness seemed to like well hereof, and commanded me to acquaint your Grace
therewith, and to receive your opinion. I humbly, crave again two lines of
assurance, that I am in your Grace's opinion as I will ever be indeed, etc.

The Heads of that Discourse which fell from Don Francisco, 7. Die Aprilis,
1624. at 11. of the clock at night.
This Relation was sent by the Lord Keeper to the Duke.
Don Carlos upon the Prince and Duke in a discourse, thrust a Letter into the
Kings hand, which he desired the King to read in private; The King said he
would, thrust it into his pocket, and went on with his discourse, as if he had
received none. The effect was, to procure private access for Don Francisco to
come and speak with the King, which his Majesty appointed by my Lord of
Kelley; and he by his secrecy, who designed for Don Francisco time and place.



At the last access, which was some 4. days ago, Don Carlos, which I do know.
It was somewhat general, and very rhetorical, if not tragical for the style.
The heads of what I read were these, viz.

1. That the King was no more a freeman at this time, then King John of France
when he was prisoner in England, or King Francis when he was at Madrid. Being
besieged and closed up with the servants and vassals of Buckingham.

2. That the Ambassadors knew very well, and were informed 4. months ago,
that his Majesty was to be restrained, and confined to his Country house, and
pastimes, and the Government of the State to be assumed and disposed of by
others, and that this was not concealed by Buckinghams followers.

3. That the Duke had reconciled himself to all the popular men of the State,
and drawn them forth out of prisons, restraints, and confinements to alter the
Government of the State at this Parliament, as Oxford, South-hampton, Say, and
others, whom he met at Suppers and Ordinaries to strengthen his popularity.

4. That the Duke to breed an opinion of his own greatness, and to make the
King grow less, has oftentimes bragged openly in Parliament, that he had made
the King yield to this and that, which was pleasure unto them. And that he
mentioned openly before the Houses his Majesty's private oath, which the
Ambassadors have never spoken of to any creature to this hour.

5. That these Kingdoms are not now governed by a Monarch, but by a Triumviri,
whereof Buckingham was the first and chiefest, the Prince the second, and the
King the last; and that all look toward Solemn Orientem.

6. That his Majesty should show himself to be, as he was reputed, the oldest
and wisest King in Europe, by freeing himself from this Captivity, and eminent
danger wherein he was, by cutting off so dangerous and ungrateful an affecter
of greatness and popularity, as the Duke was.

7. That he desired his Majesty to conceal this his free dealing with him,
because it might breed him much peril and danger. And yet if it were any way
available for his service, to reveal it to whom he pleased, because he was
ready to sacrifice his life to do him acceptable service.

And this was the effect of so much of the penned speech as I remember was read
unto me out of the Spanish Copy.

His Majesty was much troubled in the time of this speech.

His Offer to the King for the restitution of the Palatinate.
TO have a Treaty for three months for the restitution, and that money was now
given in Spain to satisfy Bavaria. That in the mean time because the people
were so distrustful of the Spaniard, the King might fortify himself at home,
and assist the Hollanders with men or money at his pleasure. And the King of
Spain should not be offended therewith.

His opinion of our preparing of this Navy.
IT was a design of the Duke, to go to the Ports of Sevil, and there to burn
all the Ships in the Harbor, which he laughed at.

Speeches which he said fell from his Majesty concerning the Prince.
1. THat when he told the King, that his greatness with the Duke was such, as
might hinder his Majesty from taking a course to repress him. His Majesty
replied; He doubted nothing of the Prince, or his own power to sever them two,
when he pleased.

2. His Majesty said, That when his Highness went to Spain, he was as well
affected to that Nation as heart could desire, and as well disposed as any son
in Europe; but now he was strangely carried away with rash, and youthful
Councels, and followed the humor of Buckingham, who had he knew not how many
Devils within him since that journey.

Concerning the Duke.
1. THat he could not believe yet, that he affected popularity to his
disadvantage. Because he had tried him of purpose, and commanded him to make
disaffecting motions to the houses, which he performed, whereby his Majesty
concluded, he was not popular.

2. That he desired Don Francisco, and the Ambassadors (and renewed this
request unto them by Padre Maestro two days ago,) to get him any ground to
charge him with popular courses, or to increase a suspicion of it, and he would
quickly take a course with him.

3. That he had good cause to suspect the Duke of late, but he had no servant
of his own, that would charge him with any particular; nor knew he any himself.

The end (as was conceived) of Don Francisco's desiring this Conference.
HE had heard that the Duke had pusht at me in Parliament, and intended to do
so again, when he had done with the Treasurer, and therefore showed, that if I
would join to set upon him with the King, there was a fit occasion.

I answered, that the Prince and the Duke had preferred me into my place, and
kept me in it, and if I found them pursuing I would not keep it an hour. That
what favor soever I showed the Ambassador, or Catholics, I did it for their
sakes, and had thanks of them for it. And that I would deal by way of counsel
with the Duke to be temperate, and moderate; but to be in opposition to my
friend, and Patron, I knew he (being one that professed so much love unto me)
would never expect from an honest man. Upon the which answer he seemed
satisfied, and never replied word in that kind.

I made an end of writing these notes about two of the clock in the morning.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke, concerning Sir Richard Weston, 24. May. 1624.
May it please your Grace,
I Hold it my duty to give your Grace a present account of this Patent made for
Sir Richard Weston. Having put off the sealing of the same as fairly as I could
(though not without the clamor of one Lake, a servant of Mr. Chancelours, Mr.
William Lake.
who very saucily pressed for a dispatch,) this morning, Mr. Chancelour spoke
with me himself, to whom I made answer, That I would seal his Patent, according
to his Majesty's Warrant, but would retain it in my hands (as I was directed)
until I either spoke with the King, or received his farther Command in that
behalf. He told me he would write unto your Grace concerning the stay thereof,
and the stand of the Kings business, until it were delivered, which course (I
told him) was very fair. After I acquainted his Highness with my sealing and
retaining of the Patent, and asked him, if he knew thereof. His Highness
answered, he did know thereof, but gave no approbation of the course, and
(although he durst not speak to cross it) he hoped I should have directions
from the King to pull off the Seals again. Three hours after I went to his
Highness the second time, and asked him, if he meant really as he spoke, or
intended only to make me believe so. I desired to know his mind, lest I might
steer my course contrary to his intendment. His Highness answered, He meant
really, and would endeavor to effectuate all that he spoke. Which I thought
very fitting for your Grace to know with all speed.

But for the man himself, I must deliver unto your Grace my conscience. For
ought I ever saw in him he is a very honest, and a very sufficient man, and
such a one, as I never in all my life could observe to be any way false, or
unfaithful unto your Grace. He was brought in by your Grace fore against my
will, (as your Grace may call to mind, what I said to your Grace at Woodstock
to that effect) not that I disliked the Gentleman, but because I was afraid he
would be wholly the Treasurers, who began then to out-top me, and appeared to
my thoughts, likely enough by his daring and boldness, (two virtues very
powerful and active upon our Royal Master,) in time to do as much to your
Grace. From that time to this, I never observed in Weston any unworthiness,
or ingratitude to your Grace. Nay, craving pardon, I will proceed one step
farther, I know no fitter man in England for the office, if he come in as a
creature of the Prince, and your Grace's; nor unfitter, if he should offer to
take it, without your likings. I think your Grace will remember, that this
fortnight, this has been my constant opinion.

Upon the death of one Mr. Read, the Secretaries place for the Latin tongue is
void. The Dean of Winchester, and I moved the King for Patrick Young, the
fittest man in England for that place. And the Prince did, and will second the
motion. I Beseech your Grace to assist us, or else the immodesty of his
Competitor (that Lake I spoke of in the beginning of this Letter) will bear
down this most honest, and bashful creature.

God be thanked for your Graces recovery and still preserve it. And so etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke. 22. August. 1624.
May it please your Grace,
I Humbly thank your Grace for your favorable and Gracious remembrance, sent
by my Neighbor Sir George Goring. Though I despair to be able to make any
other requital, yet will I never fail to serve your Grace most faithfully, and
when I grow unnseful in that kind, to pray for you.

I beseech your Grace, that I may receive from the Prince's Highness, and your
Grace, some directions how to demean my self to the French Ambassador, in
matters concerning Recusants, and that Mr. Secretary may either address
himself to Mr. Atturny General in these causes, or else write unto me plainly
what I am to do.

His last letter required of me, and the Judges (who neither are, nor will be
in town these six weeks yet,) an account of this their supposed persecution,
neither so much as intimating unto me what, or when I should return an answer,
and supposes some directions his Majesty should give me therein, the which
(particularly, or dividedly from the Judges) I never received.

I adventured out of mine own head to write that answer, I imagine your Grace
has seen, whether I did well, or ill therein I know not, but conceived his
Majesty expected some answer. Yesterday the Ambassador sent unto me, to know
if I had received any order from his Majesty to stay this (as he termed it)
persecution. I assured him, there was no such matter in this state, and that as
yet, I had received no order from his Majesty of late, but was in expectation
to hear from the Court very shortly. I humbly crave your Graces directions,
what I am to say, or do in the premises, being otherwise a mere stranger in all
these proceedings. I write to no body herein besides your Grace, so as if I
receive no direction, (which upon my head, and livelihood I shall bury in all
secrecy) I shall be in a pitiful perplexity, if his Majesty shall turn the
Ambassador upon me, altogether unprovided how to answer. And so with my
hartiest prayers for your Graces health, I rest

yours, etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke. 21. July. 1624.
May it please your Grace,
I Could not suffer Sir George Goring to depart without these few lines,
although the greatest matter of their contents must be this, to express unto
your Grace my sorrow, and affliction, that I have no matter or occasion at all,
wherein to show actuallie my affections and earnest desires to comply with my
bounden duty in serving your Grace, and humbly to desire your Grace to believe,
that there is no soul living shall do it more sincere-ly, and faithfully to the
utmost of my understanding, then my self will do. I add this Caution the
rather, because if ever I have offended your Grace, I take Almighty God to
witness, it was only forwant of a perfect understanding of those high
matters, and the persons bent, whom they concerned, not out of any corruption
of affections toward your Grace, or the least staggering in a continued
resolution to live, and die, your Graces most constant, and most faithful
servant.

This, God in heaven (who sees what I now write,) and the King, and Prince
upon carth, do perfectly know, and I (nothing doubt it) will acknowledge unto
your Grace. And thus with my most humble thanks unto your Grace for that
assurance I received, that I remain (though unimployed and unprofitablely) yet
in your Graces good affection, I beseech Almighty God to preserve your health,
and to increase your favourday, by day with God, with the King, with the
Prince, and with all good men. The daily vows of etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke concerning the Countess of South hampton 17.
November. 1624.
May it please your Grace,
I Know how few arguments I need to use to persuade your Grace to works of
Nobleness, and charity. Your fashion has been ever since my happiness of
dependence upon you, to outrun, and prevent all petitions in this kind. Yet
pardon my boldness to be an humble suitor unto your Grace to go on, as I know
you have already begun, in extending your Grace, and goodness toward the most
distressed widow, and children of my Lord of South-hampton. Your Grace cannot
do any work of charity more approved of by God, more acceptable unto men, and
that shall more recommend the memory of your Nobleness to future posterity.
Sir William Spencer (the only Solicitor this sorrowful Lady has now to
employ,) will present some particulars unto your Grace, whom God ever preserve
in all health, and happiness. And so, etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke, 11. October. 1624.
May it please your Grace,
With my most humble and hearty thanks for all your favors extended, and
multiplied daily toward me in sickness and health, which are such, and so
many, that (although I trust in God I shall never prove so inhumane as to fail
in any service, or faithfulness to your Grace,) I must for all that ever live,
and die ungrateful. I thought fit to return unto your Grace this account of the
message received by your Grace's Steward.

I spoke with that Lord, and although he seemed to be quite off from the
business, and had (to my knowledge) disposed of his money for a great, and a
fair purchase here in London, and was resolved never to touch any more upon
VVatt Steward, (who had touched somewhat of his,) and with whom he had agreed
for 4000 l. yet hearing the proposition to come so entirely from me, as
proceeding immediately from your Grace, whose good favors this Lord (I protest
unto your Grace) has earnestly desired, and if at any time he has straggled
aside from the Prince's desires, and yours, it was merely and solely because he
thought he was not so much relied upon as others of his rank. He promises me
sometime to morrow a reasonable answer.

His material Objections were these.

1. QUantity of the money; so as first and last he is out 16000 l. whereas
Cavendish his Countryman and neighbor got up from a Gentleman, for 14000. l. I
answered, That I observed your Grace never got by any of these bargains, but
that in this compass of a year or two, your favors exceed any gratuity
presented.

2. Precedencie before Wallingford, and especially Vane. I did promise (for
your service) to dispute the latter, but could say nothing to the former,
because he was a Viscount, and his far ancienter Baron.

3. Your Grace's favor, and reflection upon himself, (bred up in the
experience of war and peace,) and upon his sons, all of them well bred, but
most toward the War. I did answer generally, that upon his application of
himself toward your Grace, I made little doubt, but he should receive good
satisfaction in those expectances.

4. Times of payment. I told him I knew he would demand but a convenient time
therein, and that I knew your Grace would never stand upon.

If I have erred in any of these addresses, I pray let your Steward come, and
reform me therein; as also to tell me, whether if I find him coming forward, I
may not say unto him, That your Lordship upon a former motion of mine, was
willing upon the next change of the Commission for the Council of the War, to
add him unto the number.

I propose this,

1. Because it is a new thing.

2. Because he desires some excuse unto the World, by reason of some future
services, why his Majesty should receive him unto this honor. I have wearied
my self, and by this time (which does less become me) your Grace too. I
beseech your Grace to pardon the blottings and extravagancies, my head being
yet but meanly settled. I beseech God to bless your Grace. And so, etc.

Postscript.
MAy it please your Grace, this Lord has returned his answer, which in good
says seems to be with due respect unto your Grace.

1. That although the place was offered him for 4000 l. yet because the Offer
proceeds from your Grace, (which he voweth to esteem as an especial favor as
long as he lives) he will pay to whom you shall assign 5000 l. and account it
a real obligation of service to your Grace for ever, if you shall remit him the
other thousand pound.

2. That for the time, with humble thanks for your noble favor (which becomes
not him to take in appointing the time) he returns it to your Grace to nominate
two days of payment, as your Steward, or the person assigned shall think meet
and fit for your Graces occasions, desiring some small respite for the former,
but as little as the party please afterward for the second payment: for his
Lordship will send in for his moneys forthwith. And he will give his bonds, or
(which I hold superfluous from so sure a Card) his Morgage in present for both
payments.

3. If your Grace shall make him your servant with this favor so nobly
conditioned, he hopes your Grace may proceed on with his Patent thus forward,
without any stay for any other Corrival, which notwithstanding he humbly refers.

4. But desires, if his presentment be accepted, he may have leave by me to
render his thanks unto your Grace personally sometime to morrow.

And so I leave your Grace for this time in Gods protection. And rest


Yours, etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke. 24. December, 1624.
My most Gracious Lord,
I Most humbly beseech your Grace for Gods sake, and his Churches, to consider
of this motion, which I do make unto your Grace, concerning the Deanerie of
York now vacant, the Dean being struck dead suddenly, by a Letter, which one
Dr. Scot procured from his Majesty, to be his Coadjutour.

It is not for any man in particular; but against Doctor Scot, that he may not
by the importunity of any one upon your Grace be promoted to this place, being
the sixth, or seventh place of preferment Ecclesiastical within this Kingdom,
but that your Grace would be pleased to remove Doctor White, or Doctor Hall, or
whom your Grace shall please, unto this great Deanery, and bestow the lesser
Deanerie (far above his merit) upon him.

For these Reasons.

1. I know that he has sold away all his Livings which he has had in this
Church, and has at this day never an one.

2. I am credibly informed, he owes 5000 l. at the least. A vast sum for a
poor Scholar, and too much to be got up in a poor Church. And most of this
money in York.

3. I know he is a great Gamester, and of no fitting conversation for a
Churchman; but of very mean parts, either of Learning, or government.

4. I am certified at this time, that he is a man often overseen in drink; but
this I do not know.

If therefore your Grace shall be pleased, upon my Lord Mordant's importunity
to procure him any Deanerie, I do not doubt but his Lordship will be satisfied,
and that Church eternally obliged unto you for that Commutation. And I beseech
your Grace to believe him, that is no way interested herein, that it concerns
your Grace very much in credit, and reputation, that so mean a man (amongst
such a choice as the Church of England does afford,) be not by your favor
preferred to so high a dignity. God be merciful to my sins, as I have no end
herein but your Honor, and the good of that Church, and therefore I recommend
no particular man unto your Grace, but do rest

Yours, etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke, concerning Dr. Scott, 4. January, 1624.
May it please your Grace,
I Humbly beseech you to interpret favorably, what I said unto his Majesty or
his Highness, as intending to put off Dr. Scott from this place. And no way
(God be my witness) to cross your Grace, nor to hurt Scot, who might have
been otherways sufficiently provided for.

But I should have written or spoken unto your Grace? so I did in this Letter
enclosed, upon Christmasse Eve. But I confess I durst not send it, for fear of
offending your Grace, which I do take all possible diligence to avoid.

But, I spoke unto the King, and Prince? I did so; but with this caution,
(which I know they do remember,) that if your Grace would not upon the motion
exchange Scot to some other preferment, I did not hold it fit to press these
charges against him, but would do my endeavor to still and quiet those of the
Church of York, who (I confess unto your Grace) are the men that have written
against him.

But I recommended Dr. White, and another to the Prince, and Dr. Warner to
your Grace: I confess it, but must distinguish the times, and the manner. I
commended Dr. Warner, when I was informed Dr. White had his answer, and
denial, and that your Grace was off from Dr. Scot, and did desire to hear from
me, what Doctor Warner was, whom I recommended only in general terms upon the
suit of another. What I said of him, I believe, and know to be true, but he is
so far from being any creature of mine, that I protest before the Almighty God,
I never spoke one word with the man to this very hour in all my life. I did
conceive so meanly of Doctor Scot, that no worthy man in the Kingdom should
have failed of my recommendations in this particular.

Now I know your Grace's resolution, I do alter my opinion, and humbly crave
your Grace's pardon for my meddling therein, although I know his Highness will
bear me witness, it was with all dutiful respect unto your Grace. I shall be
very careful of giving your Grace the least cause of jealousy in this kind
again. And whereas I had put a poor suit in your Grace's hands about the
helping of mypoor fortunes, I will let that, and all others fall, and desire
only to be accounted

Yours, etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke, 2. March, 1624.
May it please your Grace,
THis heavy, and unexpected accident of my Lord Stewards death, makes me to be
troublesome unto your Grace at this time. In safety and discretion, I might
very easily spare this labor: but my obligation to your Grace is such, as if
that I conceal any thing, which but my self apprehends fit to be represented to
your Grace, whilst I affect the title of a reserved, close, and wise, I may
lose the other of an honest man, which I more esteem.

Thus much by way of preface.

I represent this office of a Lord Steward, as a place to be either accepted of
by your self, or else to be discontinued (as for many years toward the latter
end of Queen Elizabeth, and the beginning of our Masters reign it was) and in
any case, not to be placed upon another, without the deliberation of some few
years at the least. Being an office, that none but the Kings Kinsmen, or
Favorites, or Counterfavourites (raised up of purpose to balance the great
one) have anciently possessed: I could desire your Grace had it in your own
person; for these Reasons.

1. It is an office of fair, and very competent gettings, but that is scarce
considerable.

2. It keeps you in all changes and alterations of years near the King, and
gives unto you all the opportunities, and accesses, without the envy of a
favorite. I beseech your Grace pause well upon this, and call to mind, if the
Duke of Richmond was not in this case.

3. It Gives you opportunities to gratify all the Court, great and small,
Virtute Officii in right of your place. Which is a thing better accepted of,
and interpreted, then a courtesy from a favorite. Because in this you are a
dispenser of your own; but in the other (say many envious men,) of the Kings
goodness, which would flow fast enough of it self, but that it is restrained
to this Pipe and channel only.

4. There must be one day an end of this attendance as a Bedchamber man, but I
hope never of being next unto the King, as a great Counceller, and officer, and
above all others, which you cannot be, but by this office. The Master of the
horse is but a Knights place at the most, and the Admirals (in time of action)
either to be employed abroad Personally, or to live at home in that ignominy,
and shame, as your Grace will never endure to do so.

I will trouble your Grace with a tale of Dante the first Italian Poet of note.
Who being a great, and wealthy man in Florence, and his opinion demanded, who
should be sent Ambassador to the Pope, made this answer, that he knew not who
Si jo vo chista, Si jo sto chi va. If I go, I know not who shall stay at home;
if I stay, I know not who can perform this employment. Yet your Grace staying
at home in favor, and greatness with his Majesty, may by your designs and
directions so dispose of the Admiral, as to enjoy the glory, without running
the hazard of his personal employment. My Gracious Lord, if any man shall put
you in hope, that the Admiralty will fill your Coffers, and make you rich, call
upon them to name one Admiral that ever was so. As in time of hostility there
is some getting, so are there hungry and insatiable people presently to devour
the same. God made man to live upon the land, and necessity only drives him to
Sea. Yet is not my advice absolutely for your relinquishing of this, but in any
case for the retaining of the other place though with the loss of the
Admiraltie.

5. I beseech your Grace observe the Earl of Leicester, (who being the only
favorite in Queen Elizabeth's time, that was of any continuance) made choice of
this place only, and refused the Admiralty two several times, as being an
occasion, either to withdraw him from the Court, or to leave him there, laden
with ignominy. And yet being Lord Steward, wise, and in favor, he wholly
commanded the Admiralty, and made it ministerial, and subordinary to his
directions.

6. Remember, that this office is fit for a young, a middle, and an old man to
enjoy, and so is not any other that I know about his Majesty. Now God almighty
having given you favor at the first, and since a great quantity (I never
flattered your Grace, nor do now) of wit, and wise experience, I would humbly
recommend unto your Grace this opportunity to be nearest unto the King in your
young, your middle, and your decreasing age, that is to be on earth, as your
piety will one day make you in heaven, an everlasting favorite. There are many
objections, which your Grace may make, but if I find any inclination in your
Grace to lay hold upon this proposition, I dare undertake to answer them all.
Your Grace may leave any office you please (if your Grace be more in love with
the Admiraltie, then I think you have cause,) to avoid envy. But my final
conclusion is this, to desire your Grace most humbly to put no other Lord into
this office, without just, and mature deliberation. And to pardon this
boldness, and haste, which makes me to write so weakly in a theme, that I
persuade my self I could maintain very valiantly; I have no other copy of
this Letter, and I pray God your Grace be able to read this. I send your Grace
a Letter delivered unto me from Conde Gondomar, and dated either at Madrid, or
(as I observe it was written first,) at London. There is no great matter at
whither of the places it was invented. I humbly beseech your Grace to send by
this bearer the resolution for the Parliament. And do rest

Yours etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke about Sr. Robert Howard. 11 March 1624.
May it please your Grace,
SIr Robert Howard appeared yesterdy, and continues obstinate in his refusal to
swear. When we came to examine the commission for our power to fine him for this
obstinacy, we found that Sir Edward Cook, (foreseeing out of a prophetical,
how near it might concern a Grandchild of his own day) has expunged this
clause (by the help of the Earl of Salisburie,) out of the commission, and
left us nothing but the rustie sword of the church, excommunication, to
vindicate the authority of this Court. We have given him day until Saturdy
next, either to conform, or to be excommunicated. She has answered wittily,
and cunningly, but yet sufficient for the Conisance of the Court. Confesses a
fame of incontinencie against her, and Howard, but says it was raised by her
Husbands kindred. I do not doubt but the business will go on well, but
(peradventure) more slowly, if Howard continue refractory, for want of this
power to fine, and amerce him. I beseech your Grace, either to procure me the
favor to come, or to excuse my not seeing his Majesty in this time of his
indisposition, which I hear still continues. I beseech Almighty God (as in
eternal duty I am bound) presently to ease him, and restore him to his perfect
health Mr. Packers being away makes me unmannerly. I am humbly to desire your
Grace to be pleased to move his Majesty (at your first opportunity) to sign
this Commission, for the proroguing of the Parliament, and to read unto his
Majesty this paper of names here enclosed, (which his Majesty is not to
sign,) knowing his pleasure, whether he allows of them for Commissioners for
the last subside of the Lords. I have added to the former the Earl of
Montgomerie according to your Graces direction, whom God almighty ever
preserve. It is the prayer of etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke 13. March. 1624.
May it please your Grace,
FOr your Brothers business, this is all I have to acquaint your Grace with.
Sir Robert Howard appeared yesterday at Lambeth, pretended want of Council,
(the Doctors being out of town) desired respite until to morrow, and had it
granted by my Lords Grace. Most men think he will not take his oath at all; I
do incline to the contrary opinion, because (to my knowledge) he has sent far,
and near for the most able Doctors in the Kingdom to be feed for him, which
were great folly if he intended not to answer. He is extremely commended for
his closeness and secrecy by the major part of our auditors, (the He and
She good fellows of the town,) and though he refuses to be a Confessor, yet
is sure to die a Martyr, and most of the Ladies in town will offer at his
shryne. The Lady Hatton some nine days since, was at Stoke, with the good
Knight her Husband for some counsel in this particular. But he refused to
meddle therewithal, and dismissed her Ladyship, when she had stayed with him very
lovingly half a quarter of an hour.

The cause of my troubling your Grace is this. The French Ambassador is fired
with some complaints of our Recusants, who (I verily believe) work upon him
purposely, finding him to be of a combustible disposition. To morrow he is
resolved to come upon you, and our Master with Complaints, for lack of
performances to the Papists. And because I would furnish your Grace with as
much answer, as I am acquainted with, (nothing doubting but your Grace is
otherways better provided,) I make bold to present your Grace with these
particulars.

1. With a Letter from my Lord Archbishop of York in answer to another of mine;
which shows how really his Majesty's promise has been in that kind performed.
I beseech your Grace to keep it safe in your pocket, until I shall have the
honor to wait upon your Grace, when you have made use of the same.

2. If your Grace shall hear him complain of the Judges in their charges, and
of their receiving of Indictments; your Grace may answer, That those charges
are but orations of Course, opening all the penal Laws, and the Indictments
being presented by the Country, cannot be refused by the Judges. But the Judges
are ordered to execute nothing actually against the Recusants, nor will they do
it, during the negotiation.

3. Your Grace may put him in mind, that my Lord Keeper does every day, when
his, (the Lord Ambassadors) Secretary calls upon him, grant forth Writs to
remove all the persons indicted in the Country into the Kings Bench, out of the
power and reaches of the Justices of the Peace. And that being there, the King
may, and does release them at his pleasure.

4. That the Spanish Ambassador never had, nor desired more then these favors.

5. That you are informed, that Copies of Letters written from the King to both
the Archbishops are spread abroad in Staffordshire, to his Majesty's
disadvantage (for so it is) and that thereby my Lord Ambassador may perceive
the bent of the English Catholics, which is not to procure ease and
quietness to themselves, but Scandals to their neighboring Protestants, and
discontentments against the King and State.

I humbly crave your Graces pardon for this boldness, and tediousness, and
with my hearty prayers for your health, do rest

yours, etc.

The Lord Keeper to the Duke, 22. March, 1624.
May it please your Grace,
I Send your Grace here enclosed, the Kings Commission, and the Prince's
Proxy, not fairly written, (which the Ambassadors upon the place may procure
in a frech hand,) but yet legibly, and passably. The Prince's Proxy refers the
manner unto the articles, and particularly to the second, third, and fourth
Section of those Articles; which gives me occasion to beg of your Grace
pardon, to desire your Grace to think seriously upon the third Section, to
advise with the Prince, and to give Mr. Packer charge to inform your Grace
punctually what he knows, and may inform himself concerning those
particulars. That is, How the Queen Margaret of France was married to Henry the
fourth, and how Madam his sister was married to the Prince of Lorrain. For
although they are both made alike in the article, yet surely they were not
married after the same fashion. For the Duchess of Bar was married in a
closet, without a Mass, by words only of the Present tense, as I believe, I
have read in the History of Thuanus. A favor, which will hardly be granted to
your Grace. And how Queen Margaret was married, my Lords the Ambassadors will
soon learn, if your Grace will be pleased to write unto them.

I hold it (in a manner) necessary, that your Grace do carry over with you in
your company one Civilian to put your Grace in mind of the formalities
required; and if your Grace be of that mind, your own Doctor, Dr. Reeves is as
fit as any man else, who is a good Scholar, and speaks that language. Your
Grace has revived my Lord of Clare, sithence I spoke with your Grace. And I
beseech your Grace to follow that resolution, and to let Mr. Packer draw up a
warrant of 3. or 4. lines signed by the King to me to place him with the rest
of the Council of War. It will be an occasion to take up more of that time,
which he now spends with the Lady Hatton. For now I am resolved, that I was of
the right in my conjecture to your Grace, that his Lordship had utterly refused
my Lady Purbecks cause (of the which the very common people begin to be
ashamed) but is deeply engaged against my Lady of Richmond, Duchess of
Richmond.
in the business of that famous (or rather notorious) foeminine Contract, and
bargain, of sixteen hundred pounds by the year for a house to sleep in.

When your Grace shall draw up your Instructions, you will be pleased to use
the words, To Contract, Espouse and marry Our Welbeloved Son, etc. because
they do in those parts contract always before marriage. And your Grace will be
pleased to express his Majesty's pleasure, that this is to be done by your
self, and no other: Because although the two Earls upon the place, have some
such general words in their Commission, yet your Grace only is named in the
Prince's Proxy, and now solely employed by the King to that purpose. Although
I conceived this restraint to be fitter a great deal for the instructions, then
the Commission.

I am extreme sorry to hear what a grievous fit his Majesty had this last
night. But I hope it is a farewell of the Agues, and I pray God it be the last
fit. And now am an humble suitor again, that I may come and look upon his
Majesty, resolved to say nothing, but that which I will never cease to say,
God bless him. If your Grace holds it inconvenient, I beseech your Grace to
excuse me, and to account me as I will ever be found,

Yours, etc.

The Bishop of Lincoln to the Duke, 7th. of January, 1625.
Most Gracious Lord,
BEing come hither, according unto the duty of my place, to do my best service
for the preparation to the Coronation, and to wait upon his Majesty for his
Royal pleasure and direction therein; I do most humbly beseech your Grace, to
crown so many of your Grace's former favors, and to revive a Creature of your
own, struck dead only with your displeasure, (but no other coffeehouse in
the universal world,) by bringing of me to kiss his Majesty's hand, with whom
I took leave, in no disfavour at all. I was never hitherto brought into the
presence of a King, by any Saint, besides your self: Turn me not over (most
noble Lord) to offer my prayers at new Altars. If I were guilty of any
unworthy unfaithfulness for the time past, or not guilty of a resolution to
do your Grace all service for the time to come, all considerations under Heaven
could not force me to beg it so earnestly, or to profess my self, as I do
before God, and you,

Your Grace's most humble, affectionate, and devoted servant, Jo. Lincoln.

The Bishop of Lincoln to his Majesty.
Most Mighty, and dread Sovereign,
I Have now these four months, by the strength of those gracious speeches your
Majesty used, (when I took my leave of your Majesty at Salisbury,) and the
conscience of mine own innocence from having ever wilfully or maliciously
offended your Majesty, comforted my self in these great afflictions; to be
thus enjoined from your Majesty's presence (the only heaven wherein my soul
delighted,) having submitted my self (I hope dutifully, and patiently) to the
discharge from that great Office (for the execution whereof I was altogether
unworthy;) My required absence from the Council Table; my sequestration from
attending your Majesty's Coronation: And your Majesty's favorable pleasure
(for so I do esteem that,) to spare my presence at this next Parliament. And I
trust in God I shall most readily obey any other Command, that bears the image
and superscription of your Majesty, without any desire of searching after the
hand that helps to press and ingrave it. Yet because I suffer in some more
particulars then peradventure is explicitly known to your Majesty: And that I
have no friend lest about your Majesty, that dares for fear of displeasure
relate unto your Majesty my griefs, and necessities, I humbly crave your
gracious Pardon to make some two representations, and some few Petitions unto
your most excellent Majesty.

First, I humbly show unto your Majesty, that besides my former Calamities, I
am not paid that part of my Pension, which should pay the Creditors, who lent
me money to buy the same; notwithstanding your Majesty has been graciously
pleased to order otherwise.

Secondly, I have not yet received my Writ of Summons unto the Parliament
(denied to no Prisoners, or condemned Peers in the late reign of your blessed
Father,) that I might accordingly make my Proxy, the which I cannot do, the
Writ not received; nor can I my self go into the Country, as I had done long
ere this, had not the expectation of this Writ, together with the special
service of my Lord Duke, and no other occasion whatsoever detained me.

These two particulars I present with all submission unto your Majesty, and
shall rest satisfied with what royal resolution your Majesty shall make
therein.

These petitions that follow I must earnestly beg at your Majesty's hands, and
for Gods sake, and your blessed Fathers sake, whose Creature, and most painful
servant I was.

First, that your Majesty would be pleased to mitigate, and allay the
causeless displeasure of my Lord Duke against me; who is so little satisfied
with any thing I can do, or suffer, that I have no means left to appease his
anger, but my prayers to God, and your Sacred Majesty.

Secondly, I beseech your Majesty for Christ Jesus sake not to believe news,
or accusations against me concerning my carriage past, present, or to come,
whilst I stand thus enjoined from your Royal presence, before you shall have
heard my answer, and defense unto the particulars. Those that inform your
Majesty may (God he knows) be oftentimes misinformed.

My last supplication unto your Majesty is, That in my absence this
Parliament, no use may be made of your sacred name to wound the reputation of a
poor Bishop, who besides his Religion and Duty to that Divine Character you
now bear, has ever affectionately honored your very Person above all the
objects in this world, as he desires the salvation of the world to come. But I
crave no protection against any other accuser, or accusation whatsoever. So
shall I never cease to pray to the Almighty God to make your Majesty the
Happiest and Greatest King, that ever was Crowned, and Anointed: which shall be
the continual orisons of

Your Majesty's most dutiful and most humble Vassal, Jo. Lincoln.

The Lord Keeper to the Lord Viscount Anan. 17. September. 1622.
Right Honorable,
I Owe more service to that true love, and former acquaintance, which your
Lordship has been pleased to afford me, now these full ten years, then to be
sparing, or reserved in satisfying your Lordship about any doubt whatsoever,
the resolution whereof shall lie in my power. Concerning that offense, taken by
many people, both on this side the borders and in Scotland, from that Clemency
which his Majesty was pleased to extend to the imprisoned Lay-Recusants of
this Kingdom, and my Letter written unto the Justices for the reigling of the
same, which your Lordship did intimate unto me yesterday at Mr. Henry Gibbs his
house, out of some news received from a Peer of Scotland. This is the plainest
return I can make unto your Lordship. In the general, as the Sun in the
firmament appears unto us no bigger then a Platter, and the Stars but as so
many nails in the pummel of a saddle, because of the Elongement and
disproportion between our eyes, and the object; so is there such an
unmeasurable distance betwixt the deep resolution of a Prince, and the shallow
apprehension of common and ordinary people, that as they will be ever judging
and censuring, so must they be obnoxious to error and mistaking.

Particularly, for as much as concerns my self, I must leave my former life, my
profession, my continual preaching, my writing, (which is instant in the hands
of many,) my private endeavors about some great persons, and the whole bent of
my actions, (which in the place I live in cannot be concealed, to testify unto
the world, what favor I am likely to importune for the Papists in their
religion. For the King my Master, I will tell you a story out of Velleius
Paterculus. A Surveyor bragging to M. Livius Drusus, that he would so contrive
his house Vt Libera a conspectu immunis ab omnibus arbitris esset, that it
should stand removed out of sight, and be past all danger of peeping, or
Eves-dropping; was answered again by Drusus, Tu vero, si quid in te artis est
ita compone domum mean, ut quicquid agam ab omnibus Conspici possit, Nay my
good friend, if you have any devices in your head, contrive my house after such
a manner, that all the world may see what I do therein. So if I should
endeavor to flourish up some artificial Vault, to hide and conceal the
intentions of his Majesty, I know I should receive the same thanks, that the
Surveyor did from Drusus. I was not called to Council by his royal Majesty,
when the resolution of this Clemency to the Lay-Recusants was first concluded:
But if I had been asked my opinion, I should have advised it without the least
haesitation. His Majesty was so Popishly addicted at this time, that (to the
incredible exhaustments of this Treasury) he was a most zealous interceder for
some ease and refreshment to all the Protestants in Europe, his own Dominions,
and Denmarks only excepted.

Those of Swithland (having lately provoked the Pole) had no other hope of
peace; those of France of the exercise of their Religion; those of the
Palatinate, and adjoining Countries of the least connivencie to say their
prayers, then by the earnest mediation of our gracious Master. And advised by
the late Assembly of Parliament to insist a while longer in this milkie way of
intercession, and Treaty. What a preposterous argument would this have been to
desire those mighty Princes (armed, and victorious) to grant some liberty, and
clemency to the Protestants, because himself did now imprison, and execute the
rigor of his laws against the Roman Catholics. I must deal plainly with
your Lordship. Our viperous countrymen the English Jesuits in France to
frustrate these Pious endeavors of his Majesty's, had many months before this
favor granted, retorted that argument upon us, by writing a most malicious
book (which I have seen, and read over) to the French King, inciting him, and
the three Estates, to put all those statutes in execution against the
Protestants in those parts, which are here enacted, and (as they falsely
informed) severally executed upon the Papists. I would therefore see the most
subtle State-monger in the world chalk out a way for his Majesty to mediate
for Grace, and favor for the Protestants, by executing at this time the
severity of the Laws upon the Papists. And that this favor should mount to a
Toleration, is a most dull, (and yet a most divelish) misconstruction.

A Toleration looks forward, to the time to come: This favor backward only,
to the offenses past. If any Papist now set at liberty shall offend the laws
again, the Justices may, (nay must) recommit him, and leave favor and mercy to
the King, to whom only it properly belongs. Nay let those 2. writs directed
to the Judges, be as diligently perused by those rash Censures as they were by
those grave, and learned, to whom his Majesty referred the penning of the,
same and they shall find, that these Papists are no otherotherwise out of
prison, then with their shackles about their heels, sufficient sureties, and
good recognisances to present themselves again at the next assizes. As
therefore that Lacedemonian posed the Oracle of Apollo, by asking his opinion
of the bird which he grasped in his hand, whether he were alive, or dead, so it
is a matter yet controversed, and undecided, whether those Papists (closed up,
and grasped in the hands of the law) be still in prison, or at liberty. Their
own demeanours, and the success of his Majesty's negotiations, are Oracles
that must deside the same. If the Lay-papists do wax insolent with this mercy,
insulting upon the Protestants, and translating this favor from the person to
the cause, I am verily of opinion his Majesty will remand them to their former
state, and condition, and renew his writ no more. But if they shall use these
graces modestly, by admitting Conference with learned Preachers, demeaning
themselves neighbourly and peaceably, praying for his Majesty, and the
prosperous success of his pious endeavors, and relieving him bountifully
(which they are as well able to do as any of his Subjects,) if he shall be
forced and constrained to take his sword in hand, then it cannot be denied, but
our Master is a Prince, that has (as one said) plus humanitatis pene quam
hominis, and will at that time leave to be merciful, when he leaves to be
himself. In the mean while, this argument fetched from the Devils topics, which
concludes a Concreto ad abstractum from a favor done to the English Papists,
that the King favors the Romish Religion is such a composition of folly,
and malice, as is little deserved by that gracious Prince, who by word,
writing, exercise of Religion, acts of Parliament, late directions for
catechizing, and preaching, and all professions, and endeavors in the world
has demonstrated himself so resolved a Protestant. God by his holy Spirit open
the eyes of the people, that these aierie representations of ungrounded fancies
set aside, they may clearly discern, and see how by the goodness of God, and
the wisdom of their King, this Island of all the Countries in Europe is the
sole nest of peace and true Religion, and the inhabitants thereof unhappie
only in this one thing, that they never look up to heaven to give God thanks
for so great a happiness.

Lastly, for mine own Letter to the Judges, (which did only declare, not
operate the favor,) it was either much mis-penned, or much misconstrued. It
recited four kinds of recusancies only capable of his Majesty's clemency not
so much to include these, as to exclude many other crimes bearing amongst the
Papists the name of Recusancies, as using the function of a Romish Priest,
seducing the Kings liege people from the Religion established, scandalizing and
aspersing our King, Church, State, or present Government. All which offenses
(being outward practices, and no secret motions of the conscience,) are
adjudged by the Laws of England to be merely civil, and political, and
excluded by my Letter from the benefit of those Writs, which the bearer was
employed to deliver unto the Judges.

And thus I have given your Lordship a plain account of the carriage of this
business, and that the more suddenly, that your Lordship might perceive it is
not Aurea Fabula, or prepared tale, but a bare Narration, which I have sent
unto your Lordship. I beseech your Lordship to let his Majesty know, that the
Letters to the Justices of Peace concerning those four heads recommended by his
Majesty, shall be sent away as fast as they can be exscribed. I will trouble
your Lordship no more at this time, but shall rest ever

Your Lordships servant and true friend, Jo. Lincoln. C. S.

The Bishop of Menevensis to the Duke: Dr. Laud.
My most Gracious Lord,
I May not be absent, and not write. And since your Grace is pleased with the
trouble, I must profess my self much content with the performance of the
duty. I am not unmindful of the last business your Grace committed to me, but
I have as yet done the less in it, because I fell into a relaps of my
infirmity, but I thank God I am once more free, if I can look better to my
self, as I hope I shall.

My Lord, I must become an humble suitor to your Grace. I hear by good hand
that my Lord of Canterbury intends shortly to renew the High Commission. Now I
am to acquaint your Grace, that there is never a Bishop that lives about London
left out of the Commission but my self, and many that live quite absent are in,
and many inferiors to Bishops. The Commission is a place of great experience
for any man, that is a Governor in the Church. And since by his Majesty's
gracious goodness, and your Grace's sole procurement, I am made a Governor, I
would be loath to be excluded from that which might give me experience, and so
enable me to perform my duty. I am sure my Lord of Canterbury will leave me
out, as hitherto he has done, if his Majesty be not pleased to Command that I
shall be in. This I submit to your Grace, but humbly desire even against my own
ease and quiet, that I may not be deprived of that experience which is
necessary for my place. I most humbly beseech your Grace to pardon this
boldness, and to know, that in my daily prayers for your Grace's happiness, I
shall ever rest

November. 18. 1624. Your Grace's most devoted and affectionate servant, Guil.
Menevensis.

The Bishop of Menevensis to the Duke: Dr. Laud.
My most Gracious Lord,
I Am heartily glad to hear your Lordship is so well returned, and so happily
as to meet so great joy. God has among many others his great blessings (and I
know your Grace so esteems them) sent you now this extraordinary one, a son to
inherit his fathers honors, and the rest of Gods blessings upon both. So soon
as I came to any end of my journey, I met the happy news of Gods blessing upon
your Grace, and it seasoned all the hard journey I have had out of Wales
through the Snow. When I had rested my self a little at my friend's house in
the Forest (Mr. Windebank a servant of your Grace's, whom I made bold to make
known to your Honor) I came to Windsor in hope to have been so happy, as to
meet your Grace at the great solemnity: but when I came, I found that which I
suspected, that your Grace's greater joy would carry you farther. Which
journey, and the cause, and the end of it, I heartily wish, and pray may be
full of joy, and all contentment to your Grace. I made bold to trouble your
Grace with a Letter or two out of Wales, which I hope Mr. VVindebank took the
best care he could to see delivered. I have no means to do your Grace any
service, but by my prayers, and they do daily attend, and shall ever, while I
breathe to utter them. I hope though I have missed this opportunity, yet I
shall be so happy as to see, and wait upon your Grace at London. In the mean
time, and ever, I leave your Grace, and all your home-blessings to the
protection of the Almighty, and shall ever be found

Windsor, 13. December. 1625. Your Graces most devoted and affectionate servant,
Guil. Meneven.

Doctor Mountague Bishop of Chichester to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
YOur Highness vouchsafed at Windsor to let me understand, that his Majesty
my gracious Master and Sovereign, had taken me off from that trouble and
vexation, which by some men's procurement, I was put unto in the House of
Commons. They as I understand, think not so, but intend to proceed against me
so far as they can, as having returned his Majesty no other answer, but that I
was freed from imprisonment. It is true, that besides 20 l. which the Scrieant
had of me by exaction for fees, they bound me unto him in a bond of 2000 l. to
appear before them, the first day of the next Sessions. I beseech your Grace,
that as you have been pleased to tie me unto your excellent not only self, but
also most honorable Sister in that bond of obligation, as never was poor
Scholar to such Worthies; so you would be pleased to let his Majesty
understand the case, that by your means I may be absolutely discharged, with
the redeliverie of my bond from them, whom I never offended, who (under
correction) have nothing to do with me; and as his Majesty's servant be left
unto himself, especially for that which was authorized by himself, and
commanded by his Father, my late Master of ever blessed memory. If his
Majesty will be pleased to call for their accusations against me, if I do not
really and thoroughly answer whatsoever is, or can be imputed to me out of my
books, I will no further desire favor and protection of his Majesty, and your
Gracious self, but be willingly left unto my enemies. I must crave pardon for
presuming thus to trouble your Grace, the rather because through a grievous
affliction of the Colic and Stone, I am not able personally to attend your
Grace, whom according unto my most bounden duty, I daily recommend unto the
Almighty, being more obliged unto your noble self, then ever to any one. So
remaining

Petwerth, 29. July. Most humbly at your Graces service ever, Ri. Mountague.
1. IF any or all the Papists living can prove, that the Roman Church, as it
now stands in opposition to the Church of England, is either the Catholic
Church of Christ, or a sound member of the Catholic Church,

I will subscribe.

2. If any or all the Papists living can prove unto me, that the Church of
England as it stands at this day, is not a true member of the Catholic
Church,

I will subscribe.

3. If any or all the Papists living can prove unto me, that any one point at
this day maintained by the Church of Rome against the Church of England, was
the received Doctrine of the Catholic Church, or concluded by any general
Council, or particular approved Council, or resolved of by any one Father of
Credit to be such, for 500. years at least after Christ,

I will subscribe

Ri. Mountague.



The Bishops of Rochester, Oxford, and St. David's, to the Duke, concerning Mr.
Mountague.
May it please your Grace,
WE are bold to be suitors to you in the behalf of the Church of England, and
a poor member of it Mr. Mountague, at this time not a little distressed. We are
not strangers to his person, but it is the Cause which we are bound to be
tender of.

The cause we conceive (under correction of better judgment) concerns the
Church of England merely; for that Church when it was reformed from the
superstitious opinions broached, or maintained by the Church of Rome, refused
the apparent and dangerous errors, and would not be too busy with every
particular School point. The cause why she held this moderation was, because
she could not be able to preserve any unity amongst Christians, if men were
forced to subscribe to curious particulars disputed in Schools.

Now may it please your Grace, the opinions which at this time trouble many men
in the late Book of Mr. Mountague, are some of them such, as are expressly, the
resolved doctrine of the Church of England, and those he is bound to maintain.
Some of them such as are fit only for Schools, and to be left at more liberty
for learned men to abound in their own sense, so they keep themselves
peaceable, and distract not the Church. And therefore to make any man subscribe
to School opinions, may justly seem hard in the Church of Christ, and was one
great fault of the Council of Trent. And to affright them from those opinions
in which they have (as they are bound) subscribed to the Church, as it is worse
in it self, so it may be the Mother of greater danger.

May it please your Grace farther to consider, that when the Clergy submited
themselves in the time of Henry the 8th. the submission was so, that if any
difference doctrinal, or other fell in the Church, the King and the Bishops
were to be Judges of it in a national Synod, or Convocation, The King first
giving leave under his broad Seal, to handle the points in difference.

But the Church never submitted to any other Judge, neither indeed can She,
though She would. And we humbly desire your Grace to consider, and then to
move his most Gracious Majesty (if you shall think fit) what dangerous
Consequences may follow upon it. For first, if any other Judge be allowed in
matter of Doctrine, we shall depart from the ordinance of Christ, and the
continual course and practice of the Church.

2. Secondly, if the Church, be once brought down beneath her self, we cannot
but fear what may be next Struck at.

3. Thirdly, it will some way touch the honor of his majesty's dear Father,
and our most dread Sovereign of Glorious, and ever blessed memory, King James,
who saw and approved all the opinions in this Book, and he in his rare wisdom
and judgment would never have allowed them, if they had Crossed with truth and
the Church of England.

4. Fourthly, we must be bold to say, that we cannot conceive what use there
can be of Civil Government in the common Wealth, or of preaching, and external
ministry in the Church, if such fatal opinions as some which are opposite,
and contrary to these delivered by Mr. Mountague are, shall be Publicly
taught and maintained.

5. Fifthly, we are certain, that all or most of the contrary opinions were
treated of at Lambeth, and ready to be published, but then Queen Elizabeth of
famous memory, upon notice given, how little they agreed with the Practice of
piety, and obedience to all Government, caused them to be suppressed, and so
they have continued ever since, till of late some of them have received
countenance at the Synod of Dort. Now this was a Synod of that nation, and can
be of no authority in any other National Church, till it be received there by
Public authority. And our hope is that the Church of England will be well
advised, and more then once over, before She admit a foreign Synod,
especially of such a Church as condemns her discipline and manner of
Government, to say no more.

And further we are bold to commend to your Graces wisdom this one particular.
His Majesty (as we have been informed) has already taken this business into
his own care, and most worthily referred it in a right course to
Church-consideration. And we well hoped, that without further trouble to the
state, or breach of unity in the Church it might so have been well, and orderly
composed, as we still pray it may, These things considered we have little to
say for Mr. Mountagues person: only thus much we know. He is a very good
Scholar and a right honest man. A man every way able to do God, his Majesty,
and the Church of England great service. We fear he may receive great
discouragement, and which is far worse, we have some cause to doubt this may
bred a great backwardness in able men to write in the defense of the Church of
England against either home, or foreign adversaries, if they shall see him
sink in fortunes reputation, or health upon his book occasion.

And this we most humbly submit to your Graces judgment, and care of the
Churches peace, and welfare. So recommending your Grace to the protection of
Almighty God,

We shall ever rest At your Graces service Jo. Roffens. Jo. Oxon. Guil Meneven.

2. August 1625.
Doctor Field Bishop of Landaffe to the Duke.
My Gracious Good Lord,
IN the great Library of men, that I have studied these many years, your Grace
is the best Book, and most Classick author that I have read, in whom I find so
much goodness, sweetness, and nobleness of nature, such an Heroic spirit,
for boundless bounty as I never did in any. I could instance in many, some of
whom you have made Deanes, some Bishops, some Lords, and Privy Councillors.
None that ever looked toward your Grace did ever go empty away I, need go no
farther then my self (a gum of the Earth) whom some 8. years ago you raised out
of the dust, for raising but a thought so high as to serve your Highness.
Since that, I have not played the Truant, but more diligently studied you then
ever before. And yet (Dunce that I am) I stand at a stay, and am a
Non-proficient, the book being the same that ever it was, as may appear by the
great proficiencie of others. This wonderfully poseth me, and sure there is
some guile, some wile in some of my fellow Students, who hide my book from me,
or some part of it. All the fault is not in mine own blockishnesse, that I
thrive no better. I once feared this before, that some did me ill offices. Your
Grace was pleased to protest no man had, and to assure me no man could. My
heart tells me, it has been always upright, and is still most faithful unto
you. I have examined my actions, my words, and my very thoughts, and found all
of them ever since most sound unto your Grace. Give me leave after so long
Patience (for which virtue you were once pleased to commend me to my old Master
King James, and I have not yet lost it) now that for these 12 Months almost, I
have been not only upon the Stage, but upon the rack of expectations, even
distracted between hope and fear, to comfort my self with recordation of your
Loving kindnesses of old, when on that great feast day of your being inaugured
our Chancellor, my look was your book, wherein you read sadness, to which I
was bold to answer, I trusted your Grace would give me no cause. You replied
with (loss of blood rather,) that was your noble expression. But God forbid so
precious an effusion. (I would empty all my veins rather then you should bleed
one drop) when as one blast of your breath is able to bring me to the haven
where I would be. My Lord I am grown an old man and am like old
Househouldstuffe, apt to be broke upon often removing. I desire it therefore
but once for all, be it Eli, or Bathe and Wells, and I will spend the remainder
of my days in writing an History of your good deeds to me and others, whereby
I may vindicate you from the envy, and obloquy of this present wicked age
wherein we live, and whilst I live in praying for your Grace,

Whose I am totallie and finally, Theophilus Landaven.

The Bishop of Landaffe to the Duke.
My most honorable good Lord,
IT is meet before I beg a new, that I should first acknowledge those benefits,
and more specially give thanks for the last noble favor your Lordship did me
in standing up the last day of Parliament, and pleading my cause. Never was
poor man more bound to a gracious Lord for protecting his innocence: and it
came seasonable, like a shower of rain in the time of drouth. My very heart was
parched with grief till it came, and it had ere this been broken, had not your
Lordships speech then dropped comfort, in strength whereof it yet lives. For an
abortive thought, which never came into act, some 2. or 3. years ago conceived,
and that tending to a work of mercy, and charity, a deed of justice, and due
thankfulness, how far? how foulie have I been traduced? your Honor cannot
imagine how deeply I have been wounded in my good name, as if I had deserved
deprivation, degradation, yea to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. This can none
cure but God, or the King, Deus in monte, God has done his part in providing
an occasion. Besides London (which is too high for me to look after) and the
removes which may be thereby, Hereford the next Seat to mine, (whither my
Predecessors have often been removed) is said to be now void. Now good my Lord,
speak once more seasonably. It is a doubled, and redoubled, an infinitely
multiplied benefit, which is so given. Never had I more need of the Cordial his
Majesty gave me at my going into Wales, which was that I should not stay long
there. It would be a restorative too, not only of my Credit, so cruelly cracked
with the sharp teeth of the wide mouth of vulgar lying fame, but of my estate
also, always poor, but lately much more impoverished, and made crazie by
occasions of the Church, which drew me to London (a place of great expenses, as
the busy times were) to little purpose: And the Parliament overtaking me,
which have held me long, and longer yet are like to hold me here, even to the
undoing of my self, my wife and six children, from whom I have now lived 6. or
7. months. And what shall I carry home with me but disgrace and infamy? Yet
my good Lord, at least procure me of my Lord the King a Nunc dimittis, leave to
depart. I shall be further out of the reach of pursuing malice, there in the
Country, do his Majesty better service in gathering up his Subsidies,
praying, and teaching my children (whilst I read a Lecture to them, my self
was never yet able to get by heart) of parcimony, which must be to them instead
of a patrimony, to pray for his Majesty's long life, health, and happiness.
In which prayer shall your Lordship ever be duly remembered by

Your Lordships daily devote Beadsman, Theophilus Landavensis.

Dr. Corbet to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
TO consider my two great losses this week; one in respect of his Majesty to
whom I was to preach; the other in respect of my Patron, whom I was to visit.
If this be not the way to repair the latter of my losses, I fear I am in danger
to be utterly undone. To press too near a great man, is a means to be put by;
and to stand too far off, is the way to be forgotten: so Ecclesiasticus. In
which mediocrity could I hit it, would I live and die. My Lord, I would neither
press near, nor stand far off, choosing rather the name of an ill Courtier,
then a saucie Scholar,

From your Graces most humble servant, Rich. Corbet.

HEre is news, my noble Lord about us, that in the point of Allegiance now in
hand, all the Papists are exceeding Orthodox, the only Recusants are the
Puritanes.



The E. of Worcester, Arundel and Surrey, Montgomery to the King.
May it please your most excellent Majesty,
ACcording to the Orders and Constitutions made and established by your
Majesty, and all the Companions of the Order at the last general Chapter held
at White Hall the 21. of May last past, we are bold to inform your Majesty,
that we having diligently viewed diverse of the Records of the said Order, do in
the black book find, that the keeping of the little Park at Windsor, next
adjoining unto the Castle, is in direct words annexed for ever to the Office of
the Usher for the said Order. So humbly kissing your Royal hands, We rest

Your Majesty's most humble and faithful Subjects, and servants, E. Worcester,
Arundel and Surrey, Montgomery.
White Hall, 1. July, 1622.
The Lord Chancellor Bacon to the Duke.
My very good Lord,
MY Lord of Suffolk's cause is this day sentenced. My Lord, and his Lady fined
at 30000 l. with imprisonment in the Tower at their own charges. Bingley at
2000 l. and committed to the Fleet. Sir Edward Cook did his part, I have not
heard him do better, and began with a fine of an 100000 l. But the Judges
first, and most of the rest reduced it as before. I do not dislike that things
pass moderately, and all things considered it is not amiss, and might easily
have been worse. There was much speaking of interceding for the Kings mercy,
which (in my opinion) was not so proper for a sentence: I said in conclusion,
that mercy was to come ex mero motu, and so left it. I took some other occasion
pertinent to do the King honor, by showing how happy he was in all other parts
of his Government, save only in the manage of his treasure by these Officers.

I have sent the King a new Bill for Sussex: for my Lord of Nottingham's
Certificate was true, and I told the Judges of it before, but they neglected
it. I conceive the first man (which is newly set down) is the fittest. God ever
preserve and keep you, etc.

The Earl of Suffolk to his Majesty.
Gracious Sovereign,
IN this grievous time of my being barred from your presence, which to me is
the greatest affliction that can lie upon me; and knowing by my former service
to you, the sweet and Princely disposition that is in you naturally, together
with that unmatchable judgment which the world knows you have, is the
occasion, that I presume at this time to lay before your Majesty my most
humble suit; which is, that you would be pleased to look upon the Case of your
poor servant, who after so many faithful desires of mine to do you service, I
do not say that success has fallen out as I wished, should now not only have
suffered for my weakness, and errors, but must be further questioned to my
disgrace. I would to God your Majesty did truly understand the thoughts of my
heart, and if there you could find one the least of ill affections to you, I
wish it pulled out of my body.

Now to add to my miseries, give me leave to let your Majesty know the hard
estate I am in; for I do owe at this present (I dare avow upon my fidelity to
you) little less then 40000 l. which I well know will make me and mine poor
and miserable for ever.

All this I do not lay down to your Majesty's best judging eyes, that I mean
this by way of complaint; For I do acknowledge the reason that your Majesty
had to do what you did: neither do I go about to excuse errors to have escaped
me, but will now and ever acknowledge your Gracious favorable dealing with me,
if you will be pleased now to receive me again to your favor after this just
correction, without which I desire not to enjoy fortune of Goods, or life in
this world, which in the humblest manner that I can I beg at your Princely
feet, as

Your, etc. T. Suffolk.

The E. of Suffolk to the Duke.
My Honorable good Lord,
AT the first minute of mine, and my wives delivery out of the Tower, I had
returned such acknowledgment due for so great a favor, but that Sir George
Goring only desired to be the Messenger, as well as he was of the other, Let
not (my Lord) my late misfortunes make me or mine more unable to serve, and
thank you, then any he, that thus takes advantage thereby to wrong me in your
belief: for what I have both received in abatement of my fine, and speedy
liberty, I must confess to come from your Noble mediation to his Majesty,
whose displeasure has been more grievous to my soul, then all the rest this
world can inflict upon me.

As your Lordships kindness has begun to ease me, so now let the same hand
cure, and preserve me from a worse relapse wherein I am like to fall, if your
power prevent it not. The motion of his Majesty's for my persuading my sons out
of their places, was the grievousest sound that ever entered me, for thereby I
still breathed under the heavy weight of all my afflictions, not despairing but
their Care (charged upon them with my blessing) might somewhat redeem my
errors, and assure his Majesty, that my will was never tainted with offending
him.

I know my Lord, there is little benefit in serving against Masters minds, but
they are unworthy servants that will leave such Masters upon any conditions.
Such as make suit to chop or change for their own advantage, are better lost
then kept: But as for mine, my curse should follow them, if ever I could think,
they followed his Majesty with such indifferency. My obedience to his
Majesty was ever of more force with me, then mine own ends any way laid, nor
ever joyed I more then in running to his Commands. But this (my Lord) rends my
heart to think, that, unfortunate I, should bury my sons alive, and pronounce
that sentence, which would make me and them Scorns to posterity. Whilst I
have knee to bend, eye to lift up, or tongue to beg, I must implore his
Majesty's pardon, and mercy in this kind. As for that more drossie part of my
estate, it still lies at his Majesty's feet, and if he now please to recall,
what he remitted, without further condition, I must obey, and let his Majesty
see, no change of time or place can change me, my love, my duty, or my zeal to
him.

My Lord, here you may read me in my greatest griefs that ever did fall to me:
weigh them well, and think that one day you may be a father, and be as nearly
touched, as now I am. The favor you shall do me herein shall prove no hidden
talent, for the increase shall not only be the happiness of a good work well
done, but the hearty acknowledgment of a whole family, and all theirs, that
shall as faithfully serve and honor you, as the best of those, that would
succeed them, which I hope your Lordship will believe from me, who will ever be

Yours, etc. T. Suffolk.

The Earl of Suffolk to his Majesty.
Most Gracious Sovereign,
Your Princely favor in dilivering me, and my wife out of the tower, must, and
shall ever be acknowledged of us with all humble thanks. And now be pleased to
give me leave to be an humble surtor to your Majesty, that out of the tender
compassion of your Princely heart, you will be pleased to cast your eye upon
the miserable estate of your distressed, afflicted, and old Servant, now
brought into fear of never recovering of your Majesty's favor, and so wretced
my case is, as the little hope, that remained in me to live in your memory,
was by my two sons service to your Gracious self, and the Prince. It is now
required of me to impose upon them the resignation of their places, which with
all humility I beseech you to give me leave to say, I would sooner use my power
over them to will them to bury themselves quick, then by any other way then
enforcement to give up their places of service, which only remains to me to
be either my dying comfort, or my living torment.

Besides, they are now past my government, being both married, and have
children, only I have a Paternal Care of them, which I humbly beseech your
best judging Majesty to weigh respectively, how unhappie I must of necessity
think my self, if I should be the perswader of that misfortune to my children,
that their children within a few years would curse me for, either living, or
dead. Upon all these just considerations (most Gracious Master) give me leave
to turn my cruel, and. unnatural part of persuading them to yield to that, for
which I should detest my self, to my humblest desire upon the Knees of my heart
to beg humbly of your Majesty, that whatsoever favor you have ever had to me
for any service done, that your Majesty will be pleased to spare the ruin of
these two young men, whom I find so honestly disposed in their desire of
spending their fortunes, and lives in your Majesty's, and your Princely son's
service, as if your displeasure be not fully satisfied with what I have
suffered already, that you lay more upon me, and spare them. I have written to
my Lord of Buckingham to be my mediator to your Majesty in this behalf, which
I assure my self he will nobly perform, as well as he has formerly done, in
being my means to your Majesty in obtaining this great begun favor. To
conclude with my prayer to God, that your Majesty may ever find the same zeal,
and Love to your person in whomsoever you shall employ, that my hearts
Sole-affection did, and ever shall carry unto you, which God knows was, and
is more to your Majesty then to my wife, and children, and all other worldy
things which God measure unto me according to the truth, as

Yours, etc. T. Suffolk

The Lady Elizabeth Howard to the King.
When I waited upon you at Theobalds to beseech your Majesty that my Lord of
Suffolk might not come into the Star Chamber, you protested that you loved the
man, but that you must show cause to the world why you took the Staff from
him, but for his fortune, that your Majesty would not meddle with it; the same
my Lord of Buckingham told me, with this assurance of your promise I went away
secure in that point. Sithence his cause was heard, he moved all that heard it
with much compassion to him, and the people did think, that when you sent him
to the Tower, you would have sent for him to have kissed your hand. But your
Majesty is abused, for they do not let you know, what is thought of the
proceeding against this good man, knowing how truly he loves you, with the
truth of his cause, that you would not follow him, and his children with
cruelty. Which might have been better spent.
My Lord has spent in running a Tylt, in Masks, and following the Court
above 20000. And Sir shall his reward now be to be turned out of his place
without any offense committed. Sir I am the child of your old Servant, and am
now great with child, I know it will kill me, and I shall willingly die rather
then desire life to see my unfortunate self, and mine thus miserably undone.
Sir I beseech your Majesty remember my Father that is dead, and me his
distressed child; for if he could know any worldly thing, he would wonder to
see me, and those that shall come of me, thus strangly used. But my hope is
still in your Majesty's goodness, and that you will not be carried away with
the malice of other men. In this confidence I rest with my daily prayers for
your health and happiness, as

Yours etc. E. H.

The Lady Elizabeth Norris to the Duke.
My Lord,
EVer since your Lordships first recommendation of my husband to me, I have
thought my self much engaged to your Lordship; for I must confess after he had
taken his leave of me, I did love him never the less: for immediately after my
fathers death (when in my Conscience he least expected to hear from me) I did
both send and write to him, which he might interpret an encouragement, or
rather an invitation. I did it the rather, because I did not believe those
which did him ill offices; for those which were most for him, on a sudden were
most against him. I must confess, that pity did confirm my affection, and I
trust your Lordship will commiserate his estate, as you do the fall of all
mankind, for I was the Eva, and he was the Adam: and I pray God the King and
your Lordship may forgive us, as I am confident God will pardon us. Your
Lordship may imagine my Mother was of the plot, but I take God to witness,
that she was not only against it, but contrarily. I did believe she was wholly
for your Brother: And for your Brother, my Mother recommended him to me, whom I
used like a Gentleman of high worth and quality. But I did by no means abuse
him by promise, or taking gifts, which I falsely suffer for, in the opinion of
the world. I only took a ring by my mothers appointment, which came as a token
from my Lady your mother, which was of very small value. My husband and I am
resolved rather to suffer in the opinion of the world, then contradict any
thing which shall be aggravated against us. We must both honor you, and think
our selves much engaged to your Lordship. After God, I protest you are the
only author of it: for by your means, I first settled my affection. I know
there are those which do my husband and me ill offices. I have reason to be
jealous of the Lord Montgomery, for he would have put tricks upon me in making
me deny the Contract; and when he failed in that, he went about to make me
believe Mr. Wray had denied his. And to tell your Lordship true, his violence
and over-earnestnesse made me the more averse. If my husband had not fetched
me, I would have come to him, and so I sent him word.

Thus humbly beseeching your Lordship as you are happy in your wife, that you
would be pleased to make our peace with the King; and seeing it is Gods act,
that you would honor us with your favor. We shall be both bound to join in
prayer, that you may be ever happy in your Wife, and in your Childrens
Children. And so with my humble respect to your Lordship, I rest

Your Lordships humble servant, Elizabeth Norris.

Sir Edward Cecyl to the Duke.
My very good Lord,
HOw much my affection and ambition has been to serve your Lordship before
other men, I hope I shall not need now to express, considering it has been
clear and manifest to your own trial, whereof I do bear still the testimony,
and the continuance in mine own heart. But in your nobleness it will not
appear impertinent to your Lordship, that I put you in mind, how much I
suffered in the disgrace my enemies cast upon me about the employment for the
Palatinate, when I was under your protection; whether I suffered for mine own
sake, or for your Lordship, I know not: howsoever of this I am assured, the
greatest cause I gave them, that had least reason, was because I sought not
them, but your Lordship only. And for the success, you may see by the miracles
the employment has brought forth, that it was carried another way, rather for
private malice, then for any great zeal to the advancement of the public
Cause.

Now my Lord, for your own honor, and for the upholding of your servant, make
me so happy, if there be any employment for men of my profession (as there is
opinion) that I may be the man by your Lordships means, wherein you shall make
me your obliged, as I am now your affectionate servant. For which you shall be
assured of as thankful heart, as any breathes in the whole world. In the
enjoying of which kind of service, though you are accounted the most happy
among great men, yet you cannot have too much of it. I could remember your
Lordship of his Majesty's gracious promise for my employment before any other
in the presence of the Prince and your Lordship, and that I am the first
General his Majesty ever made, and that I had no ill success in the
perfecting of that service; yet for all this, I will only trust in your
Nobleness, if you resolve to make me your Creature.

And if it shall please his Majesty to hold me worthy of this honor, I will
undertake to save his Coffers (as I have heretofore done) the sixth part of the
employments charge and cost, that any other man shall require, who makes not a
computation for the managing of it, by a sufficient expense of his own.

I will not write more at this time, but to wish your Lordship as much
happiness as your heart can desire, and that you will give me an occasion to
show how much I am, and will be

Your Lordships most faithful and affectionate servant. Ed. Cecil.
From our Army this 20. of November.
Sir Edward Cecil to the Duke.
May it please your Excellency,
THis Gentleman Sir George Blundel has now clearly quitted the service of the
States, for this especial reason (as he assures me) to be the more absolutely
employed in your Excellencies service. This I know, his friends here that love
him (which are many) are very sorry to part with him, for there is no
melancholy where he goes. And therefore considering the condition of this
place, we shall be great losers, being upon a melancholy place, and service,
ill paid, sick of all diseases in the world, in a place that is next neighbor
to hell, if the book printed say true, which says, that the Low-Countriemen
are next neighbors to the devil. And I am sure, we are now seated lower then
any part of these Countries; for the waters are above us, and about us, and we
live in more fear of them, then of the enemy; for we may be drowned at an hours
warning, if we do not continually work against it, and yet, and it shall please
your Excellency, this is the Seat for a Winter War. Many more inconveniences
we are daily sensible of, of which I have endured so much, as I dare say
without vanity, that few of my rank and fortune have suffered more, or longer
then I have done in these Countries; having served these 27. years together
without intermission; and all this for no other end (for I am 900 l. a year the
worse for the Wars) then to make me able to serve my Prince and Country when
occasion should be offered.

But since the time is come, that opinion does so govern, as strangers get the
Command, and new Soldiers employed, which was never heard of before amongst
men of our occupation, It is high time for me to retire, and wish I had been of
any other profession then this. For if long service can get no honor, nor
reward, nor employment, but the contrary; it would touch a man's discretion to
be more and more unfortunate: All my comfort is, that I shall have the honor
and good fortune in my retreat, to draw nearer to your Excellencies service, if
not in my profession, (which I desire above all) yet in something whereof your
Excellency may make use of me. For I am ambitious of nothing more, then to
prove my self by action, and not by recommendation,

Your Excellencies most faithful devoted, and humble servant, Ed. Cecyl.
From our Army at Wallike the 4th of December.
Sir Edward Cecil to Mr. Secretary Conway.
My very good Lord,
IT has pleased your Lordship to write me three Letters lately: the one a
particular list of officers, that should be sent from hence; the second for Mr.
Hopton, the third an acknowledgement only of the receipt of my Letter to your
Lordship. The first I have put in execution, and have written to your son, Sir
Edward Conway to give them all notice of your Lordships Care of them. And to
let them know how welcome any one shall be to me, that you think fit to be
employed. For one of them called Ensign Rainesford, I had set him down, because
I received your Lordships direction from himself. For Mr. Hopton I have written
unto him according to your desire, with your Letter enclosed; concerning the
last, I give your Lordship many humble thanks for having expressed the
acceptance by your answer. Touching your business here: the State has been as
contrary to us, as the wind. For though they see a great action likely to be
performed to their own good, with little cost to themselves; yet they desire to
be so wise, as to make benefit, both ways, and not to balk any advantage:
which makes them stand so stiff upon the denying of us Officers, and Soulders
by election, and will yield to send none but whole companies, only to abate so
much upon the repartitions. But Sir William St. Leiger and I, have utterly
refused their offer as a proposition against his Majesty's service: for by this
ignorant winter war our Companies are grown half new men, having lost most of
our old, and of those new men the half are sick besides: So that his Majesty
should be beholden to them, rather for names, then men: And again for the
Officers, and Soulders, it is like they should be most of them the worst in the
regiment, from whence they are to come. Whereas if we might have had those
Officers we made choice of, which were but ten Captains, and other inferior
Officers to the number of thirty, they might have been fit for employment upon
a double enemy. And I could wish, that whenever his Majesty shall be once
furnished with Good Officers, it would please him to make account of them, as
these men do, who have had long experience, and known their Value.

It pleased my Lord the Duke to write to me a Letter, and to let me know he had
chosen me his Officer, to attend, and obey him this journey: an honor too great
for me, because I did never expect it, but nothing shall excuse my faults,
saving my life. And among many other directions he commanded me to provide for
the Army such necessary things as cannot be had in England. Whereof I have
thought of many, which I fear, I shall not have the time to get. In my care
belonging to these provisions, I have considered the use of our small pieces of
Ordinance here, which they call Drakes, that shoot 70. Musket bullets. They
will be of great use in this service, both in regard of the quick landing, and
of the passing of such mountainous places, as perhaps we may meet withal, and
likewise in respect of the little hope we have to get any good musketeers, or
at least any great store of them. But they are in such favor here, as we can
obtain none from hence, and so are forced by a general consent to buy ten of
them here, that were provided for the King of France. And the reputation they
carry is such, as they are ready money every where. They cost not much more
then 400. sterling, and I hope they will prove the profitablest pieces that
were ever used in the quarrel of his Majesty's Friends. We have likewise
considered of what service a company of Firelocks would be to the action, but
the time is so short, we cannot raise them. Howsoever we are promised of the
States to have leave for a company of Harquebussiers, which are of such use
upon all occasions, that we cannot miss them. And we have chose a brave and
worthy Gentleman his Majesty's Servant and Subject who is willing to leave any
service for this, being the service of the King. If they should have been
raised in England, his Majesty must have paid for the horses, arms, saddles,
and pistols, and yet not find any able to have served in that kind.

The wind (as yet) holds contrary, which has made me send this by Sir Henry
Vane, who goes a way, that I dare not pass. But (I hope) if the wind serve,
not to be many days behind him to receive your Lordships command, more
particularly which I will obey as

Your Lordships most humble Servant, Ed: Ceoyl.
Hagh 2. June. 1625. Postscript.
MY Lord, now in this time of necessity for the getting of good Musketeers,
there are many hundred to be found in England that have served in this Land,
which by proclamation and promise of money in hand, or more pay, will easily
discover themselves, whom some of the new men (to be released) will be glad to
satisfy, without charge to his Majesty.



Sir Edward Cecyl to the Duke.
My most excellent Lord,
THere are some Letters of mine, that had come to your Lorships hands, a good
many days since, had not the wind been contrary and withstood their passage.
The substance whereof was only to show you how thankful I hold my self to your
excellency for so great and infinite a favor as it has pleased your
excellency to think me worthy of. But as is it a favor that will set me on
work all the days of my life: so is it greater then I can ever deserve.
Howsoever my resolution is to do my best. And I humbly beseech your Excellency
to believe, that with my diligence, and the best understanding I have, I will
seek nothing but to please you, and to honor you; and if God say Amen to make
the world speak of your design as much (I hope) as ever our Nation has given
cause. And for the faults of my self, and those I shall bring with me, they
shall not be excused, but with our lives, and bloods: for I hope I shall bring
none, but such as know what to do, and when they come to it will bite fooner
then bark. I do promise my self your Excellency will have no cause to doubt or
repent you of your favors, for I know what men have done, and what they can do
in my occupation. But God is God, and men are but men.

All my discouragement is, that the States answer not his Majesty's expectation
being fearful (especially since the loss of Breda) to part with any of their
old Officers, or old Soldiers; but my hope is now better, for we have put them
to another resolution, by answering all their objections. By this disposition
of the States to the keeping all their old Soldiers, I wish your Excellency
will be pleased to be as careful in your choice, as you are desirous of great
designs. For otherwise the honor, and the charge will both be cast away, as
your Excellency may perceive in some of our latter expeditions, seeing that
although there are many called Soldiers in the world, yet but a few there be,
that are so: for so long a man must live in the profession to enable him
sufficiently, that many grow unable to perform, what they know, before they
have attained to the knowledge of what to perform. The knowledge of war being
the highest of humane things that God suffers man's understanding to reach
unto.

I have according to your Excellencies command made as many provisions as I can
for the shortness of the time, of such things as cannot be gotten in England.
And I could have wished I had known of this employment but some months sooner;
for then I could have saved his Majesty somewhat, and have added many things
that would very much have advanced the service. For in our profession the
preparing of things belonging to the war, does more show a man's experience and
judgment, then any thing else, by reason the first errors are the begetting of
many more, that afterward cannot be avoided. Your Exellencie may be pleased to
inform your self of all the exployts, and undertakings of our nation, that none
of them has suffered (for the most part) more then through the negligence of
provisions, as in victual, munition, boats for Landing, and for the receiving
of sick men, to keep the rest from infection. In this point of provision, it is
not good to trust upon a particular man, for gain is a corrupter where the care
is not public. And in so great an expedition, one must do with living men, as
they do with the dead, there must be overseers and executors to have a true
intent well performed.

I have presumed to write thus much, to show my thankfulness to your
Excellency, and my great affection to his Majesty's service, whereof I am
infinitely possessed. I hear your Excellency is in France, but my prayers to
God are to send you safe, and happy home, for the World holds you the soul of
advancing his Majesty's affairs, wherein his Honor is engaged as it is,
especially in this action, being the first, and a Great One.

And as for my self, who am now a creature you have made, I know not what I
shall do when I come to England, being your Excellencies shadow only.

I have here attended the wind, and since I cannot force it, I am glad of the
opportunity to send the Letters by Sir Henry Vane, who goes over Land, a
Passage I am not capable of, having been so long their enemy. But I hope God
will send me soon after, leaving Sir William St. Leiger here for the dispatch
of that which remains. I have written more particularly to my Lord Conway which
I dare not set down here for fear of being tedious, and knowing his Lordship
will give your Excellency an account of it. And so in all humbleness and
duty, I pray God send your Excellency honor, and length of life for his
Majesty's affairs, and for the happiness of

Your Lordships most humble, faithful and obedient servant, Ed. Cecill.
Hagh the 3d. of June, 1625.
Sir Edward Cecil to the Duke.
My most Excellent Lord,
THe occasion of my boldness in presenting your Excellency with these lines,
is for that, contrary to my expectation, I hear that there is a Commission a
drawing to make Sir Horace Vere a Baron of England. It is strange to me at this
time to hear it, for that I know not what worth there is more in him, then in
those, that are equal in profession, and before him in birth. If your
Excellency have made choice of me to be your second in this journey of so much
charge, and expectation, and to make me less then I was, what courage shall I
have to do you service? or what honor will redound to your Excellency? But
although I write it, yet I cannot believe it, for that I know you of that
judgment and nobleness, that you will rather add to your faithful servants,
although they beg it not, then to disgrace them, and make them less. Therefore
I will continue my belief, and rest

Your Excellencies most humble, and devoted servant, Ed. Cecill.
19. of July, 1625.
My Lord Wimbledon to the Duke.
My Gracious Lord,
IT has not a little troubled your faithful servant at my last being with your
Excellency in White Hall Garden, to understand (after I had attended so long)
that I had ill offices done me to his Majesty, and yet the World is of
opinion, that I have your Excellencies favor. I presently went home, and ever
since I have mused and considered, and can find no reason or policy for my
being kept from his Majesty's presence, which makes me and my near friends
astonished. For hitherto I have received no favor, but rather the most
strictest proceeding, that ever was used (and without example) to any man, that
had such a charge.

And whereas there is no Commission of any force, or validity, without the
assistance of the State, and Prince he serves, for he that Commands is but
one man, and the rest are many thousands, which are great odds, yet I have
been publicly heard before the whole body of the Council (my adversaries
standing by) so curiously, as no inquisition could have done more.

For first, I was examined upon mine instructions, then upon my acts of
Council, then upon my journal, then upon a journal compounded of by ten sundry
persons, which were under my Command both Landmen and Seamen, which was never
heard of before, and I did not only answer in particular to all points that
were demanded, but by writing which is extant: yet cannot I get any judgment or
report made to his Majesty, but rather time is given to my enemies (as I hear)
to make an ill report of me and my actions to the King. But when I was to be
accused, there was no time delayed nordeferred, and such men as I have proved
guilty, and failed in the principal point of the service, to have fired and
destroyed the Shipping, are neither examined, or any thing said against them,
which is strange, especially Sir Michael Geere. So that I know not how my Lord
of Essex can take any thing ill from your Excellency, unless it be to have
you do injustice, or against all reason. He may rather give your Excellency
many thanks, that his Lordship is not called into question for letting pass
the King of Spain's ships, that offered him fight, which would have been the
chief service, having instructions not to let any fly, or break out, without
fighting with them.

Now (my Lord) I humbly beseech your Excellency to consider my Case, that has
been so severely examined, and no body else, and that after my Examination, I
have lingered so long in my wrongs and disgraces, and by the ill offices your
Grace does see are done me to his Majesty, which will rather increase then
diminish, so long as I shall be kept from the presence of his Majesty, that is
I know of himself the justest Prince in the world, and yet to be in your
Excellencies favor.

And I hold my self clear of all imputations in despite of all malice and
practice, that has been against me, to obscure all my endeavors which my
adversaries in their consciences can best witness, that when they slept I
waked; when they made good cheer, I fasted; and when they rested, I toyled. And
besides, when they went about to hinder the journey at Plymouth, by railing on
the beggerlinesse of it, and discrediting of it, I was content to take it upon
me, though against my judgment, as I did secretly deliver both to his Majesty
and your Grace, before I departed from the Coast: Nominating in my Letter to
his Majesty all the inconveniences that did after happen unto the Fleet: for
had it not been in my obedience to his Majesty, and my good affection to your
Excellency, (that I did see so much affect it, and was so far engaged) I would
have been rather torn in pieces, then to have gone with so many ignorant and
malicious people, that did show so little affection or courage to his Majesty's
service, or any affection at all to your Excellency. Yet for all this, all
has been laid upon me, having had rather hard courses taken against me, then
any way maintained in my Commission which was given me, which no State, that I
have ever heard of, did before. I pray God his Majesty's future service do not
suffer for it; for where his Majesty's Officers are not obeyed, he can never be
served.

Wherefore my suit is, that if I have any ill offices done me to his Majesty,
that I may clear my self before him by your favor, which I have so long
attended after; or by way of Petition, which the meanest Subject is not to be
hindered in; for as I continue now, I have not only wrong done to me, but I
suffer as much punishment (without any fault) as if I had been condemned.

And that your Excellency will do me the favor to deal plainly with me, to
let me know, why I am deferred from his Majesty's presence, which is not denied
to any, having received so much wrong.

If my suffering be to add any service to your affairs in these troublesome
times, let but this honest friend of mine know so much, and I will suffer any
inconvenience, as I have, misery, danger, and decay of my fortunes for your
Excellencies sake. And so I rest

Your Excellencies most devoted, and faithful and thankful servant and
Creature, Wimbledon.
28th. Apr. 1626.
My Lord Wimbledon to the Duke.
My Gracious Lord,
I Understand that it pleased the Lords to grant the Colonels leave to accuse
me anew, and they have taken to them the most discontented Seamen they could
get to help their malice forward. I had thought, that before my coming, they
should have had time and advantage sufficiently to have shown all their envy.
And I was persuaded, that they could not have desired more, then to have been
present when I should be examined, and my journal read. At the reading whereof
they took all the exceptions that might be, and I did answer them all in your
Excellencies presence, as I thought fully, whereupon they seemed to be so
content, as they had no more to say; neither did they at that time desire to
make a journal, or to say any more.

Then the Lords resolutions were only to hear the Seamen speak, upon whom all
the business did lie. If they may be suffered upon new Combinations, to bring
new slanders upon me, I cannot tell what to think of it. But this I can say,
that if this course be taken, his Majesty will never be without a mutinous
Army. (which all States in policy do shun) For when the Common Soldiers shall
see their Chiefs give them such examples, they will soon follow, being that all
Armies are subject to it, especially a new Army. I had thought that one Trial
had been sufficient, being it was before such an Assembly. But if I should be
accused, I should desire to have new accusers, and not the same that have
already accused me, (for so there would be no end) and that upon their
Petition, I might have been heard what I could justly say, why they should not
have leave to make a journal, and not to give them leave before I were heard. I
am afraid there was never any such president before, and what inconveniences
may come of it time will show.

I have sought to none of the Lords as I fear my enemies have done, (I know not
whether I shall suffer for it or no) but my trust has only been in your
Excellency and the justness of my Cause. I have been your Excellencies
Officer in as difficult and as miserable an action as ever any one has
undertaken, and with as little assistance as ever any one had. For many of
those that should have assisted me, were more careful in betraying me, then in
forwarding his Majesty's service. And if this course be held to encourage them,
there is no man shall suffer more then his Majesty's service will. For it will
be folly for any man to look to his Majesty's service, or to take any pains to
prevent, or hinder that which may be committed against it; But to let every man
do what he will, so all will be pleased, and he that Commands shall have no man
to slander him, which is the way to live in quiet.

Thus much I thought was fit for me to let your Excellency understand, and
withal, that I held it a great unhappiness for me (that have taken such toil
and pains, and suffered so many slanders) to be kept back by my enemies from
that honor, that never any one of my rank and place was hindered in, which is
from kissing the hand of my Sovereign Lord the King All Power is in your
Lordships hands; whether you will uphold me in my just cause, or no, or let me
be ruinated for want of it. So that I can say no more, but that if I suffer, I
shall be your Excellencies Martyr, if not, I shall all my life rest

Your Excellencies most humble, and most thankful servant and Creature,
Wimbledon.

Sir John Ogle to the Duke.
Right Excellent and most Gracious Lord,
ANd because you are so, why should not I put my soul in your hand? that I have
not done it sooner was not through want of will in me, but it has been the
will of God, that mine acknowledgment should be the fuller, your goodness the
greater. Your Grace cannot be ignorant of the many motions I have had thereto,
but my judgment has been made irresolute by several distractions. I lay now my
self, and the fortunes of me and mine at your Graces feet. Take me up then
(noblest Lord) as becomes the fame which you have, and the confidence which I
have of you with a hand of goodness. If I had wilfully sinned against you
(when I was wickedly ensnared and beguiled by that wretch at Vtrecht, to whom I
gave some Extract out of your Letters, as also out of the Lord Ambassadors,)
or did yet with obstinacy maintain such indiscreet proceeding, your Grace
might in justice reject me as unworthy.

But since you have long discerned in me a propension to crave your pardon,
though still unhappily diverted till this time; I trust your true Nobleness,
generousnesse and goodness to be such, as you will not only not turn this
hearty submission to any disadvantage on my part; but looking upon mine
ingenuitie, with a right eye of gracious inclination, both pardon my fault, and
folly toward your self, and also (to bind my prayers to be offered in the
greater zeal for you, for I shall not be able to do you better service then in
prayer) be a strong mediator to his gracious Majesty, that my errors of
weakness, and want of discretion, committed then toward his late Majesty of
ever blessed memory, and his Ambassador, with what other oversights may have
been gathered up since, may be freely and fully forgiven and remitted, that so
my soul being discharged of all fear of displeasure against me, I may with a
cheerful heart and quiet conscience, go on in such a vocation as the Lord shall
have appointed for me. My Lord, this wound has long festered near my heart,
and though false skins have been drawn over it sometimes by unskilful hands,
yet have I ever judged it the surest ^^re to rip it up by Confession, and heal
it by Contrition. And sure I judge that it savours more of a right generous
spirit to confess a fault, then to conceal it, especially when the party
offending is free from malice, and the party offended of a nature so noble and
full of goodness, as nothing can be wished to be added unto it, and which is
yet more; and this have you graciously done to me, (my Lord) signed himself
with his own hand a true and faithful friend unto him, the more to invite him
to trust him. And trust you I do my Lord, and in you (next my Gracious
Sovereign) as much as may be in any arm of flesh. The God of Heaven (I hope)
will speak peace to my soul, if the King, and your Grace will send peace to my
heart. I trust you will, and will pray to God you may, that I may in all
cheerfulness and thankfulness ever remain

Your Grace's most humble, and faithful, and obliged servant Jo. Ogle.
Exester 3. June, 1625. Postscript.
I Beseech your Grace to send some other man to take this Charge which I too
weakly for fear of offending by denial have thus far undergone, but upon hope
of being withdrawn. Yet still submit my self to your Graces good pleasure.



Sir Robert Mansel to the Duke.
Right Honorable and my singular good Lord,
HAving used all the possible speed I could to repair to Algier, where I should
have been by the 15. of March last, I held it my duty humbly to present unto
your Lordship the particular account of my proceedings.

Before my arrival I furnished the two Prizes, three Brigandines, and a fourth
Boat with Eirelocks, and combustible materials for the burning of the Pirates
ships within the Moal, and had trained my men in the execution of their several
duties, and likewise appointed a squadron of boats with small shot to rescue
the vessels of execution in their advancement and retreat.

The first night of my arrival being the 21. of May last, the vessels of
execution were all advanced, but by reason of contrary winds they were
commanded to retire.

The second and third nights they were also in a readiness, but were withheld
with calmes.

The fourth night it pleased God to bless us with a fair Gale, and they being
advanced again, and the two ships with the fireworks, having almost recovered
the mouth of the Moal (the wind to our great grief) turned to the opposite
point of the Compass.

The boats performed their directions in towing of the ships, but considering,
that by the continuance of the course, they should expose their principallest
men to hazard, by reason of the great store of Ordnance and small shot, which
plied upon them, they debated amongst themselves what to do, Capt. Hughes (who
commanded one of the Brigandines) replied, Go on, and give the attempt with the
boats, which they cheerfully pursued, crying out without cessation, King James,
King James, God bless King James, and fearlesse of danger (even in the mouth
of the Canon, and small shot, which showred like hail upon them) they fired
the ships in many places, and maintained the same to the great comfort of us,
that were spectatours, so long as they had any powder left in their bandileers,
striving in the end who should have the honor to come off last, the which at
length, as a due to his former resolution and courage, they left to captain
Hughes, and so retired, all the ships continuing still their cheerful cry,
King James, with the loss of 20. that were slain, and hurt, and leaving the
fire flaming up in 7. several places, which continued in some of them long
after their retreat, and being aboard his Majesty's ships.

The cowardly Turks, who before durst not show themselves to so weak a force,
but from the walls or the tops of their houses, so soon as they perceived all
the boats retired, opened their ports, and Sallied out in 1000. and by the help
of so great multitudes, and a sudden shower of rain ^, seconded with a calm
which then happened, the fire was after extinguished, without doing any more
hurt then making two of their ships unserviceable.

During that Stay, there there came out of the Moal only one Frigot, which we
forced to run on shore.

Other service by us there performed, was the sinking of one of their best men
of war by Sir Thomas Wilford, and Captain Chidleigh, she was manned with a 130.
Turks and 12. Christians, whereof 12. only escaped, the rest were either slain
or drowned, which appeared both by the relation of diverse Christians which
nightly escaped aboard us, and by diverse of the dead bodies that floted upon
the water by our ships. We took likewise before their faces in the Bay a
Fly-boat, which the Pirates had formerly taken from the Christians and sold to
Ligorn. In her Merchandise to be exchanged for Pirates goods, and some money
amounting to 2000. and odd pounds, the exact account whereof I shall not fayl
to address to your Lordship as soon as the same is perfected by the council of
War.

The Turks hereupon presently manned out three Gallyes to reskue here, but
Captain Giles, and Captain Herbert, with the help of three Brigandines, which
I sent out to second them, soon fetched her up, and brought there unto me, and
the Galleys were put to flight by Sir Thomas Wilford, Captain Pennington, and
Captain Childlegh.

During the time of my abode there, after the attempt made by the boats, I
attended ten days for an opportunity to send in the ships with the fire
works, to finish the service begun by the boats; but in all that time there
happened not a breath of wind fit for their attempt, notwithstanding the ships
were always ready at the instant, that they should receive my directions to
advance. But at last understanding by the Christians (that escaped by swimming)
aboard me, how the Pirates had boomed up the Moales with Masts, and Rafts, set a
double guard upon their ships, planted more ordnance upon the Moale, and the
walls, and manned out twenty Boats to guard the Boome, and perceiving likewise,
that they had sent out their Galleys, and boats both to the Eastward and
Westward to give advce to all the ships upon the Coast, that they should not
come in during my abode there, and so finding no hope remaining, either by
stratagem to do service upon them in the Moale, or to meet with any more of
them, in the regard of the daily complaints brought unto me, both from some of
the Kings ships, and most of the Merchants of their want of victuals, I
resolved by the advice of the Council of war to set sail, whence I made my
repair to this place, where I met my Brother Roper with your Lordships
dirrections which I have received, and at the instant obeyed, by signifying his
Majesty's pleasure declared by your Lordships Letter unto the worthy
Commanders of those four ships whom his Majesty has pleased to call home.

But my Lord, in the duty I owe your Lordship, and my zeal to his Majesty's
honor and service, I humbly beg your Lordships pardon to advertize your
Lordship, that seeing we have now made this attempt upon the Pirates, and that
they perceive that our intent is to work their utter ruin and confusion, the
recalling of these his Majesty's Forces before the arrival of others in their
stead, and the bereaving us of so many worthy and experienced Commanders, I
fear may prove more prejudicial to the service, then upon one days
consideration I dare presume to set down in writing, by encouraging the Pirates
to put in execution such stratagems upon us, as to my knowledge they have
already taken into their consideration. My reasons for the same, I shall be
bold upon more mature deliberation to offer in all humbleness unto your
Lordships judicious view, either by the Commanders that are to return unto your
Lordship, or by a messenger which diverse of the Council of War advise to be
addressed over land on purpose with the same.

And so being ready (so soon as we have received in our water, and dispatched
diverse other businesses, which of necessity must be ordered in this place) to
set sail for Malega, there to receive in our remainder of Victuals, and to take
my leave of these 4. Ships, and such other of the Merchants as cannot be made
serviceable in these parts. With my endless prayers for your Lordships
increase of all honor, I cease your Lordships farther trouble for the present;
And rest

From aboard the Lion in Alegant Rode. 9th. June. 1621. Your Lordships most
humble, most faithful and sad servant, Robert Mansel.

Sir Robert Mansel to the Duke.
Right Honorable and my singular good Lord,
IT is not unknown unto your Lordship, that Sir Thomas Button before his coming
out, thought himself much wronged in that he did not hold the place of Vice
Admiral in this Fleet, whereof I must acknowledge him very worthy, and that for
my part I had engaged Sir Richard Hawkins, a very Grave, Religious, and
experienced Gentleman, before I was assured whether Sir Thomas Button would
leave his employment in Ireland, or no; and that afterward Sir Thomas Button
by your Lordships mediation, was contented to undertake the charge he now
holds, which God knows I labored for no other end, then for the security
and advancement of his Majesty's service, by reason of the experience I have
had of his sufficiency and ability.

Since that time, I have doubled that injury. A wrong was done unto him which
cannot be denied, he patiently appealed to me for justice, which I must
confess I denied him. But the name of the person that offered the wrong, and
the reasons why I denied him Justice, I must leave unto Sir Richard Hawkins and
Sir Henry Palmer to relate unto your Lordship, and if that will not give your
Lordship satisfaction, I must humbly submit my self to your Lordships Censure.

Notwithstanding the impression that these injuries took with him, yet thus
much I must truly confess in his behalf, That there was no man more zealous to
advance his Majesty's service nor more forward to undergo any danger or hazard
then himself, whereof he has given assured testimony to the World in these
three particulars.

First, in the service performed by him on a Christmasse day at night, whereof
I have formerly advertized your Lordship at large.

Secondly, Then in going over to Algier cheerfully, without complaining, when
his Ship was so grievously infected, that he had not able men in her to manage
her Sails.

Also in employing the most choice men in his Ship under the command of his
Nephew, for the firing of the Pirates ships within the Moale of Algier.

And lastly, in his joining with Sir Richard Hawkins in the towing off one of
the Prizes, when she was becalmed within musket shot of the Moale.

My Lord, I must protest unto your Lordship, that I had no ends of mine own for
the injuries done to Sir Thomas Button, and therefore your Lordship cannot cast
a greater honor upon your poor servant then in repairing him, which I humbly
beg of your Lordship.

If Sir Richard Hawkins do return unto me, then I shall be an humble suitor
unto your Lordship in the behalf of Sir Thomas Button that he may return to his
employment in Ireland, from whence in my earnest desires to enjoy his company
and assistance, I was the only means to withdraw him, and that he may receive
such allowance and entertainment as was formerly usually paid unto him, by
which means your Lordship will take away the Curses of his children, whose
bloods are near unto me, and oblige me with my continual prayers for your
Lordships increase of honor, ever to remain

From aboard the Vantguard the 10. of July. 1621. Your Lordships most humble
and faithful servant, Robert Mansell.

Captain John Pennington to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
MY last to your Lordship was of the 18. of this present from Stokes Bay, since
which time I have received two from your Grace, at Deep one by your Secretary
Mr. Nicholas, whereby your Grace commands me to deliver up his Majesty's Ship,
and the rest under my Command, to the hands of such Frenchmen as his Christian
Majesty shall appoint, according to his Majesty's pleasure signified by my
Lord Conway. And that I and the rest of the Masters take security of them for
our ships severally according to the true valuation. And to see this put in
execution, you sent your Secretary Mr. Nicholas. And the other by Mr. Ingham
in answer of mine written from Stokes Bay. The former part whereof being only a
command to put your former in practice, and the latter a denial of my humble
suit for my being called home from this Service. Which said part confirms
absolutely, that it was not your Graces pleasure that I should yield up the
ships into their hands, and disposesse my self and company of them: for I
trust your Grace had no such unjust thought as to continue me here alone after.

The French had possession of her to be their slave, as I am sure they would
have made me if they had their wills. To give your Grace an account of what I
have done since I came to Deep (which was the 21th. at this instant about nine
of the clock at night) would be too tedious for this time. The 22th. in the
morning Early I sent my boat ashoare with my Lieutenant to find out your
Graces Secretary, to receive my Letters, whereby I might know your Graces
pleasure, and to kiss my Lord Ambassadors hands from me, and to let him know
I was come with his Majesty's ship to do him service, but could not command the
rest to come along with me, their Masters not being there, and all their
companies in a mutiny. But his jelousie was such, that he would not suffer your
Graces Secretary to come aboard, or to send me your Letters, or that my
Lieutenant should speak to him, but in his presence, but presently sent a
Gentleman aboard to me, commanding me to come ashore to him, which I confess I
was very loath to do, in regard my people were much discontented, and ready
daily to mutiny, being all wondrous unwilling to go against Rochel, or those
of their religion. And besides, I never having been a shore, since I came into
my command, neither on our own Coast, or else where. (It being not my use) yet
notwithstanding these particulars knowing his Greatness, and your Graces
pleasure, for the giving him all due respect, I presently went to him, where he
taking me into a room apart with your Graces Secretary, he first delivered me
my Lord Conwaies Letter, or rather a warrant, (for so he terms it himself) for
the delivery of the ship into their hands (as they interpreted it) and then
your Graces Letter, commanding me to see his Majesty's pleasure (signified by
my Lord Conwaie) put in execution. And lastly a letter from the King of France,
thereby willing me to receive his Soldiers aboard that he had provided, and
his Cousin the D. de Mommorencie, and to go presently, and to join with his
Great Fleet against his rebellious subjects. This is the effect of that Letter.
Having read all these letters, he would presently have possession of the ship
that night, for that he could not stay longer. I told him, that I did not
understand it so, but that I was to render all service to his most Christian
Majesty; but nothing would serve him, save the present possession, which
because I would not yield unto, he grew into a strange fury, telling me, that
your Grace had sent your Secretary to see her delivered, and security to be
taken for her. My answer was, that I was ready to obey, according as I
understood the warrant, which was to do his Christian Majesty service, and to
receive a convenient number of Soldiers aboard me. But to dispossess my self
of my command, I had no such order: but still nothing would satsfie him but the
shipe, telling me, he would not entertain at the most (if they were willing)
above 60. or 80. of our people. My answer was, I had no order to discharge a
man of them, neither could I, but if they were discharged, what they should do,
or how they should get home, having neither meat, money, nor clothes, I know
not. To the first of these, he told me, that Mr. Nicholas had order by word of
mouth from your Grace to discharge us, which Mr. Nicholas confirmed, as also to
see the ship delivered, which he commanded me to do. But with your Graces
pardon I durst not do it upon words, it being a business of too high
consequence, neither if I had been willing, would my company ever have
condescended to it. To the second, for our passage, he promised to have
provided barques for us; but to conclude this, and not to insist upon the rest
of the particulars (they being too tedious) his rage and fury was such, that I
must of necessity give a little way thereto, or else I think he would have kept
me ashoare, so as I told him I was content if my company would yield thereunto,
and therefore desired to go aboard to speak with them, and to give order for
the drawing up of the inventorie. And upon this he suffered me to depart, but
not without promises of a large sum of money which should be given me at the
surrender, besides a royal pension during my life, he sending his Secretary,
and many others aboard with me to see all things put in execution, and your
Graces Secretary to persuade me to do it. But when I had them aboard, I told
them it was a thing not presently done, neither was my company willing to
deliver over the ship without a more ample warrant, yet I would do my best to
bring both to pass so soon as I could. So using them with the best respect I
could, and fair promises, that I would use all diligence for the accomplishing
of their desires; though I must confess I never meant it, till I should hear
further from your Grace, and have an especial Warrant from his Majesty, or
your Grace for it, it being a business of so high a nature. Upon these hopes
they departed, and went a shore, where they had not been long, till some of
them returned back with a strange allarum from his Lordship, that he would
presently have possession of her, or my resolution to the contrary. And althoug
I alleged that the inventory, and other business would not be dispatched in
two days, it would not suffice, except I would receive 400. Soldiers aboard
in the mean time till things were perfected.

Thus seeing I could not delay him till I heard farther from your Grace, I was
forced to give him this resolute answer, That upon this Warrant, I would not
deliver over the ship unto him, neither if I would, would the company give way
unto the same, we not holding it a sufficient discharge for us: But that we
were ready to receive a competent number of Soldiers aboard, with a chief
Commander, and to go upon such service, as his Christian Majesty should direct
us, according to the agreement with the King my Master; but nothing would
satisfy him but to have her delivered over to him, which if I did not
presently, my head should pay for it. I desired his patience for two or three
days, till I had written and sent to your Grace, and that he would let me have
a Shallop for that purpose; but he denied both the one and the other;
notwithstanding sent away a Barque himself with one to your Grace, but would
not suffer me to send thereby, which made me the more jealous of the real
intent of the business. The 23. he sent your Lordships Secretary aboard to
work and persuade me, but I could not give other answer, then I had done
formerly, only that I would attend until I heard farther from your Grace;
though I must confess I had much ado to persuade my Company, who were very
unwilling to it. But I had hope still to have a more ample Order how to proceed
in this great and weighty business. And upon the 24. at two of the clock in
the morning, Mr. Ingham (whom I sent from Stokes Bay to your Grace) returned
unto me with two Letters, one from your Grace, and another from my Lord Conway,
the former part of both commanding me to put your former Commands in execution:
but the latter part prohibiting me to depart with my charge, gave me the more
courage to stand upon my former terms.

This day your Graces Secretary came aboard me again, after I had sent your
Graces Letter to him, being sent by the Ambassador to prosecute the business,
for the deliverie of the ship unto them. But after I had showed him, that part
of your Graces Letter, he knew not what to say to it. I willed him to tell the
Ambassador, that this Letter was nothing but an answer of mine written from
Stoken Bay, concerning the not coming of the rest of the ships. I further
offered his Lordship this day for the more expedition of the business, to take
150 of his men aboard, and to run over for the Coast of England, and to send
presently to your Grace, that we were ready to surrender over there, upon an
authentic Warrant from his Majesty, or your Grace. His answer to this was,
That he would not put his men in to be prisoners, nor that we should be the
major part. I then offered him to take in as many French as I had English man
for man, but without arms, yet nothing would satisfy him, but the possession
of the Ship, either by delivering of her over into their hands, or by receiving
400 armed men aboard, wherewith they would quickly have taken her from us, as
you may plainly see their intent by their proceeding. Which I refusing to do,
this night about ten of the clock, he sent his Secretary aboard with three or
four others to make a protestation against me, as a Rebel to my King and
Country, as you may perceive by the Copy of it, which I send your Grace
herewith, and this he said was the last he would have to do with me, for that
on the morrow, he would away for Paris. Whereupon the next morning I sent this
Gentleman Mr. Ingham unto him to know, what farther service he would command
me, and whether he would have me attend his pleasure longer here, for that I
was ready to go upon any service they would command according to the former
agreement, and to receive as many men aboard as possibly I could; but he said
he had nothing to do except I would either deliver up the ship, or take in the
400. Soldiers. In the interim came his Secretary, with the same company he
had before, and made another protestation against me, in regard I would not
take in his 400. men, and therewithal brought me a Letter from your Graces
Secretary, (for he is so jealous that he will not suffer him to come aboard
but when he lists) which Letter was, That the Ambassador would stay till
Thursday next, if I would give it him under my hand to deliver up the ship
then, if I had not order to the contrary before, which I had as good have done
at the present; for I expect no Letters from your Grace, in regard they would
not suffer me to write to you, as I desired. And if your Grace should write to
me by his messenger, they would be sure not to deliver them, till the day were
past, except such as were for their turn.

In all which your Grace may see their intents, that there has been no slights
or ways left unassayed to bring their purpose to pass: first by fair words,
then by seeking to get me become the French Kings servant, with promises of a
great Pension, and brave employment, with offers of good sums to be laid down
upon the surrender of the ship as aforesaid. And when none of these courses
could prevail with me, then followed their threatenings of having my head, and
such like. All which (I thank God) I have withstood; for I had rather live all
my life with bread and water, then betray my King and Country of so precious a
Jewel as this; and had rather the King should take my life, then to have a hand
in the surrender, or valuing of such a Bulwark of the Kingdom.

Upon the making of the last Protest, and with the threats they gave us, my
Company grew into such a fury and tumult, that they got up their Anchors, and
set sail for England, without acquainting me with it, or order from me, saying,
They would rather be hanged at home, then surrender the Kings Ships, or be
slaves to the French, or fight against those of the Religion. But I must
confess, I heard what they were a doing, but let them alone, because I saw
they had reason; otherwise, I should rather have died amongst them, then to
have suffered it.

And thus I have related the principal passages unto your Grace, wherein, if I
have offended his Majesty, or your Grace, it has been for want of discretion,
and not of true zeal to do his Majesty, your Grace, and my Country service,
which if it be found to be an offense, I humbly crave pardon.

I am now come to an anchor in the Downs, where I shall attend your Grace's
farther pleasure, to be disposed of as his Majesty, and your Grace shall
please. But to return again to France, I can assure your Grace, that all the
people in the ship will rather be hanged then do it, they have been so well
used there. Thus praying for your Graces many happy and prosperous days, I
humbly rest

Your Graces most humble, and faithful servant, Jo. Pennington.
From aboard the Vanguard in the Downs, 27. July. 1625.
Captain Pennington to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
TO take into your Consideration these particulars following:

First, That there is no clause in the contract for our quiet enjoying, and
celebrating our Divine service to God morning and evening, according to the
ancient order of the Seas.

Secondly, That they may bring as many of their own Nation aboard as they will,
and they speak of putting in as many French as English, which will amount to
500. in all, which the ship is neither able to carry, neither will it be for
the health of those that go in her, or safety of the ship to his Majesty. All
which I desire may be considered of, and a course settled with the Ambassador
of the just number I shall receive aboard.

Thirdly, That we are bound to fight against any Nation, that they command us,
except our own; which you may likewise please to consider of.

Fourthly, That there is no Clause for the supply of the Victuals, and other
provisions before the six months be expired, so that they may keep us till
that time, and then turn us off naked and destitute of all provisions to be a
prey to our enemies.

Fifthly, That we may know where we shall receive our supplies of powder, and
other munition from them, for that the three last, which we have in here, with
the appurtenance, is not sufficient to maintain a fight of three hours.

The former five Articles I humbly desire your Grace judiciously to consider
of; and what your Grace will have me therein perform, may be inserted in my
instructions.

Now further I humbly desire your Grace;

First, That all we English may be of a squadron, and not separated upon any
occasion, the accidents of the Sea excepted, and that we may be ready at all
times to aid and assist one another.

Secondly, That I may have power in my instructions, or otherwise, for the
command of the rest of the English that go along with me, if not, every man may
take his course, and do what likes him best, which may prove prejudicial to
the service, dishonorable to the State, and dangerous for the safety of his
Majesty's ship.

Lastly, I humbly desire, that your Grace will be pleased to give order, that
there may be some provision of Clothes laid in for naked men, (whereof there
are many in the ship) as hose, shoes, and shirts (at least.) As also some
provision of store for sick men, of Oatmeal, Rice, Sugar, and fruit, and some
little stock of money, to relieve them if necessity require it. It may
afterward be deducted out of their wages, if your Grace will have it so.

Your Graces Loyal, and faithful servant ever to be commanded, Jo. Pennington.

Mr. Trumbal to the Secretary.
Right Honorable,
With my former dated the 11th. of this month, I sent your Honor two Letters
for his Majesty, and promised by my next to write unto your Honor at large,
about the matter they did contain.

In performance whereof, and for the discharge of my duty, I will now desire
permission hereby freely to deliver my mind, for so much as is yet come to my
knowledge, and I judge meet to be committed to paper concerning the same. And
seeing this Packet is to be sent by an express Messenger, and a Mr. Carry.
person of trust, I will for your Honors greater ease abstain from the use of
a Cipher.

After I had been at Lovain, and Antwerp to take some depositions for the
discovering of the authors and correctors of that most pernicious Libel,
Coronae Regia, (as by a dispatch to the late Mr. Secretary Lake I did
advertize his Majesty,) there came unto me a certain person, living about this
Town, going by the name of Nicholas de Laken, and brought me the Packet, which
a good while since I sent to your Honor. Amongst other things, he told me,
that heretofore by accident, he fell into the company of a Cannon of Lovain,
with whom he had some speech about that divelish book, and that if I would send
thither, he was very confident, he should penetrate farther by his private
industry in the space of a few days into the mystery then I had been able to
do in the compass of diverse years, with my public information.

Here upon to make a trial, and desiring to employ Le see et Leverd, for the
manifesting of a truth, which I knew his Majesty so much longed to understand,
I furnished him with money, and some instructions, and sent him to Lovain. At
the end of six or seven days, he returned from thence, and as his own letters
do testify, and (he has protested with many oaths) he avouched to me, that he
had discovered that secret to the very bottom. I inquired of him, by what
means? He made answer by the help of the said Canon, and some young Scholars
his country men, Students, in that university, who had brought him to the
acquaintance of a certain Italian living there, that had served the author of
the book both while he did compose it, and while it was in printing. He
averreth also that Puteanus, and some others, had their fingers in that
unsavorie Pie. And he says, that when I began to make search for those
persons, which had done his Majesty that intolerable wrong, that the
principal author, and Flavius the Printer were secretly warned, to get them
out of this country, and had some means given them to maintain them abroad. He
affirms likewise, that both of them ever since that time, have remained, and
are at this present remaining out of the territories of the Archdukes. That he
has often seen the said author in this City, and knows his name, and
Surname, and his person so well, as no change of his apparel, nor disguising
of his body, can cause him to mistake or be deceived. By his report, that party
is no. Clergy man, though he be a good Scholar, and reputed to have an
excellent Latin pen. But those commendable quallities, are drowned by his
greater vices, he being much addicted to lewd women, and unsatiable drinking.
He is now (by this man's information) resident in a town upon the Frontiers of
Germany, And as for Flavius, he can (if he truly) declare where he lurketh, and
assures me, that his wife is at a place within ten leagues of this town. The
Cannon that did oversee the press, and withdrew the leaves of this book, as
they were printed, is called (as he heard) Mr. Claud. and dwells at Nostre
Dame de Halles, whither I purpose to send him this Easter holidaies to make
farther inquiry. More then these, and some other particulars (which are so
transcendent, as I dare neither believe, nor set them down in writing) he will
not impart unto me, until he be assured of his Majesty's protection, by a
Letter under his hand, and a competent reward for his labors. And the reason
he alleges therefore is, that if once it be known, he did meddle in this
matter, there can be no more safety for him to continue in these provinces. He
does further undertake, that in case his Majesty will be pleased to grant him
his demands, allow money for the expenses of the journey, and give him two
persons of courage, and fidelity to accompany him, he will either lose his
life, or put the said author into their hands who may carry him (as he
thinks) with little danger, either into the Pallatinate, or the united
Provinces. Hereupon I guess, that (if this report be well grownded) that
wicked fellow must be in, or near about the town of Cullen. I cannot amongst
all those of my acquaintance, and his Majesty's subjects here call to mind any
one so fit for this interprize, as the Gentleman whose name is written in
Cipher in my letter to his Majesty. For he is universally well spoken of for
his honesty, and other good Parts, and in sundry occasions has given good
testimony of his ardent desire to do his Majesty some remarkable and
meritorious service. And his sufficiency being better known to his Majesty
then to my self, I will not commend it any further. The want of employment and
some disgustes he received in Holland, while he served there, compelled him by
necessity to look for preferment under the King of Spain. But hitherto his
religion, the respect he bears to his Majesty, and my persuasions, have
detained him from those Courses. By him I am told, that he has heard out of
the mouths of one Captain Carpentine, and his son in law Captain Hamilton,
pencioners to the King of Spain (but subjects to his Majesty, that they being
one day walking in a street at Antwerp called the Major Brugg (where they
reside) with 4. or 5. others in their company, and there happening some speech
amongst them, about a book his majesty had then published against the Pope, it
fell out that one of them apprehending that opportunity said, that he had
subject enough to furnish a book which should more vex the King of great
Britain, then his Majesty's book could offend his Holiness, and if he could
meet with a Scholar, that were able to put it into a method, and good latin,
he would be ready to perform his word. Another of the troop made answer, that
he would undertake the work upon that condition, and they both (for a great
whiles after) were absent at Lovain, even about the same time that the Libel
was forged. Perhaps some part of this, may draw near to the verity. But they
both depending upon the King of Spain (as is before mentioned) and being averse
in religion, I am much afraid, I shall do little good upon them by examining
them before the Arch Dukes Commissioners, seeing they may delude me, and the
truth with equivocation, and mental reservation. Although he conceives, that
if they were called before a judge, and summoned upon their oaths to speak
the truth, they would not refuse to discharge their consciences. I have
seriously entreated him to bestow his best endeavor in attempting what he can
further learn about this relation, and he has accepted to perform my request.
The said Gentleman from whom I had it is not willing to be brought publicly
upon the Stage, for this business, lest thereby he should incur the note of
an informer, then which nothing is, or can be more odious in these parts.
Nevertheless he has promised (if his Majesty like to have it so, and will be
pleased to give commandment for it) to justify what is before rehearsed to
their faces.

Whether both these parties encounter upon one, and the same author, or
understand them to be diverse men, I can neither judge, nor fortell: yet it
seems that one of them may hit on the right. And as I will not spare any
pains, charges, nor peril whatsoever to bring the parent of this child of
darkness into the light, so I hope his Majesty (whose cause it is) will not
refuse to hazard a little money to give himself satisfaction.

These things having passed in this manner, I humbly beseech your Honor at a
fit opportunity, when the King is alone to acquaint him with these particulars,
and entreat his Majesty to keep them secret; for I am of opinion (being spoken
under humble correction, and without offense) that had not his Majesty by
communicating this business at the first to Mounsieur Borschot, given him
means to advertize it to his wife (who by tatling divulged it, and foiled the
way) we had never been put to half this trouble, but had taken Flavius, in the
form, and by him discovered the author. My intention is not, that his Majesty
should be induced to put 2000. Pistols (or the sum that shall be allotted
Laken) into his hands, before the service be done; but that his Majesty would
vouchsafe (if he approve the project) to cause so much money, as in his profound
wisdom, he shall think meet for this occasion to be forthwith remitted to me by
Mr. John More, by the means of Mr. Ducket, a Merchant dwelling in Milk street
in London, to be repayed at Antwerp by Mr. Lionel Wake trading there, or by the
company of our English Merchants at Middleborough in Zealand in the name of
reward for service done, or to buy Tapestries, or linen for his Majesty. And
I will either return it back again by exchange, if this design cannot be
effected, or defaulk the remains thereof upon my entertainment. All that I
would venture in this case, should only be for those men's necessary expenses
that are to be employed therein; and that also I would have not to exceed, but
to be limited within the compass of 200. pounds sterling.

By apprehending these men, the Archdukes cannot take any just occasion of
offense against his Majesty or his Ministers, seeing one of them is not their
Vassal, and both are out of their Dominions.

It may (for these Considerations) please your Honor to advise with his
Majesty, whether it be fitter to proceed herein Via facti, or Via Juris: to
send Laken to seek out the Author and others to apprehend him, or the Printer,
or upon promise of a reasonable recompense for his pains, to deal with him
effectually to declare their names, and habitations, and afterward leave it to
his Majesty's gracious and Princely pleasure to prosecute or let fall his
action. In either of which kind, I will yield humble obedience to his Majesty's
Commands, and your Honors directions, as things to my self indifferent. But I
am doubtful, that by continuing of the course formerly holden in the carriage
of this business, we shall never attain our desired ends. I am not so slight
as to give credit to all reports, nor so prodigal as to part with money for
nothing.

My most humble and earnest suit is, that his Majesty, and your Honor after
mature deliberation upon the several points of this Letter, will vouchsafe to
send me by my servant Marsham (who is now at London) particular, and distinct
answers for my better direction. I have been the more prolixe upon this
subject, in hope that this I have written shall serve once for all.

In that matter concerning the Countess of Argile, which it pleased your
Honor to recommend unto my Care, I have done as much already as I can for the
present. We must of necessity with a little patience expect the success,
whereof your Honor shall in due time be punctually advertized. In the mean
while, I do with all reverence, desire your Honor to excuse the tediousness
of this Letter; And so take my leave,

Bruxels 21/31. of March, 1618/1619. Your Honors very humble, and ready to be
commanded, W. Trumball.

Mr. Trumball to the Secretary.
Right Honorable,
THose that are employed in such place as I am, must admit all manner of men
into their company. And the Oath I have taken to his Majesty, will not permit
me to conceal any thing from his knowledge that comes to mine, and may in any
sort have relation to his Royal service. For these Considerations I assume the
boldness so soon to renew your Honors trouble, after the dispatch of those
Volumes of Letters which I sent you yesterday by one of my servants.

This Bearer de la Forest is better known to your Honor, then to my self,
although I remember many years ago to have seen him in England. During his stay
in this Town, he brought unto me a certain French Gentleman, calling himself
the Viscount of L'orme, and Sir De la Pommeraye; who has (by his own relation)
been a great Navigator, and been authorized by 18. of the chief Pirates in the
Levant, to search for their pardon, and retreat into some Christian Country,
being sorry for the ill they have done, and desirous to spend the rest of their
days in peace. With this Commission he came into France, and there traveled
so far with the King and his Ministers, as he obtained a general abolition for
the said Pirates, a safe Conduct to bring them into his Dominions, and a
procuration (which I have seen under the great Seal of France) to treat, and
conclude with them upon certain conditions. But he being envied by some
Grandees of that Kingdom, and by misfortune happening to kill a man, he was
forced (as he pretends) for the safety of his life to fly into these
Countries, before he could bring that work to perfection.

And being now disinabled to return thither again, he desires to make a trial,
whether his Majesty will vouchsafe to lend his ear to that Treaty, and grant
unto the said Pirates a general Pardon. To which effect, he sends over La
Forest, and has entreated me to accompany him with my Letters to my Lord
Admiral, your Honor, and Mr. Secretary Calvert. For retribution of this
grace, the said Pirates offer to give 45000 l sterling to be shared amongst you
three, or to be disposed of as his Majesty shall appoint. But your Honor may
see the Conditions proposed to the French King were more advantageous. For they
were to give him their Ships, Artillery, and Munition, and to furnish means to
set out some men of War for his service.

And I see no reason (in case his Majesty should incline to such capital
offenders, and common enemies) why he should not have as much, or more benefit
then another Prince, the greatest part of them being his Vassals.

Your Honor if you please may peruse these adjoined Papers, and impart the
contents of them to my Lord Admiral. They agree with their Originals; and if
his Majesty do not taste this overture, there is no more harm done (for any
thing I can perceive) then the loss of my labor to peruse and subscribe them.

There remains only two points, wherein I should speak to your Honor, the
one is, that this matter may be concealed from the French Ambassador Mounsieur
le Count de Tilliers, for fear of ruining de L'Orme. The other with gratifying
La Forest with the pay of a Packet (if your Honor shall think it meet) for
the carrying of these Letters, who says your Honor is his great Patron, and
has promised him a good turn.

Mounsieur de L'Orme has given him power to solicit this business, and
procure him an answer; wherein I join my humble prayer, that the poor man may
not here languish in hopes, and spend his money to no purpose.

When I shall know whether his Majesty will relish this overture, or not, I
will write thereof more largely (if there be cause) otherwise let it remain as
it was before. In the mean while, I humbly take my leave; And rest

Your Honors In all humbleness to be commanded, W. Trumball.
Bruxels 23. of October. 1619.
Sir Thomas Roe to the Marquess of Buckingham Lord Admiral.
My Lord,
I Can give your Lordship no great account of any thing that has occurred
since my departure. I was bold to write to Mr. Secretary Calvert from Maliga
of the great increase of the Pirates in those Seas, and of the danger of the
Merchants; with my own thoughts, if his Majesty have any farther purpose to
attempt their destruction, which is both honorable and necessary; if these
Trades, or the other of Spain to the South of the North-Cape be of any
consequence to his Majesty's Kingdoms: if they be suffered to increase, they
will brave the Armies of Kings at Sea in a few years, and attempt even the
Coasts and Shoares with peril. And because they carry the name only of Thieves,
they are yet contemned, or neglected; but they will become a dangerous enemy,
when they shall rob with Fleets, and therefore would be in time considered. The
Spaniards now make great offers to continue the Contract, though their
performance be slow, and their own Estates chiefly interessed, yet besides the
danger and ruin of the Merchant it is considerable, that this Army increasing
is at the obedience of the Grand Seignior the common Enemy, who has no
strength but Galleys. I know your Lordship will collect enough out of this
without further pressure. The Armado's of Spain, Naples and Sicily, have been
in the Archipelago, the Turks Forces absent in the black Sea. Yet they have
done nothing of consequence, taken a few Carmisales and slaves, and are
returned to the Port, where Don Philibert of Savoy Generalissimo is present,
who is made Viceroy of Sicily, with absolute power to dispose of all offices,
without attendance from Spain, which is more then Vice-Re. He has used me for
his Majesty's honor with very great respect, as I have in particular advised
Mr. Secretary. Among many courtesies, finding 13. English Captives in the
Galleys, I thought it my duty to succor them. His Highness at the first
instance, to express his good affection to my Master, gave them to me all
free, which I think is a good work, and not ordinary. I beseech your Lordship,
that his Majesty may be pleased to take knowledge of it into Spain for the
Princes honor, that he may in the like occasion, not think himself neglected.

The advice from Constantinople is seconded of the overthrow of the Turk. God
grant it be true, and yet the pride of the Grand Seignior is not assuaged, but
he threatens a new attempt in the spring. I hope I have hitherto done his
Majesty no dishonor, nor can I boast of services; but being under your
Lordships protection, I will hope for a good interpretation, beseeching you to
present my name to his Majesty, that I be not forgotten in these great
distances, wherein my humble fortune has kept me, and as I have observed your
Lordship to be the Amparo of those that pretend to virtue and honor, and not
to desert them till they have forsaken themselves: So I beseech you take me
upon those conditions which cannot shame you, and leave me, when I am other,
then

Your Lordships faithful, and honest servant, Tho. Roe.
Messina, 7/17. December. 1621.
L. R. H. to the Duke of Buckingham.
My dear Lord,
I Have since my departure from you used all diligence in the Princes service,
and punctually observed all his Commands. Only with the King I have dealt so
freely in my relation of the Prince his carriage, and your extraordinary care
of working his content in all points, that I did move him to shed tears in
expressing his happiness for such a son, and likewise his good fortune in
having a Favorite, who is framed according to his own heart in all points.
Neither have I pressed any thing to injure any farther then my duty bound me,
and my faithful love to your service, which shall always have a prime place in
my heart.

My Lord, there are contrary opinions in Court and City, by the one you are
much admired for your noble expressions of true honor, and love to your King,
Prince, and Country, with many observations of your special care and zeal to
Religion, and your immovable resolution to Contest with all oppositions to the
contrary. By the other you are maligned, and they give it out, That you have
with your wilfulness occasioned these delays, by diverting and changing their
ways wherein they had begun to treat: but the falsenesse hereof has been
shown, and it appears malice without ground, the which, (though heretofore I
have told you,) not out of any other end then to do you service, yet have you
so slightly regarded me for it, and so much respected those ill-deserving Great
ones, (as if you had intended to receive your enemies into your bosom, and to
cast off your faithfullest friends;) yet shall not any usage discourage me from
discharging the office of a most loving and zealous affected friend, and
servant, yea insomuch, that I will rather displease you, in doing you that
faithful service, that both my honor and love obliges me to, then be silent,
and they let you run into apparent danger.

My Lord, amongst the protestants your are divulged (as much as ill disposed
ones dare) a Papist. Among the Papists, it is avowed you are the greatest enemy
they have. For which reports, I am not troubled, for they have made you the
much more pittyed, and as highly esteemd, and honored amongst the most
juditious, and best deserving subjects, as any thing could do. And I dare
assure you, that since your being at Madrid you are much better beloved of all
people (who have not ends) then you were before. Noble Lord, I find the King
both resolute, and courageous, but wise, and secret, to my own hearts joy, and
not to be won upon by the subtle and false policy of any. I made it my humble
suit upon my knees, that he would consent to no proposition of this Spanish
Ambassador concerning peace or war, till the Princes return. Which suite he
took well at my hands, and granted. I have told him freely what I observed in
Spain, both of their manners, usage, and honesty, and left it to his wisdom
to make what use he pleased. His Majesty longs to see the Prince, and you, and
so do all the subjects, and will not be satisfied with any thing, but your
speedy return. Except you have jelousies put into the Spaniards heads, and
prevent the danger, which will be by hasting the marriage with all possible
speed; for there are some whose buttons break with venom, that you have got so
much honor, and so well deserved of the King and Prince. But you believe me
not, but think I speak of Spleen, when God knows I never bore any to any man,
but for your sake. Your most virtuous lady mourns for your absence, and will
not be comforted. Your fair Daughter deserves your staying withal, and your
faithful friends and the good of the Kingdom want you most of all

And for your greater comfort, the King is so reserved in the Princes affairs,
as that he neither imparts the businesses of Spain, nor his intents therein to
any of hit privy Council. Since your pattent, the Earl Marshal is become a
great stranger at the Court. But all men find you so fast revited into the
Kings, heart that they see it is an impossibility to work you any way
displeasure in your absence, and therefore forbear to express, what willingly
they would effect, but find it in vain to go about it. But let not the Kings
love to you or their small ability to do you harm, make you too careless, or
too credulous of those your enemies, last it give too great encouragement to
them, and too great dishartning to your faithful friends. I am sorry at my
being with you at Madrid that you durst not impart those secrets, wherein I am
sure my faithfulness, and love unto you, would have done you all service (as
the thing I most desire) but I see the zeal of my heart to you, is not rightly
considered, yet am I confident that time will make me best known, and better
esteemed by you as one whose true heart, is always watchful of taking all
opportunities to do you service. My Lord, you shall find me not only a
word-friend, but an active, who never am better pleased, then when I find most
opposition. And for conclusion, I am so far from shunning dangers to do you
service, as that I would willingly wade in blood at any time to manifest my
self yours. And therefore) I should receive great content, if you knew, how
truly I were yours, because then I am sure in the Nobleness of your nature, it
would be impossible for any to be able to do me wrong in your Honorable.
thoughts. My dear Lord, pray suffer no longer delays in Spain, but either
dispatch what you went for quickly, or else return speedily; for assure your
self, their desire to have you continue there, is for no love to you, but to
further thereby their own designs elsewhere. Nay I dare justify it out of my
own weak judgment, that the longer you stay, the farther off you shall be from
obtaining, what you desire. And if you resolutely purpose your return with
speed, you will force them out of their dull pace, and put them upon the rock,
from which they cannot escape, except they fulfill your desires. Besides, your
presence is most necessary here for home-affairs, for your absence has caused
too great insolency in the Court, by such as bear themselves very loftily, and
insult very much over yours, especially your poor servant Mewtis is much
threatened as being yours, and must suffer till you come back. Some other things
likewise are otherwise carried in your absence, then would be in your presence,
therefore for Gods sake return, but with the Prince, and count delays,
denyals. And the longer you stay there, the stronger you make them and your
selves the weaker. My Lord of Bristol has a great, and more powerful party in
Court, then you imagine, in so much, that I am confident were the King a
newter, he would prevail, and I do not much marvail at it, for you trust upon
the honor, and justification of all your actions, desirous to make no friends,
because you need none, but he deals with a great deal of cautelous wisdom,
and as he has wrought into the Kings opinion, by reason of some pleasing
services, so has he into all those, who are about the King, or powerful, that
they may better his good services, and smother his bad. Besides the man who is
suspicious (as he must needs be) has far greater care of after-reckonings, how
to make fair glosses, then he who does all things with the avowment of all
honor, and the only intent of service to his King, and Country. It grieves me
I am not thought worthy to hear from you any word by these last messengers,
especially being promised the employment, from which I was put. Farewell (dear
Lord) and the Almightes protection be upon our unmatchable Prince, upon whose
worth, and brave achievements all eyes are fixed, and the same protection
light upon you his right hand, and give you the good fortune, to make as brave
a return, as you did voyage thither, to the eternal praise of your future
memories. And upon these hopes, I rest happy to think my self

Yours H. R.

Sir George Carry to the Marquess of Buckingham. 8. December, 1619.
Your Lordship
Will be satisfied, before this of mine will have the happiness to kiss your
noble hands, that the great Mystery of iniquity in the Star Chamber is now
revealed, and as many as could be discerned to have the mark of the beast upon
them, have undergone their censure. Some I must confess, and great fishes too,
have broken out of the nett. But that escape must be objected to the errors of
some of the pursuers, whose courses in some things were not enough direct to
warrant, what otherwise might have been done. And your Lordship who is a good
Woodman well knows, unless the Wind-lace be well carried, the Bows which
stand up can never shoot.

Notwithstanding all the defaults of the meaner Agents, the Court maintaining
the honor of their own uprightness, and integrity has with moderation too,
(yet such as leaves subject to his Majesty's mercy to work upon some
particulars,) raised in Fine some 130000 l. or thereabouts. If no errors had
been committed, (whereupon those Defendants, which escaped, took advantage to
be safe) by this which is done, you may imagine what it would have amounted to.
For my part, I rejoice to conceive, how with the shortest of the days, we are
at the worst of our estate, hoping by this means with the return of the Sun, to
see some such return of the money, (the riches of his Majesty's Treasury, and
blood of the Commonwealth) as that the Exchequer may flow, and the Veins of
the State may fill again, and both with the Spring renew their strength,
luster, and complexion. I have now stayed here so long attending this
business, that I hold it too late to wait upon you at Newmarket, That gives me
cause to crave your pardon for this presuming imperfect Account of this days
action, and withal to desire the assurance, that I live in your estimation, the
same, I will ever be

Your Lordships Most sincerely honest and humble servant, G. Carry.

To King James, ab ignoto.
Your Majesty,
BOth in the eminency of your regal dignity, and in the excellency of your
judgment, does truly represent the common sense, whose part it is to judge and
discern of all things; whereas the other senses do but report their particular
objects. And in that manner do I humbly offer to your Majesty's Consideration
in this importune Chrisis of the affairs of Christendom, so much as I have
observed in France, that may now concern your service, in which place I have
been, heretofore employed in your affairs.

And first considering the present estate of things in France, and weighing
against it, the seizure made of the Valtoline by the King of Spain, the late
invasion of the Palatinate, and now this new defeat arrived in Bohemia, I do
put this for an infallible ground, that either the King of France will resolve
out of jealousy of the progressions of the house of Austria effectually to
succor the Palatinate, or else abandoning the affairs of Germany to their own
success, and neglecting the increase of the house of Austria on that side, he
will think more then to recompense himself, by taking this opportunity to
extinguish the body of those of the Religion in France. And as undoubtedly he
will resolve on one of those two points, so on both of them for sundry reasons
he cannot. To move him to the succor of the Palatinate, the main motive will
be, the jealousy between those two Monarchies, which can never die, so long as
they do both subsist in no greater a disproportion of strength and power; As
also that France shall by their usurpation of the Palatinate, be on all sides
Circled by the house of Austria, and particularly on that part where France
has before usurped on the Empire; in which regard his interest of estate is
greater then your Majesty's in the Conservation of the Palatinate, though your
personal interest be incomparable with his. Then he cannot but think of the
loss of his Correspondencies, and breach of his Confederacies in Germany,
which have been very ancient, and very particular with the house of the
Palatine. And if the reason of mutual gratitude, and vindication of injuries,
may move Frenchmen, there are plentiful arguments on both kinds to move them to
defend the House of the Palatine, against that of Austria. But now on the other
side to move him against those of the Religion at home, first does present it
self, his successeful beginning against them in the business of Bearn, then
which nothing could be more unjust, both in regard of the matter it self, and
of his own faith, and promise, and of the desert of those of the Religion
toward him, in these late troubles, nor could any thing be more suddenly, or
violently (I do not say cruelly) executed, then that was. And again the present
terms, wherein that King, and those of the Religion do stand, will push him
on. Then there will not want to this purpose, the powerful persuasions of the
Pope, and his adherents, both by propounding overtures to lay asleep the
jealousies of the house of Austria, and offering huge sums toward the charge
of the War, which if he should attempt, and prevail therein, it would prove of
far greater prejudice for many reasons that may be given in the interest of
Estate, to your Majesty, though not in the interest of your affection, then
the loss of the Palatinate.

What may in France be resolved upon these motives, is uncertain.

But I do conceive hereupon, that it may be useful for your Majesty's service
effectually to propound in France, a Confederacy for the Conservation of the
Palatinate, to which if they do hearken, your Majesty shall proceed in that
design with greater strength and reputation, and occasion the King of Spain to
proceed with greater remissness, or else absolutely to relinquish the
Palatinate by a Treaty. But if in France it be not hearkened to, your Majesty
may take it for an assured argument, that they mean to proceed against those of
the Religion, in which case your Majesty may make use of the same Embassage to
revive again some of their factions in the Court, whereby those of the Religion
may be strengthened in their defense, and it will not be hard to effect, if it
be well proceeded in. And herein does properly offer it self the person of the
Duke of Bovillon, who for his great experience and wit, and intelligence in
that Court, is best able to guide and further your Majesty's intentions; and
for his interest in the person of the Palatine, and in the conversation of
those of the Religion, does precisely square with your Majesty's ends, whose
advice you may first suddenly and secretly enquire. etc.

Sir Walter Aston to the Duke, 10. December, 1624.
May it please your Grace,
THe Archduke Don Carlos, brother to the Emperor, made his entry into this
Town on the 15th. of the last month, Still. Vet. He was met by the Almirante of
Castile two days journey from this place, who went from hence well
accompanied, and attended by many Liveries richly set forth. Some 400. paces
without a Gate of this Town called Alcala, the Archduke was received by the
two Infants Don Carlos and the Cardinal, and about 200 paces without the said
Gate by the King himself, who came attended with the greatest part of this
Court, and in his Coach accompanied with the Duke of Newbergh, and the Conde of
Olivarez: The King lighted out of his Coach to receive the Archduke, and some
complements being past between them, returned into his Coach, and set the
Archduke by him on his left hand; in the other end of the Coach set the two
Infants; in one boot the Duke of Newbergh, and the Conde of Olivarez; and in
the other the Emperors Ambassador, and the Almirante; the Almirante taking
place of the Ambassador. Being come to the Palace, the King accompanied the
Archduke to the Queens Quarter, where his Majesty left him to be conveyed
from thence to his own Quarter (which is the same was given to the Prince his
Highness at his being in this Court,) by the Infants his Brothers, as he was,
having finished his complements with the Queen, and the Infanta Dona Maria.
There were preparations here making for the honoring his reception with
several feasts, and entertainments after their manner here. But these have been
stopped by the Archdukes sickness, who felt himself indisposed the day after
his arrival, and applying some Physical remedies by the advice of a Physician
which he brought along with him, his distemper increased, and as it is
pretended by these Physicians by a wrong course held with him. What has been
the true cause of his infirmity, I leave to be disputed by them; He has been
held diverse days with a terrible Calenture, which proved at last a Tabardillo,
whereupon there was little hope conceived of his life; but he has since
received some ease, and is now in a good way of amendment. In respect of the
Emperors unworthy proceedings with the King our Master, I have not dared to
visit him, until I shall have notice of his Majesty's pleasure therein, which
I shall be glad to understand from your Grace.

Since the expiring of the Truce betwixt this Crown and the Hollanders, this
King has given License to diverse Port Towns on the Coasts of Biscay to arm out
what ships they shall think good, and to make prize to their own particular
benefit of what they shall light upon belonging to the enemies of this Crown:
by which means it is here hoped, That these Coasts will be much the better
secured from the daily pillages of the Holland men of War, and the Turkish
Pirates. For the advancing whereof upon request made of those of Sevil, there
is License given unto them to arm what men of War they can find means. The Duke
of Maqueda likewise with leave has lately set forth six ships which are abroad
in Pyracie.

There is advice given hither, that the Duke of Brandenbergh has given his
consent to the conferring of the Electoral dignity upon the Duke of Bavaria,
which I can hardly believe, though I find it assured from very good hands.

The Duke of Newbergh remains still in this Court, and presses to carry a clear
resolution in his businesses from hence; but for any thing I can yet learn his
negotiation remains in the same estate as I advertised in my last to Mr.
Secretary Conway.

The Armada prepared in Portugal for the recovering of Brasil is gone to Sea,
and whereas, they were to have stayed at the Cape St. Vincent for the Armado of
Castile, upon advice, that is given hither, that the Hollanders in Brasil are
not able to make any resistance of consideration, they have order to proceed in
their journey. Twenty ships of war, and 4000. land Soldiers (which is the
force of that Fleet) being here held sufficient for that enterprise. The Armado
in Cadiz is not yet departed, but has her men aboard, and there is daily
expectation of news that it is gone to Sea. The Duke of Saxony having
received letters from the King our Master, and the King of Denmark, sent
presently coppies of them unto the Emperor, with his answers unto their
Majesty's, and accompanied them with a letter of his own unto the Emperor. All
which the Emperor sent unto the King. The carriage of the Duke is much
esteemed here, for having given (as I am informed) by his Letters unto the King
our Master, and the King of Denmark such an answer as they are here much
satisfied withal. Nothwithstanding in this Letter to the Emperor with many
reasons, and much instance, he advises him to apply himself to the settling of
the peace in Germany, and expressing much affection to the composing of the
affairs of the Prince Palatine does earnestly entreat his Majesty not to
destroy that ancient house. In the mean time the Duke of Bavaria uses all
diligence to combine himself with this Crown, and now does offer to cast off
all other thoughts of leagues, and to depend wholly upon Spain, so that this
King will protect him in his Electoral dignity, and what he has lately
possessed himself of in those parts. This offer of the Dukes has been several
days debated in Council, where the Marquess Ynoiosa has been busy in the
behalf of the Duke: but the wiser part of this Council seeing how prejudicial,
the increase of the Dukes greatness may prove to the Empire, do no way favor
his pretentions. They likewise hold fit to continue the state of things in a
possibility of an accommodation without our Master.

The Archduke Don Carlos has brought power from the Emperor to proceed to
the consummation of a marriage betwixt the Emperors son and the Infanta Donna
Maria, wherein he says, he has nothing to Capitulate, but brings them a
blanck paper, and has power, and order to confirm what conditions they shall
here set down. The Emperor's Ambassador does much press to proceed to the
Capitulations, but there is yet nothing done. The Infanta of Brussels has
lately written hither, importing this King to admit of a treaty of marriage
betwixt the Prince of Polonia, and the Infanta his Sister, extolling with many
expressions the worth, and parts of that Prince.

There has been some months a general stop of their proceedings here in all
suites of English Merchants depending in this Court; but I have at last
procured a Junto to be assigned for the hearing of all English Causes, wherein
I am promised there shall be a speedy Resolution taken of whatsoever is at
present in Question.

The Duke of Feria has lately advertised hither from Millain, that the French
King, and the Duke of Savoy do minister much occasion of jealousy, that they
intend to attempt some novelty in those parts, and does therefore desire, that
his Troops may be augmented; whereupon (above the ordinary charge) there was
instantly remitted unto him 2000. Ducats.

The great annual Assiento which this King makes with the Genoueses is newly
concluded, it is for 7. millions, whereof 4. are remitted for Flanders, to be
paid by monthly portions.

In a late meeting of the Council of State upon a discourse that passed amongst
them, taking into consideration this Kings wants, and the present distemper of
his affairs, the Inquisidor General expressing how necessary a time it was for
his Majesty's Subjects to assist his present occasions, made offer of 100
Ducats for his part, which the Conde of Olivares followed with a tender of
300; the Conde of Monterrey of 100; all the rest of the Council of State
following their example gave according to their quality. Notice being taken of
this abroad, the Condestable wrote a Letter unto this King, wherein he made
tender of 200 Ducats, the Marquess of Castle Rodrigo of 100, the Marquess of
Carpio of the like sum. Diverse others have likewise declared themselves in
this donative, and it is hoped that it will go over the whole Kingdom, and
bring in an extraordinary Treasure into the Kings purse. Thus with the
remembrance of my duty, I rest

Your Graces, etc. W. A.

Archbishop Abbots to Secretary Nanton, 12. September. 1619.
Good Mr. Secretary,
I Have never more desired to be present at any Consultation, then that which
is this day to be handled, for my heart, and all my heart goes with it. But my
Foot is worse then it was on Friday, so that by advice of my Physician, I have
sweat this whole night past, and am directed to keep my bed this day.

But for the matter, my humble advice is, That there is no going back, but a
countenancing of it against all the world; yea so far as with ringing of Bells,
and making of Bon-fires in London, so soon as it shall be certainly understood
that the Coronation is past. I am satisfied in my Conscience, that the Cause is
just, wherefore they have rejected that proud and bloody man, and so much the
rather, because he has taken a course to make that Kingdom not elective, but
to take it from the donation of another man. And when God has set up the
Prince that is chosen to be a mark of honor through all Christendom to
propagate his Gospel, and to protect the oppressed, I dare not for my part give
advice but to follow where God leads.

It is a great honor to the King our Master, that he has such a Son, whose
virtues have made him thought fit to be made a King. And me thinks I do in
this, and that of Hungary foresee the work of God, that by piece and piece the
Kings of the earth, that gave their power unto the beast, (all the Word of God
must be fulfilled) shall now tear the Whore and make her desolate, as St. John
in his Revelation has foretold. I pray you therefore with all the spirits you
have to put life into this business, and let a return be made into Germany
with speed, and with comfort, and let it really be prosecuted, that it may
appear to the World that we are awake when God in this sort calls us.

If I had time to express it, I could be very angry at the shuffling which was
used toward my Lord of Doncaster, and the slighting of his Embassage so, which
cannot but touch upon our Great Master who did send him, and therefore I would
never have a Noble Son forsaken, for respect of them who truly aim at nothing
but their own purposes.

Our striking in will comfort the Bohemiant, will honor the Palsgrave, will
strengthen the Union, will bring on the States of the Low Countries, will
stir up the King of Denmark, and will move his two uncles the Prince of
Orange and the Duke of Bovillon, totogether with Tremoville (a rich Prince in
France) to cast in their shares. And Hungary as I hope (being in that same
cause) will run the same fortune; for the means to support the war, I hope
Providebit Deus. The Parliament is the old, and honorable way, but how assured
at this time I know not, yet I will hope the best; certainly if countenance be
given to the action, many brave spirits will voluntarily go. Our great Master
in sufficient want of money, gave some aid to the Duke Savoy, and furnished out
a pretty army in the cause of Cleve. We must try once again what can be done
in this business of a higher nature, and all the money that may be spared is to
be turned that way. And perhaps God provided the Jewels that were laid up in
the Tower to be gathered by the Mother for the preservation of her Daughter who
like a noble Princess has professed to her Husband not to leave her self one
Jewel rather then not to maintain so religious, and righteous a cause. You see
that lying on my bed I have gone too far, but if I were with you this should be
my language, which I pray you humbly and heartily to represent to the King my
Master, telling him, that when I can stand, I hope to do his Majesty some
service herein. So commending me unto you, I remain

Your very loving friend, Geo. Cant.

The Lord Brook to the Duke, 11. November, 1623.
May it please your Grace,
OUt of Spain we hear, the world comes so fast after you (since your
departure,) as we assure our selves this great work is at a good end, with
contentment to our blessed Prince, and like a Princely treaty, with addition of
honor to the Monarchy, he intends to match with.

But Sir, we hear of a new treaty sprung up between the Palsegraves Eldest son
and the Emperors youngest Daughter. A Labrynth into which, what hope soever
leads us, I fear no one thread will be able to guide us well out. Because in
the passages between these far distant Princes education of children seems
like to be demanded, Ballancing of Councels to the jelousie of friends,
Question whether the Palatinate shall be delivered in the Nonage before
marriage, or after. Then whether sequestered into a Catholic, or Protestants
hands. If into a Catholic, a probable argument that both it, and the
Valtoline are equally reserved free to fall with associated forces upon our
ancient Bulwark the Nether-Lands at pleasure. Lastly whether the Myter, and
these Scepters thus united, with their advantage in number of swords, and
Deskes abroad, their new springing party at home, strengthes by sea and land,
Constant ambition of adding Crown, to Crown, and perfect Auditt of their
neighbors powers, and humors (even while the second Heir male of this Kingdom
shall live in the hands of enemies, and strangers) I say whether these will not
prove fearful in equalities, casual to the lives of our King and Prince,
dangerous to the Crown by changing successive rights into tenures of Courtesy,
and charging of the peoples consciences with visions of confusion or bondage.

Again (Sir) admit this new project should vanish into smoke as undigested
vapors use to do, yet give me leave to question, whether to your Grace you
have overtlie protested against the intricate Courses of the Spaniard, even the
specious issue of the Palatinates delivery before consummation of marraiage,
but not like to prove Mother of many Colorable and unavoydable delays.
Because, suppose the proposition should be granted, yet who sees not that the
effecting of it will prove an act of so many parts. Viz: the Pope, Emperor,
King of Spain, Duke of of Bavaria etc. and of so great consequence joyntlie,
and severally to them all, and must of necessity require diverse assemblies,
commissions, perchance Dietts etc. And then what time the execution of the
Minutes under these Heads will demand, he that knows the diverse natures of
Nations in treating may easily conceive.

To begin with the least; what money or other conditions can be offered like to
satisfy the honor, humor, and huge expense of the Bavarian, for quitting his
Conquest to so unreconcileable a neighbor: and if there be possibility, yet
out of whose estate or treasury are these conditions, or large proportions of
Dowry probably to be expected? touching the Emperor; Is there any foreign
alliance able to persuade this Prince, who having by an untimely war, changed
all tenures of Election into succession, and thereby shaken the ancient freedom
of our Germany Princes, what I say can in likelihood winn him to restore these
dead forces of his Enemies, to the prejudice of all he injoyes, or aspires.
Besides what shall move this Emperor to take away the Bann from the
Palsegraves person, who has so desparately hazarded not only his own private
Kingdoms, and Provinces, but by his undertaking, waved the main ambition of of
the Austrian family. For the Spanish King if he be pressed, his answer will be
ready and fair, that he has no right in him (but mediation) as appears by the
divisions already made. Notwithstanding how little right soever pretends, yet
his Council, his instruments, his charge, by diversion, Overt Aid, insensible
succors (the world sees) have been used in all these wars; so as this together
with his right by strong hand gotten (and kept by arts of depositing) upon the
Voltaline may lead us to discern clearly, that he finds the passage of his
forces through them, equal, and so resolves both, to overrun the Low countries
when he please. Against which little State (whether out of revenge, or ambition
of greater conquests by them, he will constantly carry a warchfull and Griping
enemies hand.

Concerning the Pope, who knows not that his universal affected supremacy
(howsoever dissembled) yet has, does and ever will urge his Holiness to stir
up colorable Wars of Religion. Since Wars, Contentions, and tumults among
Princes have been his old way of adding more wealth, and power to his
sanctified Sea. How I say this new fashioned Monarch, shallbe won to suffer
Heidelberg (the most dangerous nest of Heretics after Geneva) to return to
her former strength is a point beyond my Capacity.

By these short, hasty and imperfect images your Grace may yet judge, that
except the restitution of the Palatinate be instantly pressed (and like a work
of Faeries either furnished, or broken off at once) we may easily be over-shot
in our own bows, by having the strengths and free Councels of England,
Scotland, and Ireland during this treaty kept under a kind of Covert-baron, and
so long made a forge for other Princes ends, as my Blessed Sovereigns trust may
perchance find it self compelled to play an After-Game, amongst discouraged
friends, and combination of powerful enemies, such as under characters of
Alliance will think they have won one great Step toward their inveterate
Ambition of a Western Monarchy.

Noble Duke, If you find me lifted above my earth, in handling a subject to
which I am utterly a stranger, yet bear with a Monks humor, in a man that is
prisoner to old age. Hide my folly from the eyes of Critiques. And pardon my
freedom that has wearied you, with a mind ever to remain

Your Graces loving Grandchild and humble servant, Tho. Brook.

Dr. Balcanquel to Secretary Nanton, 26. of March.
Right Honorable,
THe reason why I have not of late written to your Honor, is the
discontinuance of our Sessions of the Synod this great while; but since my last
unto your Honor, we have thus spent our time. The public reading of all the
Collegial judgments upon the 5. Articles was made an end of. In which (God be
thanked for it) there was a greater harmony and consent then could almost be
hoped for, in such variety of learned men, who did not know one of another
judgment. The only difference was in the second Article. After that the
President (never asking advice from the Synod) took upon him to conceive, and
dictate the Canons himself to us; but we who were sent by his Majesty,
conceiving that course to be altogether against the dignity of the Synod,
consulted with some of the Delegates, who approved our Counsel, and thought it
fit, that there should be some deputed by the Synod, and joined to the
President for conceiving of the Canons, that so whatsoever was done, might be
done by public authority. This motion did trouble the President not a little,
who has all the Provincials at his beck, and some of the foreign Divines too,
but especially the Palatines. Yet there was a public Synod called for this
purpose, where the President of the Delegates did make a speech, desiring the
Synod to depute some who joined with the President and the Assessours, might
take pains for moulding of the Canons. In the delivering of the voices most
testified their dislike of this course, and their singular respect to the
Presidents Credit; but Scultetus did by many reasons approve the course which
the President had begun, and disprove this new course, which was suggested, yet
he taxed no man personally. But Sibrandus (when he came to deliver his voice)
like a madman did inveigh against those, who were the suggesters of this
change, and said, That strangers should not take upon them to prescribe what
was good for the estate of their Church, and that some others who had joined in
that, were worthy to be noted Censura Ecclesiastica: there in he aimed at the
South Holland, who did likewise much dislike the President his Course.
Sibrandus spoke so furiously, that both the Praeses Politicus, and the Praeses
Ecclesiasticus, desired him either to hold his peace, or else speak that which
might not disturb the peace of the Synod. Yet since it was the Delegates
pleasure, the whole Synod added to the President, and the Assessours three
foreign Divines, viz. my Lord of Landuff, Sculte^us, and Deodatus; 3.
Provincials, viz. Poliander, Vallaeus, and Triglandius; who should mould and
conceive the Canons upon every Article, and then send a Copy of what they have
done to every College, that they may add power, and change what they will,
the Colleges observations being considered by them, and the Canons according
to them amended, they are to be returned to the Colleges, and the Colleges to
return them again, and so to keep the course ever till there be no exceptions
against them. When they are thus agreed upon by all several Colleges, they
shall publicly be concluded, and approved by the Synod.

We are now hard at polishing the Canons, which these Deputies send us. All our
trouble is in the second Article: The most part of the Synod would cry us down
with voices for the restriction of the general propositions in Scripture, and
the Confessions of the Reformed Churches concerning Christ's death, ad Solos
Electos. We stand for leaving them unexpounded, and unrestricted as we found
them, and rejoice exceedingly, that the Directions which my Lord Ambassador
sent us from his Majesty concerning this point, agrees so fully with our
judgment subscribed with our hands, given in to the Synod, upon the second
Article. By this doing we first leave a sound and sufficient ground for
preaching of the Gospel to all men. Next we shun a great deal of offense, which
otherwise we must needs have given to the Lutheran Churches. Thirdly, we retain
the same phrases, and forms of speaking which those Fathers did, who wrestled
with the Polagians in the same point. If this Article be well looked into, I
hope there shall moderation enough be observed in all the rest. If it were not
for the moderation of the foreign Divines, we should have such Canons as I
think have not been beard of; for there is never a Provincial Minister here,
who has delivered any rigid Proposition, and has been taxed by the
Remonstrants for it, but he would have that Proposition thrust into one Canon
or another, that so he may have something to show for that which he has said.
As soon as the Canons are agreed upon, I shall by Gods grace with all
expedition send them unto your Honor. Our next work will be Verstius, whose
book they would censure, without citation of himself. The Prosident wrote to
our College in the Delegates name to know, whether we thought it fit to have
him personally cited; but especially to know what we thought would be most
agreeing to his Majesty's mind.

To the latter, concerning his Majesty's mind, we answered, That we thought my
Lord Ambassador could give them the best resolution for that point.

For the former, we thought it would be evil taken, If any man should be
condemned, not being first heard. But because they, that Vorstius would keep
them as long as the Remonstrants had done; We told them, That we desired they
would not suffer him to make any defenses, or explications of his blasphemous
propositions, but simply to answer per ita velnon, whether he would plainly
abjure them, or not; And so accordingly proceed against him, and so we should
make no great loss of time; so I think he shall be personally cited.

This is all, for we have had no Synodical meetings these 12. days. I can see
no end of the Synod before Whitsontide. With my best prayers for your Honors,
and the remembrance of all my faithful respects. I take my leave; And am

Your Honors In all true observance and service, Walter Balcanquel.

Sir William Beecher to his Majesty, 4th. of February.
Most Gracious Sovereign,
BEsides the relation of the appearance of change in the affairs of the Court,
wherewith my Dispatch to Mr. Secretary Lake will acquaint your Majesty: I
thought it my duty to give you particular account, that being yesterday with
the Prince of Jain ville, after some earnest protestations made to me of his
desire to do your Majesty service, falling into discourse of those
occurrences, he grew into these terms. That the complaints of the Queen Mother
were founded upon good reason; that if she had offended the King, or the State,
why did they not make her process? if she had not offended, why should she not
see the King, and her children? that when the Queen fell upon these Complaints,
they thought to fright her, by Pretending to bring forth the Prince of Conde;
but that the Queen had astonished them, by telling them, That she was so far
from opposing, as she desired the liberty of the Prince. That the Queens
friends would be glad of his liberty, for that it could not be prejudicial, but
rather advantageous, at the least, it would be honorable for them, if his
liberty were wrought, if not by their intercession, at least by their occasion;
further he told me, That he was confident, that the Queen would not be gained
by their fair words, but would persist in her resolution. Which discourse of
his with some other advertisements, does persuade me, that this matter has a
farther root, and is likely to bring forth some great alteration here, in no
long time. And I doubt not but that Monsieur de Luine will find with
repentance, how much better it had been for him, to have furthered your
Majesty's advice for the delivery of the Prince, whereby he might have acquired
to the King a reputation of Justice, and to himself an obligation of a powerful
friend in the Prince, rather then to leave him to the adventure of the changes,
that time may produce. But if your Counsel did prove fruitless to them by
their misconceit of it, yet it does, and will every day prove more honorable
to your Majesty, who by your wisdom have foreseen, and by your goodness have
premonished all your neighbors of the mischiefs that threatened them.

Peradventure they may overcome this effort of the Queens by fair words to her
Person, and threats signified afar off, and continue the state of affairs in
the same condition that now it is, which is in few words extremely Romish,
Jesuitish, and by consequence Spanish.

Mounsieur de Luine seems to me a man in himself capable of reason, and by
the death of the Marshal d'Anchre, eternally bound to be a good Patriot, but
that he applies himself wholly to the Kings person, and that distrusting his
own judgment, relies upon the judgment of the Ministers of the State, and
principally Du Again.
Du Augen the Chancellor, and the Gardeseaux.

They utterly neglect all the Alliances of our Religion abroad, and care not
how inconsiderately they oppress it at home. Only they seem desirous to
entertain themselves well with the King of Spain, by the intervention of the
Nunce, and do think that no advantage which they can give the Spaniard by this
proceeding in other parts, can equal that which they pretend to receive at
home, by suppressing the State, and doctrine of those of the Religion.

If they proceed long in this train, it will undoubtedly breed mischievous
designs, which there is no so ready way to prevent, as to let them generally
perceive, that they are discovered, whereby the proceedings of the Ministers of
State will grow so detestable to all those here, that have any sense of the
love of their Country, that it will produce either a change of their persons,
or of their Councels.

But I do humbly submit the Censure hereof to your Majesty's most exquisite
judgment, whom I do beseech the Almighty long to preserve in health, and all
perfect happiness.

Your Majesty's Most humble Subject, and Loyal Servant, Will. Beechor.

To King James, abignoto.
Most wise, and Glorious Prince,
BEcause the departure of your Majesty does not permit me to hope for the
honor of seeing you, and that the advertisements, and orders which I have to
communicate unto you, do merit your speedy review and magnanimous resolution, I
have presumed to trust them unto this paper, which I do humbly desire may rest
in the hands of your Majesty alone.

The treaty of restoring all that had been taken by Sea (which by a motion from
Spain, was put into the hands of some Ministers in Rome) is accompanied with so
little hope of obtaining the end, that was pretended, that by reason of their
continuing at Naples to dissipate, and waste such goods as they had taken in
our ships, and the Cardinal Borgias reservednesse to promise any thing, that
negotiation may be held as vain, and as an insidious invention to gain time.
Nevertheless my Masters marching still with a constant desire of purchasing
the public tranquillity, have been content to render all such vessels as they
had taken within their Gulf, in hope that having gotten the advantage of the
cause by this honest proceeding, they might prevail in which they had made at
Naples, for the restitution of their Galeasses, and of the ship called Rosse.

But the actions and operations of the Spaniards do not answer unto what is
desired, and hoped. For in the Kingdom of Sicilie Naples, and Calabria, they
do muster new Soldiers, and they make great preparations for a war by the Sea.
The subjects of those Kingdoms are taxed with extraordinary Contributions of
money, and in daily councels held by the duke of Ossuna, the Marquess Santa
Croce, and other ministers they do consult of the means of making war, and
doing hurt. But that which is most important is, that in the conjuncture, there
is likewise in diverse parts of Spain a terrible concourse of great provisions.
For they have put in a readiness armor for 30000. men, they have engrossed
all the ammunition that could be purchased, and have put in good equipage 60.
tall ships which being added unto those they have already in the Streights make
80. at Naples they have 20 ships more besides all their own Galleys, and an
order they have obtained for the Galleys of Malta, Florence, and the Pope to
join with them.

All the Italian Soldiers are quartered along the Coast of Apulia, which is
opposite to our Gulphe, and they have 14000. foot of Walloons, French, and
Spaniards lodged within the Kingdom of Naples. In Flanders at this present,
they make a new Leavie of 6000. foot, and a 1000. horse. And in the state of
Millan, they do retain still 3000. horse supernumeraries. All which forces, and
provisions, as they do deserve for their greatness to be regarded, and looked
upon with a jealous eye of every one; so those, who do suffer at the present
many injuries and acts of hostility at the hands of the Spaniards, and in
particular the State of Venice, which is betrayed by their fraudulent treaties,
cannot choose but fear, and doubt more then any other. Neither can any pretenses
of enterprises or designs against the Turk secure those, who set the sword
bended against their breasts, and the fire kindled in their own houses.

Whereupon your Majesty is humbly desired that you will be pleased to consider
seriously of what has been remonstrated, and to take such a resolution, as may
best befit your wisdom, and Greatness, and the safety, and indemnity of a
State so observant of your Majesty as ours is, and of a member so important of
the liberty of Italy, and of Europe. There is not, at this day (Invincible
Sir) any Prince in the whole world upon whom the Conservation of the public
tranquillity does more rely then upon your Majesty. For there being none that
does equal your Majesty in wisdom, and experience, possessing your Kingdoms
in perfect peace, quietness, and plenty, to the infinite praise of your name,
and being free from the molestation of all storms and tempests, it seems
that the eyes of all men are turned toward your Majesty as toward a Sun,
that ought to clear the Sky, and that they expect deliverance only from your
hand. These resolutions (oh most wise King) will be the strongest walls upon
which your eternity can be reared. These will be the Jewels, and the crown,
which will adorn you in earth, and in Heaven. These will be the immortal Glory
of your powerful name.

The resolutions in cases of such weight, and danger ought to be magnanimous,
quick, and powerful. The very noise of your putting in order your royal Navy,
the sending a person of quality to the place, from whence the danger is feared,
and the declaring your self in favor of those, whom you shall find to have the
right on their side, may perhaps prove sufficient to procure a peace. If words
will not prevail deeds must follow, and such a resolution will prove the true
Antidote to all their poisons. For the better effecting whereof the world does
attend with great devotion to see a good correspondencie renewed betwixt your
Majesty and the French King; and for the disposing your Majesty's heart
thereunto, the State of Venice does join her humble prayers unto the earnest
entreaty of many others.

In the mean time, I am to request your Majesty, that you will be pleased to
forbid the exportation of Artillery, ships and Mariners out of our Kingdoms
for the service of the Spaniards, it being neither just nor agreeable to your
Majesty's Piety, that your Arms should be stained with the blood of a State,
and Prince, that has no equal in love to your Royal Crown, and that will ever
testify to all the world by effects of their observance, the pure, and sincere
devotion that they have to your Glorious name. For my own particular, I humbly
crave leave to kiss your royal hands.

Sir Isaac Wake to the Secretary.
Right Honorable,
I Have safely received the Letter, wherewith your Honor has been pleased to
favor me, dated at Theobalds the 19th. of July Still. Vet. and have to my
singular comfort understood, that you have been pleased not only to give
favorable acceptance unto such weak dispatches as I have made bold to address
unto you, but done me the honor likewise to acquaint his Majesty with the
contents of them, and to direct my proceedings in in this intricate business,
which instructions dictated by his Majesty's wisdom, this light will be
sufficient to direct my steps in the midst of an Egyptian darkness, which
does not only obscure the Horizon of this Province where I reside, but almost
the whole face of Europe, by reason of the great mists, which are cast
artificially in all men's eyes to cover the designs of those, who do presume,
that they have in all places arbitrium Belliet Pacis.

I most humbly crave pardon of your Honor, if you do not receive my answer so
soon as perhaps you might expect. For yours having stayed upon the way a month
and a day, did not come to my hands until the 20th. of August Still. Vet. At
which time it was brought unto me by Mr. Rowlandson, whom I had dispatched into
Germany, to advertize those Princes of the motion made to the Duke of Savoy for
the passage of Spanish forces through his State. My Lord of Doncaster under
whose Cover I received that Letter, did not think fit to send it to me by an
express messenger for fear of increasing the suspicion of some in those parts,
who are jealous that his Majesty does favor the Duke of Savoy more then they
could wish. And I must confess, that the same reason induced me likewise to
send that Gentleman of the Duke of Savoy's into Germany, rather then any
servant of mine own, for fear least allees, and vennes of messagers betwixt my
Lord of Doucaster, and me in these doubtful times might so far injealous the
contrary party, as might prejudice the service of his Majesty in that
Negotiation.

The instructions that your Honor has been pleased to give me from his
Majesty, 52. c. the Duke of Sav. y. 93. a. the Bohemians. 95 a. the Emperor
Ferdinand. 51. a. the King of England. 97. a. Germany. 99. a. the King of the
Romans. 71. c. the Agent of England. 51. b. the Prince Palatine. 52. b. the
Marquess Brandenbergh. 54. b. the Marquess Auspach. 50. b. the Princes of the
Union. 56 b. Count Ernest Mansfelt.
concerning my treating with 52. c. in favor of 93. a. having reference unto
the inclination of 95. a. to peace, or the probability of defense to be made by
93. a. I held it more safe for me to govern my self by such informations of the
state of those affairs as I have received from the favor of the 1. 32. 7. 5.
47. 48. 2. 10. 40. 45. of 51. a. in 97. a. And for the better justification of
my proceedings, I send your Honor here enclosed the Copy of his Letter unto
me, wherein you will see, that I have no reason as yet to spend the name of 51.
a. in favor of 93. a. nor to imbargue 52. c. in a business, which may draw a
great charge, and envy upon himself, and not much advantage the 93. a. I must
confess that the 50. b. in general, and particularly the 54. b. and the 41.
45. 23. 34. 9. 12. of 5. 35. 22. 4. 30. 50. have represented the state of those
affairs at this present unto 52. b. in a manner not only different from the
advertisements sent me, but almost contrary, and they do seem not only to be
confident of the prevailing of 93. c. but likewise they continue to give hope
that the 10. 51. 29. 15. of 48. 3. 59. 15. will concur with 51. b. and 52. b.
in the 12. 30. 13. 9. 50. 27. 40. 35. of 99. a. But because I have reason to
suspect that they make relation of those affairs, rather as they wish they
were, then as they be indeed, and that their intention to draw somewhat from
52. c. toward the succors of 93. a. I will forbear to join with them therein,
until I can have some better ground then their advertisements, which may be
thought to savor of partiality, and I have reason to be backward therein,
because I know that 52. c. would presently take me eu mot, and put to the
account of 51. a. that which he is most willing to do of himself. I do not
affirm this out of conjecture, but upon good ground; for besides, that he did
signify so much unto me at my return out of England, I do know that within
this fortnight he has sent unto 56. b. 3000. 41. 24. 48. 49. 40. 30. 47. in
part of 42, 2. 60, 32. 15. 35. 50. and in the conveyance of this 33. 39. 34.
35. 61. there was extraordinary diligence used to conceal it from the knowledge
of the 71. c. whereof no other construction can be made, but that 52. c. would
fain be entreated by 71. c. to do that, which he has already a mind to do.

If upon more fresh Letters, which I expect from my Lord of Doncaster, I shall
find that the affairs there have changed face since the writing of his last
unto me, I will govern my self accordingly, as I shall receive warrant from him.

We are here at a stand, expecting with devotion the issue of the affairs of
Germany. The Army in the Kingdom of Naples is still retained, and no order
given, either for the dismissing of those Troops, or the employing them in any
service. Prince Philibert is at Messina with the Galleys, and has with him 10.
or 12000 men. The Ships and Gallions remain at Naples, and the Walloons,
Lombardes and Neapolitanes which should have come to Vado, are since their
disimbarquing again, quartered round the City of Naples. It is impossible to
guess what they mean to do; but the most probable conjecture is, that under
the color of suspecting the Duke of Ossuna, the Spaniards will keep their
potent Army on foot, and by that means keep all Italy in awe, and as it were
sub Ferula, and delude the reiterated promises and oaths that have passed by
them, to assure the Duke of Savoy and the Venetians, that they would dismiss
those Forces. The season is now past for any enterprise by Sea, so that Prince
Philibert must be forced to return without doing any thing. And many are of
opinion, that the Duke of Ossuna had secret order to counterfeit madness, and
to cross the Kings Commandment expressly to deprive Prince Philibert of the
honor which would have redounded unto him, if he had been possessed of the
absolute Command of so potent an Army. The Duke of Savoy on the other side,
would fain make you believe, that undoubtedly Ossuna has entertained
rebellious thoughts, and that if Don Octavio D'Arragona do not bring a good
answer out of Spain, he will break out into open contumacie. His demands of the
King of Spain are these:

First, That he may be continued in the Government four years longer.

Secondly, That he may be permitted to enter with his Fleet into the Gulf of
Venice, and to dispute his Majesty's Title to that Sea by the force of Arms.

Lastly, That in case the King of Spain will not let him Contest so far with
the Venetians, that there may then be sent him so much money out of Spain as
may license his Army, considering that the Kingdom of Naples is so far
exhausted, as that they cannot contribute any longer either to the maintaining,
or to the dismissing of those Forces.

The Venetians did lately chase a small Gallie of the Vicocchi, which was
entered into the Gulf to rob and spoil, and followed her unto the shoares of
Apuglia, where Ferlitick the Captain of those Thieves saved himself and the
most part of his fellows by flight into the mountains, but Signior Filippo
Belegno recovered the Gallie, and carried her away as a prize, having found two
banners displayed, the one with the arms of Spain, the other with the arms of
Ossuna; And not only a formal Patent and Commission to take any thing, that he
could from the Venetians, but some Letters likewise from some principal
Ministers of Ferdinand, wherein this Capo di Banditi is encouraged, and
requested to do the Venetians as much hurt and damage, as he might be able.
Now the Duke of Ossuna is fallen into a great rage with the Venetians, quod non
totum telum corpore acceperunt, and he does threaten to be revenged upon them
for not suffering these Vicocchie to rob and spoil their subjects.

The Duke of Savoy has done me the honor to entreat my company with him into
Savoy, whither he does purpose very shortly to go, that he may receive at the
confines of his estate, the Prince of Piedmount, and Madam his wife. And
because his request has the power of a command over me in Licitis, et
honestis,, I must be enforced to pass the Mountains again at an unseasonable
time, before I have sufficiently refreshed my self after my last voyage, and I
know not whether I shall have the opportunity of writing unto your Honor again
before my going, which is uncertain, as depending upon the going of the Duke.
So with my hearty prayers unto Almighty God for the preservation of his
Majesty in health, and the prosperity of his Estate, in all humility I take
leave; And rest

Your Honors most faithfully to command, Isaac Wake.
Turin 27. September. 22. August. 1619.
Sir Isaac Wake to Mr. Secretary.
Right Honorable,
I Have received the Letter, wherewith your Honor has been pleased to favor
me, dated at White Hall the 27. of February, and having to my singular comfort
understood, that his Majesty has declared his gracious approbation of my
proceedings here, with the Duke of Savoy, and the Venetians. And I do with all
thankfulness acknowledge to receive that favor from the hand of your Honor,
as my only Gratum faciens --

I will not fail to govern my self precisely by the rule of those Instructions
which you have been pleased to give me. And as you have favored me with
passing your word for me, that I will not spend his Majesty's name without
particular Warrant, and direction; so will I promise faithfully to perform as
much, as you have undertaken for me, and both in this, as in all things else
you may assure your self, that his Majesty's revealed will, and that only,
shall be a Law unto me.

Your Honor will have understood by my former Dispatches, that the Duke of
Ossuna is re-confirmed in his Government of Naples: He has not (as far as I
can learn) any certain time prefixed, but is to remain there durante Regis been
-- placito; And when his Patent was presented unto him, he had likewise order
(which was delivered by word of mouth) that the King his Master did require him
immediately to dismiss all his Army, and to send the Walloons, and
Neapolitanes into Germany to the succors of the Emperor. The same party did
likewise signify unto him, that as the King of Spain had showed, to have a
care of the honor of the Duke of Ossuna in establishing him anew in that
Regencie, at this time, when the world had made some doubt, that his late
actions had not been conformable to the will and pleasure of his Master, so he
did expect that he should voluntarily, and of himself, ask leave to go into
Spain, and offer to give an account of all his proceedings. Which course, the
King did recommend unto him as most honorable, for the justification of his
own innocence, and the confusion of his enemies. This Message the said Duke
has wisely suppressed, and has published the Patent of his Confirmation,
without taking notice of the private Articles, which were annexed thereunto,
and delivered verbally. He does profess to understand very well, that in Spain
they wish him ill, and that their design is under the fair bait of this
establishing him in that Government, to make him swallow the hook of dismissing
his army, that so they may afterward dispose of him at their pleasure, when
he hall remain utterly disarmed. But his heart did not serve him to throw away
the scabbard when he had drawn his sword: and I am persuaded, that as in Spain
they will judge of his proceedings by the rule of Tacitus. Qui deliberant
desciverant: so he will repent of not having observed, that other Maxim, Aut
nunquam tents, Aut perfice. His best hope is, that Chi ha tempo ha vita, and
if he can make his peace at home upon any conditions, he will not much care to
turn honest, and change his dangerous designs into faithful service of his
Master. To play Le bon valett, he has now obeyed his Masters Commandment in
sending the Walloons and Nepolitans into Lombardie, and they are all so safely
arrived at Vado upon 19. Gallions, being in number 6. or 7000,

The landing of these troops, and their passing along the skirt of this State
does not only give a little jealousy to the Duke of Savoy, but put him
likewise to some Cost, and trouble. For as he does well know, how dangerous it
is to stand to the discretion of a reconciled enemy, so does he evidently see,
that their ill talent toward him, does not only continue, but increase; and
therefore to assure himself, and his State, he has caused at this present a
general muster to be made of all his Cavallarie, and trained Infanterie, which
he does send to the confines of his State, that way, which these newly landed
Troops are to pass. And although their order be to march toward Swisserland,
and to pass that way into Germany, yet will this Prince stand upon his guard
until they are quite gone out of Lombardie, and has given order to the Count
Guido St. George in his absence, not to let him lodge in Monferrat upon any
terms whatsoever, nor to linger too long near the Confine of this Province. He
has this reason to conclude, that the Spaniards wish him ill, because he does
see that they do mistrust him. For whereas they had a fair promise of the
passage for their army through this State, in virtue of ancient capitulations
betwixt the King of Spain, and the Duke of Savoy, they have chosen rather to
buy the passage at the hands of the Swisses at a very dear rate, then adventure
to take it here Gratis. Whereby it may appear unto all the world how little
confidence they have in this Prince, and how much they mistrust him for being
partiallie affected to the Prince Palatine, and all that party. Howsoever your
Honor does conceive, that the season of the year is too far passed for the
transportation of this army of the Spaniards into Germany, yet you will see
that necessity does make men strive with many inconveniences, for they must
pass whatsoever weather happen; and indeed the Alps are passable enough until
the months of January and February, if the Soldiers be well clothed, for
there is no danger but of cold, until the deluges of Snow which fall late do
shut up the passages.

Perhaps they will not find the passages of Suisserland so favorable as they
do conceive, and as is figured unto them, for they have bought it only of the
little Popish Cantons, without asking leave of the Seigniorie of Zurich, and
Berne, and it is to be supposed, that the State of Berne will take a hot
Alarm, considering that their controversy with Friburge is not accommodated,
and that the Governor of Millan has made offer unto those of Friburge, and the
little Cantons, of all this army for the defense of the Catholic religion in
the Bailiage of Eschalens, whereof I have given notice to our Signiorie of
Berne by an express Currier that they may have time to save themselves from a
surprise.

The voice does run current over all Italy, that the Duke of Parma is to
undertake a voyage shortly for the service of the King of Spain, but whither he
is to go they cannot tell; for some send him into Germany, others into
Flanders, and the most men into Spain. For all which discourse, I know no other
ground, but that his brother the Cardinal Farnese has asked leave of the Pope
to retire himself for a time to Parma, and I do imagine that the Speculativi
have concluded thereupon, that he is to govern the State in the absence of his
brother.

Prince Philibert having failed of the enterprise of Susa, did intend in his
scond setting out from Sicily, to meet with the Turkish Fleet and fight with
them. The first part of his design succeeded happily, for he had the good
fortune to encounter the whole Fleet between Zant and Cephalonia, but finding
them more strong then he was aware, and well resolved to give him battle, he
was counseled to retire to Messina, where he is at this present, without
having effected any thing. The two armies of Venice, and the Turk, did likewise
meet on those Seas, not far from Corfu, but as soon as they did know each the
other, the two Generals, and all the principal Officers, did interchangeably
present one the other with wine, and Rinfres Camenti, and so much kindness
passed betwixt them, that the Vizier Bassa did offer to join his Fleet with the
Venetian, and to set upon the Spanish Armado, which charitable offer, the
Venetian General had so much christianity as to refuse with modest thanks.

Signiour Autonio Donato has sent a servant of his hither, who had the fortune
to arrive in an ill Conjuncture. For the Duke of Savoy having lately called
upon the Venetians for that money which is wanting in Signiour Donato's
account, they did excuse themselves upon his pleading not guilty, and did send
unto the Duke a Copy of his Letter written to the Senate, when he was yet
Ambassador, and not convicted. This Letter arrived here from Venice the very
day before Signiour Donato's servant, and if your Honor will be pleased to
cast an eye upon the Copy which I send here enclosed, you will not blame the
Duke of Savoy for refusing to give him audience, or to receive his Masters
Letters; for he does give the Duke the Lie three several times in that Letter,
which is strange language to be used of a Prince; and I do much wonder, that
the Venetians would upon any occasion whatsoever publish such a Petulancy,
committed by one, that was their Ambassador at that time.

He brought me a Letter from his Master of mere Ceremony, and Complement, and
had his principal address unto the Popes Nuntio in this Court, whereat I did
wonder somewhat formally at the first, as conceiving that in Congruity he ought
to have interrupted his Correspondence with the Popes Ministers, as long as he
does live under the protection of his Majesty; but when I understood, that the
Duke had lodged him in a prison, with an intent to send him to Venice, I was
glad that I had so little to do with him, and the Nuntio so much.

The Duke of Savoy does assure himself, that when his Majesty shall have
perused this Letter of Signiour Donato's, he will withdraw his countenance, and
protection from him, and account him unworthy of any favor, for having wronged
in so high a degree a Prince, that is so much a servant of his Majesty.

I may not likewise conceal from his Majesty's knowledge, that Signiour Donato
has not been wanting to ruin (as far as he could) Padre Paolo, and Fulgentio
in Venice; two persons that have done his Majesty very long and faithful
service, as by an enclosed Paper, your Honor may see, which is an abstract of
a Letter written from Fulgentio.

The Prince of Piedmont having made a posting voyage hither to receive his
Fathers blessing, before he bring his Lady in the Country, I did present unto
him his Majesty's Letters of Congratulation, whereunto he has returned an
answer, which I send here enclosed. So with my hearty prayers unto Almighty God
for the preservation of his Majesty's Person in all happiness and prosperity,
in all humility I take leave, And rest

Your Honors Most faithfully to command, Isaac Wake.
Turin 3/15 of October. 1619.
Sir Isaac Wake to the Duke.
Right Honorable, and my very singular good Lord,
IN these parts we have nothing of moment worthy the relating, the storms which
do vex our neighbors round about us keeping us here in calm, and quiet, as it
were per antiperistasin. Howsoever I am of opinion, that we shall enter into
the Dance either actively or passively before the next summer pass over. All
over Italy there does reign a great dearth, which did lately cause in Naples a
dangerous Cullevation of the people against the Cardinal Zappata Viceroy, who
had somewhat to do to save himself from the fury of the Popolarzo.

In the State of Millan likewise some insurrections were beginning to be made
in Novarra, Allessandria, and Cremona, both for want of bread, and for the
insolency of the Garrison Soldiers, who having had no pay for many months,
did commit many violent excesses upon the people, which did drive them into
despair; but those Commotions were appeased betimes, and no great matter of
Consideration has ensued, although there are some neighbor Princes who did
stand aux Escoutes, and would be ready to have acted a troublesome part, if the
scene had been ready.

The Duke of Parma has imprisoned his natural son Don Octavie, the mystery
whereof is not well known, but it must needs be for some great matter, because
he did make show to love him passionately. The Infanta Isabella of Modena has
been in danger of her life, by being surprised with a violent fever, near the
time of her childbirth: from hence the Duke of Savoy sent his Physicians to
help her, and we hear now that she has escaped that danger, and is safely
delivered of a daughter.

Count Mansfelt is grown formidable, and does daily increase in strength and
reputation. Although he has hitherto entitled his arms unto the service of
the King of Bohemia, yet I believe he will neither disarm, nor suspend his
arms, when he shall be commanded so to do by that King. For being now
entertained by the State of Venice with an honorable provision of 12000.
Crowns per annum in peace during his life, and the pay of 10000 Foot, and 2000
horse in the time of War, he will try what he can do for the infranchising of
the Grisons, when the affairs of the Palatinate shall be accommodated. And if
the Austriaci do not bend all their forces against him very speedily, and break
his Army before it grow more strong, he is like to give them a greater blow
then they have had these many years. That which he has gotten already in
Alsatia, is much more worth, then the lower Palatinate; and although he has
hitherto made those people to swear Allegiance unto the King of Bohemia, yet
when the said King shall make his peace with the Emperor, it may be doubted
whether Count Mansfelt will resign up what he has conquered; and it is
thought, that he will either keep it for himself, or entitle some other Prince
thereunto. The Austriaci were never so matched as with Count Mansfelt, for he
is a perpetual motion, and does not stand upon the defensive (as others have
done hitherto, and lost by the bargain) but he is always setting upon them,
and does make War at their cost; let them take heed how they proceed with him;
for he, who has nothing to lose, is ready to hazard the Paquet upon all
occasions; And if he do chance to overthrow them once in battle, they will run
danger, or lose all that they have in Germany. Let me in all humility beseech
your Lordship to continue me in the honor of your good opinion, and to favor
me with your honorable protection, especially with a good word to my Lord
Treasurer, for the sending me some relief, without which I cannot possibly
subsist, having for want of my pay, consumed all that I had in the world. God
Almighty increase upon your Lordship all happiness and prosperity, as is
unfainedly wished unto you by him that is

Your Lordships most humble obliged Creature and Servant, Isaac Wake.
Turin 13/23. of Febr. 1621.
Sir Isaac VVakes Proposition for the King of Denmark.
IT seems that the Glory of this State, which at all times was great does
shine brighter now adays; since that besides so many Neighboring Kings and
Princes, whereof some are in a made league with us, and some do keep a good
correspondence, and all a good intelligence with us. Now the friendship of your
Highness is sought by the mighty King of Denmark, a monarch of those nations,
that in time past have left their remembrance of their prowess in Italy.
France, Spain, and in whole Europe behind them. This Great King of the N^^th,
who like a Second Atlas holds up the Artick-pole, rich in treasure, numerous in
men, dreadful for his invincible generosity and Courage, does here offer
himself unto your Highness. And acquainting you of his actions, does
confidently promise you to stand firm, and stout in the defense of the common
cause, if so be that he receive that assistance as he has reason to expect
from those, that are interested in the same cause. His Majesty of Denmark has
had from the King my Master, as much as can be given, and it is no small
matter, that his Majesty of great Britain does still continue the same
assistance, having withal still those great expenses, that are required for
the surety of his Realms, and for the offense of the common enemy.

His Majesty of France has also contributed to this good work somewhat, and
there is great hope, that he will bring forth in a short time some fit remedy
against this evil. The Lords States do as much as they are able. And the
Princes of Low Saxony do not want in their duties. There remains now, that
your Highness put also your powerful hand to this work, and with a vigorous
succor, worthy of your great heart do encourage all the rest to continue
their Emprese. The two Kings are not ignorant of the great sincerity wherewith
this most Excellent State, does observe the capitulations made with Allies of
the league, and that rather then to be wanting in things agreed upon, you have
surpassed in necessary provisions for the advancement of the designs, and that
you have not been partakers, nor agreers of the treaty made at Moncon. But that
you do continue to keep some forces in your Dominions, and likewise some troops
in the Valtoline for the effecting (as much as is in you) of what was first
thought fit, and of the agreement of the League.

And as that generous resolution and constancy of this State is never enough
praised, so there is great hope that you will not bring this same in the
reckoning of the two Kings, who never will miss to praise the wisdom and
generositie of this State, though not obliged for their particular for any
thing whatsoever done till now, either by the league in general, or by
whomsoever of the united in particular, because that the league was made two
years and more before his Majesty of great Britain broke with Spain, or that
the King of Denmark had declared himself. Since the time that these two Kings
are come to the Dance, your Highness has not levied one man, and the Forces
which you do yet keep, as they were not levied, so are they not maintained in
Contemplation of the two Kings, but only for the first reasons of the League.

The only thing here sought for is to go with a common pace, that those that
are now too heavily laden, may be supported by their friends, either by way of
diversion, or by way of assistance. And therefore your Highness and other
Princes are now requested to help, seeing there is small appearance of
diversion. And set the case, that the Peace between Spain and France should be
firm, would it not turn against the Common Cause? Italiae incendium ruina
Germaniae extinguere? To quench a little fire in Italy by the ruin of whole
Germany? In Chronical diseases Physicians do not so much respect the symptoms
and accidents as they do the causes of the evil.

The Valtoline, Palatinate, Hussia, Marchisat of Baden, Dukedom of Brunswick,
and so many other Countries attempted, and oppressed by the Spanish and
Austrian usurpation, are grievous and dangerous symptoms and accidents: but
the Cause, and fuel of the evil remains yet in the ambitious bowels of the
Spaniard, who now with spread sails goes on toward the universal Monarchy;
unless there be applied betimes some fit remedies, all topic remedies will do
but little good.

The King of Denmark does offer himself ready to apply such an issue, whereby
he may be brought back to terms of modesty, and with the assistance he does
expect from your Highness and other interessed Princes, he hops to bring his
good intent to pass. And being prodigal of his great Soul, there is no doubt
he will ever go back, unless he be forsaken.

Thus there remains the Common liberty almost in your hands, and if this most
excellent Senate resolves to give aid unto that King, that liberty will be
preserved. If you do forsake him, that will also be endangered, yea lost. I
therefore beseech your Highness to ponder well this matter, and to grant such
an assistance, as is requested by the King of Denmarks Ambassador.

Sir Henry Wootton to the Duk.
My most Noble Lord,
I Will be bold by this opportunity to give his Majesty through your Lordships
hands, an account of a Command which I had from him at Theobalds, about
sounding how the Venetian Ambassador stood satisfied with the late
determination touching his predecessor Donato.

I did visit the said Ambassador immediately at my return from the King, and
saluted him as by express Commandment; interjecting some words of mine own
gladness, that he had received contentment in this tender point, which would
signalize his beginnings. This I said, because in truth I had found him always
before the more passionate in it by some reflection upon himself. His answer
(after due thanks for his Majesty's gracious remembrance of him from abroad)
was, That for his own part, he was Contentissimo, and had represented things
home in the best manner. He hoped likewise it would be well tasted there also,
though with some doubt, because the State out of their own devotion toward his
Majesty might form a confidence of expecting more. I replied, that the King
upon the matter (if we consider disgrace) had done more then themselves: for he
was but once banished at Venice, and twice here; viz. once from the Verge of
the Court, and secondly, from London, which was as much as could be done with
preservation of National immunities, and more then would have been done at the
suit of any other Ambassador here resident, or perhaps of any of their own
hereafter if the like case shall occur. For (as I told him) it was the Kings
express will, that his particular respect to the republique, and to him in
this business should not be drawn into examples. With this point he was not a
little pleased for his own glory, and said, that indeed Mr. Secretary Nanton
had told him so. This was the sum of what passed between us, omitting
impertinencies. Let me end (my dear Lord) as I am bound in all the use, either
of my pen, or of my voice, with an humble and hearty acknowledgment of my great
obligations toward your Lordship, which will make me resolve, and in good
faith unhappy, till I can some way show my self

Your Lordships most thankful and faithful servant, Henry Wootton.
25th. of January, 1619.
Sir Henry Wotton to the Duke.
My most honored Lord, and Patron,
THese poor lines will be presented unto your Lordship by my Nephew (one of
your obliged servants) and withal some description (as I have prayed him) of my
long infirmities, which have cast me behind in many private, and often
interrupted even my public Duties; with which yet I do rather seek to excuse
some other defects of service then my silence toward your Lordship.

For to importune your Lordship seldom with my pen is a choice in me, and not a
disease, having resolved to live at what distance soever from your sight, like
one who had well studied before I came hither, how secure they are whom you
once vouchsafe any part of your love. And indeed I am well confirmed therein by
your own gracious lines: for thereby I see that your Lordship had me in your
meditation, when I scant remembered my self.

In answer of which Letter after some respite from mine own evils, I have
deputed my said Nephew to redeliver my fortune into your Noble hands, and to
assure your Lordship, that as it should be cheerfully spent at your Command if
it were present and actual (from whose mediation I have derived it) so much
more am I bound to yield up unto your Lordship an absolute disposition of my
hopes: But if it should please you therein to grant me any part of mine own
humor, then I would rather wish some other satisfaction, then exchange of
Office; yet even in this point likewise shall depend on your will, which your
Lordship may indeed challenge from me, not only by an humble gratitude, and
reverence due to your most worthy person, but even by that natural charity and
discretion, which I owe my self: For what do I more therein, then only remit
to your own arbitrament the valuation of your own goodness? I have likewise
committed to my foresaid Nephew some Memorials touching your Lordships familiar
service (as I may term it) in matter of art and delight.

But though I have laid these Offices upon another, yet I joy with mine own pen
to give your Lordship an account of a Gentleman, worthier of your love, then I
was of the honor to receive him from you.

We are now after his well-spent travailes in the Towns of purer language,
married again till a second Divorce, for which I shall be sorry, whenever it
shall happen. For in truth (my good Lord) his conversation is both delightful,
and fruitful, and I dare pronounce, that he will return to his friends, as well
fraught with the best observations as any that has ever sifted this Country,
which indeed does need sisting; for there is both flower and bran in it.

He has divided his abode between Sienna and Rome: The rest of his time was
for the most part spent in motion. I think his purpose be to take the French
tongue in his way homewards, but I am persuading with him to make Bruxels his
Seat, both because the French and Spanish Languages are familliar there,
whereof the one will be after Italian a sport unto him, so as he may make the
other a labor: And for that the said Town is now the scene of an important
Treaty, which I fear will last till he come thither: but far be from me all
ominous conceit.

I will end with cheerful thoughts and wishes; beseeching the Almighty God to
preserve your Lordship in health, and to cure the public diseases. And so I
ever remain

Your Lordships Most devoted obliged servant, Henry Wotton.
Venice 29. of July, 1622.
Sir Henry Wotton to the Duke.
My most honored, and dear Lord,
TO give your Lordship occasion to exrecise your Noble nature, is withal one of
the best exercises of mine own duty and therefore I am consident to pass a
very charitable motion through your Lordships hands, and mediation to his
Majesty.

There has long lay in the prison of Inquisition a constant worthy Gentleman,
viz. Mr. Mole; In whom his Majesty has not only a right as his subject, but
likewise a particular interest in the cause of his first imprisonment. For
having communicated his Majesty's immortal work touching the alleagiance due
unto Sovereign Princes with a Florentine of his familiar acquaintance, this man
took such impression at some passages, as troubling his conscience, he took
occasion at next shrift to confer certain doubts with his Confessor, who out of
malicious curiosity, enquiring all circumstances, gave afterward notice
thereof to Rome, whither the said Mole was gone with my Lord Rosse, who in this
story is not without blame; but I will not disquiet his Grave.

Now having lately heard, that his Majesty at the suite of I know not what
Ambassadors (but the Florentine amongst them is voiced for one) was pleased to
yield some releasement to certain restrained persons of the Roman faith: I have
taken a conceit upon it, that in exchange of his clemency therein, the Great
Duke would be easily moved by the Kings Gracious request, to intercede with the
Pope for Mr. Moles delivery. To which purpose if it shall please his Majesty
to grant his Royal Letters, I will see the business duly pursued. And so
needing no arguments to commend this proposition to his Majesty's goodness,
but his goodness it self, I leave it (as I began) in your Noble hand.

Now touching your Lordships familiar service (as I may term it) I have sent
the complement of your bargain upon the best provided and best manned ship,
that has been here in long time, called the Phoenix, and indeed the cause of
their long stay has been for some such sure vessel as I might trust. About
which since I wrote last to your Lordship, I resolved to fall back to my first
choice. So as now the one piece is the work of Titian, wherein the least figure
(viz the child in the Virgins lap playing with a bird) is alone worth the price
of your expense for all four, being so round, that I know not whether I shall
call it a piece of sculpture, or picture; and so lively, that a man would be
tempted to doubt, whether nature, or art had made it. The other is of Palma,
and this I call the speaking piece, as your Lordship will say it may well be
termed: for except the Damosel brought to David, whom a silent modesty did
best become, all the other figures are in discourse, and action. They come both
distended in their frames; for I durst not hazard them in rowles, the youngest
being 25. years old, and therefore no longer supple, and pliant. With them I
have been bold to send a dish of Grapes to your Noble Sister, the Countess of
Denbigh, presenting them first to your Lordships view, that you may be pleased
to pass your censure, whether Italians can make fruits as well as Flemmings,
which is the common Glory of their pencils. By this Gentleman, I have sent the
choicest Melon seeds of all kinds, which his Majesty does expect, as I had
order both from my Lord of Holdernesse, and from Mr. Secretary Calvert. And
although in my Letter to his Majesty (which I hope by your Lordships favor
himself shall have the honor to deliver together with the said seeds) I have
done him right in his due attributes; yet let me say of him farther as
Architects use to speak of a well chosen foundation, that your Lordship nay
boldly build what fortune you please upon him, for surely he will bear it
virtuously. I have committed to him for the last place a private memorial
touching my self, wherein I shall humbly beg your Lordships intercession upon a
necessary motive. And so with my heartiest prayers to heaven for your
continual health and happiness, I most humbly rest

Your Lordships Ever obliged devoted Servant, Henry Wotton.
Venice 2/12. December. 1622. Postscript.
MY Noble Lord, it is one of my duties to tell your Lordship, that I have sent
a servant of mine (by profession a Painter) to to make a search in the best
towns through Italy for some principal pieces, which I hope may produce
somewhat for your Lordships contentment, and service.



Sir Henry Wotton to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
HAving some days by sickness been deprived of the comfort of your sight, who
did me so much honor at my last Access, I am bold to make these poor lines
happier then my self. And withal to represent unto your Grace (whose noble
Patronage is my refuge, when I find any occasion to bewail mine own fortune) a
thing which seems strange unto me. I am told (I know not how truly) that his
Majesty has already disposed the Venetian Embassage to Sir Isaac Wake; from
whose sufficiency if I should detract, it would be but an argument of my own
weakness.

But that which herein does touch me, I am loath to say in point of reputation,
surely much in my livelihood (as Lawyers speak) is that thereby after 17. years
of foreign in continual employment either ordinary or extraordinary, I am left
utterly destitute of all possibility to subsist at home, much like those Seal
Fishes which sometimes (as they say) oversleeping themselves in an ebbing
water, feel nothing about them but a dry shore when they awake. Which
comparison I am fain to seek among those Creatures, not knowing among men that
have so long served so gracious a Master, any one to whom I may resemble my
unfortunate bareness. Good my Lord, as your Grace has vouchsafed me some part
of your Love, so make me worthy in this of some part of your Compassion. So I
humbly rest

Your Graces, etc. Henry Wotton.

Sir Henry Wotton to the Duke.
My most Noble Lord,
When like that impotent man in the Gospel, I had lain long by the Pooles
side, while many were healed, and none would throw me in, it pleased your
Lordship first of all to pity my infirmities, and to put me into some hope of
subsisting hereafter. Therefore I most humbly and justly acknowledge all my
ability and reputation from your favor. You have given me encouragement, you
have valued my poor endeavors with the King, you have redeemed me from
ridiculousnesse, who had served so long without any mark of favor. By which
arguments being already and ever bound to be yours till either life or honesty
shall leave me, I am the bolder to beseech your Lordship to perfect your own
work, and to draw his Majesty to some settling of those things that depend
between Sir Julius Caesar and me, in that reasonable form, which I humbly
present unto your Lordship by this my Nephew; likewise your obliged servant,
being my self by a late indisposition confined to my Chamber, but in all
estates such as I am

Your Lordships Henry Wotton.

Sir Henry Wotton to the Earl of Portland, Lord Treasurer.
My most honored Lord,
I Most humbly present (though by some infirmities a little too late) a
straying new years gift unto your Lordship, which I will presume to term the
cheapest of all that you have received, and yet of the richest Materials.

In short, it is only an image of your self drawn by memory from such
discourse as I have taken up here and there of your Lordship among the most
intelligent, and unmalignant men. Which to portraict before you, I thought no
servile office, but ingenious and real. And I could wish, that it had come at
that day, that so your Lordship might have begun the new year somewhat like
Platos definition of felicity with the contemplation of your own Idea. They
say, that in your foreign employments under King James your Lordship wan the
the opinion of a very able and searching judgment, having been the first
discoverer of the intentions against the Palatinate, which were then in
brewing, and masqued with much art, and that Sir Edward Conway got the Start of
you both in title, and employment, because the late Duke of Buckingham wanted
then for his own ends a Martial Secretary.

They say that under our present Sovereign you were chosen to the highest
charge at the lowest of the State, when some instrument was requisite of
indubitable integrity, and provident moderation, which atributes I have heard
none deny you.

They discourse thus of your actions, since, that though great exhaustations
cannot be cured without sudden remedies no more in a Kingdom then in a natural
body: yet your Lordship has well allayed those blustering clamours, wherewith
at your beginning, your house was in a manner daily besieged.

They note, that there has been made changes, but that none has brought to
the place a judgment so cultivated, and illuminated with various erudition as
your Lordship, since the Lord Burleigh under Queen Elizabeth, whom they make
your parallel in the ornament of knowledge.

They observe in your Lordships diverse remarkable combinations of virtues and
abilityes rarely sociable.

In the character of your aspect, a mixture of Authority, and Modesty. In the
faculties of your mind quick apprehension and solidity together, in the style
of your Port, and Trayn, as much dignity and as great dependencie as was ever
in any of your place, and with little noise, and outward form.

That your Table is very abundant, free, and noble, without Luxury; That you
are by nature no flatterer, and yet of greatest power in Court. That you love
magnificence and frugality both together. That you entertain your Guests and
Visitours with noble Courtesy, and void of Complement. Lastly, that you
maintain a due regard to your person and place, and yet no enemy to
froath-formalities.

Now in the discharge of your function, they speak of two things that have done
you much honor, viz. that you had always a special care to the supply of the
Navy; And likewise a more worthy and tender respect toward the Kings only
sister for the continual support from hence, then she has found before.

They observe your Greatness as firmly established as ever was any, of the
love (and which is more) in the estimation of a King who has so signalized his
Constancy: besides your additions of strength (or at least of luster) by the
noblest alliances of the Land.

Amongst these notes, it is no wonder if some observe, that between a good
willingness in your affections to satisfy all, and impossibility in the
matter, and yet an importunity in the persons, there does now and then, I know
not how, arise a little impatience, which must needs fall on your Lordship,
unless you had been cut out of a Rock of Diamonds, especially having been long
before so conversant with liberal studies, and with the freedom of your own
mind.

Now after this short Collection touching your most honored Person, I beseech
you give me leave to add likewise a little what men say of the Writer.

They say I want not your gracious good will toward me, according to the
degrees of my poor talent, and Travailes; but they say, I am wanting to my
self. And in good faith (my Lord) in saying so, they say the truth. For I am
condemned I know not how by nature to a kind of unfortunate bashfulnesse in
mine own business, and it is now too late to put me in a new Furnace.

Therefore, It must be your Lordships proper work, and not only your Noble,
but even your charitable goodness, that must in some blessed hour remember me.
God give your Lordship many healthful and joyful years, and the blessing of
that Text Beatus qui attendit ad attenuatum. And so I remain with all humble
and willing heart

At your Lordships command, Henry Wotton.

Sir Richard Weston to the Duke.
May it please your Lordship,
I Fear I have taken too much of that liberty of not writing, you were pleased
to allow me by Sir George Goring, but I hope your Lordship will measure my
devotion to serve you by no other rule then your own interest and desert. For
as I understand by Sir George Goring how often I come in your thoughts, and how
great a part I have in your Cares; so is there no man to whom I would more
willingly give daily account of my self then to your Lordship, to whose grace
and favor I owe so much.

I forbear to trouble your Lordship with any relation of business, because I
presume your Lordship is acquainted with all my dispatch, and it is not long
since I entreated my Lord Treasurer to tell your Lordship what I thought of
things then. I have yet little reason to change my opinion.

And if your Lordship please to know the state of things now, I have sent this
Gentleman the Bearer hereof especially to do your Lordship reverence in my
name, and to give you full information. For my return or stay, I humbly submit
it to his Majesty's pleasure.

Though this Negotiation be like to spin it self out into much length, I weigh
not my own interest. I shall willingly be there, where I shall be thought most
able to do his Majesty service. And so entreating that I may be continued in
that good opinion and grace, wherein your Lordships own affection, not any
merit of mine has placed me, I humbly kiss your hands; And remain

Your Lordships Faithful and devoted servant, Rich. Weston.
Bruxels 26. June, 1622.
Sir Richard Weston to the Duke
My very good Lord,
I Have understood by my Lord Treasurer the way you have made with his Majesty
for my calling home, for which this present does give your Lordship most humble
thanks, though I have forborne to press or solicit it, because I would approve
my obedience to his Majesty, and take away from them all occasion, who
otherwise might have accused my departure, and imputed the want of success
here to my want of patience to expect an answer.

I have almost in all my Dispatches since we entered into this Treaty, signified
what opinion I had of their proceedings here, and my chief comfort was, that
whatsoever the success were, that the clearness of his Majesty's intentions
would appear to the whole world, and that the failing is not of his side, which
I think is manifest enough: for notwithstanding that his Majesty has followed
them in all their desires, and the Prince Electour has conformed himself to
what was demanded, that the Count Mansfelt, and Duke of Brunswick, the
pretended obstacles of the Treaty, are now with all their Forces removed. No
face of an enemy in the Palatinate, but his Majesty's power in the Garrisons;
All other places repossessed which Mansfelt had taken. No cause of continuing
any War now, nor any cause of jealousy or fear for the future, considering his
Majesty's fair and honorable offers: yet are they so far from a cessation,
that they are fallen upon Heidelbergh, and either want the will, or power to
remove the siege. And all I can get is two Letters of entreaty from her
Highness to the chiefs of the Emperor to proceed no further; and after some
18. days since I made my proposition for the Cessation, I have yet no answer:
so that being able to raise no more doubts, they make use of delays. I have
said, and done, and used all diligences within my power to bring forth better
effects, and can go no farther; and therefore I humbly beseech your Lordship
that I may have leave to return, when I shall hear that they will not remove
the siege at Heidelbergh. For their pretending to restore all, when all is
taken, is a poor comfort to me, and as little honor to his Majesty; and how
far they are to be believed in that, is to be examined more exactly then by
writing, by weighing how the weak hopes given me here, agree with the strong
assurances given by my Lord Digbie out of Spain.

I hope therefore his Majesty will be pleased to think it reasonable to speak
with me, and as your Lordship has ever been a happy and gentle star to me; so
have I now more need of your favorable aspect then ever, that his Majesty may
receive my obedience as a sacrifice, and interpret well of all my endeavors,
what success so ever I bring home with me. Wherein humbly entreating your
Lordships wonted grace and favor, I humbly kiss your hands, and vow unto you
the faithful observance of

Your Lordships Most humble and devoted Servant, Richard Weston.
Bruxels 3d. of September. 1622.
Sir Richard Weston to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
YOur Grace shall add much to the infinite favors I have received from you to
read a few lines from me, much more to vouchsafe them an answer, which I am the
more bold to beg, and the more hopeful to obtain, because I understand by Sir
George Goring, that howsoever I have had many ill offices done me, your Grace
will not easily depart from that opinion, you have hithert^ conceived of me,
for which I humbly thank your Grace, and entreat the continuance of it no
longer, then I shall be able to make good the integrity of my heart unto you.
But that, which with all humility, and importunity I sue for at your Graces
hands, is to let me know my Accuser, and if your Grace think it unseasonable
now, that I may have a promise to know him at your return. Whatsoever, or how
great soever he be, (though respect, and reverence of those eyes which shall
read these lines make me forbear ill language now) I shall dare to tell him,
whatsoever becomes a wronged innocence to say. In the mean time, I despise him,
if there be any such that has accused me since your Graces departure, to have
done, or said, or given way to the hearing of any thing that may be wrested to
the impeachment of my faith and sincere professions toward your Grace; and yet
till it come to the trial, I rely (as I wrote to Sir George Goring) no less
upon your Graces wisdom and goodness, then my own innocence, that such
Calumnies shall not lessen the estimation I had with you; wherein being most
confident praying for the continuance and increase of your Graces honor and
happiness, I remain

Your Graces Most humble and devoted servant, Richard Weston.
17. July, 1623.
Sir Richard Weston to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
I Humbly thank your Grace for the Message I received from you yesterday by Mr.
Packer. And withal I humbly beseech your Grace to believe, that no man shall
condemn me more, then I would my self, if I had omitted any possible diligence
either to interest, or acquaint your Grace with the Commission of the
Treasury. Wherein I appeal to Mr. Secretary Conway, who first declared his
Majesty's pleasure unto me, which I could not ascribe more to any Cause, then
your Graces favor, and good opinion of me. And at my last being with your
Grace, I began to speak with you of it, but finding your Grace to grow into
some indisposition, I forbore, thinking it not only incivilitie, but a violence
to have spoken any thing of my self to your Grace at that time. This I
entreated Sir George G^ring to relate unto your Grace, and withal to renew the
professions of my love and reverence to your Graces person, which I had rather
make good by real performances then by words, and therefore I will trouble your
Grace no longer upon this subject.

I am now extremely importuned by the Earl of Middlesex to solicit his
Majesty for the first testimony of his gracious disposition toward him. And
your Grace remembers, that in the beginning of his Lordships troubles, his
Majesty commanded me to deliver unto his Majesty, whatsoever his Lordship
should petition of him.

Now I humbly beseech your Grace to direct me what to do: His Lordship sues for
his enlargement, and I know desires to derive that favor from his Majesty by
your Graces mediation. And I am careful to perform all duties, my obedience to
his Majesty, my respect to your Grace, and my ear of him (that relieth upon
me) being in affliction. And therefore I humbly befeech your Grace to vouchsafe
me an answer to this particular, because his Majesty goes from hence to
morrow, and the Earl of Middlesex will languish with expectation till he
receive some comfort from him. And so continually praying for the increase of
your Graces health, I remain

Your Graces Most humble servant, Richard Weston.
29. May, 1624.
Sir Richard Weston to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
I Have according to his Majesty's Command signified to me by Mr. Secretary
Conway, delivered to the Earl of Middlesex his Majesty's pleasure concerning
his Fine. The news of it did extremely dismay him, as being far contrary to his
expectation. He used not many words; but thereof I having given Mr. Secretary
a particular account in answer of the charge I received from his Majesty, I
will not trouble your Grace with the repetition of them.

The chief cause of this unto your Grace is, to acquaint your Grace with a
short Dialogue that passed between Mr. Brett and me touching his Pension.

He sent his man to me this week to demand it; to whom I made this answer, That
the charge of the Progress being settled, I would consider of the payment of
his Masters pension amongst others, before which time I could not in that case
give satisfaction to any. He went away with this answer, and immediately after
(within less then a quarter of an hour) Mr. Brett himself came to me, and asked
me at the first word, Whether I had any Command to stay his Pension. I replied,
No other command then the want of money. He told me, That the rest of his
fellows were paid: I said it was true, I was to have care of them that
immediately followed his Majesty, when I was forced to entreat others to have
patience till more moneys came in. He asked me again. Whether I had any
Command to stay his? I answered as before; wherewith he parted from me, as it
seemed, not pleased.

This peradventure is not worth troubling your Grace withal, but that because
his Majesty was pleased to acquaint me with his just indignation against him
at VVansteed, I would be glad to receive some direction, what answer I shall
make upon his next importunity. And so humbly entreating your Grace ever to
number me amongst those that do most honor and pray for you, I remain

Your Graces Most humble and faithful servant, Richard Weston.
Chelsey 23. July, 1624.
Sir Richard Weston to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
I did scarce esteem my Letter worthy your Graces reading, much less worthy
your pains to answer it. It is my duty upon all occasions great and small, to
pay unto your Grace those observances I owe you. And when your Grace vouchsafes
to take knowledge of them, it is your favor, and therefore I humbly thank
your Grace for vouchsafing an answer.

I have according to his Majesty's commandment signified by your Grace unto
me, taking the best order I can about the Wardship of the Lady Cravens Son.
The most of the Officers of the Court of Wards being out of the town, I have
spoken with Sir Benjamin Buddier, who assured me, that there is nothing yet
done, nor can be, till there be a master, or that the Officers meet together,
and that he will take care that nothing shall be done to the prejudice of his
Majesty.

And for the more Caution, I have commanded the Clerk of Court, if any man
petition, or sue about the Wardship, that there be no proceeding till he
acquaint me with it. This is all can be done for the present, and thereof I
think fit to give your Grace account, in answer of the charge I have received
from his Majesty. And so humbly craving leave to kiss your Graces hands, I
wish your Grace continual increase of honor and happiness, and remain

Your Graces Most humble and faithful Servant, Richard Weston.
Chelsey 12th August 1624.
Sir Francis Cottington to the Duke.
May it please your Honor,
MY last unto you was of the 23. of September by Mr. Berrie, who that day
departed from hence toward England, with intention to take passage by Sea from
St. Sebastians: and although I conceive, that this conveyance will be much
speedier (it being by an extraordinary dispatched for Flanders) yet for that I
hold the other to be sure, I will not forbear to trouble your Honor with any
tepetition of that dispatch.

The strength and boldness of the Pirates (or rather of the Turks) is now grown
to that hieght both in the Ocean, and Mediterranean seas, as I have never known
any thing to have wrought a greater sadness and distraction in the Court, then
the daily advice thereof. Their whole Fleet consists of 40. Sail of tall ships,
of between 200. and 400, tuns a piece; Their Admiral of 500. tuns. They are
divided into 2. Squadrons, the one of 18. Sail remaining before Malaga (in
sight of the City) the other about the Cape St. Marie, which is between
Lisbone, and Sevil. That Squadron within the Straights entered the rode of
Mostil (a Town by Malaga) wherewith their ordnance, they beat down a part of
the Castle, and had doubtless taken the town, but that from Granado there came
Soldiers to succor it; yet they took there diverse ships, and amongst them 3.
or 4. of the west part of England. Two bigg English ships they drove on shore,
not past four Leagues from Malaga; and after they went on shore also, and burnt
them, and to this day they remain before Malaga, intercepting all ships, that
pass that way, and absolutely prohibiting all trade into those parts of Spain.
The other Squadron at the Cape St. Marie does there the like, intercepting all
shipping whatsoever. They lately met with seven fail of English ships, (all of
London as I take it) but laden only with pipestaves, which they had taken on
the Coast of Ireland by the way. Five of these, viz. the Marie Anne, the Marie
and John, the Rebecca, and Gibbs of Sandwich, and one John Cheyney of London
they took, and the other two escaped. They robbed them only of their victuals,
their Ordnance, and of some sayls, and so let them go, but in their company was
also taken a great Ship of Lubeck, said to be very rich, which they still keep
with all the men. They have few or no Christians aboard them, but all either
Turks, or Moors, and the most part are of those, which of late years were
turned out of Spain for Morisces. They attend (as it seems) and as themselves
report to them that have been aboard them (the coming of the West Indian Fleet,
which is now very near.) But from hence they have commanded the Armada (which
was divided into three Squadrons) to be joined together, and advice is brought
that it is so, and now consists of twenty strong ships; Don John Faxardo (the
General) has also express order to fight with the Pirates, not admitting any
excuse whatsoever, but the common opinion is here, that we will be able to do
them little harm, because his ships are of great burden, and they will be able
to go from him at their pleasure. And the other Squadron within the Straights
will always be able to secure their retreat thither. I doubt not but in my
next dispatch, I shall be able to tell your Honor what Don John Faxardo either
has or will do to them. If this year they safely return to Argier (especially
if they should take any of the Fleet) it is much to be feared, that the King of
Spains forces by Sea will not be sufficient to restrain, them hereafter, so
much sweetness they find by making prize of all Christians whatsoever. The
Secretary of the Council of war, has hereupon discoursed much unto me, and by
him I perceive, that here is an intention, to move his Majesty (the King our
Master) that he will be pleased to join some of his Sea-forces (upon good
terms) with this King, for the suppressing of these Pirates, if they should
hereafter grow, and increase as hitherto they have done. Seeing they now
profess themselves the common enemies of Christendom. Many reasons he gave me,
that he thought might move his Majesty thereunto; but that whereon for my part
I most reflect is, that these courses of the Pirates, do but exercise the forces
of the King of Spain by Sea, and put an obligation on him by all means to
strengthen, and increase his Armada, and keep in practice his Sea-souldiers,
without doing him any great harm, for that the greatest damage will always
fall upon the Merchants that trade into those parts (of which the English will
ever be the greatest number, and the greatest losers) And as for the taking of
his Fleet, it is not to be imagined, for that besides, that they come very
strong (consisting of 50 great ships, of which eight are Gallions of war) they
shall always be meet, and guarded by the Armada. Your Honor may be pleased to
acquaint his Majesty with what I here write, for I perceive it is expected,
that I should advertize what the Secretary has discoursed to me, which I
would have done more at large; but I am straightned with want of time. Yet I
may not forbear to advertize your Honor, that the said Secretary told me
withal, that the last year the States desired leave of this King for certain
ships of war (which they had armed to Sea against Pirates) might have safe
recourse into these parts, which was accordingly granted them, but that instead
of offending the Pirates, the same ships sold in Argeir as much Powder, and
other warlike provision (especially powder) unto the Turks, as furnished the
foresaid Fleet which they have now at Sea, a thing which is here (he says)
very ill, taken. I doubt not but from Piemount your Honor has better
advertizement (at least more speedier) then I can give you from hence, yet have
I thought it fit to advertize you, that in a late ambush, which the Duke of
Savoy had laid, at Don Pedro de Tolledo's entrance into Piemount, the Maestro
de Campo of the Spanish army was slain; the Son of the Prince of Asloli was
hurt: so was the Prince of Morveles (who serves this King there) and many other
Captains, and Gentlemen of note slain and hurt. They here say that the number
of men Don Pedro lost was but few, but their custom is to dissemble their
losses, howsoever it is to be conceived, that when so many principal men were
touched, the common Soldiers could not well escape.

At Lisbone there is arrived two Caracks, and a Gallion from the East Indies,
the Caracks very rich, and much richer then in former years, but (as in a
former Letter I advertised you) two others as rich as they, and that should
have come in company with these, were cast away coming home.

Don-Roderigo Calderon (now the Marquess de Las Siete Iglesias) is suddenly
commanded from this Court, and confined to a small Village, and Judges are
appointed to examine by what means he is so suddenly grown to so great an
estate (which in my time is risen from nothing to above 60000. Ducats a year
rent, besides an infinite treasure in movables) and doubtless some heavy
sentence will fall upon him, for he has many enemies, and I understand that
the Duke of Lerma has much withdrawn his favor.

New supplies of Soldiers are here raised for the Governor of Millan, and 30.
Companies are ready to be embarked at Valentia, where the Galleys attend them.

Here is lately come hither one who calls himself Sir James Mackenel a
Scotchman, and says he is Cousin german to the Earl of Arguile: I have not
seen him, but I hear he discourses of his breaking out of the Castle of
Edenborough, of the unjustnesse of his imprisonment there, of his integrity in
the Popes Religion, and so desires to be entertained into this Kings service,
which doubtless he shall obtain if he can make it here be believed, that he
has a true fugitives heart.

My Lord Rosse is now much hearkened after, and they think he stays very long.
By the ordinary (God willing) I shall write again to your Honor. And so for
this time I humbly take my leave

Your Lordships to be Commanded, Fran. Cottington.
Madrid the first of October. 1616. Still. Vet.
The Lord Viscount Rochfort to the Duke of Buckingham.
My Lord,
I Have received great wrongs about my Lord of Oxford by reports, which can
find no author: yet have they wrought such impressions in the hearts of some,
that it is hard to remove those Calumniations: for diverse are possessed, that I
am to be his accuser, which is so strange, and so maliciously bruited, that it
is somewhat suspected; yet know I not any one particular, for which he is in
the Tower, neither if I knew any such slip (in so noble a person as might
deserve the Kings displeasure) would my nature give me leave to play the
Informer, except it nearly concerned the safety, or the honor of my King, and
then should my discovery be public to the face, and not private behind the
back, for that I account too base to be found faulty in.

Sorry I am to be so much as suspected, but since ill disposed persons will
raise ill rumors without any ground, the eleernesse of my heart is sufficient
content unto me; and as my heart has been always most faithful and watchful
to do you service; so good my Lord, let me entreat you, that for my sake, my
Lord of Oxford may receive some testimonies of your great favor for his speedy
enlargement, and that it may appear, you are the more willing to do it, for my
earnest entreaty. My Lord, you shall not only hereby oblige all my Lord of
Oxford's friends, but likewise the Lady Diana's, who does lose a great deal of
precious time by my Lords imprisonment, and therefore let all be arguments to
excite your noble heart to procure his freedom. And so I kiss your hands, and
rest

More yours then his own, H. R.
Postscript.
PRay make all haste from Spain, for neither are your pleasures and contents so
great there, as you may find them here, neither have you so faithful friends
there as you deserve; but sure I am your have many false ones. For I have work
enough both in Court and City to falsify their reports of you; yea some of
them (about women) very base ones, and much tending to your great dishonor.
And it goes current among very great ones, that the Prince has been somewhat
displeased with you of late. I have sent you another Letter of larger contents,
and I should be glad to hear from you.



King James to Pope Gregory 15th. 30. September, 1622.
James by the Grace of God King of great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender
of the faith, etc. To the most Holy Father Pope Gregory the 15th. greeting,
and all manner of Felicity.
Most Holy Father,
YOur Holiness will perhaps marvel, that we differing from you in point of
Religion should now first salute you with our Letters. Howbeit such is the
trouble of our mind for these calamitous discords and bloudsheds, which for
these late years by past, have so miserably rent the Christian World, and so
great is our care, and daily solicitude to stop the course of these growing
evils betimes, so much as in us lies, as we could no longer abstain,
considering that we all worship the same most blessed Trinity, nor hope for
salvation by any other means, then by the blood and merits of our Lord and
Savior Christ Jesus; but breaking this silence to move your Holiness by these
our Letters friendly and seriously, that you would be pleased together with us
to put your hand to so pious a work, and so worthy of a Christian Prince.

It is truly to be wished, and by all means to be endeavored, that this
mischief creep on no farther, but that these storms at the last ceasing, and
the rancor being removed, by which they were at the first raised, the hearts of
these Princes, whom it any way concerns, may be reunited in a firm and
unchangeable friendship, and as much as may be knit together in stricter
obligations then before, one unto another.

This we have always had in our desires, and to bring it to pass, have not
hitherto spared any labor, or pains, not doubting but your Holiness out of
your singular piety, and for the credit and authority that you have with the
parties, both may and will further this work in an extraordinary manner. No way
can any man better merit of the state of Christendom, which if it shall take
the desired effect in your days, and by your assistance your Holiness shall
worthily reap the glory and the reward due to so excellent a work.

That which remains for us further to say concerning this matter, this
Gentleman our Subject George Gage will deliver unto you more at large. Praying
your Holiness, that you will give him in all things full credence and belief,
beseeching Almighty God from our heart to preserve you in safety, and to
grant you all other happiness.

From our Palace at Hampton Court the last of September. 1622.
Pope Gregory the 15th. to the Prince of Wales.
Most Noble Prince, Health and light of Divine Grace, etc.
GReat Britain abounding with worthy men, and fertile virtues, so that the
whole earth is full of the glory of her renown, induces many times the
thoughts of the great Shepherd to the consideration of her praises. In regard
that presently in the infancy of his Church, the King of kings vouchsafed to
choose her with so great affection for his inheritance, that almost it seems
there entered into her at the same time the Eagles of the Roman Standard, and
the Ensigns of the Cross. And not few of her Kings indoctrinated in the true
knowledge of Salvation gave example of Christian piety to other Nations, and
after-ages, preferring the Cross to the Scepter, and the defense of Religion
to the desire of Command. So that meriting heaven thereby (the Crown of eternal
bliss) they obtained likewise upon earth the luster, and glorious ornaments of
sanctity. But in this time of the Brittanicks Church, how much is the case
altered? yet we see that to this day the English Court is fenced and guarded
with moral virtues, which were sufficient motives to induce us to love this
Nation, it being some ornament to the Christian name, if it were likewise a
defense and sanctuary of Catholic virtues.

Wherefore the more the glory of your most Serene Father, and the property of
your natural disposition delights us, the more ardently we desire, that the
gates of Heaven should be opened unto you, and that you should purchase the
universal love of the Church. For whereas, that the Bishop Gregory the Great
of most pious memory introduced amongst the English people, and taught their
Kings the Gospel, and a reverence to the Apostolical Authority, we much
inferior to him in virtue, and sanctity, as equal in name, and height of
dignity, it is reason we should follow his most holy steps, and procure the
salvation of those Kingdoms, especially (most Serene Prince) there being
great hopes offered to us at this time of some successeful issue of your
determination.

Wherefore you having come to Spain and the Court of the Catholic King, with
desire to match with the house of Austria, it seemed good to use most
affectionatetly to commend this your intent, and to give clear testimony, that
at this time your person is the most principal care that our Church has. For
seeing you pretend to match with a Catholic Damosel, it may easily be
presumed, that the ancient seed of Christian piety, which so happily
flourished in the minds of British Kings, may by Gods Grace reverberate in your
breast. For it is not probable, that he, that desires such a wife, should abhor
the Catholic religion, and rejoice at the overthrow of the holy Roman
Church. To which purpose we have caused continual prayers to be made, and most
vigilant orisons to the Father of Lights for you (fair flower of the Christian
world, and only hope of great Britain) that he would bring you to the
possession of that most Noble inheritance, which your Ancestors got you by the
defense of the Apostolic authority, and destruction of monsters of haerisies.
Call to memory the times of old; ask your forefathers, and they will show you
what way leads to heaven, and perceiving what path mortal Princes pass to the
Heavenly Kingdom, behold the Gates of heaven open. Those most holy Kings of
England, which parting from Rome accompanied with Angels, most piously
reverenced the Lord of Lords, and the Prince of the Apostles in his Chair.
Their works and examples are mouths wherewith God speaks, and warns you,
that you should imitate their customs in whose Kingdoms you succeed.

Can you suffer that they be called Heretics, and condemned for wicked men,
when the faith of the Church testifies, that they reign with Christ in Heaven,
and are exalted above all the Princes of the Earth, and that they at this time
reached you their hands from that most blessed Country, and brought you safely
to the Court of the Catholic King, and desire to turn you to the womb of the
Roman Church; wherein praying most humbly with most unspeakable groans to the
God of mercy for your salvation, to reach you the arms of Apostolical charity
to embrace most lovingly your children, so often desired, and to point out as
it were with a finger the blessed hopes of Heaven. And truly you could do no
act of greater comfort to all Nations of Christendom, then to return the
possession of those most Noble Isles to the Prince of the Apostles, whose
authority for so many ages was held in England for the defense of the Kingdom,
and divine Oracle, which will not be uneasy to do if you open your breast
(upon which depends the prosperity of those Kingdoms) to God who is knocking.
And we have so great desire of the honor and exaltation of your Royal Name,
that we wish, that you should be called through thee whole world (together with
your most Serene Father) the Freer of Great Britain, and restorer of her
ancient Religion. Whereof we will not lose all hopes, putting them in mind in
whose hands the hearts of Kings lie, and he that rules all nations of the
world, by whose Grace we will with all possible diligence labor to effect it.
And you cannot choose but acknowledge in these Letters the care of our
Apostolical charity to procure your happiness, which it will never repent us
to have written, if the reading thereof shall at leastwise stir some sparks of
Catholic religion in the heart of so Great a Prince, who we desire may enjoy
Eternal comfors, and flourish with the Glory of all virtues.

Given in Rome in the Palace of St. Peter the 20. of April 1623. In the third
of our Pontificado.
The Princes answer to the Popes Nuntio that brought him this Letter.
I Kiss his Holiness Feet for the favor and honor he does me, so much the
more esteemed, by how much the less deserved of me hitherto. And his Holiness
shall see what I do hereafter, and I think my Father will do the like. So that
his Holiness shall not repent him of what he has done.

The Prince of Wales his Reply to the Popes Letter.
Most Holy Father,
I Received the Dispatch from your Holiness with great content, and with that
respect which the piety and care wherewith your, Holiness writes, does
require: It was an unspeakable pleasure to me to read the generous exploits of
the Kings my predecessors, in whose memory, posterity has not given those
praises and Elogies of honor as were due to them: I do believe that your
Holiness has set their examples before my eyes, to the end I might imitate
them inall my actions, for in truth they have often exposed their estates and
lives for the exaltation of the holy Chair; and the courage with which they
have assaulted the enemies of the Cross of Jesus Christ, has not been less
then the care and thought which I have, to the end that the peace and
intelligence which has hitherto been wanting in Christendom, might be bound
with a true and strong concord: for as the common enemy of the peace watches
always to put hatred and dissension amongst Christian Princes, so I believe
that the glory of God requires that we should endeavor to unite them: And I do
not esteem it a greater honor to be defcended from so great Princes, then to
imitate them in the zeal of their piety. In which it helps me very much to have
known the mind and will of our thrice honored Lord and Father, and the holy
intentions of his Catholic Majesty to give a happy concurrence to so
laudable a design: for it grieves him exceedingly to see the great evils that
grow from the division of Christian Princes, which the wisdom of your Holiness
foresaw, when it judged the marriage which you pleased to design between the
Infanta of Spain and my self, to be necessary to proture so great a good; for
it is very certain, that I shall never be so extremely affectionate to any thing
in the world, as to endeavor alliance with a Prince that has the same
apprehension of the true Religion with my self: Therefore I entreat your
Holiness to believe, that I have been always very far from Novelties, or to
be a partisan of any faction against the Catholic, Apostolic Roman Religion:
But on the contrary, I have sought all occasions to take away the suspicion
that might rest upon me, and that I will employ my self for the time to come,
to have but one Religion and one Faith, seeing that we all believe in one Jesus
Christ. Having resolved in my self, to spare nothing that I have in the world,
and to suffer all manner of discommodities, even to the hazarding of my estate
and life, for a thing so pleasing unto God: It rests only that I thank your
Holiness, for the permission you have been pleased to afford me, and I pray
God to give you a blessed health and his glory after so much pains which your
Holiness takes in his Church.

Signed, Charles Steward.

Nobleman, health and the light of Divine Grace.
THe authority wherein we have understood your Nobleness to flourish in the
British Court, is accounted not only the reward of your merits, but also the
patronage of virtue; certainly an excellent renown, and every way so worthy,
that the people desire a diuturnity to be annexed unto it. But it is almost
ineffable, what an increase of glory thoroughout the world would be annexed
unto it, if by Gods favor it should become the defense of Catholic Religion.

Certainly you have gained an opportunity by which you may insert your self
into the Councels of those Princes, who obtaining an immortal name, have
attained the Celestial Kingdom.

Suffer not then (O Nobleman) this occasion presented to you from God, and
commended by the Bishop of Rome, to slip out of your hands.

You that are privy to their royal Councels cannot choose but know in what
estate the affairs of Britain at this time stand, and with what voices of the
Holy Ghost (speaking in them) they daily sound in the ears of your Princes.
What Glory would redound unto your Name, if by your exhortation and
persuasion, the English Kings should again recover their Celestial inheritance
of that Glory left unto them by their Ancestors in those Kingdoms in
abundant manner, by providing for the increase of Gods Worship, and by not only
defending, but propagating the jurisdiction of the Pontifical authority. There
have been many, and shall be hereafter, whom the bounty of Kings has enriched
with fading riches, and advanced to envied titles, and yet mindful posterity
will not celebrate your name with eternal Praises for having attained these:
but if your Councels should reduce those most powerful Kings and people unto
the bosom of the Roman Church, the name of your Nobleness would be written in
the book of the living, whom the torment of Death touches not and the
Monuments of Histories, shall place you amongst those wise men in whose
splendour Kings walked; but with what comforts in this life, and what rewards in
the life to come, God who is rich in mercy would reward you, they easily see,
who know the art, and force by which the Kingdom of heaven is conquered. It is
not only our Pontifical charity (to whose care the salvation of mankind
pertains) but also the piety of your Mother, who as she brought you into the
world, so she desires to bear you again to the Roman Church, which she
acknowledges for her mother, that moved us to desire, that you were made
Partakers of so great felicity. Therefore when our beloved son the religious
man Didacus de la Fuente, who has wisely administered the affairs of your
Princes in this City) prepared his journie for Spain, we commanded him to come
unto your Nobleness, and present these our Apostolical Letters, by which the
Greatness of our Pontifical charity, and the desire of your salvation may be
declared. Your Nobleness may therefore hear him as the interpreter of our
mind, and as one endued with these virtues which have won him the love of
foreign nations being a Catholic, and religious priest: He certainly has
reported those things of you in these parts of the world, that he is worthy to
be embraced of you with singular affection, and defended by your authority
being a servant to the Glory, and salvation of the British Kings, and people.
This thing truly will we pray for to the father of mercies that he will open to
your Nobleness the gates of his Celestial kingdom, and afford you frequent
Documents of his Clemency.

Given at Rome at St. Marie the Greater under the Ring of the Fisherman the 19.
of May. 1623. and of our Popedom the third, John Champolut.

To his Sacred Majesty abignoto.
My most Gracious King,
THese things which your Majesty did lately command to be spoken unto you, and
now to be repeated in writing, are not such as they can be made bylegal and
Judicial proofs, both because they by whose testimony they may be confirmed,
do for fear of a most potent adversary withdraw themselves. And also because
they think it a crime to come into the Ambassadors house, yea even they are
afraid to do it, who have commandment from your Majesty; but neither was it
lawful for the Ambassadors themselves to speak these things, especially not to
such as they directed, when the order of the affairs required it, because they
had never the freedom to speak unto your Majesty, and no audience was given or
granted them in the absence of tht Duke of Buckingham. An example certainly
unusual with other Kings, and never to be taken in good part, unless it be
perhaps, when the King himself wanting experience, and being of weak judgment
and no wisdom, some one, that is familiar, and inward with the King, a man
wise and circumspect, of great judgment and no less experience, supplies the
Kings place. But here, when all things go preposterously, and the King himself
being a most prudent, and experienced Prince, he that is familiar, or favorite
does in all things show himself, a rash, headie young man, a Novice in managing
of business, and to the Crown of Spain most offensive. Certainly by all just
right, this man was to be kept away from the audience of the Ambassador of the
State. We may also be bold to say, that his presence so earnestly desired of
him does argue a great fear in him, and a great distrust in him, as well of his
own upright conscience, as also the Kings wisdom. Hence therefore it is come to
pass, that your Majesty's most faithful Vassals dare not so much as indirectly
disclose their minds to the King, though they take it in very ill part, that a
very good King should be driven into such streights. And that a man pleasing
himself in his own designs, should use the favors of Princes so sinisterly,
that he does of set purpose stir up breach of friendship, and enmity between
most Mighty Kings.

Besides, who can without a discontented mind endure, that the greatest
affairs, and of greatest moment (if any in the Christian world can be so
termed) shall be ordered, or concluded at the pleasure of your Parliament, and
from thence all things carried on with a headlong violence, at his will and
pleasure, and a most deadly war to be preferred before a most happy Peace.
When as nevertheless, I am not ignorant, that not so much the restitution of
the Palatinate, as the very claim to it, will very difficultly be obtained, or
recovered by force of arms. Let your Majesty exactly consider as it uses to
do, whether this be not an evident argument of that I have said, that the
conference, or treaty about the Palatinate was taken from the Council of
State, a society of most prudent men, only forthis cause, that almost every
one of them, had with one consent approved the proposition of the most
Catholic King, and did not find in it any cause of dissolving that treaty.
Hereupon the Parliament of this Kingdom was procured by the Duke, because he
thought his plots would be most acceptable to the Puritans, not without great
injury to your Council of State, from which he fled, and disclaimed by way of
an appeal, and with such success, that we may be bold to say, that the
Parliament is now above the King; Nay, which is more, that this daring Duke
propounded many things to the Parliament in the Kings name, your Majesty being
neither acquainted with them nor willing to them. Yea and that he propounded
many things contrary to your Majesty's service. Who is there that does not see,
and commend the royal disposition of the Prince, adorned with so great
endowments, of his mind, that he does not in them all show, and approve himself
to be a very good son, of a very good King. And yet nevertheless, that the
Duke does so much presume upon his favor, that he contemns all men, as
knowing that those, who are obedient to his Highness, will also subject
themselves to his will. I would to God, he did direct those his actions, to the
good of the Prince. But that is a thing so far from the opinion of good men,
that they rather believe, that he, who has overthrown the marriage with Spain,
will be of no less power to the breaking of any other marriage, and that is it
which many do prophecy.

They knew in Spain, that very same day, that he had received Letters from the
most illustrious Prince Palatine, that he caused the procuration to be revoked,
and in a few days after, when the coming of the foresaid Princes Secretary,
and the confirmation of his hope of having his Daughter married to her
Highness son, all things were utterly dashed in pieces. Let your Majesty have
a care of your self, and the Prince, and foresee the hurts, and damages, which
a man of such a turbulent humor may stir up; whose headie spirit your Majesty
says you have noted, and have desired to mittigate.

A man (I say) that is ambitious of popular air, as plainly appeared in
Parliament, when the casting of all odious matter upon your Majesty, he did
arrogate the thanks of all things that were acceptable, to himself, being
styled the redeemer of his country. I say again, a man that has envied so
great a good to the Christian world, and principally to the kingdoms of
England and Spain, having used some certain means, which do argue, that he
aimed at such an end, as many already do fear, and to prophecy in it the worst
event that can be, if the Puritans desire a kingdom (which they do against
their wills) they wish it not to the most illustirous Prince, the best and true
Heir of your Majesty, but to the Prince Palatine, whose spy and Scout
Mansfelt is, what show soever he makes. He that makes these things known to
your Majesty discharges the part of a good man, as well toward God, as your
Majesty, and the illustirous Prince, whom it now stands in hand to foresee
the vengeance of God provided by the Dukes plots, and the fury of the
Parliament, there having been so many, and so great testimonies published
against Spain contrary contrary to truth, so many, and so frequent infamous
Libels begotten and brought forth, and many such other things so full of
bitterness, and ignominy, that they cannot be read even of our enemies,
without some taint upon the English Nation.

It is mostapparent, and stories will testify, that here Leagues have been
broken by the will and pleasure of them, whom it especially concerns to
provide for your peace, and quiet, and to wish from the bottom of their hearts,
that after many, and these most happy, years, that Motto of yours (blessed be
the Peacemakers) might be verified in Letter of the person of your Majesty,
and to propound the same Counsel to the most illustrious Prince to be imitated,
which your Majesty has done to the whole world to be commended, and admired.
A happy Prince will he be, if he comes, and succceeds peaceably into the
haereditarie possession of his kingdom, and which will be of no less advantage
to him, having his peace established with those Princes, whose friendship and
amity your Majesty has procured, and deserved. He would certainly love and
commend those that had given him those Counsels of peace. Peace and
tranquillity are by haereditarie right devolved to the most illustrious
Prince, in as much as he is born of the Father, who has with so much industry
procured them, not only to this Island, but to the continent also, esteeming
them at a higher value, then his kingdoms themselves.

Which since it is thus, and that the blood of his Father, which is in him, and
the love wherewith he is carried toward your Majesty, and the experience of
this your most happy Government, and that great example wherewith your
Majesty has drawn, and won the Christian world to an admiration, and love of
you, did all direct the most illustrious Prince with a kind of connatural
motion to the same Counsel, and purpose of peace, as might have heretofore been
likewise hoped. Certainly this Machination is very strong, violent, and mighty,
which does suddenly labor to turn him into a clean contrary course.

And questionless if the very entrance into a war, the war it self if it want
justice, it will want also happy success. It cannot be unknown to your
Majesty, that the Duke of Buckingham carries himself so lofty; that he would
have all men persuaded that he has, and does exercise a kind of dominion over
the will of your Majesty, and of his Highness. All things shall be made
manifest to your Majesty, if you will have them so; for there are not means
wanting, whereby you may free your vassal from fear and diffidence, who will
otherwise dare nothing, nor say nothing, which certainly appears so far to be
true, that when all things standing as they do, it is an easy matter to find
who will speak against your Majesty, yet there is none that dare speak against
the Duke.

Let your Majesty call some certain men unto you, and sist out of them, the
opinion of the more moderate Parliament, and enquire of those that come out of
Spain, who did first give the first cause of falling out? whether the
Complaints against the King of Spain be true, or no? whether that foresaid King
were not desirous to satisfy the desire of the Prince his Highness? Whether
he did not faithfully endeavor to effect the marriage? Whether the Duke of
Buckingham did not many things against the authority and reverence due to the
most illustrious Prince? Whether he was not wont to be sitting, whilst the
Prince stood, and was in presence, and also having his feet resting upon
another seat, after an undecent manner? Whether when the Prince was uncovered,
whilst the Queen, and Infanta, looked out at the Windows he uncovered his
head, or no? Whether sitting at the Table with the Prince he did not behave
himself unreverently? Whether he were not wont to come in to the Princes
Chamber with his clothes half on, so that the doors could not be opened to
them that came to visit the Prince from the King of Spain, the Door-keepers
refusing to go in for modesties sake? Whether he did not call the Prince by
ridiculous names? Whether he did not dishonor and profane the Kings Palace
with base and contemptible women? Whether he did not diverse obscene things, and
used not immodest gesticulations and wanton Tricks with Players in the presence
of the Prince? Whether he did not violate his faith given to the Conde O
livares? Whether he did not presently communicate his discontents, offenses and
complaints to the Ambassadors of other Princes? Whether in doing of his
business, he did not use frequent threatenings unto the Catholic Kings
Ministers, and to Apostolical Nuns? Whether he did not affect to fit at Plays
presented in the Kings Palace after the manner and example of the King, and
Prince, being not contented with the honor that is ordinarily given to the
High Steward, or Major domo of the Kings house. Besides all these things which
have heretofore been told your Majesty, there is yet this more, that is new:

That the Duke of Buckingham (with what intention let others judge) has
divulged in Parliament some secret Treaty negotiated betwixt your Majesty and
the King of Spain touching the affairs of Holland; the secrecy whereof,
nevertheless your Majesty had so recommended, that besides the King, and the
Could of Olivares, no man in Spain knew of it.

If the Duke do not appear guilty of all these things, let him be still your
Majesty's most faithful servant, and let your Majesty yet confer upon him
greater Honors, if you can. For I would have these things conceived to be
spoken for the security of your Majesty; not for the hurt of him, to whom I
wish prosperity, if by him the Christian world might be in prosperity.

It only remains, that your Majesty will be pleased to take in good part
this my service and obedience showed to your Commandments.

To the King, ab ignoto.
Best, and most excellent King,
YOu will wonder that he who at first protests to be neither Papist nor
Puritan, Spaniard nor Hollander, or yet in any delirium fit, should presume in
this Libel-like way, to lay down to your Majesty the strong zeal he bears to
the safety of your Majesty, and his Country, by showing in this dark Tablet
(drawn by the worst Painter) the common opinion of all those which are not
possessed as above.

They say, the business of greatest consequence, that ever your Majesty
handled, is now at point to go well, or ill. The marriage, or none, and (as it
is carried) a present War, or a continued Peace. The match of your son, they
wish you may perfect in your own time, and think that for the quiet of your
self and Kingdoms, the shortest time the best: And that this already traced
will far sooner piece, then any new one have beginning and accomplishment.

They fear this suspension carried by Killegrew was brought by Buckingham, not
for what he pretends, and plainly say, It was not only to prevent his
Highness marriage there, but any where.

Whereby, 1. His particular greatness may still stand absolute.

2. His Wife, and Tribe still present the Princess person.

3. And your Majesty be, and remain their Pupil.

The Parliament so much urged, they say, is to be a marrying his Mightiness
unto the Common Weal, that as your Majesty is his good Father, It may be his
Mother, and so he stand not only by the King, but by the People, and popular
humor, that he has lately so earnestly courted, and especially from those who
are noted to be of the most troubled humor.

How your Majesty should gain upon a Parliament they cannot imagine, seeing
all are resolved to sell your Courtesies at the dearest rate both by ill words,
and for double as much again, the humor of it being so inconstant, that twenty
to one, but those very tongues, which in the last did cry War, War, War, will
now curse him that urges for one poor Subsidy to raise a War. And miserable
is he, that is to make a War, or to defend against it, with money that is to be
given, and gathered from them.

They say, our Great Duke bath certainly a brave desire to War, but in that
also, he has some great end of enriching himself, which he too well loves,
being carried away with that sweet sound, how Nottingham gained yearly during
that ficknesse 40000 l. by his Admirals place; but what his Majesty gained,
they find not in the Exchequer or Kingdom.

Somewhat also they fear this his Graces precipitate humor, and change of
humor, has of pride, to show his power as great here, as is Olivares his
there, as also of revenge against him in particular. For were it love to his
now much beloved Country, they say, there was as much reason for breach both
of the Match, and Peace when the Parliament urged it, as there is now.

They say, There is a rumor of his Graces, a match for his Mary with the young
Palatine. It is no Gorgon; and will concern his Highness, if they that are now
our best friends the Hollanders should change their Copy.

In this his Highness coming off from Spain, they say, He has advised him to
no worse then he did himself; for how many did he deflour, abuse, and cosen
with marriage, by his grace in Court, and power with your Majesty?

In short, your Subjects that have sense of your estate, do most earnestly
beseech your Majesty, to have more especial care of your own preservation,
then ordinarily you have, both in respect of the desperate staggering which
their Priests now stand in, and of your own Phaeton himself, who in truth
wants nothing of man enough but a good nature, and being in custom to carry
all with a high hand, must be desperate if he fail in any Punto of his violent
will.

We know your Majesty according to the sweetness and virtue of your Nature,
agreeing with Gods blessed Will, has long preserved your people in all peace
and plenty. And all good and sensible people pray you even for Gods sake not
to be cousened of your own life and liberty. Oh be not mislead to trouble your
own Kingdoms quiet, but that after many and many a happle year you may die
happily in peace.

To his Sacred Majesty, ab ignoto.
May it please his most excellent Majesty to consider,
THat this great opposition against the Duke of Buckingham is stirred up and
maintained by such, who either maliciously, or ignorantly and concurrently seek
the debasing of this free Monarchy, which because they find not yet ripe to
attempt against the King himself, they endeavor it through the Dukes side.
These men though agreeing in one mischief, yet are of diverse sorts and humors,
viz.

1. Meddling, and busy persons, who took their first hint at the beginning of
King James, when the union was treated of in Parliament. That learned King gave
too much way to those popular speeches, by the frequent proof he had of his
great abilities in that kind.

Since the time of H. 6. these Parliamentary discoursings were never suffered,
as being the certain symptoms of subsequent rebellions, civil Wars, and the
dethroning of our Kings. But these last 20 years most of the Parliament men
seek to improve the reputation of their wisdoms by these Declamations, and no
honest Patriot dare oppose them, lest he incur the reputation of a Fool, or a
Coward in his Countries Cause.

2. Covetous Landlords, Inclosers, Depopulators, and Justices of the Peace, who
have got a habit of Omniregencie, and an hope to extend the same against the
King in Parliament, as they do on his Subjects in the Country. Hereby the King
loses 24000 l. in every whole Subsidy; for Anno 1600. it was 80000 l. and now
it is but 56000 l. which comes by the decay of the yeomandry, who were three
and four pound men. And these Gentlemen (most of them of the Parliament) do
ease themselves to afflict those who are the true Commons, and yet persuade
them, that the grievances are caused by the Duke, and the ill government of the
King.

3. Recusants and Church Papists, whose hatred is irreconcilable against the
Duke for the breach of the Spanish Match. The French Lady, though as zealous a
Catholic, does not please him, for they were tied to Spain by their hopes of
a change of Religion that way. All the Priests are sent from the Spanish
Dominions, and the sons and daughters of the Papists remain as hostages of
their fidelities in the Colleges and Nunneries of the King of Spain. And
though the Papists have no place in the house of Commons, yet privately they
aggravate all scandals against the Duke, to kindle a separation between the
King and his people, and avert them from enabling the King to resist, or be
avenged of our great enemy. Remember the course held by these men in the
Parliament of undertakers; also Dr. Eglesham and all the Priests daily practice
libelling against all great men about the King.

4. Needy and indebted persons in both Houses, who endeavor by these
Parliamentary stirs not so much the Dukes overthrow, as a rebellion, which
they hope will follow if it be not done. This is much to be suspected, as well
by their Calumniations against his Majesty, as for their own wants; many of
them being outlawed, and not able to show their heads, but in Parliament time
by privilege thereof, and they know, that there are enough to follow them in
the same mischief.

5. Puritans and all other Sectaries, who though scarce two of them agree in
what they would have, yet they all in general are haters of Government. They
begun in Parliament about Anno 23. Eliz. and spit their venom not only against
the Bishops, but also against the Lord Chancellor Hatton, and others, the
Queens favorites, and Councillors, as they do now against the Clergy and the
Duke. But their main coffeehouse is against the Kings Government, which they
would have extinguished in matters Ecclesiastical, and limited in Temporal.
This is a fearful and important Consideration, because it pretends Conscience
and Religion, and they now more deadly hate the Duke, because he shows
himself to be no Puritan, as they hoped he would at his return from Spain.

6. Malcontents censured or decourted for their deserts, as the kindred and
dependants of the Earl of Suffolk, and of Sir Henry Yelverton, Coke, Lake,
Middlesex, though all of them (the last excepted) were dejected by King James
without any Concurrencie of the Duke. Others because they are not preferred, as
they do imagine that they deserve, as the Lord Say, Earl of Clare, Sir John
Eliot, Seldom, and Glanvile, Sir Dudley Diggs, and the Bishops of Nerwich and
Lincoln. These, and many others, according to the nature of envy, look upon
every one with an evil eye, especially upon the Duke, who either has, or does
not prefer them to those places, or retain them in them, which their ambition
expects.

7. Lawyers in general, for that (as Sir Edward Cook could not but often
express) our Kings have upholden the power of their Prerogatives, and the
rights of the Clergy, whereby their comings in have been abated. And therefore
the Lawyers are fit ever in Parliaments to second any Complaint against both
Church, and King, and all his servants, with their Cases, Antiquities, Records,
Statutes, Presidents, and Stories. But they cannot, or will not call to mind,
that never any Nobleman in favor with his Sovereign was questioned in
Parliament, except by the King himself in case of Treason, or unless it were
in the nonage, and tumultuous times of Rich. 2. Hen. 6. or Edw. 6. which
happened to the destruction both of the King and Kingdom. And that not to
exceed our own, and Fathers memories, in King Hen. 8. time Wolsies exorbitant
power and pride, and Cromwels contempt of the Nobility and the Laws, were not
yet permitted to be discussed in Parliament, though they were most odious and
grievous to all the Kingdom. And that Leicester's undeserved favor, and
faults; Hatton's insufficiency, and Rawleigh's insolence far exceeded, what yet
has been (though most falsely) objected against the Duke: yet no Lawyer durst
abet, nor any man else begin any Invectives against them in Parliament.

8. The Merchants and Citizens of London convinced (not by the Duke, but) by
Cranfield and Ingram, to have deceived the King of Imposts and Customs, and
deservedly fearing to be called to account for undoing all the other Cities and
good Towns, and the poor Colonie of Virginia, as also for transporting of our
silver into the East Indies; these vent their malice upon the Duke in the
Exchange, Paul's, Westminster Hall, with their suggestions, and therein they
wound, both to Subjects and strangers the honor of his Majesty, and his
proceedings.

9. Innovators, Plebicolae, and King-haters. At the latter end of Queen
Elizabeth it was a phrase to speak, yea to pray for the Queen and State. This
word (State) was learned by our neighborhood and Commerce with the
Low Countries, as if we were, or affected to be governed by States. This the
Queen saw, and hated. And the old Earl of Oxford his Propositions at her death,
they awakened King James to prevent this humor, and to oppose the conditions
and limitations presented unto him by the Parliaments.

The Lawyers, Citizens, and Western men (who are most hot infected with
Puritanisme) stood strong against him under a color of Parliaments, and
Parliamentary privileges. His Majesty therefore strengthened himself ever
with some Favorite, as whom he might better trust then many of the Nobility
tainted with this desire of Oligarchie. It behooves without doubt his Majesty
to uphold the Duke against them, who if he be but decourted, it will be the
Corner stone on which the demolishing of his Monarchy will be builded. For, if
they prevail with this, they have hatched a thousand other demands to pull the
feathers of the Royalty, they will appoint him Councillors, Servants,
Alliances, Limits of his expenses, Accounts of his Revenue, chiefly if they can
(as they mainly desire) they will now dazzle him in the beginning of his reign.

10. King James and King Charles lastly, are the Dukes Accusers; (my meaning
is, with all humble reverence to their Honors, and Memories, and to speak in
the sense of the House of Commons) both their Majesty's are Conjuncta Persona
in all the aspersions that are laid upon the Duke. For instance, The
Parliaments money destined for the Wars, spent in the Treaties, Messages,
Ambassadors, and Entertainments of the Kings marriage, and the burial of his
Father, and the War in the name of the Count Palatine, the Breach of both the
Treaties, which then Canonized the Duke, but now is made evidence against him;
the Honors and Offices conferred upon him by King James, That his Majesty
might with his own Councels direct their managing, the setting forth of the
Navy, though to the Duke's great charge by both their Commandments; the Match
with France, and generally whatsoever has not been successeful to men's
expectations. All these, though the Acts of the Kings are imputed to the Duke,
who if he suffer for obeying his Sovereigns, the next attempt will be to call
the King to account for any thing he undertakes, which does not prosperously
succeed as all men would desire it.

If it please his Majesty to remove, and set aside all these disadvantages, He
shall find the Charge laid against the Duke will prove very empty, and of small
moment. And for them, if his Majesty and the Duke's Grace think it no
impeachment to their Honors, all that the Parliament has objected against the
Duke, is pardoned at the Kings Coronation, which benefit every poor Subject
enjoys. Three things only excepted which may most easily be answered.

Mr. Chapter Th. to the Duke of Buckingham.
My Lord,
IT is intimated to your Lordship, first, that you would procure his Majesty
to desire the Lords to choose six (or so many as you shall think fit) of whom
they have most confidence to attend him to morrow morning, to whom his Majesty
may be pleased to declare; That he has endeavored to divert the charges
against your Lordship, because his Majesty has had sound knowledge, and
experience of the service, and fidelity (though in outward show the contrary
might justly appear) and because also he saw, it was urged with a great deal of
private spleen, and perhaps not without some Papisticall device of troubling
his Majesty's business in Parliament, but seeing no suite, or persuasion could
prevail to appease the distempered course, his Majesty is now forced, and so
pleased to reveal some secrets, and Arcana of State, which otherwise in the
wisdom of Kings were unfit to be opened. Here his Majesty may let them know,
that the King his Father finding the Palatinate more then in danger to be lost,
and after his Majesty being in Spain, and there deluded, and his abode, and
return, both unsafe. It was a necessity of State to sweeten, and content the
Spaniards with a hope of any thing that might satisife, and redeem those
engagements, and therefore willed your Lordship to yield discreetlie to what
you should find they most desired, and this was chiefly the point of religion;
so as in this and all of the like kind, your Lordship (upon his Majesty's
knowledge) was commanded, and but the instrument trusted by your Master in this
exigent, or (if you will) extremity. And this with other more Potent overtures
(such as your Lordship best understands) may Cancel all those objections of
that nature. Upon this same ground, though not in so high a degree, the sending
of the ships to Rochel may be excused (and this is not the least fault objected
in the opinion of the wisest.) Touching the vast creation of Nobility his
Majesty may ask those six Lords (whereof perchance some of them may be
concerned in this article,) whether they conceive any reason of King James his
doing herein; to which I suppose, they will stand mute. Then his Majesty may
say, I will tell you, and therein discover a truth, and a secret of State. My
Father who was born a King, and had long experience of that Regiment,
especially more traversed in this point, then perhaps ever any King, found
that this State inclined much to Popularitie, a thing apparent universallie in
all the Courts, viz. in that of Star Chamber, which was at first erected to
restrain the insolence of Great men, in great outrages, but now for every
petty offense, the meanest Tennant may be bold to call thither his Lord. A
thing also appearing in the saucy approaches of the Puritans upon the Bishops
etc; and plainly in the boldness of the house of Commons against the Kings
pattents, and edicts, which in all good times (out of their necessity) have
been powerful. And especially this humor has been comforted by the sturdie
example of the Neighbor States of the Low Countries, as in their insolences
in the East Indies etc. From this place an enticing voice has sounded in our
ears of liberty and freedom, though indeed a feigned voice, and (but in
sound) unsound. I say when the king my Father had well beheld these things, he
could not foresee a remedy more proper, or easier, as being unserviceable and
in his own gripe, then to enlarge the number of his Nobles, that these being
dispersed into several Counties might as lambs of Soveraigntie, in protection
of their own degrees, and at their own charge inure the people with respect,
and obedience to greatness; and yet not to amate, and discourage them, he
thought good to raise some near, or of their own rank, whereby they might see
themselves in possibility of the like honor, if either by virtue, wealth, or
honesty they make themselves worthy. This I protest was a child of my Fathers
best judgment in this point, and the Duke but the instrument thereof. And if
you say, that there was money many times given for these Honors, nay if you
say, that money has been given for places of Clergy, and Judicature; I pray
take this of me, that this is so in all other Countries, as in France, and
Spain. And those Councels seem a little to smile at our dullness, that we have
so lately apprehended their soundness herein; for (say they) when men pay well
for such places, it is the best kind of security for their honesties,
especially when sailing in their duty, they shall be sure to be as much
punished as they were advanced. Howbeit I am not satisfied in this opinion. And
if it be said that the King should have had the money, which the Duke took to
his own use; I believe this last is more, then any can prove, neither will I
deliver what I know therein. Howsoever, it matters not much being no popular
disbursment. Only this I will say, that I know the Dukes particular service,
and affection to me, and that he, and his will lay down themselves, and all
they have at my Feet. Neither is this bare opinion, since the Duke alone has
dibursed, and stands engaged more for my affairs, and the States, then any
Number of Noblemen of England whatsoever, and therefore there is reason, that
from a King he would receive his own and more.

And now (my Lords) since I have thus far opened a Kings Cabinet unto you at
least by the measure of this foot of answer, you may discover, what may be said
concerning that great body, and bulk of accusations of the Highest kind made
against the Duke. I desire you would take it to heart, remembering, that it is
your King, that speaks this, who therefore expects your service, and love
herein, and who will requite the same assuredly; hoping you will believe me
indeed, and do accordingly indeed, and that you will also rest assured, that my
spirit is not so young (though a young King) as that I would bring this
testimony in mine own wrong, were not that I say, true in my own knowledge. And
being so, you also will grant, that it is not for a King to use his Servant,
and Instrument as he does his Horses, which being by hard riding in his service
foundred, and lamed, to turn them off to grass, or to the Cart. I must
therefore in right of the King my Fathers Honor and my own, protect a man
(though I have said justly seeming guilty, yet) in mine own knowledge
innocent, and free as I have delivered it; will you then deny the King to
favor whom he please, which the King has never denied you, that are his
subjects? will you control me your Head and Governor in things wherein your
selves have taken liberty uncontroled? would you that I should require account
of your liberality? nay of all your failings, which are liable to my
authority? well commend me to my Lords, and tell them, that if any thing had
been formerly done amiss by others, I have power, and will to redress it, and
to prevent the like. I speak it in the word of a King, neither Lords, nor
Commons can desire of me any thing that is honest, which I am not ready to give
them. Let not therefore the world by these mistakings make Table-talk any
longer of your King and his negotiations? nay of his secrets and necessities;
for alas what great wrong, or indignity can the Glory of the State receive,
then that the private grudges of subjects (accusing to the ignorant, when in
their consciences they could excuse) should be the business of our Parliament,
and that the King himself should be forced to appear as a party? No doubt this
is a Cocatrice egg, that crafty heads of our enemies seek to hatch, whilst
the weighty affairs that in present concern the Honor, and welfare of the
King and State, and the peace of all Christendom are by us utterly neglected.

I end, hoping your Lordship (now privy to these things) will be tender of your
Sovereigns honor, and will so satisfy, and treat with the rest, that those
particular janglings may be by some other course, and in some other place and
time discussed and determined, that so our minds and time may be employed in
the care of better things, which earnestly invoke our aid at this instant.

Thus much spoken, or written, or the like, (for I seek but to awaken your
Lordships higher spirit and invention) I conceive it may get this effect: That
these 6. Lords won by these reasons, and by other the Kings invitations, may
deliver to the House, that for their parts, they have received unexpected
satisfaction in those greatest points of the accusation against your Lordship,
and of such secret nature as are not fit to be published without further
deliberation. Wherefore since it pleased their Lordships, to have made choice
of them to be trusted in this employment, they have faithfully served
accordingly, and do upon their Honors freely, and without any engagement or
respect, protest the fame. And therefore humbly desire their Lordships, that
they would entreat his Majesty to be President in advice with their Lordships:
What further were to be done in this private Contention betwixt your Lordship
and the Lord Digbie; which obtained, something may then follow for your
Lordships good, by yielding up that Cause into the Kings hands. And his
Majesty has great reason to bend it that way, because it is conceived, that
the Lords will be loath to admit the King to be supreme Judge, and Accuser;
which point will much touch his Majesty. And his Majesty were better give
some ease to the Lord Digbie, then permit that dispute.

And now for my self, I beseech your Lordship to pardon my strange boldness; I
know I am a mere stranger to you, and if ever you have heard of me, it must be
as of a friend of such you then did not love. I know it shows me a medler in
business, or an insinuator, which are suspicions, that may distaste you, and
make you suspect my pretenses, though they were not altogether witless. I know
this disadvantage, and am in my own nature offended for putting my self thus
into your notions. But yet I resolved to undergo all this; First, because you
made my Brother a Captain in Ireland, who had otherwise perished. Next, for the
favor you did to my Lord of Northumberland, and the retiring of disfavour from
my Lord of Sommerset. And lastly, for your firm hand, that advanced the now
Lord Treasurer. To all which Lords I am familiarly known, and bound. But
(nearest to you) your Lordship may hear of me from the Lord Treasurer.

I am confident of your Lordships noble interpretation, since I seek no ends,
no acquaintance, no other thanks, being one that have no Court-suits to your
Lordship; but being one that loves not ruins, (which my friends have tasted)
nor that the public should wrestle with a private Inturn of Spleen. And I
offer it but as a simplicity, yet with good will enough; for what can a man,
that is not privy to the Elements of State, demonstrate any conclusion thereof;
yet I hear sometimes how the world goes as other men do.

I conceive I have said something to your Lordship, and though perhaps short,
yet enough to occasion, and stir up your deeper thoughts. I also may have
deeper, but also I know, that little pinnes of wood do sustain the whole
building. More I could have said touching the other points, but these greatest
elided, the fall of the others may be easily directed. What I have said against
those objections I touched, does arise from grounds of truth, and they must
win, and prevail, and my conceit is fitted to the Kings part, and to the
occasions now on foot.

I humbly cease your Lordship further trouble, and wish you all good, desiring
your Lordship also to pardon my tedious and hasty scribled hand.

Your Lordships unknown servant, Chapter Th.
Postscript.
YOur Lordship shall be pleased to take off some part of my boldness, and
impute it to the obligation and service I owe this worthy Lady, the Bearer.



To Count Gondomar.
My Lord,
I Thought my hands bound that I could no sooner have occasion to write unto
you, being forced against my will to delay my writing from day to day in
expectation of the news of your arrival at that Court, assuring my self, that I
should then receive from you some ground whereupon to write. But after a long
expense of time before that I could hear of your arrival, and in the Packet
that his Majesty's Ambassador sent thereafter, receiving no Letters nor word
from you as I expected, I do now by these break my long filence unto you.

As for news from hence, I can in a word assure you, that they are in all
points, as your heart could wish: for here is a King, a a Prince, and a
faithful friend and servant unto you, besides a number of your other good
friends, that long so much for the happy accomplishment of this match, as every
day seems a year unto us, and I can assure you in the word of your honest
friend, that we have a Prince here, that is so sharp set upon the business, as
it would much comfort you to see it, and her there to hear it. Here are all
things prepared upon our parts; Priests and Recusants all at liberty: all the
Roman Catholics well satisfied, and which will seem a wonder unto you, our
Prisons are emptied of Priests and Recusants, and filled with zealous Ministers
for preaching against the Match; for no man can sooner now mutter a word in the
Pulpit though indirectly against it, but he is presently catched, and set in
straight prison. We have also published Orders both for the Universities, and
the Pulpits, that no man hereafter shall meddle, but to preach Christ
crucified; Nay it shall not be lawful hereafter for them to rail against the
Pope, or the Doctrine of the Church of Rome further then for edification of
ours; and for proof hereof you shall herewith receive the orders set down, and
published. But if we could hear as good news from you, we should think our
selves happy men; but alas! Now that we have put the ball at your feet,
although we have received a comfortable Dispatch from his Majesty's Ambassador
there; yet from all other parts in the world, the effects appear directly
contrary. For Mr. Gage brings us news from Rome, that the dispensation there is
at a stand, except a number of new Conditions be granted, which we never
dreamed of, and some of them can tend to no other end, but to bring our Master
in jealousy with the greatest part of his Subjects; nay which is strangest of
all, we find some points yielded unto by us, (which would have given the Pope
good satisfaction) to be concealed from him by the King your Masters ministers
there. We were never more troubled to put a good face upon an ill Game, then we
were upon Gage's arrival here, which in your phrase is to put a good sauce to
an unsavory dish.

For the whole world being in expectation of bringing the Dispensation with
him, we are now forced to make him give it out here to all his friends, that
it is past in Rome, and sent from thence to Spain. And from Brussels we find,
that notwithstanding, both of the King your Masters promises, and undertaking
of the Infanta there, who has long ago acknowledged to have had power from the
Emperor for granting of this long-talked of Cessation, yet now after
innumerable delays on her part, Heidelbergh is besieged by Count Tilley, and
that at such a time, as his Majesty cannot imagine what ground or shadow of
excuse can be found for his Commission. For the Treaty has been twice reformed
at her desire, and all the Auxiliaries such as Brunswick and Mansfelt have
taken another course: His Majesty's son in law staying privately in Sedan,
ready to obey all his Majesty's directions; and the places in the Palatinate,
which are not already in his enemies hands, being only possessed by his
Majesty's Soldiers. So as now if the War shall continue, it must be directly
between the Emperor, and our Master, his Majesty having sent a Commandment to
his Ambassador at Brussels, that if Tilley will needs go on with that siege,
that he return hither with all speed. For his Majesty in honor cannot endure,
that whilst he is treating for a cessation of Arms at Bruxels, the Wars should
go on in the Palatinate, especially when they have no body to invade, but his
Majesty's own Subjects and servants; And indeed his Majesty thinks he is very
ill dealt withal, for all that great sincerity and candor, wherewith he has
constantly carried himself from the very beginning of this business, that no
less can satisfy the Emperors revenge then the utter extermination of his
children both of honor and inheritance, and not without a direct breach of his
former promise, avowedly set down in his last Letter to his Majesty.

And now let me I pray you in the name of your faithful friend, and Servant,
beseech you to set apart all partiality in this case, and that you would be
pleased indifferently to consider of the streights we are driven into, if the
Emperor shall in this fashion conquer the Palatinate, the ancient inheritance
of his Majesty's children: what can be expected but a bloody and
unreconcileable war between the Emperor, and my Master wherein the King of
Spain can be an Auxiliarie to the Emperor against any other party but his
Majesty. And therefore as my Master lately offered to the Infanta for
satisfaction of her desire, that in case the Auxiliaries would not be contented
with reason, but still perturbe the treaty, he offered in that case to assist
the Emperor and her against them; so can he in justice expect no less of the
King your Master, that if the Emperor will contrary to all promises both by
his Letters, and Ambassadors, proceed in his conquest, and refuse the
cessation, that the King your Master will in that case, and in so just a
quarrel assist him against the Emperor, in imitation of the King my Masters
just and real proceedings in the business from the beginning, who never
looked (as you can well be witness) to the rising, or faling hopes of his son
in Law his fortunes, but constantly keep on that course, that was most agreeable
to honor and justice, to the peace of Christendom; and for the fastening of a
firm and indissoluble knot of amity, and alliance betwixt the king your Master
and him, which was begun in the time of the treaty with France, and then
broken at your desire, that we might embrace this alliance with you; you are
the person, that many times before your departure hence, besought his Majesty
once to suffer himself to be deceived by Spain. We therefore do now expect to
find that great respect to honor in the King your Master, that he will not
take any advantage by the changing of fortune, and success of time, so to
alter his actions, as may put his Honor in the terms of interpretation. You
see how all the rest of Christendom, envy and malign this match and wished
conjunction; How much greater need then has it of a hasty and happy
dispatch? And what comfort can the Prince have in her, when her friends shall
have utterly ruined his Sister, and all her babes? you remember how your self
praised his Majesty's wisdom in the election of so fit a Minister, as Sir
Richard Weston in this business, but you saw what desperate Letters he writes
from time to time of their cold and unjust treating with him in this business;
you could not but wonder at any spark of Patience could be left us here; and to
conclude this point in a word, we ever received comfortable words from Spain,
but find such contrary effects from Bruxelles, together with our intelligences
from all other parts of the world, as all our hopes are not only cold, but
quite extinguished here. Thus far for the By, and yet such a By, as may put by
the main, if it be not well and speedily prevented. As to the Main, which is
the match, his Majesty, and we all here, thought we had done our part, and put
the ball at your foot, when we agreed upon the twenty, and five Atticles
more: whereupon as your self often answered, and assured us the best Divines in
Spain concluded that the Pope, not only might, but ought to grant a
dispensation to this marriage, but now we are surcharged with a number of new
Articles from Rome, and in the mean time the Dispensation is as far off as ever
it was.

His Majesty hopes that you are not ignorant, that the treaty is between him,
and your Master; He has no treaty with Rome, neither lies it in his way to
dispute with them upon this question; yet that his readiness to embrace your
Masters friendship may the better appear, he is contented to yield to so many
of their demands, as either his Conscience, Honor, or safety can permit, if
so the King your Master shall think it necessary. But on the other part we
three remember, that when as you first moved this match unto him, and persuaded
him to break off with France, you then promised, that he should be pressed to
nothing in this business, that should not be agreeable to his conscience, and
honor, and stand with the love of his people. As to the particular Articles
new added at Rome, I will not clogg this paper with them, which I fear without
them, will be too troublesome unto you. For what his Majesty's opinion is of
them, his Majesty's Ambassador there will particularly acquaint you.

But whereas the Pope desires in the end of his Articles, that he may see what
ponum publicum, the King our Master will grant unto, that may persuade to grant
this dispensation, I will remit it to your conscience and knowledge, whether if
the favors his Majesty daily grants to those of his religion, and is resolved
still to continue, if not to increase them, if they shall by their good
behavior deserve it, be not a real bonum publicum, considering that if the
match should break off (which God forbid) his Majesty would be importunatly
urged by his people (to whose assistance he must have his recourse) to give
life and execution to all the penal Laws now hanging upon their heads.

It only rests now, that as we have put the ball to your foot, you take a good,
and speedy resolution there to hasten a happy conclusion of this match. The
Prince is now two and twenty years of age, and so a year more, then full ripe,
for such a business: the King our Master longs to see an issue proceed from
his Loins; and I am sure you have reason to expect more friendship from the
posterity that shall proceed from him, and that little Angel, your Infanta then
from his Majesty's Daughters Children. Your friends here, are all discomforted
with this long delay: your enemies are exasperated, and irritated thereby; and
your neighbors, that envy the felicity of both Kings, have the more leisure
to invent new Plots for the Cross, and hinderance of this happy business; And
for the part of your true friend and servant Buckingham, I am become odious
already, and counted a betrayer both of King and Country.

To conclude all with; I will use a similitude of hawking (which you will
easily understand, being a great Faulkoner;) I told you already that the Prince
is (God be thanked) extremely sharp set upon this Match; and you know that a
Hawke, when she is first dressed, and made ready to fly, having a great will
upon her, if the Faulkoner do not follow it at that time, she is in danger to
be dulled for ever after.

Take heed therefore, lest in the fault of your delays there, Our Prince, and
Faulcon gentle, (that you know was thought slow enough, to begin to be eager
after the Foeminine prey) become not so dull upon these delays, as in short
time hereafter, he will not stoop to the Lure, though it were thrown out to him.

And here I will end to you my sweet friend, as I do in my prayers to God,
(Only in thee is my trust,) and say as it is written on the outside of the
Pacquets, Haste, Haste, Post-haste.

Conde de Condomar to the Duke, 13. Febr. 1625.
Most Excellent Sir,
AT last Sir, the Earl of Gondomar goes for England; There will be many good
discourses made in Holland about this voyage: But the truth is, that the
intention of his journey is not to offend any one, but only to desire, and
procure peace, and the public good. And only with this intent the King my
Master Commands me to go thither, and I go with a great deal of joy as well for
this as for to kiss his Majesty's and his Highness his hands, and your
Excellencies in particular.

And therefore I do appoint for the field of our Battle your Excellencies
Gallerie over the Thames, where I hope your Excellency shall see, that the
Earl of Gondomar is an honest man, and that he has been, is, and ever will be,
a faithful and true servant and friend to Sir George Villiers Duke of
Buckingham, whom God preserve many happy years.

The Countess my Wife, and my self, kiss my Lady the Countess, and my Lady
Duchess their hands.

Your Excellencies Constant and faithful servant, Gondomar.

Padre Maestre at Rome to the Spanish Ambassador in England, 12. June, 1621.
My Lord,
I Have received two Letters from your Lordship, the one of the 15th. of March
brought me by Mr. George Gage, and the other of the 30. of April which came by
the Ordinary. In both which Letters I have received a special favor from you,
and much comfort. The coming of Mr. Gage has given me infinite contentment,
then which there could nothing have happened more fitly and to the purpose, for
the matter which is in negotiation, nor any man have come hither that could
better advance the business then he, as well in respect of his good affection,
as for his wisdom and dexterity in all things. And if the King of Great
Britain will withal help now a little, the business will be quickly done, and
in a good manner. I beseech your Lordship preach to him a Christian Sermon as
is most needful: for there comes from thence diverse ways such reports thither,
that I am ashamed, and out of countenance in the streets as I go, and they do
me a favor, that they do not stone me, knowing that I am treating, and
laboring this business at the same time, when the poor Catholics are so
cruelly used in England, Scotland, and Ireland. And when I excuse it, that it
is not by the Kings order, but by the abuse and malice of some ill affected
Ministers, it will not be received; neither do they want Replies. Besides,
there is a rumor all over Rome, that the King in a Speech which he made at the
beginning of the Parliament, affirmed publicly, That for all this marriage
with Spain, the Catholic party in England should not be in one jott better
condition then they are.

But I cannot be yet discouraged; My confidence is in the King, and in the
desire which I know he has to procure a good Wife for his Son. And now that
the time is come, let him play the part of a Courageous Wooer, and frustrate
the intentions and desires of all those, that are adverse to it. It is a
comfort unto me, that I do not find here an impossibility; but that though
there be difficulties, yet I find many here that desire to overcome them. And
above all, I hope that God will assist this business as his own Cause. I am
going to prepare my self for the Congregation of the Cardinals, and a
Consultation of Divines, to whom I understand we shall be remitted this next
week. I shall give your Lordship an account punctually of all things that
happen in those Conferences. Ous Lord, etc.

Your Lordships, etc. Padre Maestre.

Don Carlos to the Lord Conway, 3. September.
SIR,
I Have understood by Mr. Strada with particular contentment the news of your
good health, which God continue for many years. I see by yours received by
Strada, what his Majesty has been pleased to order concerning the ships of
the Indies, which is as much in effect as could be hoped for from so great a
King, so zealous of Justice and Equity.

In the Conduct of this business, we will observe the order given by his
Majesty, in confidence that the Subjects of the King my Master shall obtain
their ends, and his Catholic Majesty receive the contentment to know, that
the excesses of those that shall be convinced have been punished.

By the last Currier of Flanders, we received neither from the Infanta, nor any
other person any other news, then what Mr. Trumbal sent by his Letters.

I confess freely, that the Marquess, and my self have been much troubled,
both of us being exceedingly desirous, that his Majesty should receive in
every thing (even in words, and formalities) the same satisfaction, which we
hope he shall receive in the effects. Nevertheless in discharge of her
Highness, I will say that which is fit for me as I am her servant, and which I
pray you from me to deliver unto his Majesty; but thus understood, that it is
only my own particular discourse.

By the displeasure his Majesty has been pleased to testify unto me upon
many occasions of the Prince Palatines refusal to sign, and ratify the Treaty
of suspension of Arms; He may be also pleased to judge how it may have been
taken by the King my Master in Spain, and the Infanta in Flanders, and the
rather because of the continual reports, that at the same time went up and down
and increased (as ordinarily it falls out) of the descent of Alberstat with a
mighty Army of 20000 foot, and 6000 horse, not any more to make war in Germany,
but to join with the Prince of Orange, and fall upon those Provinces in
obedience to his Catholic Majesty, which was no other but directly to aim at
the vital parts of the Spanish Monarchy.

If for these just fears (which cannot certainly be held vain, being considered
with those of the year past, proceeding from one and the same Cause, both of
which have been scattered by the Almighty hand of God, in his secret Judgments)
it has not only been lawful, but also necessary to conserve the ancient
alliances, and procure new, I leave it to the judgment of every man of
understanding, not doubting but for this respect you will be of the same
opinion with me: And much more his Majesty, whom God has endowed with so
great knowledge, and royal qualities, as are known to all the world.

Morover, let us see if in the Law of gratitude, the Infanta could do less
then acknowledge toward the Duke of Bavaria, the valor wherewith his Army had
resisted the pernicious designs of Alberstat, having hazarded his own estate to
hinder the imminent danger of the King my Masters.

Again let us consider if the Infanta sending to visit, and give him thanks
could excuse her self from giving him all those titles, which the Duke of
Bavaria gives himself, and desires should be given him. And if he might not, if
she had done otherwise have thought the ingratitude the greater, then the
acknowledgement. And therefore things being in this state, the Infanta could
not excuse her self from sending to visit him, seeing he had succored her in
a time of need, and in visiting him to give him that, which he desired should
be given him. And the like is to be said for the King my Master in case he has
done the like as Mr. Trumbal writes the Infanta should tell him, and with a
great deal more reason because the Countries are his own. And therefore since
his Majesty of Great Britain is so great a King, and has so great a
reputation of the exact performing of his royal obligations, I doubt not but he
will judge, that in this formality, the King my Master, and the Infanta his
Aunt, have but acquitted themselves of their obligations. For the rest, if at
the conferrence of Cullen, which his said Majesty, and her Highness have
desired, and do yet desire his Majesty of great Britain shall see, that they
are wanting on their part to proceed with that sincerity and truth, which they
have so often offered, and which the Marquess of Ynoiosa does still offer on
the behalf of the King my Master, so that only the Prince Palatine make the
submissions due to the Emperor as his natural Lord, and resolvie to follow the
Paternal counsels of his Majesty of great Britain, his Majesty shall then
have reason to complain. And in the mean time the Prince Palatine should do but
well not to entertain those Amities he endeavors to conserve, nor to solicit
those Leagues which he labors to procure, not only with the declared rebels
of the King my Master, and of the House of Austria, but also with the enemies
of all Christendom. I will engage my head if following this way his Majesty
and his son in law find themselves deceived.

You know Sir, that I treat in truth, and freedom, and do therefore hope you
will impute my excuses to that, and will not call this liberty of my
discourse, rashness, but an immortal desire in me in all things to procure the
service of our Kings, laying aside all occasions of misunderstandings, now we
treat of nothing else, but uniting our selves more by the strickt bonds of love,
over and above those of our Alliance.

I do humbly beseech you to say thus much to his Majesty, and to assure him
from me, that when he shall be pleased to employ me in this matter, as in all
other, he shall ever find me faithful and real, as I have offered my self, and
always continue, being well assured, that even in that I shall serve my
Master. And I pray you to believe in your particular that I am, and will be
eternally

Yours etc.

The Marquess Yuoiosa to the Lord Conway, 5. September, 1623.
I Answered not long since to both your Letters, and now I will add this, that
only the sport, and pleasure that Don Carlos, and I consider his Majesty has
in his progress, may make tolerable the deferring (by reason of that) and not
hearing the news we expect to hear of his Majesty's good health. For by that
means we might not only satisfy more often our desires in this point (having
his Majesty nearer) but also our desire to bring these businesses to an end,
which are ordinarily more delayed, and less well executed, when they are to
pass through the hands of Ministers (though they be very zealous, and well
affected to it) as these Lords are with whom we treat here; who are desirous
that the King should be known for just, though unnecessarily, when nothing is
pretended contrary to that which is agreed upon. This knowledge whereupon I
ground my reasons may perhaps make me (Sin Embargo) incur the Censure of an
impatient man; But I am persuaded, that if that which has been done here, had
been settled there by your Honor, and the Lord Count of Carleil (whose good
disposition, and proceeding is as much to be esteemed as it is praised by Don
Carlos and my self) we would have made an end, and those things, which I have
seen, and observed here had not happened unto us. For in the conference, in
which my Lord Keeper did assist, it was agreed (as we thought) that his
Majesty should give order to the Judges and Justices of Peace, Archbishops
and Bishops signed with his royal hand under the little Seal within three
months, or at the Princess her arival. He has persisted afterward, as also
Sir George Calvert in that (though it was plain) that his Majesty would give
the said warrant, afterward, there being no term nor day appointed.
Nevertheless at last we have condescended, that it should be within six
months, or at her Highness arrival, if she comes before that time, that we may
show how happy we think our selves in being Servants to his Majesty, whom God
save.

The dispatches that we are to have are contained in the relation here
enclosed. I pray you to take order, that those that are to be sent back to that
effect, may be subscribed, and Sealed; for I have differred the dispatching of
a Currier (with an evident danger that he will now arrive too late, and put in
hazard a business of mine of consideration, which obliges me to dispatch him)
that he may not go without them; And that it may not be an occasion to doubt of
the assurance we have given of his Majesty's good will and intention; whose
Royal hands, I, and Don Carlos do entreat your Honor to kiss in our name, and
to continue us in his Majesty's good Favor, and your Honor likewise in yours;
for we deserve it with a particular affection, and equal desire to serve you.
God save your Honor, as I desire

Your Honors servant, The Marquess, Yuoiosa.

Sir Arthur Chichester to the Duke, the 25. January, 1623.
May it please your Grace,
When you went last from White Hall I waited on the Prince and you into the
Gallery, where your Lordship spoke something unto me which I understood not, to
wit, Are you turned too? As I knew not the ground of the Demand, I could make
no present answer; nor now but by Conjecture. When I turn from the Prince,
(whom I know to be the worthiest of Princes) or from you, (who by your favors
have so bound me to serve you) or from the truth (as I conceive it) God I know
will turn from me; until then I humbly pray your Lordship to believe that I am
your honest servant.

The Sunday after your Lordships departure, the Ambassadors of the King of
Spain came unto me under the pretext of a visit. I have herewith sent your
Grace a brief of what passed between us. I judge some man has done me an ill
office, by insinuating me into their good opinions of me; sure I am, I never
spoke of them, nor of the affairs they have to manage, but what I have said,
when the selected Council were assembled. I cannot be so dull, but to know that
they meant your Grace to be the Interposer of their desires, and the Man, whom
they wished to be absent when they have their private audience. They are
exceeding Cautelous, and I conceive the late Dispatch from Spain is like a
gilded bayt to allure and deceive; your Lordship perceiving their Malice, will
be wary to avoid their Venom. I am

Your Graces Humble, and faithful Servant, Arthur Chichester.

The Collections of the Passages and Discourses between the Ambassadors of the
King of Spain, and Sir Arthur Chichester, 18. Jannary, 1623.
These Passages were sent to the Duke, enclosed in the last foregoing Letter.
ON Sunday the 18. of this present January, the two Ambassadors of Spain came
to visit me at my House in Drury Lane. At their first entrance they took
occasion to speak of the profession of Soldiers, and of the Spanish Nation,
affirming them to be the bravest Friends, and the bravest Enemies. I approved
it in the Soldier, and contradicted it not in the Nation.

When they were come into an Inner Room, looking upon the Company as if they
desired to be private; I caused them to withdraw, but noting that they had
brought an Interpreter with them, I prayed Sir James Blount, and Nathaniel
Tomkins Clark of the Princes Council, (who does well understand the Spanish
tongue) to abide with me.

Being private, they said they came to visit me, because of the good intention,
and well-wishing they understood I had to the accommodation of businesses, and
because I stood named by his Majesty for the employment into Germany.

I acknowledged their coming to visit me as a particular Favor, professing my
self to be one of those, who was able to do least, but that I must and would in
all things conform my self to the will, and good pleasure of the King my Master.

They were pleased to remember, and to take for argument of his Majesty's good
opinion of me, to make me one of the Junta (as they called it) of the selected
Councillors, and his employment given me the last year as his Extraordinary
Ambassador into Germany.

I told them I had been bred a Soldier, as their Excellencies had been, but
that I wanted the capacity and abilities which they had, and that for want of
Language (not affecting to speak by an Interpreter) I had forborne to wait on
their Excellencies, as otherwise I would have done.

To that they returned the like Complement, and then said, Their Master had
sent a good answer touching the Palatinate, and they assured me, that he would
perform what he had promised with advantage.

I said if it were so, I then hoped all things would sort to a good end.

They then asked me how his Majesty, and the Lords were affected, and whether
therewith they were satisfied, or no?

I answered, That I conceived their Excellencies knew his Majesty's mind as
well as the Lords, for that they had so lately audience of him.

They said. It was true, they had so, but not a private audience; nor could
they obtain any, though they had much desired the same, but that others were
still present.

I said merely that they were two, and I believed that the King their Master
had sent as able and experienced Ministers as he had any, and therefore his
Majesty might peradventure think fit not to hear them alone.

They said his Majesty might alone hear a thousand Ministers of any Kings, but
if he should be otherwise pleased, they well liked of the Princes being
present; but they said there were also other great Ministers of the Kings, who
wished not well to their Masters affairs.

I said, There might therein be a mistaking, or misunderstanding on their part;
for if the King their Master mean so really as they said, I conceived that no
body would be willing to remove his Majesty from those purposes, and that good
affection which he bore unto his dear Brother the King of Spain.

The Marquess said in English, The King was a good King, and the Prince a good
Prince, but some of their Ministers they doubted were ill willers to them.

I asked if greater demonstrations of reality could be devised, then had been
given on the part of the King and Prince, instancing in the Prince his going in
Person into Spain.

They confessed it, but as the times now were, they said ill offices were done
them.

I assured them, That I neither knew, nor understood of any; neither did I ever
hear them spoken of, but with due respect had unto them, as to the Ministers of
a great King, and his Majesty's dear Brother.

They said their meaning was not, that the ill offices were done to their
Persons, but to the great Businesses, which a certain Person had showed a
willingness to disturb; but they hoped, that the intended amity between our
Masters would hold, and proceed nevertheless.

I professed, that I knew nothing to the contrary, neither understood I the
particular at which they aimed.

The Marquess swore as he was a Christian, he knew that the King his Master
did so truly, and really esteem his dear Brother the King of England, and the
Prince of Wales, that if they needed part of his blood, they should have it for
their good: But he complained, that they could not have their Messages
delivered nor returned from the King of late, but qualified according to the
pleasures of others.

I said, They misconceived it, for I thought they had no cause to complain,
seeing they now had, or might have (as I supposed) the Kings Ear when they
craved it in due, and befitting times.

They seemed to deny it, alleging, That they could not get their Messages and
Papers answered as aforetime.

I said, When the Prince was in Spain, they had free access to his Majesty,
whenever they desired it.

Yea said the Marquess in Latin Tune; but now, he said, the ease was altered.

I said the King had given many testimonies to the world of his willingness to
comply with their Master, and Them: And if either his Majesty or the Prince
seemed now more reserved, and deliberate in their actions then heretofore, it
might be that his Highness had learned that wary and circumspect proceeding in
Spain, where they are said to use it in matters of far less moment.

They smiled hereat, and prayed me to continue my good intentions, and respects
toward them, and to the joint affairs of both our Masters.

I said, I would always serve the King my Master, with a true and faithful
heart, and so far as should be agreeable to his desires, and good liking, I
would to my small power be ready to serve them.

In Conclusion they said, They came but to visit me, but being come, they could
not choose but say something, and touch upon business.

Arthur Chichester.

22. of May, 1624.
Having made visits at sundry times to the Spanish Ambassadors, I do here
under my hand declare, what passed betwixt them and me, so near as my memory
serves; lest in my absence any such ma^ter should fall in question, I now
intending to travel for a space.
When his Highness was in Spain, being upon my journey in Scotland, I went to
Elis-House to take my leave of Don Carles, where Vanvail was present, I
expressing much joy of the march, which in my mind would without all question
be perfected, did find no such humor, nor inclination on their part, which did
much astonish me; for they grumblingly did allege, that the King my Master
did perform nothing that he promised, or how could any thing be expected the
Infanta being here, whereas nothing was per formed the Prince being in Spain? I
besought them to do better offices, then without reason to put jealousies
betwixt my Master, and theirs, who would never have sent his son to Spain
without a real intention. Which only act was reason sufficient to remove all
doubts.

Yet did they still continue their challenge of diverse Bracks, specially, anent
the sending of ships to Scotland to bring away the two Dunkirkers, and not
perfecting such conditions as were promised to Catholics. I did entreat them
again, that such conceits of my Master might be removed, for they might be
confident of full performance of what he had promised, by reason he had never
broke his promise to any. I desired them likewise to consider with what love
our Prince was gone, and what a stain it should be to the State of Spain, if
uncourteously he should return with distaste; Besides, it might fall out to be
the worst act that ever they committed, where anent if they had love to their
Master they would prove good Instruments. What was spoke by me in English was
related in Spanish to Don Carlo, so was it to me what they spoke in Spanish.
Sometimes Don Carlo spoke in French, so that not a word passed which each man
did not know.

I went again after the Treaties were given up, and did remember Don Carlo of
what I had forespoke, when the Marquess was present and took the speech; they
did demand of me whether I was come of my self, or by Commission, for they
professed to account me their friend.

I answered that I came merely of my self, and was sorry that by their own
deserving, they had procured such alterations and I thought strange of such
demands as they had made at Hampton Court, which did both express much spleen,
and lack of good intelligence. They did avow their demands were reasonable;
but, from that time they would make visits to the Duke and love him better then
before, because they were in doubt before, but now they know him to be an
Enemy. I did answer, that I was sorry for their proceeding, and was their
friend so long as they were friends to my Master.

After a few haughty words, such (as it was a wrong way to deal with their
Master by threatenings, who gave pay daily to 300000. Soldiers that they had
followed the wars a long time, and had seen men killed by the Cannon, Musket,
Pike, and sword, but never saw men killed with words, they desired me to speak
to his Majesty, that they might either be dismissed, or have freedom to go
about their business with security. They did desire me likewise to speak to
his Majesty, that the treaty for the Palatinate might continue.

I did demand of them how these two things did agree, both to threaten and
entreat? whereupon they passed upon me with odd complaints. I went once more of
late to give them a farwell. I said, they proved themselves good Servants to
their Master in pressing to raise jealousies in this State, but they were now
too well known to do harm. The Marquess swore, that by this time the Infanta
had been here, and the Palatinate restored, if the blame had not been on our
Part. I did entreat I might be excused not to believe that. I did ask whether
they did not condemn their own judgments in accusing the Duke of Buckingham of
that whereof he was cleared, both by the King, and State. Their answer was, He
was cleared by those who were his confiderates, all as guilty as himself.

I demanded, why they should still express their malice against the Duke of
Buckingham. Did they not think but our Prince was a man sensible of what
injuries he had received? their answer was, if the Duke were out of the way,
the Prince would be well disposed. They said farther, his Highness was an
obedient son before the Duke guided him, but since, he was not. So that when we
speak of his Majesty, they speak with much respect, but for the Prince did not
use them kindly, they did make the less account of him. So after I took my
leave and parted.

Nithisdail.
MUch I have omitted for brevitie, wherein they did express much respect to
his Majesty, much of their threatening to the Duke of Buckingham.



The Lord Nithisdail to the Duke, 22 June, 1624.
My most Noble Lord,
FInding matters at great uncertainty when I came hither, I resolved to make
farther trial before I should part from hence. What thanks is due to the
Ambassadors for their paineful, and discreet Carriage can hardly be expressed.

Matters now being drawn to such a conformity (which I confess I thought
impossibilities, though withal I found much respect always to the Prince with
a sensible desire of the Match expressed, both by the King, and those I spoke
withal) our Ambassadors seem still to be discontent, that all things are not
remitted to our Masters verbal promise, which though it may be assurance
sufficient to all Catholics, who have the sense to consider, that it must be
our Masters, and the Princes gracious disposition must be our safety, more then
either word or writ: yet the writ being desired privately (as they pretend)
merely to draw the Popes consent (without the which nothing is to be finished)
the difference is not so great, their Princely promise being given already.

What cause of jealousy the refusing hereof should procure, you may consider:
besides, my judgment fails me, if a more easy way shall be assented unto upon
this side. If the Ambassadors have bestirred themselves to get this out of the
public Articles, I can bear witness. Thus much I dare avow, that neither
time nor place have been omitted by them to do good; though I must confess,
what intelligence I had in the proceeding, has rather been from the French
then from them. Their Reasons (as I conceive) was their doubts, that did bring
me hither, having neither Letters from the King, the Prince, nor your Grace.

Whereupon to remove these conceits, I showed them, that I did only take this
in my way, intending to go see the Jubilees, wherewith though his Majesty, nor
the Prince, neither yet your Grace were acquainted with at my parting, you will
be pleased to make my excuse. I am infinitely beholding to the Ambassadors
noble Courtesy, which I know has proceeded from that relation which they know
I have to you.

My Lord, let the happiness which shall come to the Prince by matching with
such a Lady, as I protest before God, has those perfections, to my thinking,
can hardly be equalled, be a means to hasten a happy Conclusion; And let not
matter of Ceremony draw delays where the substance is agreed upon. So shall
all that belong to our Master be made happy, in general, and you in particular,
for that love which they express here to your self.

Once more I humbly beg, you will consider particularly upon each one of the
Articles, and I hope you shall not find such unreconcileable difference as an
affected Puritan may pretend. Whereupon if I have looked more with eyes of a
Papist then was fitting, it is my lack of judgment, and not of zeal to my
Masters Honor, which of all carthly things shall be preferred. Beseeching God
to give a happy success hereunto, with a sound recovery of your own health, I
humbly take my leave.

Your Graces Faithful servant, Nithisdail.
Dated at Compion.
Sir Tobie Matthew to the King of Spain.
DOn Tobea Mathei Cavallero Ynglesy Catholico Romano beseeches your Catholic
Majesty with all humility and reverence, to give him leave to speak these few
words unto you.

He understands that the Theologos have persisted precisely upon the Voto,
which they gave before, and he finds clearly that the Prince conceives, that
he can by no means submit himself thereunto with his Honor. And besides, my
Lord the King has expressly required him to return with all possible speed, in
case that Voto should not be qualified. And it is certain that he will depart
for England within very few days. And whosoever shall inform your Majesty,
that the Treaty of this marriage may be really kept on foot after the
departure of the Prince upon these terms, does deceive your Majesty through
the ignorance wherein he is of the State of England. So that the Prince
departing thus, the Catholic Subjects of all my Lord the Kings Dominions are
to be in lamentable case. For although the Prince did yesterday vouchsafe to
have Compassion of me in respect of the grief wherein he saw I had upon these
occasions, and to say, That although the marriage were broken, yet he would
procure that his Catholic Subjects should not fare the worse for that; yet I
know that it is morally impossible for that honorable design of his to take
place in respect of the People, and the importunity and malice of the
Puritans, and especially because it will now be a case of mere necessity for
my Lord the King, to run in a course of very straight Conjunction with them of
his Parliament, that he may be able the better to serve himself of them in
other occasions: from which Parliament, as now the case will stand, what
Catholic can expect any other then the extreamitie of rigor?

In consideration whereof I cast my self with a sad heart at the feet of your
Majesty, beseeching you, that you will take into your royal remembrance the
love, which you owe, and procure to pay to our holy Mother, the Church, and
that some course may be taken, and with speed (for otherwise it will be too
late to give the Prince some foot of ground upon which he may be able to stand
in such sort, as that without loss of honor, and breach of that word, which
he has given to the world, and without prejudice to that obedience, which he
owes to the least commandment of the King his Father; his Highness may be
enabled to comply with the incomparable affection which he bears the Infanta
your Majesty's Sister. And that by means hereof the two Crowns may be kindly
in perfect union, and the Catholic religion may be highly advantaged, not
only in the Dominions of my Lord the King, but in many other parts of
Christendom, into which the Authority of these Dominions does flow.

For my part, I take the eternal God to witness, whom I procure to serve, and
who has given me a heart, which disclaimeth from all other interesses then to
serve God, and my King, that I conceive my self not to comply with a good
conscience without laying this protestation under the Eye of your Majesty,
that if the Catholic subjects of the King my Lord shall grow liable to
persecution, or affliction by occasion of breaking this Match, through the
disgust of the King my Lord and his Council, or through the power, which
infallibly the Puritans assembled in Parliament will have with him upon this
occasion, that blood, or misery whatsoever, it may partly be required at their
hands who have advised your Majesty not to accept of those large conditions
for Catholics which my Lord the King and the Prince have condescended to, and
of that more then moral Security which they have offered for the performance
thereof.

And on the other side, I undertake to your Majesty, under the pain of
infamy, in case that be not made good which here I affirm, that if your
Majesty will be pleased to give some such ground to the Prince, as whereupon
he may with Honor stay, and perfect the Treaty of the Marriage by any such
way, or means, as may occur to your Majesty's royal wisdom, the whole bodies of
the Catholics in England both religious, and secular, shall acknowledge it as
a great blessing of God, and shall oblige themselves to pray incessantly for
your happy Estate etc.

Sir Tobie Matthew to the Duchess of Buckingham, 9. June 1625.
Madam,
THere was no cause till now, why I should trouble your Ladyship with
presenting my unprofitable service to you: but now I shall venture to do it, by
reason of the good news I shall send with it.

For our Queen arrived here yesterday, and I was glad at the heart to see her
such, as she had seemed; she is more grown then I had thought, being higher by
half the head then my Lady Marquess. And whatsoever they say, believe me, she
sits already upon the very skirts of womanhood. Madam, upon my faith she is a
most sweet lovely Creature, and has a countenance which opens a window into
her heart, where a man may see all Nobleness and Goodness; and I dare venture
my head (upon the little skill I have in Physiognomie) that she will be
extraordinarily beloved by our Nation, and deserve to be so; and that the
actions of her self, which are to be her own, will be excellent. Me thought I
discerned in her countenance a little remnant of sadness, which the fresh
wound of parting from the Queen Mother might have made, yet perhaps I was
deceived. Her Aattyre was very plain, for so Great a Queen can be thought to
have nothing mean about her. But I hope that amongst many other blessings,
which God, will have provided for us by her means, her example will be able to
teach our Country wit in this kind.

I had the happiness to see, and hear her at a short distance, by the
Commandment which my Lady of Buckingham laid upon me to interpret for her, and
believe me, she is full of wit, and has a lovely manner in expressing it. But
I confess I was sorry with all my heart, to hear that her courage was so
great, as to carry her instantly (after my Lady of Buckingham had taken her
leave for that time) to Sea in a poor little boat in the company of her
brother, whom yet, I have not had the honor to see. I dare give my word for
her, that she is not afraid of her own shadow, who could find in her heart to
put her self at the first sight, upon an element of that danger, and disease
for mere pastime; Unless it were perhaps that she might carry some Steel
about her, and that there is some Adamant at Dover, which already might begin
to draw her that way.

I am extremely sorry, that we have lost the hope of seeing the two other
Queens, for if they had come, we might have had beauty here as well in the
preterperfect, and in the present tense, as now we have in the future.

But the Queen Mothers indisposition has arrested her at Amiens in punishment
of that malice, wherewith she dissembled it too long at the first, through the
extreme desire she had of coming hither.

Our Queen received my Lady of Buckingham with strange courtesy and favor,
and now there is no remedy but that the King will needs defray and treat her
after a high manner. And I have been told that Mounsieur will needs descend so
much as to visit her in her lodging; and the Duchess of Chevereux (being that
great Princess, as she is, both by match, and blood) will perforce give
precedence not only to my Lady of Buckingham, but to my Ladies her daughters
also: And I assure my self, that a less puissant example then this will serve
to convert our Great Ladies, even to exceed in England toward the Ladies which
are strangers, and do but come, and go.

But the while this Court does so apply it self to do my Lady of Buckingham all
imaginable honor, I look on it so, as that I am no way discouraged thereby
from bearing devotion to the blessed Virgin, when I see that men, who are sick
of love toward the Son, are put even by a kind of Law of nature into pain,
till they revenge themselves upon the Mother. I beseech Jesus, etc.

From Bulloign. ph
Dr. Sharp to King James.
The Complaint of Europe our Mother, aged, and oppressed,
TO whom? To the Kings and Princes of Europe. Of whom? Of the Pope of Rome. For
what matter? For causing by his Catholic League so much blood to be spilt
within these few years in Europe. To this effect, as that excellent Poet
speaks, with a little change of his words, Quis non Europaeo sanguine pinguior.
Campus sepulchris impia praelia
Testatur? auditumque Turcis
Europaeae sonitum ruinae?
Qui gurges aut quae flumina lugubris
Ignara belli? quo Mare Civicae
Non decoloravere caedes?
Quae Caret ora cruore nostro?


And what further danger is it like to breed? Even to bring the Turk into
Austria, Italy, Germany, into Vienna, and into Rome it self, as it has brought
him into Pannonia, and of late into Pollonia to the great danger of all
Christendom. Which danger she does foresee, and lament, and tells, That no
European King has sought to compound these bloody home-quarrels but the King
of Great Britain. She most humbly desires the rest of the Princes, that they
would Commiserate her most afflicted estate; her Cities taken, her houses
spoiled, her children murdered, her Matrons and Virgins defloured, her ways
full of Thieves, her Seas of Pirates, all the helps of life taken from her in
many parts, her flocks and herds scattered, her Tillage ceased, her Trade
decayed, the Laws silent, Learning fallen, good manners ruined, neither fear
of God left, nor care of men, that all things seem to tend to the first Chaos,
etc. And therefore she does beseech the Princes to whose trust God has
committed, not to whose power he has permitted his two Wards, two Twins, the
Common Wealth, and the Church as to Guardians, that they will look better to
their charge.

And first, not suffer the Common Wealth of Christendom by their arms (at the
Popes secret instigation) to be destroyed, and to this end she first uses the
example of good Heathen Emperors to persuade them as Augustus, Vespasian,
Titus, Nerva, Trajan, Antoninus, Marcus Aurelius, Alexander Severus, Probus;
that they will settle peace at home, and by joint Forces make War abroad upon
the Common enemy of their Kingdoms, and so make the Commonwealth to Honor
them, being made by them, rich in wealth, strong in power, famous in glory,
honest in manners, the felicity of every earthly Commonwealth.

Now for the other Ward, or Twin, the Church, the Heavenly Commonwealth,
because she has before professed, that as she had been long a Pagan, so now by
the Grace of God, has long been a Christian, and did take this to be her
greatest honor, to be the harbor of the Christian Church, she stirs them up
to be more careful by the example of the best Christian Emperors, Constantine,
Jovinian, Gratian, Theodosius, Arcadius, Honorius, Charlemaign, and his Sons
Lotharius, and Lodovicus, to defend her from heresies within, and from violence
without.

And now she begins to tell them, That as one walking with others in the Sun;
not thinking on it, must needs be Sun-burned; so she walking with her reformed
children in this new-risen Sun of the Gospel of Christ, did feel her self
colored (as it were) with the Spirit of Christ, by observing the differences
between the two Churches with great indifferency.

Here because she has before challenged the Pope and the Jesuits of cruelty,
and persuading first, that as men they should spare humane blood.

Secondly, as Europeans they should spare European blood.

Thirdly, as Christians they should spare Christian blood.

She is first thus answered by the Pope speaking for himself, and his Jesuits,
That they are not the authors of shedding Christian blood, but haeretical
blood: And that her reformed sons (as she terms them) are not Christians,
because they be no Catholics; And therefore Heretics to be taken away by
death, according to the sentence of St. Paul, Haereticum hominem post unam aut
alteram admonitionem devita; Hoc est de vita toll, as Cardinal Allen does
expound it, and according to the Decree of the Council of Lateran.

And where I pray you was this your Reformed Church before Luther? And as for
my Jesuits you call them bloody, even as you call your Physicians bloody, who
for driving away a Pestilential Fever, do take more corrupt and putrified
blood from the party then they would.

And thereupon, he does twitt Europe as an old doting Sibylla, in her youth,
being the Concubine of one Taurus, whom she feigned to be Jupiter, to cover her
fault, with the greatness of her lover, who did also give her the name of this
divided World, that by the honor of her title, she might excuse the shame of
her fact; And bytes the fond Orator, that put this person upon her, a whelp of
Luthers, that makes this Minion to accuse him before the Princes of Homicide,
or an insensible piece of Earth to plead his Cause.

To which Europe answers, First, for her self;
Then for the Church.


This Sum I thought good to present to your Majesty, if it please your
judgment, I shall bring the whole work to your Majesty when I am recovered.

And thus craving pardon of your Majesty for troubling your greater thoughts,
though this tend to the good of Christendom which you intend, I rest.

Your Majesty's Most humble Chaplain, Leonel Sharp.

Dr. Sharp to the Duke of Buckingham.
May it please your Grace,
IT is not my purpose to advise, but to attend what others shall determine of
the Match of the Palatinate; but if that be broken off, and this not restored
according to promise, every one may conceive that Peace must give place to War
abroad; but with whom, and where, and how it is to be made, it is for an higher
Council, then for any private man to resolve.

Peace were best, if it had Nihil insidiarum, as Tully says; but it is to be
feared that the malice of the Catholic League does, and will hinder the work
of the Kings most Noble and Christian heart, and then it will be a War wrapped in
the name of Peace.

A just War is the exercise of Faith, as Peter Martyr well collects out of
those Wars which those Worthy Kings and Princes Heb. 11. fought for their God
and his Israel: so war is just which is made for the maintenance of Gods true
religion, and for the safety of the Common Wealth, either for the keeping of
that we have, or recovering of that we have lost.

Every one therefore does rejoice to see the King and his Subjects so joined in
love together, and in the purpose of this defense, every one I mean that is a
true Christian, and good subject; and do wish that two things presently were
added, care at home to Coupe up all false-hearted Subjects, that are known, and
provision to meet with the secret, and open practices of such foreign Enemies,
as are like to abet them

The good policies of the former reign in such times is the best president for
this, at this time. The heads were then committed liberali Custodiae, divided
from their inferior parts, the Papists disarmed, their claws pared, that they
might not hurt us, the laws executed upon the Jesuits and Priests,
firebrarnds of sedition, and rebellion withal: Or if not blood drawn of them,
yet close imprisonment, or banishment enjoined them.

Large subsidies granted to prepare the Navy, and pay the armies. And a great
while no war proclaimed, but brave Adventurers sent forth as to Portugal, the
Groine, to the West Indies, etc. And before Letters of reprisal granted to the
Merchants to make up their losses, a Rowland, for an Oliver, because they had
granted Letters of Mart against us. By this means Carricks were brought in,
the treasure of their West-Indian mines laid for at their return, so to make
war upon them with their own money, till they had made the enemy bankerout,
Ausbrug.
and to break with their banquers of Auspurg, and Genua, that he was not able
to pay his Soldiers, and garrisons; and still the Low Countries strongly
assisted, and war made upon the enemy there, or at home, at his own doors,
which was more Noble, gainful and safe for us; for we still had peace and
plenty at home, though war abroad.

I know not how the case stands now between us, and the Spaniards, but me
thinks it should not be very well, when nothing will satisfy him, but the head
of him, that spoke the truth for the good of the King and kingdom. Certainly if
we break with him, as they which sit at the Helm know what is best to do, he is
ready to strike, and will peradventure strike quickly before we be fully
prepared, therefore our preparations had need to be more speedy, and thorough,
lest we fall into the snare. While they were treating of peace in 88. they did
even then invade us. I pray God they have not used this treaty of marriage to
as bad a purpose; for it seems they never did intend it, but for delays, and
to make it serve their turn, they have plainly abused us in the Palatinate
therereby. But I can say nothing for the present, yet what is to be done, it is
proper to an higher judgment; only I tell what was then, when we were enemies.

I remember in 88. waiting upon the Earl of Leicester at Tilbury Camp, and in
89. going into Portugal with my Noble Master the Earl of Essex, I learned
somewhat fit to be imparted to your Grace.

The Queen lying in the Camp one night, guarded with her army, the old Lord
Treasurer Burleigh came thither, and delivered to the Earl the examination of
Don Pedro, who was taken, and brought in by Sir Francis Drake, which
examination the Earl of Leicester delivered unto me to publish to the army in
my next sermon. The sum of it was this.

Don Pedro being asked what was the intent of their coming, Don Pedro's
Confession.
stoutly answered the Lords, What? But to subdue your Nation, and root it out.

Good, said the Lords, and what meant you then to do with the Catholics? He
answered, We meant to send them (good men) directly unto Heaven, as all you
that are Heretics to hell. Yea but said the Lords, what meant you to do with
your whips of cord, and wire? (whereof they had great store in their ships)
What? said he, We meant to whip you Heretics to death, that have assisted my
Masters Rebels, and done such dishonours to our Catholic King, and people?
Yea, but what would you have done (said they) with their young Children? They
(said he) which were above seven years old, should have gone the way their
fathers went, the rest should have lived, branded in the forehead with the
Letter L. for Lutheran, to perpetual bondage.

This I take God to witness I received of those great Lords upon examination
taken by the Council, and by commandment delivered it to the army.

The Queen the next morning rode through all the Squadrons of her army, as
Armed Pallas attended by Noble Footmen, Leicester, Essex, and Norris then Lord
Marshal, and diverse other great Lords. Where she made an excellent Oration to
her army, which the next day after her departure, I was commanded to redeliver
to all the Army together, to keep a Public Fast.

Her words were these.

MY loving people, we have been persuaded by some, that are careful of our
safety, to take heed how we commit our self to armed multitudes for fear of
treachery: but I assure you, I do not desire to live to distrust my faithful,
and loving people. Let Tyrants fear, I have always so behaved my self, that
under God I have placed my chiefest strength, and safeguard in the loyal hearts
and good will of my subjects. And therefore I am come amongst you as you see,
at this time, not for my recreation, and disport, but being resolved in the
midst, and heat of the battle to live, or die amongst you all, to lay down
for my God, and for my kingdom, and for my people, my Honor, and my blood even
in the dust. I know I have the body, but of a weak and feeble woman, but I
have the heart and Stomach of a King, and of a King of England too, and think
foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any Prince of Europe should dare to invade
the borders of my Realm, to which rather then any dishonor shall grow by me, I
my self will take up arms, I my self will be your General, Judge, and Rewarder
of every one of your virtues in the field. I know already for your
forwardness, you have deserved rewards and crowns, and we do assure you in
the word of a Prince, they shall be duly paid you. In the mean time my
Lieutenant General shall be in my stead, then whom never Prince commanded a
more Noble or worthy subject, not doubting but by your obedience to my
General, by your Concord in the Camp, and your valor in the field, we shall
shortly have a famous victory over those enemies of my God, of my Kingdoms,
and of my People.

This I thought would delight your Grace, and no man has it but my self, and
such as I have given it to, and therefore I made bold to send it unto you, if
you have it not already.

I would I could persuade your Grace, either to read your self, or to command
your Secretary to gather out of the History of Spain translated into English
toward the end five or six leaves, which has matter of great importance fit
for the Parliament, especially for two points; the one concerning the settled
intention of the State of Spain against England, whenever they can get an
opportunity; the other concerning the main reasons of state, which moved the
Queen, and Council, then to take upon her the protection of the Low Countries.

They were of two sorts, the first inherent in the Person of the Prince then
being, which died with her, (as some think) the Quarrel being then between the
Queen, and King of Spain, Philip the second, which are said to be buried in
their graves; the other inherent in their estates, which live with them, and
remain in the heart of the State of Spain against us, whosoever is their King.

And this appears by a large Disputation of State had before the King of
Spain, and blab'd out by their Chronicler in many words, wherein pro et contra
two do argue. The one, who proves that the Netherlands their Rebels are first
to be conquered, that it may serve them as a rise to the Conquest of England,
and the reasons for that project. The other, who proves, that the English are
first to be conquered, the supporters of those their Rebels, and for a rise to
the Empire of Christendom, and the reasons for the project, and specially for
that it is more easy now for the disuse of arms in England; for that England
is not now that England which it has been, etc.

And the mean, how they may win themselves into us by a Treaty of Marriage, as
Mariana blabs it out in general, that which the Prince has tried, and your
Grace has uttered in Parliament in special, that Colloquia de Contractibus,
are with them Mera ludibria parata tantum Regum animis, Ne noceant distinendis,
dum ea quae ipsi intendunt, perficiantur. Which Guicciardine also does in
general affirm, That the Spaniards bring more things to pass by Treaties, and
subtilties, then by force of Arms.

And that you may truly understand the full intention of the Spaniard to the
state of this Kingdom, and Church, I would your Grace would read a notable
Discourse of the late most Noble Earl of Essex, made by the Commandment of
Queen Elizabeth, and debated before her Majesty, and her Council concerning
this point, Whether Peace or War was to be treated with Spain? The Lord
Buckhurst speaking for a Treaty of Peace, to the which the Noble Queen, and
her old Lord Treasurer inclined: The Earl speaking for War, because no safe
peace could be made with that State for 3. special Reasons, which are in that
Treatise set down at large, which is not fit for me yet to deliver by writing,
but there you shall find them. Your Grace may have the book of diverse Noblemen
your friends. If you have it not (if I may understand your pleasure) I will get
it for you. It was of that effect, that it brought the Queen, and Treasurer
contrary to their purpose to his side, for the very necessity of the common
safety.

Your Lordship having angered them, and endeared your self to us, you had need
to look to your self; you are as odious to them as ever the Earl of Essex was.

The Jesuit Walpool set on one of the stable (Squire) one well affected to my
Lord, to poison the rests of his Chair. And seeing they strike at the
Ministers, which deal effectually for his Church, (witness worthy Doctor
White) what will they do to such Pillars of State as you are? The Lord preserve
your Grace, and watch over you. And thus I rest

Your Grace his most humble at Commandment, Leonel Sharp.

The Lord Cromwell to the Duke, 8. September. 1625.
May it please your Grace,
I Am now returned from mine own home, and am here at Fulham near Mr.
Burlemachi, making my self ready to attend your Command in the best manner my
poor fortunes will give me leave, and with what speed I may. Some things I have
sent to Plymouth, and some Gentlemen, so as when I come there, I hope to find
that your Lordship has appointed me a good sailing ship, and one, that shall
be able to play her part with the best and proudest enemy, that dare look
danger in the face.

Though your Grace has placed a Noble Gentleman in the Regiment was intended
to my Lord of Essex, yet I will not despair of your favor, or that you will
not give me some taste of it, as well as to any other. I will study to be a
deserving Creature, and whether you will please to look on me with an
affectionate eye or no, I will love, honor, and serve you, with no less
truth, and faith, then those you have most obliged. What concerns me, I will
not here speak of for fear I offend. My prayers shall ever attend you, and my
curses those, that wish you worse then their own souls. Diverse I do meet, that
say your Grace has parted with your place of the Mastership of the Horse,
which makes the world suspect, that some disfavour your Lordship is growing
into: And that this prime feather of yours being lost, or parted with (be it as
it will) it will not be long ere the rest follow.

They offer to lay wagers, the Fleet goes not this year, and that of necessity
shortly a Parliament must be, which when it comes, sure it will much discontent
you. It is wondered at, that since the King did give such great gifts to the
Duchess of Chevereux, and those, that then went, how now a small sum in the
Parliament should be called for at such an unseasonable time: And let the
Parliament sit when it will, begin they will, where they ended. They say the
best Lords of the Council knew nothing of Count Mansfelts journey, or this
Fleet, which discontents even the best sort, if not all; They say it is a very
great burden, your Grace takes upon you, since none knows any thing but you.
It is conceived, that not letting others bears part of the burden you now
bear, it may ruin you; (which heaven forbid) Much discourse there is of your
Lordship here, and there, as I passed home, and back, and nothing is more
wondered at, then that one Grave man is not known to have your Ear except my
good, and Noble Lord Conway. All men say, if you go not with the Fleet you will
suffer in it, because if it prosper, it will be thought no act of yours; and if
it succeed ill, they say it might have been better, had not you guided the
King. They say your undertakings in the Kingdom, and your Engagements for the
Kingdom, will much prejudice your Grace.

And if God bless you not with goodness as to accept kindly, what in duty
and love, I here offer; questionless my freedom in letting you know the
discourse of the world, may much prejudice me. But if I must lose your favor,
I had rather lose it for striving to do you good in letting you know the talk
of the wicked world, then for any thing else, so much I heartily desire your
prosperity, and to see you trample the ignorant multitude under foot.

All I have said is the discourse of the world, and when I am able to judge of
your actions, I will freely tell your Lordship my mind. Which when it shall not
be always really inclined to serve you, may all noble thoughts forsake me.
Because I seldom am honored with your Ear, I thus make bold with your
all-discerning eye, which I pray God may be enabled with power and strength,
daily to see into them that desire your ruin. Which if it once be, I will
never believe, but so good a King will constantly enable you daily with power
to confound them.

Many men would not be thus bold and saucie. If I find you distaste me for my
respect to you. I will respect my poor self (who ever has honored you) so
much as hereafter to be silent. So I kiss the noble hands of your Grace.

Your Lordships servant, during life, Tho. Cromwell.

Sir Robert Philips to the Duke of Buckingham, 21. August, 1624.
May it please your Grace,
BEfore the receipt of that Dispatch, with which you were pleased to honor me
from Apthorp, dated the last of July, I was fully determined at your return to
Woodstock, to have presented your Grace my most humble and faithful service,
and by that means to have obtained the knowledge in what state and condition of
health you had passed this part of the progress. Your former weakness,
together with the dangerous temper of the season, giving me cause both to
doubt, and pray against the worst; But I found my self then to be more strictly
obliged to the performance of this duty, when I received from your Grace so
clear, and abundant a testimony, as well of your good opinion, as of the trust
you reposed in me. Obligations certainly of that nature, and of so large an
extent as do with reason deprive me of all degree of liberty, and justly
subject me to a perpetual state of servitude, and obedience to all your Graces
Commandments.

I have diligently perused my Lord of Bristols answer, which it pleased your
Grace to communicate unto me. And although it become me not, neither will I
presume to give my opinion of the strength, or weakness thereof, yet will I
take the liberty to say thus much, That I find in his case that to be verified
which I have observed at other times, (to wit) That when able and prudent men
come to act their own Parts, they are then for the most part not of the
clearest sight, and do commonly commit such errors, as are both discernable
and avoidable, even by men of mean abilities.

Being now fallen to speak of this Lord, I humbly beseech your Lordship to give
me leave plainly and briefly to set before you some Cogitations of mine own,
touching his present occasion.

First, that it may be maturely considered, Whether the tendering him any
further charge, unto which he may be able to frame a probable satisfactorie
answer, will not rather serve to declare his innocence, then to prepare his
Condemnation, and so instead of pressing him, reflect back with disadvantage
upon the proceeding against him.

Secondly, That your Grace would be pleased to consult with your self, whether
you may not desist from having him further questioned, without either blemish
to your Honor, or manifest prejudice to the service: Considering that you have
(to your perpetual glory) already dissolved and broken the Spanish party, and
rendered them without either the means, or the hope of ever conjoyning in such
sort together again, as may probably give the least disturbance or impediment
to your Graces ways and designs.

And lastly, Although his Lordship in sundry places of his answer, especially
in the latter part, does seem directly to violate the rule of the Provident.
prudent Mariner, who in foul weather, and in a storm, is accustomed (to
prevent shipwreck) rather to pull down, then to set up his sails.
Nevertheless as this case stands, it deserves to be thoroughly pondered, which
of the two ways will most conduce to your Graces purpose, and is likely to
receive the best interpretation and success, either to have him dealt with
after a quick and round manner, or otherwise to proceed slowly and moderately
with him, permiting him for a time to remain where he is, as a man laid aside,
and in the way to be forgotten. A state of being (if I mistake not his
complexion) which will be by him apprehended equivalent to the severest and
sharpest censure, that possibly can be inflicted on him.

Thus have I over-boldly adventured to present unto your Grace, these few
Queries and Proposals, which they might be both enlarged, and more forcibly
urged; yet to avoid the being too tedious, I have chosen to omit the further
insisting upon them, till such time, as I may have the honor and felicity of
being near your person. At this present it shall suffice, humbly to beseech
your Grace, to be assuredly persuaded, that what I have now delivered in this
subject, does not proceed from any over indulgent respect I bear either to the
person, or fortune of my Lord of Bristol; though I should not be sorry, that
like a prudent man he might by his discreet application to your Grace, render
himself capable to be again readmitted to your love and favor. But the motive
which has induced me principally to use this plainness and liberty, is the
Consideration, how importantly (as I conceive) the well ordering and disposing
this particular, does concern your Graces service. Unto the advancement and
furtherance whereof, if I may be able now, or at any time to contribute the
least proportion, I shall esteem my self most happy, and more then abundantly
rewarded, in case that my right humble endeavors in that kind may receive from
your Grace a favorable and acceptable construction.

I will conclude this Letter with a twofold prayer; first to you for my self,
that your Grace will be pleased to pardon this boldness. Next to God for you,
that he will give you health, and length of days for his Majesty's service,
and the good and honor of this Commonwealth. I humbly crave leave to remain

Your Graces Most obedient and devoted servant, Rob. Philips.

The Earl of Middlesex to the Duke.
Right Noble, and my most honored Lord,
I Have received diverse Letters from your Lordship since your going from
Theobalds, which though they concern several men, and in sundry kinds, yet they
all conclude upon diminution of his Majesty's estate, contrary to your general
ground, when his Majesty delivered me the Staff, and contrary to your
Lordships private directions given me at Theobalds, with which I did your
Lordship the right to acquaint the King.

I have of late had cause to take into consideration the miserable condition of
my present estate, who since I received the staff, have led such a life, as my
very enemies pity me, which I foresaw, the distraction of the Kings estate, and
burden of that place, would of necessity throw upon me. Yet my duty, love
and thankfulness to his Majesty, and my love and thankfulness to you,
contrary to my own judgment, and advice of my friends, made me undertake it,
little expecting these Cross accidents, which have lain heavy upon me, and
more troubled me, then the continual cares and vexations of my place.

I do most freely and willingly acknowledge one man cannot be more bound unto
another, then I am to your Lordship; and if I do not make a thankful return,
let me be held an ungrateful Monster, which is the worst of Villains.

I have been so ambitious as to desire to extend my gratitude so far, as that
the King may have cause to thank you for preferring me, and that your Lordship
may bless the time you did it. To effect that, I shall delight to live a
miserable life for a time. The course which must of necessity be held to do
it, I will acquaint your Lordship with very shortly, which I hope you will be
pleased to approve, and assist me in. And then I will express my thankfulness
to you that way: If that course shall not like you, I will not only deliver
you up my places, but whatsoever I hold from the King, and live privately upon
mine own estate. For I will never fell so good and gracious a Master, nor so
noble and constant a friend ruined, and undone. God bless you, and send you
your hearts desire. As for my self, I never desired to quit the World, and all
the fooleries in it, till now.

Your Lordships Faithfullest servant, and Kinsman, Middlesex.

The Earl of Middlesex to his Majesty, 26. April, 1624.
Sacred Majesty, and my most gracious Master,
YOur goodness is such to me your oppressed servant in this my time of
persecution, as I know not how to express my thankfulness otherwise then by
pouring forth my humble and hearty prayers to the great God of heaven and
earth, to grant your Majesty all happiness here, and everlasting happiness
hereafter.

Between 5. and 6. of the clock upon Saturday in the evening. I received my
Charge from the Lords assembled in Parliament, with an Order, by which I am
commanded to make my appearance at the Bar upon Thursday next by 9. of the
clock in the morning with my answer. And in the mean time to examine my
witnesses.

This Charge of mine has been in preparing, by examining of witnesses upon
oath, and otherwise, 23. days. And has been weighed by the Wisdom of both
Houses, and does concern me so nearly in point of honor, and faith to your
Majesty to answer well, as I value my life at nothing in comparison of it.

I may grieve, though I will not complain of any thing my Lords shall be
pleased to Command; but do hope, that upon a second consideration they will not
think three days a fitting time for me to make my Answer, and to examine
witnesses in a cause of such importance, and so nearly concerning me, when
twenty three days has been spent almost from morning until night in preparing
my Charge.

I know the House (whose Judgment I shall never desire to wave) is the proper
place for me to move to be resolved herein, and therefore shall upon Wednesday
morning make my humble motion there to have 7. days longer time, as well to
make my answer, and appearance, as to examine my witnesses, which are many, and
upon several heads.

But because the Prince his Highness, and many of the Principal Lords are now
with your Majesty at Windsor, my most humble suit to your Majesty is, That
you would be pleased to move them on my behalf, to yield me so much further
time, that my Cause may not suffer prejudice for want of time to make my just
defense, that which I have propounded being as moderate as is possible.

With my most humble and hearty prayer to Almighty God for continuance of
your health with all happiness, I humbly kiss your Royal hands, and will ever
rest

Your Majesty's most humble, etc. Middelsex.

The Earl of Carlisle to his Majesty, 14. February. 1623.
May it please your most Excellent Majesty,
THough my present indisposition deprives me of the Honor to attend your
Majesty with the rest of the Commissioners, with whom your Majesty was pleased
to associate me; yet I most humbly beseech your Majesty to give me leave in
all humility to represent unto your Majesty, what my heart conceives to be
most for your Majesty's service in the present conjuncture of your affairs.
During this time of my distemper, I have been visited by diverse Gentlemen of
quality, who are Parliament Men, none of those popular, and plausible Orators,
but solid, and judicious good patriots, who fear God, and honor the King. Out
of their discourses I collect, That there are three things, which do chiefly
trouble your people.

The first, that for the subsidies granted, the two last Parliaments, they have
received no retribution by any bills of Grace.

The second, that some of their Burgesses were proceeded against after the
Parliament were dissolved.

And the third, that they misdoubt, that when they shall have satisfied your
Majesty's demands and desires, you will nevertheless proceed to the conclusion
of the Spanish match. It would be too much importunity to trouble your Majesty
with the several answers which I made to their objections, and would be too
great presumption in me to advise your Majesty's incomparable wisdom what
should be fittest to be done for your Majesty's honor, and the contentment of
the people; yet if it would please my Lord the King to give his humblest
Creature leave to give vent to the loyal fervor of his heart, restless, and
indefatigable in continual meditation of his Gracious Masters honor and
service, I would thus with all humble submission explain my self. That there is
nothing which either the enemies of this State, or the perverse industry of
false-hearted servants could invent more mischievous, then the
misunderstanding: which have grown between your Majesty, and your people:
nothing that will more dishearten the envious Maligners of your Majesty's
felicity, and encourage your true hearted friends, and Servants, then the
removing of those false fears, and jealousies, which are mere imaginary
Phantasmes, and bodies of air easily dissipated, whenever it shall please the
sun of your Majesty, to show it self clearly in its native brightness,
luster, and goodness.

God and the World do know the scope, and the end of all your Majesty's pious
affections, and endeavors to have been no other, then the settling of an
universal peace in Christendom; (a felicity only proper for your Majesty's
time, and only possible to be procured by your incomparable goodness, and
wisdom) but since the malice of the Devil, and deceitful men, have crossed
those fair ways wherein your Majesty was proceeding, abusing your trust, and
goodness, (as Innocence, and goodness are always more easily betrayed then
wiliness, and malice) you must now cast about again, and sail by another point
of the compass, and I am confident your Majesty will more securely, and
easily attain, your Noble and pious end, though the way be different.

The means are briefly these three.

First let your Majesty's enemies see, that the Lion has teeth, and claws.

2. Next, embrace and invite a strict, and sincere friendship, and association
with those whom neighborhood and alliance, and common interest of state and
religion have joined unto you.

3. And last of all, cast off, and remove jealousies, which are between your
Majesty and your people.

Your Majesty must begin with the last, for upon that foundation, you may
afterward set what frame of building you please. And when should you begin
(Sir) but at this overture of your Parliament by a gracious, clear, and
confident discovery of your intentions to your People. Fear them not (Sir)
never was there a better King, that had better subjects, if your Majesty would
trust them. Let them but see, that you love them, and constantly rely upon
their humble advice, and ready assistance, and your Majesty will see, how
they will tear open their breasts, to give you their hearts, and having them,
your Majesty is sure of their hands, and purses. Cast but away some crumbs of
your Crown amongst them, and your Majesty will see those crumbs will make a
miracle, they will satisfy many thousands. Give them assurance that your heart
was always at home, though your eyes were abroad; invite them to look
forward, and not backward, and constantly maintain, that with confidence you
undertake, and your majesty will find admirable effects of this harmonious
concord. Your Majesty as the head directing, and your people as the hands and
feet, obeying and cooperating for the honor, safety, and welfare of the body
of the State. This will revive, and reunite your friends abroad, and dismay,
and disappoint the hopes of your enemies, secure your Majesty's person, assure
your estate, and make your memory glorious to posterity.

Pardon I most humbly beseech your Majesty, this licentious freedom, which
the zeal of your safety and service, has extorted from a tongue-tyed man, who
puts his heart into his Majesty's hand, and humbly prostrateth himself at
your Royal feet, as being

Your Majesty's Most humble, most obedient obliged Creature, Subject, and
Servant, Carlisle.

The Earl of Carlisle to the Duke, the 20. of November, 1625.
My most Noble dear Lord,
SInce my Last to your Lordship by Mr. Endimion Porter, there has not happened
any matter of great moment, or alteration here, saving the resolution (which
his Majesty has taken by the advice of his Council) for the disarming of all
the Popish Lords. In the execution whereof there fell out a brabble at the Lord
Vaux his house in, North-hamptonshire, wherein there were some blows exchanged
between the said Lord, and Mr. Knightly, a Justice of the Peace, who assisted
the Deputy Lieutenant in that action. Whereof complaint being made, his
Majesty was pleased himself in Council to have the hearing of the business,
and upon examination to refer the judgment thereof to the Star Chamber the
next Term. But at the issuing out of the Council Chamber, the Lord Vanx taking
occasion to speak to Sir William Spencer, (who with the rest had given
information in favor of Mr. Knightly,) told him, that though he neglectect his
reputation before the Lords, yet he doubted not, but he would have more care of
his oath when the business should come to Examination in the Star Chamber.
Herewith Sir William Spencer finding his reputation challenged, presently
complained, and thereupon the words being acknowledged, the Lord Vaux was
committed prisoner to the Fleet.

In the disarming of the Lords-Recusants, there was as much respect had of
some, who have relation to your Lordship, as you your self would desire.

The Papists in general here do give some cause of jealousy by their
Combinations and Murmurings, wherein it is suspected, that they are as fondly,
as busily encouraged by the pragmatical Mounsieurs. But his Majesty's temper
and wisdom will be sufficient to prevent all inconveniencie, which their folly
or passion may contrive. There is one Sir Thomas Gerrard a Recusant brought up
hither out of Lancashire, being accused of some treacherous design against his
Majesty's Person. Rochel is so straightly blocked by Sea and Land, as no
Intelligence can be sent into the Town. We have not as yet any clear
Categorical answers touching the restitution of our ships. As soon as any thing
more worthy of your Lordships knowledge shall occur, you shall not fail to be
advertised from him that is eternally vowed

Your Graces Most faithful friend, and most humble servant, Carlisle.

The Earl of Carlisle to the Duke.
My most Noble dear Lord,
I Must ever acknowledge my self infinitely obliged to your Lordship for many
Noble favors; but for none more, then the freedom, and true cordial
friendship expressed in your last Letter touching my son; And I shall humbly
beseech your Lordship in all occasions to continue that free and friendly
manner of proceeding, which I shall ever justly esteem as the most real
testimony of your favor toward me. Your Lordship will now be pleased to give
me leave with the same freedom and sincerity to give your Lordship an account,
that it is now 4. months since the Count of Mansfelt made the proposition to
me, to nominate my son to be one of his Colonels, as he did likewise to my Lord
of Holland for his Brother Sir Charles Rich; which at the first (I must deal
plainly with your Lordship) I took for a piece of art, as if he knowing, that
next to the benefit and assistance he received from your Lordships favor and
protection, we were the most active instruments employed in his business, and
therefore he sought to engage us so much the farther by this interest. But
afterward I found, that under the shadow of this Complement put upon me, he
had a desire to gratify Sir James Ramsey, whom he designed to be my sons
Lieutenant, having regard to his former deserts, and the courage and
sufficiency he has found in him. I profess unto your Lordship sincerely,
that he received no other encouragement, or acceptance from me then a bare
negative; Insomuch as he afterward sent a Gentleman to tell me, That he
perceived whatsoever he should expect from me in the furtherance of his
business, must be only for the respect I bare to my Masters service, and
nothing for love of his person, since I accepted not the proffer of his
service. My Lord of Holland can justify the truth of this assertion, who alone
was acquainted with that which passed: for I protest upon my salvation, that I
neither spoke of it to any creature living, not so much as to my son, neither
have I written one word thereof to the Count Mansfelt, neither knew I any thing
of his proceedings, till by the last Currier Mr. Secretary was pleased to
acquaint me with the nomination of my son. If I had seriously intended any such
thing, I want not so much judgment and discretion, as not first to discover my
desire to my gracious Master, humbly craving his leave, and allowance: And I
should not have failed to have recourse to your Lordships favorable assistance
therein. And thus (my Noble Lord) have I given you an account what
entertainment I gave to the Count Mansfelts Complement. And I will be bold also
to give your Lordship this further assurance, that no particular interest, or
consideration of mine own shall have power to alter my constant course of
serving my gracious Master faithfully, and industriously. And so humbly
submitting all to his Majesty's good pleasure, and your Lordships wisdom, I
remain eternally

Your Graces most faithful friend, and humble servant, Carlisle.
Postscript.
I Most humbly beseech your Lordship that this unfortunate Complement put upon
my son, may be no prejudice to the deserts of Sir James Ramsey.



The Lord Kensington to the Duke.
My Noblest Lord,
I Find the Queen Mother has the only power of governing in this State, and I
am glad to find it so, since she promises, and professes, to use it to do
careful, and good offices in the way of increasing the friendship that is
between us, and this State, and likewise to relieve, and assist the united
provinces, the which they are preparing to do fully, and bravely; for she has
now a clear sight of the pretentions of the King of Spain unto the Monarchy of
Christendom; during the absence of the King, who went out of this town early
the next day after I arrived here (before I was prepared to attend him) I have
been often at the Lonure, where I had the honor to entertain the Queen Mother.
She was willing to know upon what terms stood our Spanish alliance; I told her
that their delays had been so tedious, that they had somewhat discouraged the
King, and had so wearied the Prince, and State, which the dilatorie proceedings
in it, as that Treaty (I thought) would soon have an end; She straight said of
marriage, taking it that way; I told her I believed the contrary, and I did so
the rather, because the Spanish Embassad our has given it out since my
coming, that the Alliance is fully concluded, and that my journey had no other
end, then to hasten his Master unto it, only to give them Jealousies of me,
because he at this time fears their dispositions stand too well prepared to
desire, and affect a conjunction with us. And truly his report, and instruments
have given some jealousies to the persons of power in this State, especially
since they find I can say nothing directly unto them; yet thus much I have
directly from them, Mounsieur de Vievielle, and others, (but he is the chief
guider of all affairs here) That never was the affection of any State so
prepared to accept all offers of amity and alliance, so we will clearly, and
as disingaged persons seek it, as is this; but as a wise minister he says,
that until we have wholly, and truly abandoned the treaty with Spaiu, they
may lose the friendship of a brother in law, that is already so, in hope of
gaining another that they may fail of. But when we shall see it reallie by a
public Commission, that may declare all dissolved, that touches upon the way
of Spain, we shall then understand their hearts not to be capable of more joy,
then that will bring them. And the Queen Mother told me she had not lost those
inclinations, that she has heretofore expressed to desire her Daughter may be
given to the Prince, with many words of value unto the King, and person of the
Prince, and more then this she could not (she thought) well say, it being most
natural, for the woman to be demanded and sought. It is most certain, that
underhand Spain has done all that is possible to procure this State to listen
to a crosse-marriage, but here they are now so well understood, as this bait
will not be swallowed by them. This I have from a grave, and honest man, that
would not be brought to justify it, therefore he must not hear of it. It is
the Savoy Ambassador, that is resident here, a wise, and a Gallant Gentleman,
who vows this to be most true. So general a desire was never expressed, as is
here for alliance with us: and if the King and Prince have as many reasons of
State at this time, besides their infinite affection here, to have it so
continued, let it be roundly, and clearly pursued, and then I dare promise as
respective, and satisfactorie a reception, as can be imagined, or desired. And
if it were not too much sauciness for me to advise, I could wish that the
propositions of a league, and marriage may not come together, but may be
treated apart. For I doubt whether it may not be thought a little dishonorable
for this King to give his sister conditionally, that if he will make war upon
the King of Spain his brother, we will make the alliance with him; on the other
part, if the league should be propounded here, with all those reasons of State,
that are now pressing for them to make it, they have causes to doubt, and so
have we too, that we may both be interrupted in that; for certainly the King of
Spain, will (if he can possibly) please one side, the which they think here may
be us, with the restitution of the Palatinate, and we may likewise fear may be
them, with the rendering of the Valtoline, these being the only open quarrels we
must ground upon. Now as long as these doubts may possess us both, this will
prove a tedious, and jealous work of both sides; But if we fall speedily upon a
treaty, and conclusion of a marriage, the which will find (I am persuaded) no
long delays here: neither will they strain us to any unreasonablenesse in
conditions for our Catholics (as far as I can find) then will it be a fit
time for to conclude a league, the which they will then for certain do, when
all doubts, and fears of fallings off, are by this conjunction taken away, and
the necessity of their own affairs, and safety will then make them more desire
it then we, and so would they now, if they could think it so sure, and so
honorable for them. For the King of Spain has so embraced them of all sides,
as they fear, and justly, that he will one day crush them to their destruction.
My Lord, I do not presume to say any thing immediately to the King* thorough
your hands, this I know will pass unto him, and if he should find any
weakness in this that I have presumed to say, let the strength of your favor
exercise those accustomed Noblenesses that you have always expressed unto

Your Graces most humble and obliged Servant, Kensington.
Postscript.
Within these few days your Grace shall hear again from me, for as yet I have
not seen the King, no otherwise then the first night I arrived here. This night
he is come unto the Town again.



The Lord Kensington to the Prince, 26. February, 1624.
May it please your Highness,
I Find here so infinite a value of your Person, and virtue, as what Instrument
so ever (my self the very weakest) having some commands (as they imagine) from
you, shall receive excess of honors from them. They will not conceive me,
scarce receive me, but as a public Instrument for the service of an Alliance,
that above all the things in this world, they do so earnestly desire. The Queen
Mother has expressed, as far as she thinks is fit for the honor of her
Daughter, great favor and good will in it. I took the boldness to tell her
(the which she took extremely well) that if such a proposition should be made,
your Highness could not believe, that she had lost her former inclinations,
and desires in it; She said, your trust of her should find great respect; there
is no preparation I find toward this business but by her, and all persuasions
of amity made light, that look not toward this end. And Sir, if your
intentions proceed this way, as by many reasons of State, and wisdom there is
cause now rather to press it, then slacken it) you will find a Lady of as
much Loveliness and Sweetness to deserve your affection, as any creature
under Heaven can do. And Sir, by all her fashions since my being here, and by
what I hear from the Ladies, it is most visible to me, her infinite value, and
respect unto you. Sir, I say not this to betray your belief, but from a true
observation, and knowledge of this to be so; I tell you this, and must somewhat
more, in way of admiration of the person of Madam, for the impressions I had of
her were but ordinary, but the amazement extraordinary to find her, as I
protest to God I did, the sweetest Creature in France. Her growth is very
little, short of her age; and her wisdom infinitely beyond it. I heard her
discourse with her Mother, and the Ladies about her, with extraordinary
discretion, and quickness. She dances (the which I am a witness of) as well
as ever I saw any Creature; They say she sings most sweetly, I am sure she
looks so. Sir, you have thousands of servants here, that desire to be commanded
by you, but most particularly the D. of Chevereux, and Mounsieur Le Grand, who
seek all opportunities to do you service, and have Credit and power to do so.
Sir, if these that are strangers are thus ambitious of your Commands, with what
infinite passion have I cause to beg them, that am your Vassal, and have no
other glory but to serve you; as your Highness, etc.

Kensington.
Postscript.
SIr, The obligations you have unto this young Queen are strange, for with that
same affection, that the Queen your sister would do, she asks of you with all
the expressions that are possible, of joy, for your safe return out of Spain,
and told me, that she durst say, you were weary with being there, and so
should she: though she be a Spaniard, yet I find she gives over all thought of
your Alliance with her sister. Sir, you have the fortune to have respects put
upon you unlookt for; for as in Spain the Queen there did you good offices: so
I find will this sweet Qeeen do. Who said, She was sorry, when you saw them
practice their Masks, that Madam her sister (whom she dearly loves) was seen
at so much disadvantage by you, to be seen afar off, and in a dark room, whose
person and face has most loveliness to be considered nearly. She made me show
her your Picture, the which she let the Ladies see with infinite Commendations
of your Person, saying, She hoped some good occasion might bring you hither,
that they might see you like your self.



The Lord Kensington to the Duke.
My Lord,
YEsternight being Sunday, I arrived safe here at Paris. I was informed as soon
as I came, that the King was resolved after sight of the Queens Masque (that
was to be performed that same night,) that he would go a private journey for 5.
or 6. days to Shaut^lie, a house of Mounsieur de Memorancies.

Being desirous therefore to kiss his hands before his going, and to see the
Court in that glory and luster, as must for certain be found upon such an
extraordinary occasion, I went to the Louure to the D. of Chevereux Chamber,
where I found him and his Lady apparrelling themselves for the Masque, and in
such infinite riches of Jewels, as I shall never be a beholder of the like worn
by Subjects. I had not been there above an hour, but the Queen and Madam came
thither, where they staid a great while. And it was observed, that Madam has
seldom put on a more cheerful then that night. There were some that told me, I
might guess at the cause of it. My Lord, I protest to God, she is a lovely,
sweet, young Creature. Her growth is not great yet, but her shape is perfect,
and they all swear, that her sister the Princess of Piemount (who is now grown
a tall and a goodly Lady) was not taller then she is at her age. I thought the
Queen would have put a fashion of reservation upon me, as not pleased with the
breach, and disorder of the Spanish Treaty; but I found it far otherwise. She
is so truly French, as (it is imagined) she rather wishes this alliance, then
with her own sister. The King (that was so early to go out of the Town) took
his rest, while the Ladies were making themselves ready; but as soon as he
waked, he sent for me, and purposed to have received me as an Ambassador. But
I entreated the D. of Chevereux before I went, to let him understand, that I
came as an humble and thankful servant only to kiss his Majesty's hands, and
had no other end then to do him service. He then received me with much freedom
and cheerfulness, with many questions how the King is satisfied with his
Present by Mounsieur de Bonevan, who when I related the Kings liking, and value
of it, he was infinitely pleased. He commanded me to attend him to the Masque,
which was danced by 16. of the greatest Princesses of France, St. Luke only
being by the Queen received amongst them, to put a singular honor, and value
upon her. The King with his Brother had danced a Masque the last Tuesday, with
the same number of persons of the best quality; who this night were to cast
Lots, who should dance with the sixteen Ladies, they only being allowed to
dance with them. And all those were so infinitely rich in Jewels, (embroiderie
of gold and silver being here forbidden) as they had almost all imbroidered
their clothes as thick with Diamonds, as usually with purle.

I cannot give your Lordship any particular account of my service in any thing,
yesternight being an unproper time for any such thing: But I am advised by the
Prince Jenvile to stay here till the Kings return, and I shall understand how
all things stand, and that no man's affection is so straight and true for the
service of the King and Prince as his is, who of himself falls into passionate
wishes for an Alliance, but tells me in much liberty, they have been informed
the cause and plot of my journey was to set an edge upon Spain, rather to cut
off their delays, then to cut the throat of the business. But I gave him
great satisfaction in that point.

My Lord, these are passages of my first nights being here, matters of
ceremony; and yet I omit much of that. I thought these too slight to trouble
his Majesty, or the Prince with, yet I thought it fit since this Messenger
goes, to let you see this outward show, and face of this Court, to have as much
sweetness, smoothness, and clearness toward our designs as is possible. My
next Letters shall inform you of a further search made by me, the which I am
confident will be of the same nature. And I conceive it the rather, because I
find them in a great alarm at the news, that they have received from Liege,
that the King of Spain makes a Fort upon the ruin there to command both that,
and the Town. This they say has made them more clearly see his vast ambition
to enlarge his Monarchy, and do all speak the careful and honest language of
our Lower house men how it may be prevented.

I have said enough, the Messenger I dare say thinks too much; yet this I will
add, That I will study to make it appear to the world, and your self, by a
thankful heart, and to God himself in my prayers for your Lordship, that I am

Your Lordships Most devoted, and most humble servant, Kensington.
Postscript.
IF the French Ambassador, or my Lord of Carlisle wonders I have not written
unto them, I beseech your Lordship, let them know this Messenger is not of my
sending, and in such haste as he cannot be stayed.



The Lord Kensington to the Prince.
May it please your Highness,
I Cannot but make you continual repetitions of the value you have here, to be
(as justly we know you) the most Complete young Prince and person in the world.
This reputation has begotten in the sweet Princess Madam, so infinite an
affection to your fame, as she could not contain her self from a passionate
desiring to see your Picture, the shadow of that person so honored, and
knowing not by what means to compass it, it being worn about my neck; for
though others, as the Queen and Princesses would open it, and consider it, the
which ever brought forth admiration from them, yet durst not this poor young
Lady look any otherwise on it then afar off, whose heart was nearer it then
any of the others, that did most gaze upon it. But at the last (rather then
want that sight the which she was so impatient of) she desired the Gentlewoman
of the house where I am lodged, that had been her servant to borrow of me the
picture in all the secrecy that may be, and to bring it unto her, saying, She
could not want that Curiosity as well as others toward a person of his
infinite reputation. As soon as she saw the party that brought it, she retired
into her Cabinet, calling only her in; where she opened the picture in such
haste, as showed a true picture of her passion, blushing in the instant at her
own guiltiness. She kept it an hour in her hands, and when she returned it,
she gave with it many praises of your person. Sir, this is a business so fit
for your secrecy, as I know it shall never go farther, then unto the King your
Father, my Lord Duke of Buckingham, and my Lord of Carliles knowledge. A
tenderness in this is honorable; for I would rather die a thousand times,
then it should be published, since I am by this young Lady trusted, that is for
beauty and goodness an Angel.

I have received from my Lord of Buckingham an advertisement, that your
Highness opinion is to treat of the General league first, that will prepare
the other.

Sir, whatsoever shall be propounded will have a noble acceptance; though this
give me leave to tell you, when you are free, as by the next news we shall
know you to be, they will expect, that upon those declarations they have here
already made toward that particularitie of the Alliance, that your Highness
will go that readier and nearer way to unite and fasten by that knot the
affection of these Kingdoms.

Sir, for the general they all here speak just that language that I should, and
do unto them of the power and usurpation of the Spaniards, of the approaches
they make to this Kingdom, the danger of the Low Countries, the direct Conquest
of Germany and the Valtoline. By which means we have cause to join in
opposition of the Ambitions, and mightiness of this King. The which they all
here say cannot be so certainly done as by an Alliance with us. This they speak
perpetually, and urge it unto my consideration.

Sir, unless we proceed very roundly, though they be never so well affected,
we may have interruptions by the arts of Spain, that make offers infinite to
the advantage of this State, at this time. But they hearken to none of them,
until they see our intentions toward them. The which if they find to be real
indeed, they will give us brave satisfaction.

But Sir, your Fathers and your will, not my opinion must be followed; and what
Commandments your Highness shall give me, shall be most strictly obeyed by the
most devoted,

Your Highness Most dutiful and humblest servant, Kensington.

The Lord Kensington to the Duke, the 14. of March, 1624.
My Lord,
I Have already acquainted your Grace how generally our desires are met with
here, much more cannot be said then I have already for that purpose. There was
never known in this Kingdom so entire an agreement for any thing, as for an
Alliance with England, the Count of Soysons only excepted, who has had some
pretensions unto Madam, but those are now much discouraged, upon a free
discourse the Cardinal of Rochfalcout made unto the Countess his Mother,
telling her, That if she or her son believed, or could expect, the King would
give him his sister in marriage, they would (as he conceived) deceive
themselves: for he imagined upon good grounds, that the King would bestow his
Sister that way, that might be most for her honor and advancement, and
likewise for the advantage of his Crown and Kingdom; and he professed for his
part, although he much honored the Count as a great Prince of the blood, yet
was he so faithful unto his Master, as he would advise him to that purpose.

The Queen Mother and Mounsieur Le Grand have advised me to say something unto
the King concerning my business. I told them, I could say nothing very
directly unto him, and yet would I not so much as deliver my opinion of the
King my Masters inclinations to wish an alliance with him, unless I were
assured, his answers might make me see his value, and respect unto him. They
then spoke unto him, and assured me, I should in that be satisfied. Having that
promise from them, I told the King, that I had made this journey of purpose to
declare unto him my humble service and thankfulness for all his Honors and
favors, the which I thought I could not better express, then by informing his
Majesty, that our Prince whom he had ever so much valued, would be as I
conceived free, and dis-ingaged from our Spanish Treaty, by reason that the
King could not find them answer his expectation in those things that made him
principally desire their Conjunction; the which your Lordship seeing you have
exercised your interest and credit with the King your Master, and the Prince to
convert those thoughts toward his Majesty, from whom, you were persuaded
nothing but truth and honor would be returned, the which at this time more
then ever, would be an infinite advantage to both these Kingdoms, and that I
believed if his Majesty would show a disposition, as affectionate to receive
Propositions to this purpose, as the King my Master had to make them, a long
time would not pass before the effects of this might appear, the which would
show the report raised here of the ends of my coming to be false, and me to be
free of all other designs, then those which I had expressed unto him. He told
me, that he had not heard, that the Spanish Match was yet broken, the which
justly might give him cause to be reserved; yet thus far be would assure me in
the general, That whatsoever should be propounded unto him from the King of
Great Britain, he would most heartily and affectionately receive it: but this
was with such a fashion of Courtesy, as showed that he desired cause to have
said more, and I am fully satisfied not only from him, but the Queens, and
most of all of Madam her self, who shows all the sweetness and contentment
that may be, and likewise from all the Officers of the Crown, and State, that
they can desire nothing equal with this alliance. A better and more large
preparation then this my instructions cannot make, and I wonder to see it thus
fair, considering the hindrances and defacings the Spanish Ambassador desires
to cast upon it, who besides the Rodomontado's and threatenings of the
preparations of his Master, does here take a contrary, but cunning way, letting
them know, that the Prince cannot have two Wives, for their Infanta is surely
his, only to create a jealousy and shienesse in them toward me, that he
suspects labors to do offices that are not to his liking.

You will therefore I hope speedily put this State out of these doubts, and
clearly and freely proceed with them. Upon my credit and reputation, they are
all of that disposition, that we can wish them to be, and it appears by their
tender care of the States, and their resolution to aid them: And likewise in
sending Captain Coborn, that came from the Duke of Brunswick to demand a
supply of men, who is returned with answer unto him, that he shall have double
what he required, and great satisfaction to the Count Mansfelt, that sent a
Gentleman hither, to let the King know, he was not yet in such disorder, but
that he could assemble his Troops to such a number, as might do his Majesty
good service, if he would be pleased to take him into his protection and favor.

And the King has sent a Gentleman of the Religion a Sedanois to Liege, to
give information to this State of the proceedings of the Spaniards there, and
to be ready to receive (if the Town shall seek it) the protection of them. But
these passages I am sure you continually understand from our Ambassador, the
which makes me omit many particularities in this kind that I could inform you
of. I have sent this Bearer of purpose, the which I beseech your Grace return
with some speed, and with him the resolutions of our dear and Sacred Master,
whom God ever bless and keep to our glory and comfort.

My Lord I am The humblest and most obliged of all your Graces servants,
Kensington.

The Lord Kensington to the Secretary the Lord Conway.
Right Honorable,
ACcording to his Majesty's order which your last of April the 14. derived unto
me, I have represented such reasons to the King, and his ministers of State
here, against the sending of any person, in what quality soever, to the Duke of
Baviers, as they acquiesce in them; specially for that they come commanded
under his Majesty's desire, which they profess to be very willing to comply
with, not only in this, but in any other occasion wherein his Majesty may
directly, or indirectly be any way interessed.

I took the same opportunity of preparing the way a little farther to a formal
treaty of alliance, by feeling once again their pulse in matters of religion,
and find, that it beats so temperately, as promises a very good Crisis of any
thing that may concern that particular.

I dealt plainly with the Marquess de la Veiville touching the course that
his Majesty may be driven to hold against Jesuits and Priests, of banishing
them the Kingdom; and of quickening the laws against the other Catholics, as
well out of necessity of reducing them within the bounds of sobriety and
obedience, as of keeping good intelligence with his Parliament, without which
he could not possibly go thorough with such a weighty work, as he is now to
undertake. He approved of the course for the ends sake; under hope
notwithstanding that his Majesty would not tie his own hands from some
moderate favor hereafter, which is all they pretend unto, and desire it may
flow from the mediation of this State upon an alliance here, for the saving of
their honor, who otherwise will be hardly reputed Catholics.

In representing a facility in these things, I leave no other difficulties to
be imagined.

Their good inclination to the match in general they are willing to
demonstrate, (as by many other evidences, so) by the care, they are now under
of lodging, and defraying my Lord of Carlisle, and my self in a more splendid
and Magnifique manner, then ever yet they did any Ambassador whatsoever, for
such is the language that Ville-aux Cleres holds to me upon that subject.

The Count of Soissons sees it, and storms, and manifests his discontent
toward me (who am the instrument) more fellie then discreetly. I encountered
him the other day, and gave him the due that belonged to his rank, but instead
of returning me my salute, he disdainfully turned back his head. I was
somewhat sensible thereof, and I told Mounsieur de Grandmont of it, and as he,
and I were discoursing of it the day following, Soissons offered himself full
butt upon us a second time. I again repeated my courtesy, and he is childish
in civility. Grandmont found it strange, and intimated to the Marquess de la
Valette a familiar, and confident of the Counts both my observation, and his
own distaste of such an uncivil kind of proceeding. Valette conveyes the same
to Soissons himself, who answered that he could not afford me a better
countenance, not for any ill will he bore unto my person, but to my errand and
negotiation; which (were it not in the behalf of so great a Prince) went so
near his heart, as he professed, he would cut my throat if he could. Nay, were
any Prince of Savoy, Mantova, or Germany here in person to solicit for
themselves in the like nature, he would hazard his life in the cause. Such is
the language that despair brings forth, which put me into an expectation of no
less then a challenge to decide the quarrel. And I once verily believed it
sent, for the Count de Lude came very so berly to me, and told me, he had a
message to deliver me from a great Personage, which he entreated he might do
without offense.

I desired him to speak freely what it was, and from whom He told me he was
sent by the Count of Soissons, and I presently replied that nothing should come
amiss from him. In conclusion the errand was to signify an extreme liking,
that the Count took to one of my Horses, which he was desirous to buy of me
upon any rate. I answered, that if the Count would express to me his desire
himself, and receive him of gift, he should be at his service, otherwise he
should remain still as he was. Since that I have met him, and been prevented
with a very courteous salute from him. I have been thus ample in these
particular passages betwixt the Count and my self, that by the trouble you find
in his disconsolate breast, you may judge of the constancy of Madams heart
toward our Prince, upon whom assuredly it is most strongly set, (as she
continually expresses upon all occasions.) Yesterday I had the honor to
entertain her two hours together, and received so many testimonies of respect,
as witnessed very warm affections toward the Personage I did represent.
Amongst other discourse, She fell to speak of Ladies riding on horseback, which
she said was rare here but frequent in England, and then expressed her delight
in that exercise.

There is lately arrived here a French Genleman ( Duport by name) with
commission from the King of Bohemia to solicit this Kings favor (in
consequence of his Majesty's generous, and Gracious declaration in his behalf)
for the recovering of his rightful inheritance, to entreat that Baviers may no
ways be countenanced in his unjust pretensions, and to crave (in this his
extremity) a reimbursement of the remainder of that sum, which his father lent
to Henry the fourth in the times of his necessities, which may arise to the sum
of 30000 Crowns; the facilitating of this negotiation is recommended unto me,
who contribute what I can to the good success thereof. There has happened
here this last Monday a dispute between the Marquis de Courtenvant one of the
first Gentlemen of the Kings Chamber, and the Colonel de Ornano ( Mounseiurs
Governor) about a lodging, which this pretended unto as most convenient for
him, in regard that it adjoined to that of Mounseiurs; but the other claimed a
right unto it by a former assignation, and possession. Ornano at the first
prevailed, till the other complained to the King, who commanded the Colonel to
quit the lodging to him; which his people refusing (out of a presumption
perhaps, that the commandment was rather formal then real) the King sent 3. or
4. of his guard to reiterate the commandment, and in case of refusal to obey,
to cast out all the stuff, and to kill all such as should oppose. Thus
Courtenvant got the day; perhaps by Vievilles recommendation in opposition of
Toirax, between whom, there has been lately a little contestation upon this
occasion. Vieville being desirous to strengthen himself, and to stand upon the
surest bottom he could, endeavored to join a confident of his in equal
commission with the Guard des Seaux, that so he might in time work it out, and
prevail himself of that office at his devotion. The Guard des Seaux finding
feeble resistance in himself, addressed his course to Toirax to seek under his
Covert shelter from that disgrace, and injury. Toirax undertakes his defense;
Vieville expostulates the matter with him, and alleadges many reasons to
justify his intentions, which the other gainesaying, with some little
warmness, has occasioned by that heat, a coldness of affection between them
ever since, and that so far forth, as it has grown to be notorious.

To the same original, I reduce the Cardinal de Richlieus introduction into the
Council of the Cabinet by the favor of Vieville (being made also an Instrument
thereunto by the Queen) that by making his own party strong in Council, he may
the more easily crush any adversary, that shall grapple with him. Yesterday he
was admitted; so that now that Council is composed of the Queen Mother, the
Cardinal de la Rouch-foulcant, Richlieu, the Constable Vieville, and the Guard
des Seaux.

Before I had finished this Letter, I had occasion to visit the Constable, to
whom I used the same language, that formerly I had done to la Vieville, and
with the like approbation. And when I touched upon the point of dispensation,
how it might be passed over, he assured me in general, that such was the
disposition of this King, and State to give the Prince content, as he might be
(in a manner) his own Carver how he pleased.

This is the account I can give you of the public: but how shall I express
the deep sense I have of my obligations to your favor in particular? shall I
multiply in thanks? It is too ordinary a payment for so many Noble expressions
of your love. I will rather endeavor by my deeds constantly and continually to
witness unto you, that I entirely rest

Your most faithful and most Humble Servant, Kensington.

The Lord Kensington to the Duke.
My most dear, and Noble Lord,
BEsides that joint Letter to your Lordship from my Colleague, and my self, I
think fit to add this particular account of what passed yesterday at Ruel
betwixt Queen Mother, and me; whither going to give her double thanks; as for
the liberty, she had given me of access at all times to Madam, to entertain
her henceforth with a more free, and amorous kind of language from the Prince;
so for having so readily condescended to an humble suit of mine in the behalf
of my Lord of Carlisle for a favorable Letter for him to your Lordship; she was
pleased to oblige me farther in relling me she did it merely for my sake. I
redoubled my thanks, and added, that I knew your Lordship would esteem it one
of the greatest happinesses that could befall you to have an occasion offered,
whereby you might witness, how much you adored her Majesty's royal virtues,
and how infinitely you were her Servant, ready to receive law from her,
whenever by the least syllable of her blessed Lips or Penn, she should please
to impose it. And this I did (as on the one side to gratify my Colleague, who
would be infinitely sensible of the disgrace he apprehends in the miss of the
Ribbon, being thus brought upon the Stage for it) as also to help to mesnage
that your Gracious favor which Mounsieur de Fiatts to my Lord represents unto
him, by giving you means withal to oblige this sweet and blessed Queen, who
has your Lordship in a very high account, and would be glad to find occasions
how she may witness it. The mention of my Lord of Carlisle upon this occasion
refreshed her remembrance of the late falling out betwixt the Cardinal and him;
and though she were sufficiently informed of the particulars by the Cardinal
himself, yet she would needs have a relation from me, who in a merry kind of
fashion obeyed her command, and salved every thing the best I could. She would
needs know my opinion of the Cardinal, who so magnified to her his wisdom, his
courage, his courtesy, his fidelity to her service, his affection to our
business as pleased her not a little. Neither did my heart and my tongue
differ, for I esteem him such. This discourse she left to fall upon a better
subject, the Prince, concerning whose voyage into Spain, the censure of Italy
(she said) was, that two Kings had therein committed two great errors. The one
in adventuring so precious a pledge to so hazardous an enterprise, the other in
badly using so brave a guest. The first, Madam, (answered I) may be excused
from the end, the common good of all Christendom, which then standing upon
desperate terms, had need of a desperate remedy. The second had need of a
better advocate then I, to put any color of defense upon it.

But his Highness had observed as great a weakness and folly as that, in
that after they had used him so ill, they would suffer him to depart, which was
one of the first speeches he uttered after he was entered into the ship. But did
he say so? said the Queen. Yes Madam I will assure you (quoth I) from the
witness of my own ears. She smiled, and replied, Indeed I heard he was used
ill. So he was (answered I) but not in his entertainment, for that was as
splendid as that country could afford it, but in their frivolous delays, and
in the unreasonable conditions, which they propounded, and pressed (upon the
advantage they had of his Princely Person.) And yet (smilingly added I) you
here (Madam) use him far worse. And how so? presently demanded she? In that you
press (quoth I) upon that most worthy, and Noble Prince, (who has with so
much affection to your Majesty's service, so much passion to Madam sought this
Alliance.) The same, nay more unreasonable conditions then the other, and what
they traced out for the breaking of the match you follow, pretending to
conclude it very unseasonablely in this Conjuncture of time, especially when
the jealousies, that such great changes in state, are apt to beget, are
cunningly fomented by the Spanish Ambassador in England, who vaunts it forth,
that there is not so great a change in La Vievilles particular person, as there
is in the general affections, which did but follow before the stream of his
Greatness and credit.

Thus casting in the Kings mind the seed of doubts, whereunto the Conde de
Olivares in Spain has been willing to contribute by this braving speech to our
Royal Masters Ambassador there, That if the Pope ever granted a dispensation
for the match with France, the King of Spain would march with an army toward
Rome and sack it. Vrayement nons l'en empescherous bien (promptly answered She)
Car nous lui taglierous assez de besongne ailleurs. Mais qu'est-ce qui vous
press le plus. I represented unto her the unfitness of the seventh Article
(even qualified by that interpretationt, hat it is) and the impossibility of
the last which requires, and prescribes an oath. And desired that the honor of
the Prince (with whom she pretended a will to match her Daughter) might be
dearer to her, then to be balanced with that, which could add nothing to their
assurance. I also humbly besought her to employ her Credit with the King her
son, her authority to the Ministers for a reformation of those two Articles
especially, and a friendly, and speedy dispatch of all.

And if we must come to that extreamitie, that more could not be altered, then
already was, yet at least she would procure the allowance of this protestation
by the King our Master, when he should swear them, that he intended no further
to oblige himself by that oath, then might well stand with the safety, peace,
tranquillity, and convenience of his State. This she thought reasonable, and
promised to speak with the King and Cardinal about it. And if you speak as you
can (replied I) I know it will be done, Though when all is done, I know not
whether the King my Master will condescend so far yea, or no. Here I entreated
I might weary her Majesty no further, but take the liberty she had pleased to
give me in entertaining Madam with such Commandments as the Prince had charged
me withal to her. She would needs know what I would say. Nay then (smiling
quoth I) your Majesty will impose upon me the like Law that they in Spain did
upon his Highness. But the case is now different (said she) for there the
Prince was in person, here is but his Deputy. But a Deputy (answered I) that
represents his person. Mais pour tout cela (dit elle) qu' est ce que vous
direz? Rien (dis-re) qui ne Soit digne des oreilles d'vne si vertueuse
Princess. Mais qu' est ce? redoubled she? Why then Madam (quoth I) if you will
needs know, it shall be much to this effect; That your Majesty having given me
the liberty of some freer Language then heretofore, I obey the Prince his
Command, in presenting to her his service, not by way of Complement any longer,
but out of passion, and affection, which both her outward, and her inward
beauties (the virtues of her mind) so kindled in him, as he was resolved to
contribute the uttermost he could to the Alliance in question, and would think
it the greatest happiness in the world, if the success thereof might minister
occasion of expressing in a better, and more effectual manmer his devotion to
her service; with some little other such like amorous Language. Allez, Allez,
Il n'y a point de danger en tout cela (smilingly answered she) je me fie en
vous, je me fie en vous. Neither did I abuse her trust, for I varied not much
from it, in delivering it to Madam, save that I amplified it to her a little
more, who drank it down with joy, and with a low Courtesy acknowledged it to
the Prince; adding, that she was extremely obliged to his Highness, and would
think her self happy in the occasion, that should be presented of meriting the
place she had in his good Graces.

After that, I turned my speech to the old Ladies that attended, and ^old them,
That since the Queen was pleased to give me this liberty, it would be henceforth
fit for them to speak a suitable Language. I let them know that his Highness
had her Picture, which he kept in his Cabinet, and fed his eyes many times with
the sight, and contemplation of it; since he could not have the happiness to
behold her person. All which and other such like speeches, she (standing by)
took up without letting any one fall to the ground.

But I fear your Lordship will think I gather together too much to enlarge my
Letter thus far: but it is, that by these Circumstances your Lordship may make
a perfect judgment of the issue of our negotiation, which I doubt not but will
succeed to his Majesty's, his Highness, and your Lordships contentment: And so
yield matter of triumph to you, and infinite joy to me

Your Lordships Most humble, most obliged, and most obedient servant,
Kensington.

The Lord Kensington to the Duke.
My most dear Lord,
THis Bearer your Cousen's going is in such haste, as what you receive from me
must be in very few words. I was yesterday with the Marquess de Vieville, whom
I find cordial to do good offices between ours, and this Kingdom; and he
assures me by all the promises and protestations that may be, he will ever use
his credit and power to do so, knowing these Kingdoms can (as the King of
Spain's power and ambition increases) have no true safety and ood, unless we
join in friendship and alliance. He is very free to me, telling me, That to
prevent this, the King of Spain offers now the largest conditions of
satisfaction and friendship that can be imagined, but their thoughts here are
wholly bent toward us; And although as yet, the King cannot with honor or
wisdom say more then he has done, yet we may be assured when we are free, to
be satisfied in all we can desire.

This day I understand the Earl of Argile is like lightning passed by for
Spain, and by a special Command from the King it is to put us in more terror;
That he will use his service in Scotland, where I believe he has little credit
and power to offend us. But howsoever they omit nothing that may dishearten us,
but we are of too noble and constant a temper, either to fear their cunning or
power.

My Lord, give me leave to beseech you, not to defer our business, for never
can this State be found so rightly and truly inclined in love and affection
toward us. And the rather hasten it, because all the art that may be is daily
used from Spain to prevent us, and if we go not roundly and clearly with them
here, they may have jealousies and discouragements that may change them: Take
them therefore now, when I dare promise they are free, very free from those
thoughts. My Lord, pardon the haste of this Letter, that has no more time
given me but to tell you, that you never can have any servant more devotedly
yours, then is

Your Graces Most obliged and most humble servant, Kensington.

The Earl of Holland to the Duke.
My dearest Lord,
WE have made a final conclusion of this great Treaty. Upon what terms the
dispatch at large will show your Grace: We have concluded honorably, that
which we could not do safely; for to receive words, that obliged not, would
have appeared an unwise, and unperfect Treaty of our part, and no way worthy
of the greatness of our Master, nor the passion of his Highness, the which
now has a brave expression, since his Mistress is only considered, and
desired, and the only object of our Treaty. But I must tell you, that since we
have proceeded thus, they say, they will out-go us in the like braverie, doing
ten times more then we expect, or they durst promise, fearing the World would
conceive all their doings conditionally; the which would be dishonorable for
Madam. But that being safe, they now say their interest is greater then ours
for the recovering of the Palatinate, and they will never abandon us in that
action. I hope we shall shortly have the honor and happiness to see your
Grace here; where you will be (as justly you deserve) adored. You must make
haste, for we are promised our sweet Princess within six weeks. I beseech you
let me know your resolution, that I may contrive which way I may best serve you
against your coming. I have carefully labored according unto your Commands in
that which the Marquess de Fiat. You may assure him of a speedy and good
success in it, the which he will more fully understand, when Mounsieur de la
Ville-aux-Cleres shall be in England. He begins his journey from hence within
3. days. He is worthy of the best reception that can be given him, having
throughout all this Treaty carried himself discreetly and affectionately. I
beseech you put the Prince in mind to send his Mistress a Letter: And though I
might as the first Instrument employed in his amors, expect the honor to
deliver it; yet will I not give my Colleague that cause of envy. But if his
Highness will write a private Letter unto Madam, and in it express some
particular trust of me: And that my relations of her, have increased his
passion, and affection unto her service, I shall receive much honor, and some
right, since I only have expressed what concerned his passion and affection
toward her. If you think me worthy of this honor, procure a Letter to this
purpose, and send it me to deliver unto her, and likewise your Commands, the
which I will receive for my greatest comforts: living in unhappiness until I
may by my services express how infinitely, and eternally I am

Your Graces Most humble, and most obliged and devoted servant, Holland.
Postscript.
THe Presents that the Prince will send unto Madam, I beseech you hasten.



The Earl of Holland to his Majesty.
May it please your most excellent Majesty,
WE are in all the pain that may be, to know what to answer to the malicious
and continual complaints made by Blanvile of wrongs and violences done him,
even to the assaulting of him in his own lodging, the which he has represented
with so much bitterness, as it took great impression here in the hearts of
all, especially of the Queen Mother, whom yesterday I saw in the accustomed
privilege has ever been given me, to have at all times my entrance free into
the Louure. And I the rather went, because I would not shrink at all their
furies and clamours, and it came to such a height, as Petitions were given by
Madam de Blanvile, that she might for the injuries done to her husband his
Ambassador, have satisfaction upon our persons. But she was (as she deserved)
despised for so passionate a folly, yet was it in confideration (as I suspect)
by a word that the Queen Mother uttered in her passion to me, who with tears
before all the World, being accompanied by all the Princesses and Ladies, told
me, (but softly) That if your Majesty continued to affront, and suffer such
indignities to be done to the Ambassador of the King her Son, your Majesty
must look that your Ambassadors shall be used a la pareylie. I confess this
stirred me so much, as I told her, That if the intentions of your Majesty were
no better considered by the King here, your Majesty commanding us for the good
and happiness of his Kingdom, to endeavor to bring, and give him (the which
we have done) the greatest blessing in this World, Peace in his Country, then
to be balanced with a person, that in requital has stirred up, and daily
desires to do it, disputes, and jarres, even between your Majesty, and the
Queen, we had reason to believe your Majesty most unjustly, and most
unworthily requited. And it might take away upon any such occasion, the care,
that otherwise you would have had to do the like. And for my part, it took from
me all desire ever to be employed upon any occasion hither, where our Actions,
that their acknowledgments have been acceptable but a few days past, are now
of so little consideration, as we are of no more weight, then the unworthiest
Minister that ever was employed. Upon that I found, she was sorry for having
expressed so much. But this day we had from her a more favorable audience, and
from the King the effects and circumstances of that which we have in our
Dispatch presented unto my Lord Conway.

Sir, the malice of this Blanvile is so great unto your worthy servant my Lord
Duke, as he has written a private Letter unto the King, the which I saw by the
favor of a friend, that he is in a condition of danger to be ruined by the
fury and power of the Parliament. And to confirm him in that opinion, has
sent all the passages amongst them that concern my Lord Duke; adding to that,
of great factions against him at the Council Table, and naming some Lords, the
which makes me see, he has intelligence with all those, that he believes may
contribute any thing toward the mischieving of him. But those that know the
magnanimity and nobleness of your Majesty's heart, know that so noble a
vessel of honor and service as he is, shall never be in danger for all the
storms that can threaten him: when it is in your Majesty's hands not only to
calm all these tempests, but to make the Sun, and beams of your favor to shine
more clearly upon his deservings then ever, the which upon this occasion your
courage and virtue will no doubt do, to the encouragement of all deserving, and
excellent servants, and to his honor and comfort that is the most worthy that
ever Prince had: And so affectionate, that the world has no greater
admirations, then the fortunes that the Master and servant have run together.
And certainly our good God will ever preserve that affection, that in so many
accidents, and one may say afflictions, has preserved your Persons.

Sir, this boldness, that I take, proceeds not from the least doubt these
foolish rumors give me of changes, but out of a passionate meditation of those
accidents, that your courage and fortune has carried you through, blessing God
for your prosperity, the which will be by his grace most glorious, and
lasting, according to the prayers of

Your Majesty's Most humble, and most obedient Subject, and servant, Holland.
Paris 1/13. March, 1625.
The Earl of Holland to the Duke.
My dear Lord,
THis Messenger is so rigid, and such an enemy to all Jantileise, as by him I
will not send any news in that kind; but when the little Mercury comes, you
shall know that which shall make you joy, and grieve that you cannot enjoy what
your fate and merit has so justly destined unto you. We have such daily
alarums here out of England from Blanvile, of the beating of his servant, and
at the last the danger, that of late he himself has been in, of being
assassinated in his own house; for the first word that his servant said unto
the King, and the whole Court was, The Ambassador had run such a bazard of his
life, as no man that heard him believed he had escaped with less then 5. or 6.
wounds. Insomuch as your friend Bouteve asked, Fait un belle fine: And this
has so animated this Court, being (as your Lordship knows) apt upon all
occasions to be fired, and ftirred up, as the King has been moved to forbid us
our entries, and liberties here. And yesterday Madam de Blanvile did openly
petition the King to imprison us for the wrongs and injuries done unto her
husband, and his Ambassador, that she feared was by this time dead. But that
had no other effect but to be laughed at. I never (I confess) saw the Queen
Mother in so much distraction and passion, for she never speaks of her Daughter
but with tears, and yesterday with some heat and bitterness to me about it:
the Circumstances I have taken the boldness to present unto his Majesty. That
which distracts me infinitely, is to hear, that they do traduce you as the
cause of all these misfortunes, and that you stir up the King to these
displeasures. And so much impression it has made into the Queen Mother, as
this day at the audience she told me. That you had made the marriage, and were
now, as she imagined, and was informed, resolved to destroy your work. I asked
her what particularitie could make her say, and believe so against the general,
and continual actions and endeavors, that the whole world ought to be
satisfied of your infinite care, and affection, to fasten and tie together a
good, and constant intelligence and friendship between these Crowns. She told
me, that you entreated Madam de St. George to do some service for you to the
Queen, the which she did, and instead of giving her thanks, you threatened the
sending of her away. I told her, Though I had as yet heard nothing of this
particularitie, yet I knew your nature to be so generous, as you would never do
any action unjust. I told her, that she must distinguish between what you say
as Commanded by the King, and what you say of your self: for if it be his
pleasure to make the instrument to convey his will upon any occasion of his
displeasure, you are not to dispute, but to obey his Command in that, and in
all other things. I told her farther, that I saw the continual malice of the
Ambassador, that invents daily injuries and falsehoods of your Lordship, to
unload himself from his insolences and faults; but I hoped that nothing should
light upon your Lordship, but what you deserved, the which to my knowledge was
more value and esteem, then any man in the world could, or can ever merit from
this Kingdom. And I desired her, not to entertain the belief of these things
too hastily, until we had news out of England, that we knew would contradict
all these malicious discourses. And I must tell your Grace, that by a friend
(whom I am tied not to name) I was showed the private Lettter that Blanvile
wrote to the King, in the which he sent him the whole proceedings of the
Parliament; and concludes they will ruin you, naming great factions against
you, and as it were a necessity to destroy you. But I hope he, and the whole
world here will fall, before any misfortunes should fall upon so generous, and
so noble a deserver of his Master, and so excellent a friend and Patron unto

Your Graces Most humble, and most obedient servant, Holland.
Postscript.
THough the Ambassador deserves nothing but contempt and disgrace as Blanvile,
yet I hope as Ambassador he shall receive (for public Honors and accustomed
respect to Ambassadors) all possible satisfaction, and it will be conceived a
generous action.



My dearest Lord,
ALL the joy I have, has such a flatnesse set upon it by your absence from
hence, as I protest to God, I cannot relish it as I ought; for though beauty
and love I find in all perfection and fullness, yet I vex, and languish to find
impediments in our designs and services for you: first in the business, for I
find our mediation must have no place with this King concerning a Peace. We
must only use our power with those of the Religion, to humble them to
reasonable Conditions, and that done, they would as far as I can guess have us
gone, not being willing that we should be so much as in the Kingdom, when the
Peace is made, for fear the Protestants may imagine, we have had a hand in it.
For our Confederation, made by you at the Hague, they speak so of it, as they
will do something in it, but not so really or friendly as we could wish. But
for these things, you allow me, (I trust) to refer you to the general Dispatch:
I come now to other particulars; I have been a careful Spy how to observe
intentions, and affections toward you. I find many things to be feared, and
none to be assured of a safe and real welcome. For the king
continues in his suspects, making (as they say) very often discourses of it,
and is willing to hear Villanes say, That the heart
has infinite affections, you imagine which way. They say there is whispered
amongst the foolish young Bravado's of the Court, That he is not a good
Frenchman that suffers anchor
to return out of France, considering the reports that are raised, many such
bruits fly up and down. I have since my coming given Queen Mother by way of
discourse occasion to say somewhat concerning your coming, as the other night
when she complained to me, That things were carried harshly in England toward
France; I then said, That the greatest unkindnesse and harshnesse came from
hence, even to forbid your coming hither, a thing so strange, and so unjust, as
our Master had cause, and was infinitely sensible of it. She fell into
discourse of you, desiring you would respect, and love her daughter; and
likewise that she had, and would ever command her to respect you above all men,
and follow all your Councels (the matter of her Religion excepted) with many
professions of value and respect unto your Person; but would never either
excuse what I complained of, or invite you to come upon that occasion, But
though neither the business gives me cause to persuade your coming, nor my
reason for the matter of your safety; yet know you are the most happy,
unhappie man alive, for the heart
is beyond imagination right, and would do things to destroy her fortune,
rather then want satisfaction in her mind. I dare not speak as I would, I have
ventured I fear too much, considering what practices accompany the malice of
the people here. I tremble to think whether this will find a safe conveyance
unto you. Do what you will, I dare not advise you; to come is dangerous, not to
come is unfortunate. As I have lived with you, and only in that enjoy my
happiness, so I will die with you, and I protest to God for you, to do you the
least service, etc.

Postscript.
HAve no doubt of the party that accompanied me, for he is yours with his
soul, and dares not now (as things go) advise your coming.



Mr. Lorkin to the Duke, the 30. of August, 1625.
May it please your Grace,
FRom an honest and truly devoted heart, to receive the sacrifice of most
humble thanks, which come here offered for that excess of favor, which I
behold in those gracious lines, that you are so nobly pleased to honor me
withal; and which derive unto me farther, the height of all contentment, his
Majesty's gracious acceptance of my poor endeavors; which howsoever they
cannot shoot up to any high matter from so low an earth, yet (in their greatest
force) are eternally vowed (with the price of my dearest blood) as to his
Masters faithful service in the first place, so to your Graces in the next; who
have received I doubt not ere this, what my former promised in the Savoyard
Ambassadors behalf, and that as well from his own pen, as mine. But this State
is very Euripus, that flows, and reflowes 7. times a day, and in whose ways
is neither constancy, nor truth. The changes your Grace will find in my
Letters to my Lord Conway, whereunto I therefore make reference, because I
suppose, there will be but one Lecture thereof to his Majesty, and your self.

There in likewise your Grace will see a sudden commandment laid upon
Mounsieur de Blanvile premire Gentilhome de la chamber du Roy speedily to
provide himself to go extraordinary Ambassador into England. The cause thereof
I rove at in my dispatch, taking my aim from two dark speeches to Queen
Mother, and the Cardinal I have since learned the interpretation of the riddle,
not from the Cardinals lips (who yet being sounded by me, pretended a further
end then Ville-aux-cleres had done, viz; to entertain good intelligence betwixt
the Queen of England, and your Grace, and to do you all the best offices, and
services that are possible;) but from the Duke de Chevereux, who (whatsoever
pretexts may be taken) makes the true ends of that Voyage to be, first, to try
whether this man can mend what (they conceive here) the Duke has marred, in
showing himself more a servant to the King of England, then to his own King and
Master. Secondly, to spy and discover what he can; and (according as he shall
find cause) to frame Cabals, and factions, whereunto he is esteemed very
proper, being charactarized with the marks of a most subtle, prying,
penetrating, and dangerous man.

And therefore as an Antidote against the poison he brings, the Duke gives this
Caveat aforehand, That every one keep close, and covert toward him, and avoid
familiarity with him, though (otherwise) he wishes a kind and honorable
entertainment.

Thus much I received from the Dukes own lips yesternight; ( Bonocil being
witness, perhaps Counselor of all that passed) he promised a memorial in
writing this day, which I have attended till this evening, and even now receive
it.

I have not touched the least syllable hereof to my Lord Conway, because I
think both your Graces, and the Duke de Chevereux's will may concur in this,
that these things be not subject to many eyes.

Even now the Savoyard Ambassador sends an express Messenger unto me to
hasten to Fountain Bleau. Perhaps it may be to facilitate the Treaty with
Rochel, by either some Letter, or Journey of mine thither.

But upon the conference I have had with the Duke de Chevereux, I shall
temporise, till I hear his Majesty's pleasure, or see good evidences of
generous effects like to ensue. Being desirous to shape my course so, as may be
most acceptable to his Majesty, and pleasing to your Grace, whose virtues I
adore, in quality of

Your Graces Most humble, most faithful, and most obedient servant, Tho. Lorkin.
Postscript.
THe Duke de Chevereux expects the Cipher from your Grace, if I be not deceived.



Mr. Lorkin to the Duke 17. September, 1625.
May it please your Grace,
TO read and consider two contrary advertisements; the one given me on Monday
evening by des Porches, who repeating what he had told me before, (D'avoir
destrompe la Royne mere en mil, et mil chooses) assured me, that her thoughts
were now so far changed from what they were, as she remitted every thing to his
Majesty's pleasure to do what he list, (provided, that he attempted not upon
the conscience of the Queen her Daughter, which was the only point she was
tender in, and scrupulous) that she had written a very sharp Letter, full of
good lessons, and instructions to her, that she had as clear a heart to your
Grace, as was possible; had sent for Blanvil expressly to alter his
instructions, and that howsoever he (like a hollow-hearted man) had uttered in
confidence to a friend of his, That he would persuade the Queen of England to
put on a reconciled countenance for a time, till the way should be better
prepared to give your Grace a dead lift, yet the Queen Mothers intentions were
assuredly sincere and good. The Savoyards Ambassadors voyage was not then
resolved, but his Secretary prepared to make it in his room. Of whom Pocheres
(by the way) gave this touch. That there was a great correspondence between
Mademoiselle de Truges, and him (contracted upon occasions of frequent visits,
that had passed betwixt her Mother, and the Ambassador) and that therefore a
careful eye was to be had of him.

Another (who must be namelesse) sent for me yesterday in the forenoone to tell
me, that Pere Berule's errand hither was only to make outcries against the
decree, or proclamation against the Catholics, and to accuse your Grace as
the Principal, if not the only author, who was now of a seeming friend become a
deadly foe. That the Earl of Arundel had (out of his respect unto this State)
purposely absented himself, that he might not be guilty of so pernicious a
Council. That your Grace and my Lord of Holland, had both but very slippery
hold in his Majesty's affections; that if this King would employ his credit as
he might, it would be no hard matter to root you both out thence, that there
were good preparatives for it already, and that my Lords Arundel, and Pembroke
would join hands and heads together to accomplish the effect. Whereupon
Blainville was sent for back to be more particularly instructed in the ways
how to compass it; and would speedily post away in diligence. The same party
added, that the propositions which the Marquess de Fiatt had made bout the
League, and Fleet, were before Brule's arrival somewhat well tasted, but since
slighted, as those, that became cheap (by their offer to diverse others, as well
as them) that the said Marquess should have visited Blainville at Paris, and
sounded him about his errand after this manner.

First, whether he had order to disnestle Madam de St. George? Whereto the
answer was, No; and that it was against all reason of State so to do; and when
the other replied, that the world was come to a bad pass, if reason of State
descended as low as her, Blainville remained silent.

Secondly, whether he had commission to introduce the Duchess of Buckingham
and the Countess of Denbigh into the Queens bedchamber. Answer was made, that
it was a nice, and tender point, and if that were once condescended to, they
would be continually whispering in the Queens ear, how dear she would be to
the King her Husband, how plausible, and powerful among the people, how beloved
of all, if she would change her religion, against which they were in conscience
here bound to provide, and therefore conclude with a refusal of that likewise.

Thirdly, whether he carried any good instructions about an offensive, or
defensive league whereunto the negative was still repeated; but that he carried
brave offers for the entertainment of Mausfelt. And when the Marquess replied,
that if that were all the contentment he carried, he feared she would find but
a very cold welcome; the other added, that perhaps he might be an Instrument to
make the Queen and Duke friends. This were good (quoth the Marquess) if the
Queen had not as much need of the Dukes friendship, as the Duke of hers, and
upon these terms they parted. The same lips that utterred all this, gave
caution likewise against the Savoyard Ambassador, as a cunning, deep,
hollow-hearted man. And being felt by me, how his pulse beat toward Porcheres,
told me he was a mercenarie man, and no ways to be trusted. In the issue of
all this, his Council was, That your Grace would consider well your own
strength, and what ground you have in his Majesty's favor, If it be solid, and
good, then a Bravado will not do amiss (may be powerful here, to make them to
see their own error, and to walk upright) so it end with a good close: but if
your station be not sure, then he Counsels to prevent the storm; for to break
with all Spain, France, Puritanes, Papists, were not wisdom; And desires that
by any means you instantly dispatch a Currier to me to represent the true
state of things at home, and how you desire matters should be ordered for your
service here abroad, so that there may be fabriqued a more solid contentment to
your Grace whose, hands I most humbly kiss in quality of

Your Graces Most humble, most faithful, most obeent, and most obliged Servant,
Tho. Lorkin.
Postscript.
IF my stay be intended long, it will be necessary that I use a Cipher, which I
humbly beseech your Grace to send me, or to give me leave to frame one as I can.

As I was closing up my Letter, Mr. Gerbier arrived, who has been somewhat
indisposed in his health by the way, but now is reasonably well God be thanked.
His coming is very seasonable, and I assure my self will be useful.

By the discourse, I have had with Mr. Gerbier, I see a little clearer into the
state of things here, and think Porcheres his advertisement may be truer, as
being perhaps grounded upon knowledge, the other springing only upon
conjecture, built upon Berult's clamours, and overtures, and the sudden
sending for Mounsieur Blanville back. Your Grace will see day in all shortly.
But assuredly the latter advice comes from a heart that is affectionately
devoted to your Graces service. This Bearer will kiss your Graces hands from
the Author, and thereby you will know his name, which he stipulated might not
come in writing



The Lord Herbert to his Majesty.
My most Gracious Sovereign,
NOw, that, I thank God for it, his Highness according to my continual
prayers, has made a safe, and happy return, unto your Sacred Majesty's
presence, I think my self bound by way of Complete obedience to these
Commandments I received from your Majesty, both by Mr. Secretary Calvert, and
my Brother Henry, to give your Majesty an account of that sense, which the
general sort of people does entertain here concerning the whole frame and
Context of his Highness voyage. It is agreed on all parts, that his Highness
must have received much contentment, in seeing two great Kingdoms, and
consequently in enjoining that satisfaction, which Princes, but rarely, and not
without great peril, obtain. His Highness discretion, diligence, and Princely
behavior every where likewise is much praised. Lastly, since his Highness
journey has fallen out so well, that his Highness is come back, without any
prejudice to his person, or dignity, they say the success has sufficiently
commended the Council. This is the most common censure (even of the biggest
party, as I am informed) which I approve in all, but in the last point, in the
delivery whereof I find something to dislike, and therefore tell them, that
things are not to be judged alone, by the success, and that, when they would
not look so high as Gods providence, without which no place is secure, they
might find even in reason of State, so much, as might sufficiently warrant his
Highness person, and liberty to return.

I will come from the ordinary voice to the selecter judgment, of the
Ministers of State, and more intelligent people in this Kingdom, who, though
they nothing vary from the above recited opinion, yet as more profoundly
looking into the state of this long treated of Alliance betwixt your Sacred
Majesty, and Spain, in the persons of his Highness, and the Infanta, they
comprehended their sentence thereof (as I am informed) in three Propositions.

First, that the protestation which the King of Spain made to his Highness
upon his departure, whereby he promised to chase away, and disfavour all those,
who should oppose this marriage, does extend no further, then to the said Kings
Servants, or at furthest, not beyond the temporal Princes, his Neighbors, so
that the Pope being not included herein, it is, though his consent must be yet
obtained, and consequently, that the business is in little more forwardness
then when it first began.

Secondly, that the Pope will never yield his consent, unless your Sacred
Majesty, grant some notable privileges and advantage to to the Roman
Catholic religion in your Sacred Majesty's Kingdoms.

Thirdly, that the said King of Spain would never insist, upon obtaining those
privileges, but that he more desires, to form a party in your Sacred Majesty's
Kingdoms, which he may keep always obsequious to his will, then to maintain a
friendly correspondence between your Sacred Majesty, and himself. I must not
in the last place omit to acquaint your Sacred Majesty, very particularly,
with the sense which was expressed by the bons Francois, and body of those of
the Religion, who heartily wish, that the same Greatness which the King of
Spain does so affect over all the world, and still maintains even in this
country, which is to be Protector of the Jesuited, and Bigott party, your
Sacred Majesty would embrace, in being defender of our faith. The direct
answer to which, though I evade, and therefore reply little more, then that
this Counsel was much fitter, when the union in Germany did subsist, then at
this time? Yet do I think my self obliged to represent the affection they bear
unto your Sacred Majesty. This is as much as is come to my notice, concerning
that point, your Sacred Majesty gave me in charge, which therefore I have
plainly laid open, before your Sacred Majesty's eyes, as understanding well,
that Princes never receive greater wrong, then when the Ministers, they put in
trust, do palliate and disguise those things, which it concerns them to know.
For the avoiding whereof let me take the boldness to assure your Sacred
Majesty, that those of this Kings Council here, will use all means they can,
both to the King of Spain, and to the Pope (In whom they pretend to have very
particular interest) not only to interupt, but if it be possible to break off
you Sacred Majesty's Alliance with Spain. For which purpose the Count de
Tilliers has strict command, to give al punctual advice, that accordingly they
may proceed. It rests, that I most humbly beseech your Sacred Majesty to take
my free relation of these particulars in good part, since I am of no faction,
nor have any passion, or interest; but faithfully to perform that service; and
duty which I owe to your Sacred Majesty, for whose perfect health, and
happiness, I pray with the devotion, of

From Merton Castle the 31. of October, 1623. Still No. Your Sacred Majesty's
most obedient, most Loyal, and most affectionate Subject and Servant, Herbert.

Mr. Edward Clark to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
I Have been hitherto very unfit (by reason of my sickness) to give your
Lordship any account of my time at Madrid. So that without your Lordships
favorable construction, I may be thought forgetful of the trust committed to
my charge, and the rather, in that as yet your Lordship has only heard what I
have done, but not why. I presume I have faithfully followed the Princes
direction, and on such probable inducements, as will I hope both in your
Highnesses and your Lordships opinion plead my excuse at least. The very day
the Prince arrived at St. Anderas, my Lord of Bristol, seeing me very weak,
told me he was very sorry, I was not able to perform the journie for England,
for that now there was an extraordinary occasion of a dispatch, not only in
respect of the ratification come the night before; but because also they were
almost come to a final conclusion of all articles, which were to be engrossed,
and signed the next day. Hereupon I was inquisitive to know what assurance he
had the Ratification was come: He answered, that, that very day, he had been
summoned to attend the Junto, and that there they had earnestly pressed him,
that the Articles might be speedily drawn up, and signed, since they had now
received full warrant to authorize them to proceed; And that the next day was
appointed accordingly. Thereupon unwilling to omit the present opportunity,
conceiving withal the purpose of the Princes Letter to be, either to express
his Highness further pleasure before the meeting of the Junto, or to prevent
the concluding of some other particular Article they might otherwise fall upon:
I delivered his Letter to his Lordship (pretending it came to my hands amongst
other Letters that same day) I found him exceedingly troubled in reading it,
nor did he forbear to tell me, it must for a time be concealed; for he feared,
if they should come to the knowledge of it they would give order to stay the
Prince. Upon these motives, and in this manner I parted with it, wherein I
humbly submitting my self to his Highness Construction, I remain.

Your Graces humblest servant to command, Ed. Clark.
Madrid, 1. October. 1623.
Mr. Edward Clark to the Duke.
My Lord,
THe Infanta's preparation for the Disposorio was great, but greater sorrow
(good Lady) to see it deferred. It has bred in them all some distraction. The
multitude know not what to conjecture, what to say, but cry Piden el
Palatinato. They confess the demand just, but unseasonable, and do publish,
that (the Disposorio past) the Infanta on her knees should have been a suitor
to the King to restore it, making it thereby her act, and drawing the
obligation wholly to her. I must confess, I want faith to believe it, and the
rather, because I see it reflect secretly, and maliciously upon your Lordship,
who are made the author of all the impediments that happen, not by your
enemies only, but by those that should suppress it. Which troubles me so
much, that I hasten all I can my return, since I know no other then to be

Your Graces faithful servant, Edw. Clark.
Madrid, 6. Sept. 1623.
Sir Anthony Ashley to the Duke.
May it please your good Lordship,
IF any thing had happened worth your knowledge, I had either come or sent to
Theobalds in your absence, being ascertained that your Lordship had been
already particularly informed of what passed in the Higher House betwixt the
Earl of A. and the L. S. which is the only thing of note, and is thought will
beget some noveltie.

Your Lordship may be most assured, that your Adversaries continue their
meetings and conferences here in Holborn, how to give his Majesty some foul
distaste of you, as making you the only author of all grievances and
oppressions whatsoever for your private ends. And I hope to be able within few
days (if promise be kept) to give you good overture of a mutual oath taken to
this purpose amongst them.

The rumor lately spread touching his Majesty's untimely pardon of the late
Lord Chancellours Fine and Imprisonment, with some other favors intended
toward him, (said to be procured by your Lordships only intimation) has
exceedingly exasperated the rancor of the ill affected, which albeit it be
false, and unlikely, because very unseasonably; It does yet serve the present
turn, for the increase of malice against you. I can but inform your Lordship of
what I understand, you may please to make use thereof as your self thinks
best.

I most humbly entreat your good Lordship to keep Letters of this nature either
in your own Cabinet, or to make Heretics of them: for I am well acquainted
with the disposition of some Penmen in Court. Upon Message even now received
of my poor Daughters sudden dangerous sickness, I am constrained unmannerly
to post unto her, being the only comfort I have in this world, and do purpose
God willing a speedy return. In the mean time, and even with my hearty prayer
I commend your good Lordship to Gods merciful and safe keeping.

This 12th. of May, 1621. Your honorable good Lordships faithfully devoted, A.
A.

Sir Wa. Rawleigh to the Duke, 12. Aug.
IF I presume too much, I humbly beseech your Lordship to pardon me, especially
in presuming to write to so great and worthy a person, who has been told that
I have done him wrong. I heard it but of late, but most happy had I been, if I
might have disproved, that villainy against me, when there had been no
suspicion, that the desire to save my life, had presented my excuse.

But my worthy Lord, it is not to excuse my self that I now write: I cannot;
for I have now offended my Sovereign Lord: for all past, even all the world,
and my very enemies have lamented my, loss, whom now if his Majesty's mercy
alone do not lament, I am lost. Howsoever, that which does comfort my soul in
this offense is, that even in the offense it self, I had no other intent then
his Majesty's service, and to make his Majesty know, That my late enterprise
was grounded upon a truth, and which with one Ship speedily set out, I meant to
have assured, or to have died; being resolved (as it is well known) to have
done it from Plymouth, had I not been restrained. Hereby I hoped not only to
recover his Majesty's gracious opinion, but to have destroyed all those
malignant reports which had been spread of me. That this is true, that
Gentleman whom I so much trusted, (my Keeper) and to whom I opened my heart,
cannot but testify, and wherein if I cannot be believed living, my death shall
witness: Yea that Gentleman cannot but avow it, that when we came back toward
London, I desired to save no other Treasure, then the exact description of
those places in the Indies. That I meant to go hence as a discontented man, God
I trust, and mine own Actions will dissuade his Majesty. Whom neither the
loss of my estate, thirteen years imprisonment, and the denial of my pardon
could beat from his service, nor the opinion of being accounted a fool, or
rather distract, by returning as I did, balanced with my love to his Majesty's
person, and estate, had no place at all in my heart.

It was that last severe Letter from my Lords for the speedy bringing of me
up, and the impatience of dishonor, that first put me in fear of my life, or
enjoying it in a perpetual imprisonment, never to recover my reputation lost,
which strengthened me in my late, and too late lamented resolution, if his
Majesty's mercy do not abound: if his Majesty do not pity my age, and scorn
to take the extremest and utmost advantage of my errors: if his Majesty in
his great charity do not make a difference between offenses proceeding from a
life-saving-natural impulsion, without all ill intent, and those of an ill
heart; and that your Lordship, remarkable in the world for the Nobleness of
your disposition, do not vouchsafe to become my Intercessour, whereby your
Lordship shall bind an hundred Gentlemen of my kindred to honor your memory,
and bind me for all the time of that life which your Lordship shall beg for me,
to pray to God that you may ever prosper, and over-bind me to remain

Your most humble servant, W. Rawleigh.

Sir Henry Yelverton to the Duke, 15. March, 1623.
May it please your Grace,
MY humble heart and affection has wrote many lines, and presented many
Petitions to your Grace before this time, though none legible but one sent by
my Lord Rochford, within five days after your most welcomed arrival from Spain.

I have learned the plain phrase of honest speech. My Lord, I have honored
your name long, and your own virtue much. I never found misfortune greater then
this, that still sailing after you in all humble desires of duty, I was still
cast behind you. I excuse nothing, wherein your Grace may judge me faulty, but
will be glad to expiate my errors at any price.

Your noble heart (I hope) harbors no memory of what did then distaste you.
Your own merits which have so much ennobled you, will be the more complete, if
I may but merit your forgetfulness of wrongs past. If I seek your Grace before
I deserve it, enable me I beseech you to Deserve, that I may seek. If any, on
whom you have cast your eye most, endear himself more to your service, then I
shall; let me not follow the vintage at all. Till this day I feared the relish
of sour Grapes, though I have sought you with many broken sleeps. But this
Noble Earl, whose honor for this work shall ever with me be second to yours,
has revived me, with the assurance of your gracious pardon, and liberty to
hope, I may be deemed your servant.

I protest to God, it is not the affluence of your honor makes me joy in it,
nor the power of your Grace, that trains me on to seek it, but let the trial of
all your fortunes speak thus much for me, that I will follow you, not as Cyrus
his Captains and Soldiers followed him, the one for spoil, the other for
place: but if with safety to your Grace, though with peril to my self, I may
serve you, let me die if I do it not, rather then want any longer, what my
humble love ever led me to, and I still affect the honor

To be yours, Henry Yelverton.

Sir John Eliot to the Dake, 8. November. 1623.
Right Honorable,
With what affection I have served your Grace, I desire rather it should be
read in my actions, then my words, which made me sparing in my last relation to
touch those difficulties, wherewith my Letters have been checked, that they
might the more fully speak themselves. I shall not seek to gloss them now, but
as they have been, leave them to your Graces acceptance, which I presume so
noble, that scandal or detraction cannot decline it. It were an injury of your
worth, which I dare not attempt, to insinuate the opinion of any merit by false
colors, or pretenses, or with hard circumstances to endear my labors, and
might beget suspicion, sooner then assurance in your credit, which I may not
hazard. My innocence I hope needs not these, nor would I shadow the least
error under your protection. But where my services have been faithful, and not
altogether vain, directed truly to the honor and benefit of your place, only
suffering upon the disadvantage of your absence, I must importune your Grace to
support my weakness, that it may cause no prejudice of your rights and
liberties, which I have studied to preserve, though with the loss of mine own.
My insistance therein has exposed me to a long imprisonment, and great charge,
which still increases, and threatens the ruin of my poor fortunes, if they be
not speedily prevented. For which, as my endeavors have been wholly yours. I
most humbly ceave your Graces favor both to my self, and them; In which I am
devoted

Your Graces thrice-humble Servant, J. Eliot.

The Earl of Oxford to the Duke.
My Lord,
I Cannot but believe that I have had some undeserved ill offices done me unto
your Lordship, otherwise I should not find this difficulty in being preferred,
if not before, at least equally in balance with my Accusers. It is common unto
all men's understanding, that it is not the guilt of the accused, but the legal
and just proceeding, which cleares the Kings honor, and this I do, and ever
will acknowledge to have been held toward me. Neither was it ever known, that
the Kings Grace, the more it came sweetened with his favor, did lessen or
diminish his honor, but rather seemed as a luster to make his goodness shine
brighter, and oblige the Receiver in a more strict Tie of gratitude. My Lord,
it cannot wrong you to oblige me to your service, nor add reputation to you
throw me upon Rocks. I appeal to the King, and your own Conscience, whether
ever I have harbored any treasonable thoughts, either against his Majesty, or
his issue, that should make me incapable of receiving his grace, without
imputation to those faithful and dutiful respects, with which I have ever
served his Majesty; If it shall please him to line me out my path to death
(the period whither we must all travel to) by imprisonment, I shall be far from
repining at the sentence, but with all humbleness, will undergo it, and employ
my heartiest prayers for the long continuance of his honor and happiness.

I beseech your Lordship receive my Character of what I am, and have ever been
toward you, not from Conjectures and reports of others, but from my own mouth,
and actions. For yet I have reason to suspect your opinion of me, else sure I
should have found better fruits of your power. I was always (as much as lay in
me) desirous to outstrip, rather then come short of any in doing you service,
and the same affections still remain with me, of the truth of which I pray you
be confident.

To this only I will add one request more, which is, That since your Lordship
is pleased to mediate with his Majesty for my freedom, you will procure it so
free from rubs, as that my obligation may be the greater, which I will ever
willingly and faithfully pay unto your Lordship in all respects, like him, who
truly is

Your Lordships, etc. H. O.

The Lady Purbeck to the Duke.
My Lord,
THough you may judge what pleasure there is in the conversation of a man in
the distemper you see your Brother in; yet the duty I owe to a husband, and
the affection I bear him, (which sickness shall not diminish,) makes me much
desire to be with him, to add what comfort I can to his afflicted mind, since
his only desire is my Company. Which if it please you to satisfy him in, I
shall with a very good will suffer with him, and think all but my duty, though
I think every wife would not do so. But if you can so far dispense with the
Laws of God, as to keep me from my Husband, yet aggravate it not by
restraining from me his means, and all other contentments, but which I think is
rather the part of a Christian, you especially ought much rather to study
comforts for me, then to add ills to ills, since it is the marriage of your
Brother makes me thus miserable. For if you please but to consider not only the
lamentable estate I am in, deprived of all Comforts of a husband, and having no
means to live of: besides falling from the hopes my fortune then did promise
me, for you know very well I came no beggar to you, though I am like so to be
turned off.

For your own honor, and Conscience sake, take some course to give me
satisfaction, to tie my tongue from crying to God, and the world for vengeance
for the unworthy dealing I have received. And think not to send me again to my
Mothers, where I have stayed this quarter of a year, hoping (for that my Mother
said you promised.) order should be taken for me, but I never received penny
from you. Her confidence of your Nobleness made me so long silent; but now
believe me, I will sooner beg my bread in the streets to all your dishonours,
then any more trouble my friends, and especially my Mother, who was not only
content to afford us part of the little means she has left her, but whilst I
was with her, was continually distempered with devised Tales, which came from
your Family, and withal lost your good opinion, which before she either had,
or you made show of it; but had it been real, I cannot think her words would
have been so translated, nor in the power of discontented servants Tales to
have ended it.

My Lord, if the great honor you are in, can suffer you to have so mean a
thought as of so miserable a creature as I am, so made by too much Credulity
of your fair promises, which I have waited for performance of almost these five
years: And now it were time to despair, but that I hope you will one day be
your self, and be governed by your own noble thoughts, and then I am assured to
obtain what I desire, since my desires be so reasonable, and but for mine own.
Which whether you grant or no, the affliction my poor husband is in, (if it
continue) will keep my mind in a continual purgatory for him, and will suffer
me to sign my self no other, but

Your unfortunate Sister, F. Purbeck.

Dr. Done to the Marquess of Buckingham, 13th. September. 1621.
My most honored Lord,
I Most humbly beseech your Lordship to afford this ragg of paper a room
amongst your evidences. It is your evidence not for a Manor, but for a man.
As I am a Priest it is my sacrifice of prayer to God for your Lordship; and as
I am a Priest, made able to subsist, and appear in Gods service by your
Lordship, it is a sacrifice of my self to you. I deliver this paper as my
Image; and I assist the power of any Conjurer, with this imprecation upon my
self, that as he shall tear this paper, this picture of mine, so I may be torn
in my fortune, and in my same, if ever I have any corner in my heart,
dispossessed of a zeal to your Lordships service. His Majesty has given me a
royal Key into your Chamber, leave to stand in your presence, and your Lordship
has already such a fortune, as that you shall not need to be afraid of a
suitor, when I appear there. So that I protest to your Lordship, I know not
what I want, since I cannot suspect, nor fear my self for ever doing, or
leaving undone any thing by which I might forfeit that title, of being always

Your Lordships, etc. J. D.

Dr. Done to the Duke.
My Honored Lord,
ONce I adventured to say to the Prince his Highness, That I was sure he would
receive a book from me, the more graciously, because it was dedicated to your
Grace: I proceed justly upon the same confidence, that your Grace will accept
this, because it is his by the same title. If I had not overcome that
reluctation, which I had in my self of representing devotions, and
mortifications to a young and active Prince, I should not have put them into
your presence, who have done so much, and have so much to do in this world, as
that it might seem enough to think seriously of that. No man in the body of
story, is a full president to you, nor may any future man promise himself and
adaequation to his precedent, if he make you, his. Kings have discerned the
seeds of high virtues in many men, and upon that Gold, they have put their
stamp, their favors upon those persons: But then those persons have labored
under the jealousy of the future Heir; And some few, have had the love of
Prince, and King, but not of the Kingdom, and some of that too, and not of the
Church; God has united your Grace so to them all, that as you have received
obligations from the King, and Prince, so you have laid obligations upon the
Church and state. They above, love you out of their judgment, because they
have loved you: and we below, love you out of our thankfulness, because you
have loved us. Gods privy Seal is the testimony of a good conscience, and his
broad-Seal is the outward bessings of this life. But since his Pillar of fire,
was seconded with a Pillar of Cloud, and that all his temporal blessings have
some partial Eclipses, and the purest consciences some remorses: so though he
have made your way to Glory, Glory; and brought you in the arms and bosom,
of his Vicegerent, into his own arms and bosom, yet there must come a minute
of twilight in a natural death. And as the reading of the actions of great men,
may assist you for great actions, so for this one necessary descent of dying,
(which I hope shall be the only step of Lownes, that ever you shall pass by,
and by that late) you may receive some Remembrances, from the Meditations and
Devotions of

Your Graces Devoutest Servant, J. Done.

Sir John Hipsley to the Duke.
My Noble Lord,
I Find that all my Lord of Bristols actions are so much extolled, that what
you command me to say is hardly believed. I will say no more in it, but leave
the rest to Mr: Greihams, only this, that you have written much to the King in
some man's behalf, and Mr. Gresley has a 100. a year given him during his life,
all which I think is without your knowledge; And Mr. Killegrew has the like,
that came for your sake after the other was granted. Mr. Greihams can tell you
how that came. My Lord of Southampton has offered his son to marry with my
Lord Treasurers Daughter, and tells him this reason, that now is the time he
may have need of friends, but it is refused as yet; the event I know not what
that will be.

I have spoken to the King of all that you gave me in command, and he does
protest, that what he has done, was merely for your sake, and indeed he is
very careful of all your business, as if you were here your self; but yet for
Gods-sake make what haste you may home for fear of the worst. For the carriage
of Captain Hall, I will not trouble you, till you come home, only this by the
way, that my Lord Treasurer has it; but upon what terms I know not nor indeed
desire you should be troubled with it. Sir George Goring came home but this
last night, and is gone to the Court, and desires to be excused for writing to
you. My Lady Hatton, and my Lady Purbeck came home with him from the Hague.

My Lord of Arundel has not been at Court since the death of his son. I fear
the news, that Charles Gleman did show you was true. For I can assure you
Marquess Hamilton was much troubled till I had spoken with him. There be some
have done no good offices betwixt you. Pray have a care of the Letter, I mean
the man Mr. Gleman did show you, and keep as many friends as you may. I have
spoken with no man, but my Lord Keeper who is yours, or not his own as he
swears. And Mr. secretary Conway is yours body, and soul; I never heard of
the like of him, for he flies at all men, that be not yours. Here is much
admiration, that they hear not from you, but I thank God, the King is not
troubled at it, for I do assure him, that it is the better, that he hears not
from you: for now he may be confident, that you keep your day in coming away,
which does much please him. I will write nothing of my own business, though
there be nothing done in it, but do hope, that you will not see your Servant
perish.

If I be too tedious, I pray pardon me, it is my love that makes me so, and
yet I have an humble suite unto you, which is to beg at your hands for
patience; for now is the time to show it or never; for all the eyes of the
world are upon you and this is the time to win Honor, and fame; and for
Gods-sake carry the business with patience betwixt my Lord of Bristol, and
you; for here be those that do laugh in their sleeves at you both. I beseech
you let me hear from you, what you will command me, for I will do nothing (as
near as I can) but what will give content: For you have that power in me, that
you need but say, and it is done (if it lie in my power) so shall you ever
command

Your faithful, and obedient Servant, till death, Jo. Hipsley
London 1. September. 1623.
Sir Dudley Carleton to the Marquess of Buckingham.
Right Honorable,
BY the dispatch of the fourteenth of this present (which I sent by Jonson the
Post) I advertised your Honor at large in the two several Letters of the
occurrents of these parts, and therewith sent a copy of my second proposition
which I made the day before in the Assembly of the States General touching the
business of Cleves, and Juliers in conformity to your Honors Letters of the
30th. of the last.

The answer thereunto was deferred until yesterday, and then brought me only by
word of mouth from the States by Mounsieur Magnus of Zealand, and Mounsieur
Zulestein of Vtrecht, and was to this effect, That the States having sent my
former proposition of the third of December to their several provinces, from
which this latter did differ in substance, save only in respect of the time
for the restitution of the Towns, which was prolonged for the space of a
month, all they could do according to the constitution of their government, was
to send this my second proposition likewise unto their provinces, which they
had done the day after I made the same, and until they receive more express
order from their principals, they were to rest upon their former answer.
Wherein they declared their good intentions to accommodate this business, so
it might be with safety to themselves, and satisfaction of their neighbors.
And herein they were to expect the resolution of the Elector of Brandenbergh,
from whom the time did not yet serve, to know his mind. Mean while they humbly
beseech his Majesty to make a gracious construction of their proceedings.

I was the day before with Mounsieur Barnevelt, (who is President this week) to
solicit their answer, who excused himself upon the smalnesse of their number,
many of the States being absent, and of two Provinces all the Deputies: So as
to give a determinate resolution according as was required, they could not: And
to make answer in general terms, since his Majesty rested not satisfied with
the former, he doubted another of the same kind would not please him. So as it
seems this Message in place of an answer in writing, proceeded of his Council.

By discourse both with him, and those which came unto me, upon this subject, I
find their diffidence of the purpose of the Spaniard rather increased then
otherwise, upon the news of Leavies intended on the Archdukes side, to the
number of 9000 foot, and 1000, or 1200 horse; and their delay in taking a
determinate resolution, no way dissuaded, but rather counseled by all other
Princes, who have interest in this business. Their Ambassador at Paris having
advertised them by reiterated Letters, That Don Pedro di Sarmientos his offer
to his Majesty touching the execution of the Treaty of Zanten is absolutely
disavowed by both the Kings of France and Spain. And this French Ambassador
Mounsieur du Maurier, having made it appear unto them, that at Brussels they
have the same conceit of it, as a thing done without authority. Besides, the
Princes of the Union have written lately express Letters to the States,
wherein they persuade them to extraordinary vigilance upon the Spaniards, and
particularly in this business of Cleves, and Juliers, the translated Copies of
which Letters, I send your Honor herewith. And the Prince of Brandenbergh
being young himself, and having his Council divided in opinion, does nothing
absolutely without reference to this State, and he when I put them in mind, how
they themselves were the authors and framers of the Treaty of Zanten, they
stick not to say plainly, Temporamutantur, et nos: so as I am daily more and
more confirmed in my former opinion, That there is no way left to accommodate
this business, but by a private agreement between the Princes Pretendents. But
Strickius, the Agent of Brandenbergh, being absent at Cleves, I do not hear how
this Negotiation proceeds.

Amongst the particularities which passed in discourse between Mounsiour
Maguns, and my self, I insisting upon restitution of the Towns, as the means
to prevent an imminent war upon the quarrel, He asked to whom they should
restore them, unless the Princes were agreed, and that they might know, which
of the Princes should receive him, and whom they should have for their
neighbor. Whereby it appears, this course will on this side remove all
difficulties.

It is advertised hither, by Mounsieur Langrack, the States Ambassador at
Paris, that the apprehension they had in the Court, to have this business
ended without the French Kings intervention, caused Mounsieur de Refuges to be
summoned to make an other journey expressly hither, in regard he had formerly
the managing thereof, Notwithstanding that Mounsieur de la Nove was already
named for this extraordinary Embassage: But Refuges excusing himself upon his
indisposition, sent all his memorial of what passed, when he was here in the
treaty of Zanten, with his private opinion upon the whole matter to serve as
an instruction to la Nove.

By the other Letters of the 28. of this present Still No. Mounsieur Langrack
has given this State many important advertisements, as first, that he has
obtained of the French Kng a continuance of the succors of the 3. Regiments of
foot, and 2. Troops of horse of that Nation for one year longer,
notwithstanding the opposition of the Spanish, and Archdukes Ambassadors, who
advised the recalling of them upon occasion of the present troubles in France.
That there is order given and assignation for 120000 Crowns toward the
arrearages of their pay. That a resolution is taken in that Court by the advice
of the new Councillors, contrary to the opinion of the old, to prosecute the
Princes by war, and maintain the Kings authority henceforward by force. That to
this effect the King desires the State should perform their promises of sending
toward the river of Bordeaux 5. men of war. That he likewise requires of them
in conformity of the last treaties betwixt the Crown, and this Stat, an
assistance of men to the number of the French, which are here in service, under
some good Commander; But the French themselves, the King will not have, for
fear, when they shall come into France, of their revolting to the Princes. That
he demands free passage through these Countries down the Mause, and the Rhene
of 3000. Soldiers, with their arms, which are leaived by the Count John
Giacomo Belioyosa in Luke-Land, and thereabouts, and shipping to transport them
into France.

All these particulars were moved unto him (as he writes) by the Marshal de
Anchre, to which he adds, That the King is so much incensed against the Duke of
Bovillon, for seeking to this State for protection, by these Letters whereof I
advertised your Honor in my last, that there is a resolution taken to declare
him Criminel de lose Majestate.

These Grauntes are so scantie (the continuance of the French Troops in the
service of the State, being but for a year only, and the payment of them
arriving only to the tenth part of what is already due) that they here
interpret them to proceed from the Marshal de Aucre Pour tenir (as they say) le
be en Leau, and the demands are so large and extravagant, that they are
thought iniquum petere, ut aequum ferant; Whereby on the one side to keep this
State in devotion to the French King, and on the other to prevent the like
requests of the Princes: for there is small appearance, they will give passage
to so many men through their Countries armed, and commanded by an Italian, who
has born arms against them, and is married into the Arch Dukes Country. And
when it comes to question of sending forces of their own thither, it is like
they will find as good excuses for that point, as they have hitherto done for
the sending of the ships, now three months since promised, and still solicited:
For howsoever the chief Persons here have been long particularly interested and
engaged (as your Honor knows) by near dependence on this Crown, I find them
of late very much alienated in consideration that it is so much governed by
Spain, which in the end they apprehended will turn to the ruin of this State.

In France they are jealous of this coldness, and have of late expostulated
the matter with Mounsieur Langrack, as if they here did incline to the Princes,
there being, a brute raised in Paris, that Count Maurice would go in Person to
their assistance; whereof the Queen Regent was very sensible; but I do not find
here, that there was any ground for that report.

Here has been lately a fame spread, and nourished by such as desire to weaken
the correspondence betwixt his Majesty and this State, that his Majesty is in
near terms of matching our Prince with Spain. Which report is now the more
credited, by an adviso out of Spain from a secret Minister, this State
entertaines, under color of soliciting Merchants causes. That this match has
been there, by order of the King of Spain debated in the inquisition, and
judged necessary in regard it would serve for introduction of Popery into
England.

This I find to be the Remora of my chief affairs with this State, my pressing
the restitution of the Towns in Cleves and Juliers being thought by many of
these jealous people to hang on this thread, as a thing very acceptable, and
agreeable at this time to the King of Spain, and much advantageous in this
present conjuncture to his affairs; and my insisting upon sending of
Commissioners to his Majesty in the business of our Merchants, they apply
the same way, as if the opinion which would be conceived of this Embassage,
(howsoever Merchants affairs were pretended, the chief intent was to play
Davus in Comaedia) should according to the use of Nitimur in Vetitum, rather
kindle, then quench the desire of the Spaniard, and draw the match to a more
speedy conclusion.

At my last being with Mounsieur Barnevelt, I did expostulate the States delay
of sending Commissioners to his Majesty upon this occasion, as neither
answers to Sir Noel Caron's word and promise to his Majesty, nor to that,
which from his mouth, I did advertise your Lordship of the States inclination
in general, and the resolution in particular of those of Holland. To which he
answered me, That with much difficulty and opposition, he had obtained the
assent of Holland, and that now the matter rested with Zealand, but he doubted,
that his Majesty's restoring the old Company of Merchants, would make a stay of
any farther proceeding, as now less requisite, howsoever, that Sir Noel Carone
had advertised, that notwithstanding this change, he thought the sending of
Commissioners very necessary.

The Questions here about Religion, rest in the same state as I advertised your
Lordship in my last, the Assembly of Holland being separated until the end of
February still. no. when they are to meet again. Mean while a provisional order
is taken, that the Contra-Remonstrants shall continue their preaching in our
English Church, which they have accommodated with Scaffolds, to make it more
capable of their number.

There was much question in this Assembly, whether his Excellency should be
present, or no: but in the end he was called by the major part of voices,
contrary to Mounsieur Barnevelt's opinion, and his authority over-swayed the
matter in favor of the Contra-Remonstrants for the continuance of their
preaching, which it was proposed to hinder by some violent Courses.

By example of this place, there is the like provisional order taken for
preaching at the Brill, and Rotterdam, and certain of the Burghers are
established in Tergow, who were put from their Trade and Commerce, for their
expostulating with the Magistrate upon this quarrel.

I have been spoken unto by diverse particular persons well affected in this
cause, to procure a Letter from his Majesty to his Excellency, whereby to
comfort and encourage him in his Zeal for the maintenance of the true doctrine,
and the professors thereof, against these Novellists and their opinions. Which
I most humbly refer to his Majesty's wisdom, (in case he judge this office
necessary) whether it be fit to be done by Letter or Message, the former of
which, will be of greater virtue, but the latter less subject to cross
construction of the Arminian faction, which your Honor knows how potent it is
here amongst those who have chief rule in this State. Thus I humbly take leave,
ever resting

Your Lordships most faithfully to be commanded, Dudley Carleton.
Hague this 24. Febr. 1616. Still. Vet.
Sir Dudley Carleton to the Duke of Buckingham.
My most honorable Lord,
IMmediately upon receipt of your Lordships Letter concerning Sir John Ogle, I
moved the Prince of Orange not only for his leave for Sir John to go into
England, but likewise for his Letters of recommendation, whereby to give your
Lordship subject, upon some such testimonies of his Excellencies good
satisfaction, to set him upright in his Majesty's favor, both which he granted
unto me: though against the first, he alleged the absence of all the English
Colonels; and touching the latter, he called to mind old matters; which
notwithstanding (upon what I undertook for Sir John's future intentions) he was
content to forget. I did once again upon Sir John's instance, put his
Excellency in mind of his dispatch, wherein I found no difficulty. Since I
find Sir John has changed his purpose of going, and his excuse will be made at
his entreaty by his Excellency, who has since let me know, Though he would
not deny me his leave, yet he is better content (in regard he is so slenderly
accompanied with Colonels, in a time when the State has need of their service
with his stay. So as Sir John has the obligation to your Lordship of a
favorable recommendation, and for his not prevailing himself of his leave when
it was granted, I must leave to himself to render a reason. For my part, having
accomplished what I find by your Lordships Letter, to be agreeable both to his
Majesty's pleasure, and your Lordships, I thought it my duty to advertize.
That there is an ancient difference between Sir Horacio Vere, and Sir Edward
Cecyl, about the extent of their Commands; whereupon follows a great
inconveniencie to the dishonor of our Nation, (which as it appears when they
were last in the field before Reez) are divided hereby, and march, and lodge in
several bodies, and quarters. Much endeavor has been formerly used in these
parts to reconcile them, but all in vain, by reason of some ill Instruments,
who wrought upon both their discontents to set them farther asunder. Now, they
are both in England, and are both written for, to come over; It were a work
worthy of your Lordship to make them understand one another better, and what
they will not yield to of themselves, to overruled by his Majesty's authority.
I may not conceal from your Lordship, that I am entreated by the Prince of
Orange himself to do this office, both with his Majesty, and your Lordship,
wherein he would not be seen himself, because having dealt between them
fruitlesly heretofore, he doubts of the like success now. But when their
agreement shall be made, he will acknowledge his obligation to your Lordship,
and for the better proceeding therein, I sent your Lordship a Copy of an order
formerly set down betwixt them, with the translate of Sir Horacio Vere's
Commission, (both which I had of his Excellency) and likewise the beginning,
and proceeding of their difference, as I have collected the same in brief out
of other men's reports.

The projects I sent your Lordship with my last, of a West-Indian Company
having been proposed to the States of Guelderland for their ratification (who
have the leading voice in the Assembly of the States general, end were ever
least forward in that business) has thus far their allowance, that they will
concur therein with the rest of the Provinces. But withal I do understand, they
have given their Deputies secret charge not to give way thereunto, in case they
find it prejudicial to the Truce. Which makes the matter evident, that the
project of the Company (though it be never so advanced) will stand or fall,
according to the proceeding of the Truce. The expiration whereof approaching so
near, and here being advertisements from Paris, that a French Gentleman one
Belleavium (who was lately employed hither to the Prince of Orange about the
difference betwixt him, and the Prince of Conde) had secret instructions to
sound the States, how they stood affected to the renewing thereof. I have used
all diligence to know how far he went; and am well informed, he has done
nothing therein of Consideration: only this past between him, and his
Excellency.

He telling his Excellency from Mounsieur Desdiguieres, and some of the French
Kings Council, how acceptable the extraordinary Embassage intended from hence
will be in that Court and thereupon persuading a speedy embracing the
opportunity.

From whence (said his Excellency after his round manner) comes this
alteration?

To speak plainly (said he) they fear in France you will renew the Truce
without them, and therefore by your Ambassadors, they would interpose
themselves.

Here are good advertisements both from Bruxels and Paris, that the Spaniards
intent is not to renew the Truce, but to have a Peace proposed with these
plausible conditions; That the King of Spain will pretend nothing in the
Regiment of these United Provinces, nor require any thing of them in the point
of Religion, but leave all in terms as it now stands, with recognition only of
some titular Soveraigntie, which he cannot in honor relinquish.

This is already proposed to France, as a glorious work to establish a settled
Peace in these parts of the world, but with this condition, That if it be not
embraced here, then France shall refuse to give this State any further support,
or countenance, of which it is here believed, that Spain has already obtained
a firm promise in that Court. And that either the like overture is already
made, or will be within few days to his Majesty.

Under which does lie hidden many mysteries much to the advantage of the
Spaniard, and prejudice of this State: for the very proposition of a new
Treaty will distract them here very much, in regard of their unsettlednesse,
and aptness upon any dispute to relapse into faction, besides many
Considerations of importance belonging properly to the Constitution of their
Government, but the acceptance of the old, by renewing of the Truce upon the
former terms, for so many years, more, or less, as shall be thought fitting,
will (in my poor opinion (which notwithstanding is not slenderly grounded) take
place, without much difficulty. The importance of this business, has made me
give your Lordship this trouble, and your Lordship may be pleased to let his
Majesty understand as well that little as is done by Mounsieur Belleavium, as
what they here conceive to be further intended by the Spaniard. So I most
humbly take leave, ever resting

Your Lordships Most faithful servant, Dudley Carleton.
Hague this 10th. of June, 1620.
Sir Dudley Carleton to the Duke.
Most Honorable,
NOt to give your Lordship the trouble of often Letters, I render an account of
his Majesty's Commandments by the same hand I usually receive them. One I had
lately by an express Letter from his Majesty, accompanied with another from
your Lordship, touching my Lord of Buckleugh, to demand full satisfaction of
the States, for all his Lordships pretentions, and to that effect to procure
Instructions and Commission to be sent to Sir Noel Carone to end this business.

To which effect I have moved both his Excellency and the States, and whilst
they were treating thereof, Colonel Brogue arrived here out of Scotland: with
whom they are now handling to put him to Pension, and to give my Lord the
Command of his Regiment in lieu of his Pretensions. Which when they come to
calculate, my Lord will find a short reckoning of them, and to send accounts
out of their accountants hands, and refer them to others, they will never be
moved.

Wherefore if the course they now take can be gone thorough with (which Colonel
Brogue does most unwillingly hear of) it will be then in my Lords choice,
whether he will remain satisfied, or not. And within few days I hope to return
my Lords Secretary with advertisement of what is done. Mean time I assure your
Lordship nothing is omitted in my endeavors to procure him that, which may be
most to his contentment.

In the present condition of public affairs, your Lordship knows well how
at this instant we have all buone Parolle out of Spain, and Cattivi-fatti of
all the rest of the House of Austria. In so much as these Low-Countrie Troops
under the governance of the Infanta, assist in the blocking up of a poor town,
all which remains of his Majesty's only Daughters Jointure in the Palatinate.
And the Emperor not content with having chased her Husband out of the Empire,
in the Proposition of the Diett of Ratisbone, makes this one Article, to make
war upon these Provinces, because (amongst other quarrels) they give refuge to
the Prince Palatine. Where will this persecution cease? And what place in the
world to which they are driven from hence (and is easily guessed in all their
extreamitie, whither they will be forced to fly) is not subject to the same
quarrel? within this week that I now write (betwixt Sunday, and Sunday) we were
here in that state, if God had not prevented it, this Country had been too hot
for them to remain in, and it had been a happiness for them, if they could
have got a poor skeveling boat to have transported them elsewhere. This
Bearer my Nephew will inform your Lordship more particularly thereof.

Now, de agendis, there rests no more, then question of maintaining the Army of
Mansfelt, and Brunswick, which is lodged at the present in a place, out of
which, it can hardly match, and more hardly be removed. If it have pay, and
countenance, it may do good service in Germany; if not, I will tell your
Lordship what I conceive may be the consequence. It will be hedged into
East-Friseland by Tillie, (whose Troops already draw that way) Cordova and
Anholt, against which keeping it self within that Country, it will be able to
make resistance, as the poor Peasants thereof did heretofore against the
Spanish Army, by reason of the difficulty of access. From this State it will
have all assistance, and though it be kept in by land, it will have the Sea
open betwixt Griett and Norden, (both which places are in Mans-felts
possession) a Haven fit for a Fleet of Gallions. If by that means they, with
correspondencie with this State may support themselves, it will be very ill for
many important consequences. If they and this State, (which will be forced to
run a fortune together) be overcome, much worse; for what can keep the rest of
Europe from subjection to the Austriaci? We see how in Terra firma, the
Walloons joined to Spaniards, both make and maintain their Conquests. Join the
Hollanders to them by Sea, they will reap the like service by them. The fruit
we have reaped heretofore of the shiping of these Provinces, both for defense
in the year 88. and offense in the Cadiz journey, shows what a strong
addition this is to a greater power.

My most honorable Lord, I am so full of such like speculations, that these
have broken out ex Plentitudine Cordis, surcharged with grief to see in
Plenitudine temporis, that to come to effect in the public affairs which was
discovered long since, by the Emperors in tercepted letters sent by the
Capuchin into Spain, and to hear the judgment made every where, that the
public opposition of the Spanish Ambassador (D'Ognates) words to the
Emperors proceeding de facto, is but a patelinage, with secret understanding
to abuse his Majesty's goodness. Of which it lies yet in his Majesty's power
to vindicate himself; but there is no time to spare. I humbly crave pardon for
this liberty of discourse I use with your Lordship, who am

Hague, 31. Jan. 1622. Your Lordships, most humble, and most faithful Servant,
Dudley Carleton.

Sir Dudley Carleton to the Duke.
Most Honorable,
I Observe in such Letters from the Prince Electour to her Highness, with the
sight of which, she is pleased sometimes to favor me, a misunderstanding
betwixt him, and his Uncle the Duke of Bovillon, who grows weary of his
Guest, doubting least in his Consideration some danger may be drawn upon his
Town of Sedan; And the jealousy the Prince conceives, what may be done with
him in case of a Siege; (against which, that is no place to make long
resistance) besides the discomforts of living in another man's house, and being
ill looked on, makes him wish himself any where else; but chiefly here, where
he is as much desired, as missed by her Highness, his children, and Family:
And where the Prince of Orange, and the States (apprehending very well his
present danger, and incommoditie) will give him very willingly his wonted
welcome. Your Lordship may be pleased to make thus much known to his Majesty:
And if your Lordship can so dispose of the matter, that with his Majesty's good
liking, he may return hither again, I know nothing your Lordship can do more
agreeable to her Highness, though she does wholly submit her affections and
desires to his Majesty's pleasure.

The wars were never warmer then they are already, and now likely more and
more to kindle in these parts: The Siege of Ostend, by those which were present
there and are now in Berghem, being esteemed sport in comparison of the fury
is used in disputing the outworks of that Town. Where on Monday last in the
night an assault was given, and maintained six hours by the Spaniards upon a
half Moon kept by the Dutch on the North side; out of which they were three
several times repulsed, with the loss of betwixt 3. and 400 men of their best,
and on this side under 40. All that they gained being (after the same manner as
their former attempt on the other side wherein Colonel Hynderson was slain) to
lodge in the foot of the work. Two of our old Captains, Sir Michael Everard,
and Lovelace (hurt in that, and the like assault given on that side within few
days after) are both dead of their wounds within these two days. One at Dort,
the other at Rotterdam, whither they were retired to be cured: which is imputed
by the Chyrurgeons to some malignity is used to the bullets: but that is not to
be believed amongst Christians, yet I have seen some brought hither shot by the
Enemy, sufficient to break all quarter.

We shall have now questionless many and sharp encounters in the field; Count
Mansfelt being on his way hitherwards with his Army, much weakened during his
abode in the Frontiers of France; but of strength sufficient to march through
the open Countries of Henault, and Brabant. Which course he takes directly with
intention to come to Breda. And where by computation, he should be by Monday,
or Teusday next at the farthest, unless he be overtaken by Don Conzales de
Cordova, or met with by the Count Henric Vandenbergh, or the Marquess Spinola,
in any of which there is small appearance. Cordova going forward at leisure
with 16. pieces of Canon, and the 18th. of this present, when Mansfelt passed a
bridge at Marpent over the Sambre in Henault (which was the only passage of
difficulty, and that as our advertisements here say, he crossed without
resistance) being some hours March behind him, who having three field pieces
only, and small store of baggage, and in effect his whole Army on horseback,
may make great expedition.

If Vandenbergh stir, he will be followed by the Prince of Orange. And the
Marquess Spinola cannot go strong enough to encounter him without raising his
Siege at Berghen, which though he should do, the Campaigne is large enough, and
Mansfelt lightly laden to take, and leave at pleasure, it being in his power,
(if his way to Brdea be stopped) to fall down toward such places, the State
hold in Flanders.

The States furnish him with 6000 Florins for the time of three months, they
entertain him and his Army. In which space, the service they hope to draw from
him, is, the raising the Siege of Berghen, by cutting off the Convoyes betwixt
Antwerp, and the Spanish Leaguer, which can no longer continue in the place it
now remains, then it can keep the way of Antwerp open, by which only their
victuals and Munition is conducted.

This time of three months expired, there is small appearance of longer
entertainment of Mansfelt by this State, who does then purpose to retire to the
Duke Christien of Brunswick's old Quarter at Lipstadt: Where they intend to
winter their Army, and augment the same against the next Spring, to return
again into Germany, if the Peace of those parts be not concluded, or some
mischance do not happen in the mean time. Which resolution of theirs, for such
it is (as I am very well informed) deserves the more to be cherished, by how
much the more disrespect is showed his Majesty's Ambassador in the Palatinate,
by burning and spoiling her Highness Jointure even in his view, (as Don
Gonzales did whilst he remained in those parts) and since besieging his
Majesty's Garrison Heidelbergh; before which place, we understand here by
Letters of the 14th. from Frankford, that Baron Tillie began his approaches the
12th. of this present.

I have not heard what is the issue of Captain Brett's business, but hope the
best. Colonel Hynderson's Regiment was given upon the first news of his death
to Sir Francis Hynderson by the Prince of Orange, with which the States are
much displeased, as contrarying their Act. And I have lamented my self to them,
as a wrong done my Lord of Buckleugh, and his Majesty, in his behalf: which
they promise me to repair, as they possibly may be able. And I press them to
it by those means which your Lordship will find contained in an abstract of a
Letter I wrote lately to his Excellency, chiefly to this purpose.

Her Highness having received a fair Present from the Prince her Brother, does
render his Highness thanks by the enclosed. I know not so great a Lady in the
world, nor ever did, (though I have seen many Courts) of such natural
affections: An obedient Daughter; A loving Sister; And a tender Wife, whose
care of her Husband does augment with his misfortunes.

Your Lordship cannot therefore show your care of her more, then by bringing
them again together with the soonest. Of which I beseech your Lordship, that
with the soonest I may know what hope there is, and that (if your Lordship
please) by Mr. Ashburnham, whose return with a favorable dispatch is daily
expected. Thus I most humbly take leave,

Your Lordships Most humble, and most devoted Servant, Dudley Carleton.
Hague 23. August, 1622.
Sir Dudley Carleton to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
THe general knowledge the Queen of Bohemia received from your Grace, by my
Nephew, of the disposition of our affairs at home, since his Highness, and
your Graces return out of Spain, upon the true understanding you have bred in
his Majesty of the Spanish proceedings, being more particularly both for the
state of the matter, and the manner fit to be held here in disposing these men
to such overtures as are necessary, expressed unto me by Sir George Goring
with special caution of secrecy and celeritie.

I have thought fit to set down at large (whilst it is fresh in my memory) an
opportunity as properly given unto me this day by the Prince of Orange, who is
the only person of power and confidence we have here to treat withal) as I
hope your Grace will judge it seasonably taken.

And that was an occasion of business concerning a mutiny at Breda, which
drew the Council of State, (where I have my Seance) to the States general, with
whom we found the Prince. That business ending in good time, gave him a long
hours leisure with me afterward in his Garden, which he himself desired of me,
because somewhat was farther to be digested betwixt us concerning the English
Troops, which showed themselves most in this Mutiny: And hereupon the
consideration of the necessity of this State, and impossibility of giving their
Troops full contentment, gave us subject of further discourse, both of the
means of better payment they have here at home, and the helps they might
conceive from abroad, which making appear unto me to be coldest from England,
as long as our Match with Spain is still in treaty, he asked me bluntly (after
his manner), Qui at'il de vostre Marriage? I told him, it was now at a stay upon
this point, That the restitution of the Palatinate must be first concluded. And
that the Queen of Bohemia was not only well comforted with this assurance, but
pleased her self with a further conceit, that the opportunity was never fairer
for this State to regain the King her Fathers favor, and return to the ancient
support of his Crowns, which by the way of gratitude for her good usage, since
she had her refuge into these parts, she could not but admonish his Excellency
of, and advise him not to let it slip. This he did not so suddenly lay hold of,
as not first to cast many misdoubts, as if the alienation were too great, and
his Majesty too much wedded in affection, if not in Alliance to new friends,
to be so soon reconjoyned to his old, as their necessities did require.

Here I took occasion to play my own Part, and to remember unto him how things
had passed within the compass of my experience from the beginning; letting him
know what friendship his Majesty had showed this State, in the making their
Truce; what sincerity in rendering their Cautionarie Towns according to
contract, when they were demanded; what affection in supporting their affairs
during their late domestique disputes; what care in settling our East-Indian
differences: finally, what Patience in conniving at all the misdemeanors, and
insolences of their Seamen, without seeking revenge.

And hereupon concluded, that I found them here in the same error as men are,
which put first from Land to Sea, and believe the Land passes from them, not
they from the Land, in that the Alienation, which has long been nourished
betwixt his Majesty and this State, sprang originally from them.

First, by Barnevelt and his faction of Arminians carrying the State to new
Alliances, with the Hans-Townes, and otherwise by themselves, refusing so much
as the knowledge of them to my Predecessor in this place, Sir Ralph Wynwood,
with much scorn, and contempt.

Next, by a harsh and peremptory style, used in all we had then to do with
them, savouring rather of Pride and presumption, then any due respect or desire
of friendship.

Lastly, by a precipitate course taken at Sea by their ships of war and
Merchants against his Majesty's Subjects, making prize of some, shouldering
others out of their places of trade, and entering in the East Indies into open
hostility, avowed by a public Act of the States General. This ill course
begun and pursued for some years continuance, breeding a deserved distaste in
his Majesty on this side; and on the Spanish part fair overtures of
friendship, being continually made, and confirmed by the tender of a Match of
a potent Prince, None can marvel that his Majesty did embrace the same,
unless it should be expected of him, that for love of this State how ill
soever deserving, he should lend a deaf ear to all other friendships, that did
not concur with the interest of this State. And the remembrance of these
things not being so old as to be worn out, they might here very well conceive,
that the suspicion of Alienation and disaffection, is as strong on our side for
their giving the cause of our leaning another way, as on theirs for the effect
which has since followed. And now the cause is removed, the effect may
possibly cease in like manner, if we may have good assurance, that breaking
with our new friends upon the occasions now presented, we might fasten after
the wonted manner with an old: and the King be satisfied in such doubts, he may
upon good reason cast, and know certainly what to trust to. To this conclusion
he answered (confessing first their many obligations to his Majesty, both for
his favor, and sufferance,) that nothing could be more certain, then the
affection of this State to a Prince embracing their cause of opposition to
Spain. And if his Majesty could take that resolution, he might dispose of
them, their lives and their fortunes. I told him, that more (in a case of this
importance, when there was question of alteration of the whole course of a
great Princes affairs) would be required then bare professions and
protestations, and the rather, because he knew I was not ignorant, how many
Billets, and Papers have been heretofore brought hither by An old Popish
Gentlewoman of this town, who by passeport on both sides trots so often to and
fro betwixt this and Bruxells, (where she has private access to the Infanta)
that she is known by the title of la Maquerelle de la Trefue.
Madam Serclaus, and others, tending to Truce, or peace, and how much such a
matter was thirsted after by their Frontier Provinces, which being free for
them to take, or leave, after their own humors, it was not likely his Majesty
would discharge them of their burden, to pull it upon his own Shoulders; But
to enter into the common cause of defense, and add a powerful hand in
supporting them, might be faisable, in the present conjuncture, upon good
assurance, he should never be left single in the quarrel. Whereunto he
answered, that true it was, the woman I named, and diverse others, had been
tampering heretofore about such Treaties, and that he had continually put their
Papers into his Pocket, and so suppressed (them with consent of some of the
States, of whom he was most confident) lest such propositions, being brought
into their public Assemblies, might have driven them into distraction, and
dispute one with another according to their several affections, either to
Peace, or War, and thereby slacken their Contributions, wherewith they pay
their Army, and by consequence expose them to the mercy of the enemy.

And that this course of his being finally discovered by the Merquesse Spinola,
and Peckius, their purpose now was (as he is privately advertized from Bruxels)
to steal over some person hither by the usual means of Passe-ports for
Merchants and Travailers, to make some such like Proposition at the several
Assemblies of the States of these united Provinces: which it should be his
study to prevent, because of the mischief may be bred thereby amongst them;
And this he assured me for conclusion, That as their affections and affairs now
stand, nothing but despair can bring these Provinces to Peace, or Truce with
Spain.

To this I yielded, but said, That was not enough because of such changes, to
which the world was daily subject. Neither did Queen Elizabeth undertake their
protection upon such bare presumptions, wherefore some further assurance must
be thought on; which he consented unto, as a thing requisite on both sides, and
joined issue with me in this point, That when the King would be to this State,
as Queen Elizabeth was; this State would be to him, as it was to Queen
Elizabeth.

This being opus unius diei, not unlike the first day of the Creation of the
world in distinguishing light and darkness, I will give your Grace this
further light, of what belongs to negotiation with this State.

The present opportunity of the Prince of Orange's good affection and strength
of these Provinces both by Sea and Land, as it yet stands, (but not possible so
long to continue) being seasonably laid hold of, his Majesty may have with
this State a firm and fruitful alliance.

But if the Prince of Orange should die, (as he is much broken, and the last
year at this time, we did not think he could live till May) or the enemy break
into the borders of this State, (as this last Summer, if the Imperialists had
joined with the Spaniards, they had undoubtedly done; and unless some Change
or Alteration happen, as is feared will do this next year) the best link we
have for a bond of friendship would fail, and as much difference be betwixt
this State, as it now is, and what it is like to be upon any such ill accident,
(as was now feared, and still hangs over them) as betwixt a strong Staff, and
a broken Reed. So I cease to give your Grace any further trouble.

Hague, 9. December. 1623. Your Graces Most humble, and most faithful servant,
Dudley Carleton.

Sir Dudley Carleton to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
What Comfort and Contentment the Queen of Bohemia receives in your Graces
Message and Letter by my Nephew, I leave to her own expression, which never
fails her, when her heart goes with her hand, as I can assure your Grace, it
does in this subject. And this I will say more, who can say nothing but truth,
I never knew your Grace ill with this good and gracious Princess; but now you
are so well settled in her good opinion and favor, that I know none has more
interest therein.

And this use your Grace may make thereof to his Majesty's service, that now
this King and Queen are both of them no less confident of your affection, then
they are of your sincerity; what you advise them in their affairs will be of
much weight to sway them in the balance of their judgment.

Which now a Proposition is made unto them, on which their whole estate does
depend as well for themselves, as their posterity, full of doubtful
circumstances on both sides, (the choice not being, as they conceive, betwixt
one thing certain, and another uncertain; but betwixt two unequal
uncertainties) it is hard to say which way they incline: but if they be left to
themselves, I perceive they will rather stand to the hazard of the latter, with
preservation of their honor and lawful pretensions, then submit themselves to
the former with shame and disgrace, and no assurance of better dealing then was
used to the deported House of Saxe, by a better Emperor then this accounted,
of which we have the Heir (one of the worthiest Princes in Germany) here in
hard Conditions amongst us. And he serves as a spectacle to these Princes of
their fortunes by the same way as his Predecessors took, of submission. Yet
other things being before agreed of, and settled in that sort as his Majesty
has always assured these Princes to be his full intention of restitution to
their Patrimonial Honors and estate; This King I find will conform himself, to
what his Majesty shall think fit, touching a due submission.

But this being a matter of ceremony, the other of substance, he judges, that
if this precede, (that is, the Submission) the other of restitution will never
follow. Neither can it be well seen, how in possibility it may be effected,
considering that (whilst things have been held sometimes in terms, always in
talk of accommodation) the Electoral is given to Bavier by the Emperor, and
avowed by a Congratulatory Embassage from Bruxels: the upper Palatinate settled
in his possession, with some portion to Newburgh for his Contentation, and
engagement. A principal part of the lower Palatinate (the Bergstrate) given to
the Elector of Mentz, with the consent of those of Bruxels, (where he was
lately in person to obtain it) though they grossly dissemble it, and promises
of parts of the rest made to other Princes.

So as what is now pretended (I must deal plainly with your Grace) is no
otherways interpreted, then as experience does teach of these three former
years proceedings: Ever new Overtures in Winter, and new Ruptures in the
Summer. And as of two former Treaties with this Prince, which passed my hands,
(one a Consent to a Submission sent to Vienna, the other a Ratification of a
Suspension oftentimes sent to Bruxels) no other use was made, but with the
first to accelerate Bethlem Gabor in his Treaty of Peace with the Emperor as
then on foot, and with the second to intimidate both the Electours Saxe, and
Brandenburgh, with the Princes of the Nethes, Saxe, and Creyes from entering
into Arms, to which they were well disposed, upon the coffeehouse they
received of the preposterous courses that were taken in the Diet at Ratisbone;
(and to this effect Copies of the very projects of the said Treaties were
dispersed by the Imperialists, before the Instruments themselves were
perfected,) so it is here believed, that now Gabor is again in arms, and other
Princes ready to embrace any good occasion of redress of affairs, time is
only sought to be gained by this new Overture, and the King of Bohemia's
Credit, with his friends and well wishers in Germany to be weakened, if not
lost; for if once he submit himself allowing the translation of the Electoral,
he shall thereby avow the Emperors undue procedings in that cause (which have
been protested against by Saxe, and Brandenbergh, and all the other Germane
Princes, excepting those only of the Catholic league) and by whom afterward
upon any ill dealing can he expect to be befriended, who forsakes himself and
his own cause? This is the discourse of these Princes upon this occasion; but
when they are asked, What then can you trust unto? their recourse is to his
Majesty, who they hope knows the means to effect in their behalf, what he
has so long, and so constantly undertaken for them. And though for these three
or four years past, affairs on this side have gone in a continual decadence,
and now threaten a final ruin, unless it be withstood by some Princely
Resolution; (not of petty, but of great Princes) yet here is no such
discouragement: but that it is thought there is yet strength and vigor enough
left in the good Party, not only to subsist, but to rise and flourish again as
well as ever. And in this cogitation the King and Queen remain, not prescribing
any thing to his Majesty, nor willing to submit themselves anew to the same
rod, with which they have been so often scourged.

Your Grace was lately invited with my Lord of Richmond to christen their young
Son, which being excused by my Lord of Richmond in both your names, And the
King of France undertaking that office, it was performed by that King, and the
King of Swede yesterday was seven-night (represented by the French Ambassador
here resident, and the Prince of Orange) in the same manner, and the same
Church, as the Princess Louise, bearing the same name, was christened the last
year: when the Duke Christien of Brunswick being invited to be Godfather,
though absent, and for some respects of precedence could not have a Deputy,
was understood notwithstanding to be one of the Parrins; and so do the King and
Queen hold both your Grace, and my Lord of Richmond.

I must now render your Grace my humble thanks for your manifestation of your
favor to my self, which you are pleased to do in such ample manner, as to tell
me farther for my Comfort who are my friends; And a farther effect of
friendship, I could not expect of them, then to procure me the assurance I now
receive from your Grace, who have won the reputation by your Constancy to
those you take into your Care, that your word is taken for your deed. And
though that, which I thought fittest for my self fails me, if your Grace can
think me fit for any thing else toward the amendment of my poor fortune, I
shall attend the same with much patience of mind, though great extreamitie
otherwise, by reason of a small estate charged with great debts, (which are no
small burden to an honest mind,) And ever remain

Your Graces Most faithful devoted servant, Dudley Carleton.
Hague, 13th. December. 1623.
Sir Dudley Carleton to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
THe Queen of Bohemia desirous to draw the Prince of Orange to more then
general professions of service to his Majesty, has sometimes in my presence,
when I waited on her highness, given occasion of discourse her self, and at
other times I have spoken in her name with his Excellency to the like effect,
as in my former Letter to your Grace: which caused his Excellency to take
three of the States, such of whom he is most confident (one of Guelderland,
another of Holland, the third of Zealand) unto him, to strengthen himself by
their concurrence in that, which is his own inclination, of carrying this State
to a strict alliance with his Majesty, in which he told them, That first their
minds must be known, and next such assurance thought of, as not only must give
his Majesty present Contentment, but likewise free him from all misdoubt for
the future, that either upon offers from Spain to these Provinces, or any
sinister accidents of War, they should be induced to make Peace or Truce
without his Majesty's consent.

Whereunto they answered him, (as I have it from himself this day) That nothing
could be more agreeable to their affections, and Interests in all respects,
then to be under his Majesty's protection: And for assurance of their remaining
constant to that course, they doubted not, but when the matter should be
treated of, the Provinces would willingly condescend to what should be
necessary to that purpose.

His Excellency in relation hereof unto me went so much further, as to
instance in their new resolution here, now finally put in practice of making
Voyages into the West Indies after the same form, as they have done into the
East; both which joined together, make them irreconcilable with Spain. Yet if
his Majesty will have a further tie on them, they will not refuse it; but he
says, The States will expect that such obligation be mutual, and that they in
like manner may rest assured, when they put themselves wholly under his
Majesty's wings, his Majesty will not fly from them, and make his peace
without them.

I told him the case was not equal betwixt his Majesty, and them, they being
actually in War, his Majesty in Peace: so as to come to a conjunction, his
Majesty must change condition, not they, and therefore has the more reason to
look before he leap out of Peace into War. And so did Queen Elizabeth, who had
reigned 27 years before she openly took upon her the protection of these
Countries; but after continued her War in their Cause to her dying day. This he
confessed, but remembered withal, That there was a Treaty of Burburck, with
which the States were much startled, and he thought that when this business
should be more particularly scanned amongst them, as they would willingly give,
so they would expect to receive good assurance.

In this point of declaration of their affection, and willingness to warrant
his Majesty sufficiently, I asked him, How far I might go not to be disavowed:
so as if his Majesty should take any sudden resolution, according as affairs
require, he might confidently build upon the concurrence of this State. He
answered me, That a resolution in this kind would require a further proceeding,
then was fit, until his Majesty would be content to make his mind known, by
such private means as might seem best to his own wisdom, and then according to
his own liking, they would enlarge this matter here, to more men's knowledge,
then the small circle, in which it hitherto walked, and guide it in that manner
as may be fit for the form of it to his Majesty's honor, and for the substance
to his full contentment. Which he offered to do now if I would press him to
it; but withal told me his opinion, that it would raise nothing but bruit and
noise without effect, when we had here no better ground to work upon, and
therefore wished the business might expect a return from his Majesty, if he
could be content it should be proceeded in. In these terms remains this
business, not free from many Cautions, and nice Circumstances; and yet on this
side, (I can assure your Grace) full of good affection; but these are the true
reasons of their coming on no faster. They hold it for a maxim, That Spain
will never match with his Majesty for love, but either for hope, or fear. If
Spain can entertain hope of reducing these Provinces to obedience by the Match,
or fear, that unless the Match proceed, his Majesty will join with these
Provinces in opposition to Spain: They hold in either of these Cases the Match
as made. And therefore lest some use should be made of their presentations of
themselves, to their own prejudice, they are thus shie, and circumspect.
Besides, as they have had some help of money out of France this last year, so
they are entertained with hopes of more against the next: which they fear would
be excused upon any offer they should make of themselves toward his Majesty,
and therefore are loath to adventure the exchange of a substance, for that
which appears unto them hitherto, no better then a shadow; And they are indeed
very umbragious; for they suspect, that Tentatives of this kind, of which some
have been made heretofore amongst them, tend to no other end, then to endear
our Merchandise with Spain, and let the Ministers of that Crown know, that we
refuse in their Contemplation. But when his Majesty shall resolve in his own
heart, and be pleased to make himself so understood, it will be no hard matter
by his Excellencies means (who is a Prince full of good intentions and real
affections to his Majesty, and his royal Family) to make these men lay by
their Jealousies, and be as true to his Majesty, and the support of his
Crowns, as his own Kingdoms. Which is no more then they owe for the protection
which these that are now in Government had of his Majesty, when they were
lately sinking under the burden of a contrary faction; and no more then upon a
good knowledge of their Interests and affections I can undertake for them, they
will really and readily pay, if the matter be well managed. In which the
confidence and freedom I have used with this Noble Gentleman, Sir George
Goring, may give your Grace some further light, as any doubts shall arise
concerning the business. So I most humbly take leave,

Your Graces Most humble, and most faithful servant, Dudley Carleton.
Hague, 18. December. 1623.
Sir Dudley Carleton to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
THe business of strict conjunction betwixt his Majesty, and this State
(touching which the Queen of Bohemia has received his Highness, and your
Graces Letters, and I your Graces of the 9th. of this present) goes on the
right foot (according as your Grace will see more particularly by my Letters to
Mr. Secretary Conway, and as the matter is here embraced with much affection,
so for the manner I doubt not but it will be well ordered in that sort, as will
be for his Majesty's honor, and contentment. But in regard of jealousies
toward us, and emulations amongst these men in matters of employment, (to
which all men are subject, especially in good and advantageous businesses, some
time, will be required, to set all in the right way, yet no illimited time; for
I hope within a week all will be resolved of, and within a a few days more,
put in execution fully to expectation. Sir Noel Caron writes, a league
offensive and defensive will be embraced by his Majesty, if it be proposed
from hence, with offer of assurance; And I assure my self both the overture,
and offer will be made and reallie effected, if it be answered on our side with
good correspondence. That which busieth my cogitations is, that tempus agendi
may be lost Consultando; and therefore seeing how both his Majesty, and this
State stand affected, I will take the liberty to give your Grace two
advertisements in matters of action, which will be of exceeding fruit, if they
be thought of in time, and for which there is no time to spare.

One is, that your Grace does inquire after in your Letter to the Queen of
Bohemia (who excuses writing either to his Highness, or your Grace till the
States have resolved of their sending) that is the States preparation for the
West Indies, which way, the company for those parts newly erected in these,
has set out one Fleet of 32. Sail now already at Sea, with some Land men
amongst them, to put on ground and fortify as they shall find occasion; for
which they have men for the purpose, and all materials ready embarked with
them.

A second Fleet they are now preparing against April next, about which all
their Admiralties and some of the Deputies of this new West-Indian Company are
here at this present. And the design is, for the Admiralties to set out at the
charge of the generality twelve good ships of war, besides they have already
on the coast of Spain and in the narrow Seas, which they will still continue.

To these 12. ships they require the West-Indian Company to join 12. more,
which will make a good Fleet, and this they intend shall be ready (as I said)
in April next, to attend the coming of the Spanish West-Indian Fleet, which
here they understand is put into the Havana, with intention there to winter as
it did the last year.

Now if his Majesty will give leave to his subjects to erect a Company for
the West Indies, and join with these men in those Parts, as they do in the
East, (and upon more equal conditions, since the business is but now in the
beginning) it will be here gladly embraced. And if he will frame a Fleet
betwixt his own ships and his Merchants to join with the States Fleet prepared
for April next to intercept the Spanish West-Indian Fleet, nothing more will be
desired by these men, and there is nothing of which for the present they
promise themselves greater fruit: for either they hope to take, or to stop the
silver of those parts (both which are good services, considering the need of
money, the Spaniards have in these), or else they resolve with the ships which
belong to the company to pursue their voyage of the West Indies.

The second is a Truce with the Pirates of Algier, such an one as this State
has made in conformity to their peace with the Grand Seigniour, which will be
no more observed for unmolesting all, and every one of our Merchants ships as
they are straglingly lighted on, then it is with these men, who suffer many
losses in particular; but those are recompensed in the General. For the
Spaniards are much amazed with this correspondence; And the men of War of this
State, or such Merchants, as can make any reasonable defense are most meddled
withal. Besides, in any matter of offense they concur together; And even now a
proposition is made from Algier to the Prince of Orange, (which I have from his
own mouth to acquaint your Grace therewith) that in case this State against the
beginning of next summer will set out twenty Sail of ships upon any good
service against the Spaniards, they will join unto them 60. Sail to pursue the
design, whatsoever it shall be of this State. The acceptance of which offer
being now in deliberation, it will be suspended till it be seen, how this
unexpected business with his Majesty may proceed; And then they will here do
nothing but that, as may concur with our common Interests. But because the
negotiation of this matter with those of Algier (that is a Truce betwixt his
Majesty's subjects, and those men) will require time, your Grace may
provisionallie move his Majesty (if the matter be well liked) to use such
endeavors as may conduce thereunto. Here they use to write, and send through
France by Marseilles to the Consul they have continually at Algeir, by whose
means (if no better present it self) any thing may be proposed, his Majesty
shall find fitting.

Other things, I will within few days remonstrate to your Grace for his
Majesty's service in this change of affairs, which require all possible
industries, and diligences to be used both far and near; And those not
neglected, I doubt not, but they who have so grossly abused his Majesty's
friendship, will soon repent themselves, and by their harms see their own
errors. Thus I most humbly take leave;

Your Graces Most humble, and most faithful Servant, Dudley Carleton.
Hague 24. January, 1625.
Sir Dudley Carleton to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
ACcording as I advertised your Grace the 24. of the last of the disposition of
the Prince of Orange, and such of the States, as he called unto him to Council,
they procured the rest soon after to resolve of an Embassage to his Majesty,
and now they have dispatched the same with as much expedition, as could
possibly be used. The Persons are Aersons of Holland, and Joachim of Zealand,
both able, and well affected Persons, and both sufficiently known to his
Majesty by former employments. They go amply authorized for what they shall
treat: but that as yet is an Embrion only which must receive form, and life
from his Majesty, in whose hands it lies to preserve this State, and dispose
for ever of the whole strength thereof for his own service, and his royal
Families. Which after more debates, and distasts, then have passed with all the
world besides. I am glad I can say upon good warrantize: whereof this is one
proof, that when his Majesty is constrained by the necessity of affairs to
send and seek to his other friends, he is sent and sought, and sued to from
hence. I doubt not but it will be objected (as has been formerly) that it is
for their own Interest, and that they would gladly engage his Majesty in their
quarrel, which it were a folly to deny: but there is always the friendship
strongest when the interests are most conjoined. And if that which is
principally for one man's benefit, turn likewise to another man's advantage, Hoc
non facere (says an old School-book) summae est imprudentiae.

The affairs of these parts for matter of Action (which have been more then
ordinarily succeeds in this cold season, but have been more coldly pursued then
was feared) I refer to this Bearer my Nephew's report, who having the honor to
be his Majesty's servant, I employ him the more willingly, as able to give
Account of such particularities, either of this Negotiation, or otherwise, of
which his Majesty, and your Grace may require knowledge. And I humbly beseech
your Grace to give him encouragement by your accustomed noble favor. So rests

Hague, 16. February, 1625. Your Graces Most humble, and most devoted servant,
Dudley Carleton.

Sir Dudley Carleton to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
IT were a sin against the public service, in which your Grace does employ
your self so much to the common good, and your own honor, to molest you with
Letters in this busy time: which must serve me for excuse of silence, since
the beginning of the Parliament. What I write now is by Commandment of the
Queen of Bohemia concerning this Bearer Captain Gifford an old Seaman of our
Nation, who having a private suite to the States, has made a journey over
hither with recommendation to me from our two Secretaries for advancement
thereof, but with a further purpose to be employed by the Queen against the
Spaniard in a matter of no less moment, then taking of a Gallion, which
usually brings the treasure over the Gulf of Mexico, from Nova Spagna to the
Havana. Which he designs after this manner: To go out with two Ships and a
Pinnace, only fitted for fight, without more in number, because of the Alarm
would be taken at a greater Fleet, and to lie under Covert of a small Island in
the entry of the Gulf of Mexico: where the Gallion coming usually alone,
unless it be accompanied with some Merchants ships, which he sets light by,
and which encumbered with goods and Passengers, he think may be mastered, and
taken, building upon the security in which that Gallion, with the rest of that
Nova Spagna Fleet, do sail scattering in the Gulf, till they meet with the
Fleet of Terra Firma at the Havana, where he having been hereto fore a prisoner
made this observation, and does now offer himself to put the design in
execution, with a demand of betwixt 10000 and a 11000 l. for the whole equipage.

The Queen in recompense of his good will returns him with this address to
your Grace as a man fit for employment, for so he is generally reputed; but for
the particularitie of the Exploit, she does not entertain any thought thereof,
but refers it wholly to your Graces Consideration, and to the opportunity
according as affairs shall succeed betwixt his Majesty, and Spain.

Here are come Letters from some of the King and Queens servants on that side,
and one to my self from a private friend, advertizing, That there is a
readiness in diverse of his Majesty's Subjects of good abilities, to put to Sea
with Letters of Mart in the name of this Kind and Queen against the Spaniard,
and of a likelihood, that if such Commissions were given by these Princes, they
would not be ill understood by his Majesty.

Mounsieur Aertsens has likewise written hither in a private Letter to the
Prince of Orange, that he has been spoken with to move the States to increase
the number, he and his Colleague have mentioned of 10 or 12 Ships to join in
any good occasion with his Majesty's Fleet to 20: And that the purpose is to
set out 50 sail on that side, and that both shall go under the name of the King
and Queen of Bohemia. Wherein though the motion be not directly made, yet the
Prince of Orange has discoursed enough, that when it shall come to issue, they
will stretch themselves to furnish to the full what is required on this side.
In both these businesses, as well the granting Letters of Mart by these
Princes, as their lending their names to any greater Action, they intend to
govern themselves only as they shall understand to concur with his Majesty's
pleasure, and therefore hope they shall receive advice from his Highness, and
your Grace, what is fit for them to contribute to such occasions as they see
much to their Comforts, you advance with so great care and vigilance. Thus I
most humbly take leave,

Your Graces most humble, and most devoted Servant, Dudley Carleton.
Hague 16. April, 1624.
Sir Dudley Carleton to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
SUch Commandments as I received from your Grace by double Dispatches of the
4th. of the last, by way of provision whilst Sir William Saintleiger lay sick,
were prevented by his own presence. He bringing the first of those Packets with
him, and thereby had Commodity to assist at the breaking of the business to
the States, by virtue of his Majesty's Credence given him, and my Lord General
Cecil: which since, he has solicited both at the Camp, and in this place with
all possible care and industry, and I have not failed of my utmost endeavors.

But the unsettlednesse of this Government, which still continues since the
late change of Governors, has bred delay to some, and direct impediments to
other points we had in charge: which we have endeavored to supply by other
means. And now in what state he leaves the whole business, he will relate to
your Grace. Such Patents as your Grace required from the King and Queen of
Bohemia, I have committed to his delivery in diverse forms, with a Blank signed
and sealed, wherein to frame such an one as may be better to your minds: But if
your Grace make no use of it, you may please to return it to me again, to the
end I may restore it.

What concerns my self, I absolutely remit and submit to your Grace; only I
will renew the request I made to your Grace by my Nephew, That your Grace will
not prefer any before me in your formerly intended favor, out of belief, that
any can be more, then I resolve to rest whilst I live a touttes Espreves,

Hague, 20. June, 1625. Humbly and faithfully devoted to your Graces person and
service, Dudley Carleton.

Sir Dudley Carleton to the Duke.
May it please your Grace,
AFter long attendance the wind is come good for Plymouth, which I hope will
carry thither speedily and safely the States whole Fleet, though in 3. parts;
12 Ships with the Admiral de Nassau, who has long waited in the Tessel; 4 but
newly ready provided by those of Zealand at Amsterdam, and 4 which have layen
sometimes before the Brill; whereof one is to land the Marshal Chatillion in
passing by Calice; the other three to Convoy the English men: And Arms I send
in 10. other Ships I have hired at Rotterdam: before which place they have
layen 20 days a Shipboard, by reason of contrary winds, with some impatiencie,
but no disorder: which what course I took to prevent, as likewise what may
happen in their Voyage, my Lord Conway (to whom I give a particular account of
all) will inform your Grace.

I have obtained leave for Sir John Proud to go the Voyage according to his
Majesty's Letter, though it was somewhat stood upon by the States, and he has
taken his passage by Zealand.

When I call to mind, what Patents I procured of the King of Bohemia, and sent
your Grace by Sir William Saint Lieger, (amongst which was one of submission to
any accommodation his Majesty shall at any time like well of for the King of
Bohemia) I think it necessary to advertize your Grace, that knowledge being
come hither of the Infanta's sending the Count Shomburgh to the King of Denmark
with a fair Message, and the Count Gondomar's overtures to Mr. Trumbal tending
to reconcilement, and restitution of the Palatinate, it is so willingly
hearkened unto by the King of Bohemia, that there is no doubt of his Consent:
but withal he well considers, that if Treaty alone be trusted unto, and
thereupon Arms now leavied by his Majesty, and his Friends be laid aside, all
will prove as fruitless as formerly. For howsoever the King of Spain (for more
free prosecution of other quarrels, or designs) may be induced to quit what he
possesses in the Palatinate, the shares, the Emperor, the Duke of Bavier, and
the two Electours Majenct, and Trevers, with a great rabble of Popish Priests
and Jesuits have therein, will require more then bare negotiation, to wring it
out of their hands; and nothing but Victory, or at least a well armed Treaty
can serve that turn.

The time seems long both to the King and Queen, and grows very irksome every
day more then other of their abode here in this place: which indeed does prove
in all respects very uncomfortable; and that your Grace will gather out of Mr.
Secretary Morton's report, and my Letters to my Lord Conway. In this very
Consideration, I beseech your Grace be the more mindful of

Your Graces Most humble, and most devoted servant, Dudley Carleton.
Hague, 20th. of August, 1625.
