TO THE KINGS Most Excellent Majesty. THE HVMBLE REMONSTRANCE AND RENEWED
PETITION OF the Commissioners of the General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland,
from their meeting at Edinburgh, the second day of June. 1643.

EDINBURGH, Printed by ROBERT BRYSON. 1643.

To the Kings most excellent Majesty. The humble Remonstrance and renewed
Petition of the Commssioners of the General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland,
from their meeting at Edinburgh the second day of June. 1643.
AS the manifold and pressing necessity of the duty of our place and trust,
did constrain us, in these distempered and dangerous times, in most humble
manner, To direct our earnest suplication to your Majesty, for such remedies
as we conceive to be most fit for us to propone, And being applied by your
Majesty's own hand, might both for cure and prevention prove most effectual:
So are we enforced by the same necessity growing daily to the greatest
extremity, In all humility and earnestness, To renew not only our prayers to
God, but our Petitions to your Majesty. For Sions sake can we not hold our
peace, and for Jerusalems sake we will not rest, until the righteousness
thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that
burns. But because in your Majesty's answer to our former Petition we meet
with a multitude of prejudices and exceptions against us and our humble
desires, we will crave leave, first to remove these out of the way:
Acknowledging the full expression of them by your Majesty to be no small
favor, and being confident, after we have expressed our selves in the truth
and integrity of our hearts, both to give unto and to receive from your
Majestes Justice and goodness the greater satisfaction.

And first, although there be good reason for printing of Answers and Replies,
the Petition being before printed, yet we acknowledge that your Majesty has
just cause to find fault with that publishing of our Petition in print (which
is mentioned in the introduction to your Majesty's answer) And if it had been
done by our commandment, counsel or knowledge, we had not only given yaur
Majesty just provocation, and fallen in an error contrary to the nature of a
Petition, and to the right disposition of Petitioners, but also had used means
contrary to our own ends, in publishing a programe of our diffidence of
obtaining our desires, or in giving a public testimony that we were aiming at
some other thing then what we professed to seek, And therefore we are so far
from excusing that form of doing, that we judge our selves to be wronged
thereby.

Another fault much more intolerable is objected against us: The bitterness
and sharpness of some expressions which may be interpreted by your Majesty's
well affected Subjects not to be so agreeable to that regard and reverence which
is due to your Majesty's person, and the matter it self to be reproachful to
the honor and constitution of that your Majesty's Kingdom. Whether the matter
of the Petition be reproachful shall afterward in the particulars appear: But
for the expresions we have examined the whole Petition and can find no word of
that kind. We rather did fear the censure of fauning and flattering words,
which your Majesty may remember were sometime put upon our supplications. Our
desire was to keep within the bounds of that liberty which beseems the
Ministers of Christ, and if any word have escaped us which we cannot see, it
was contrary to our intention: for we know that we should neither speak evil
of dignity nor unreverently unto them. The like report has been made to your
Majesty of our preaching and prayers, but when the delators are tried, they
will be found either malicious against us for reproving their faults; Or having
no other way of insinuation, too officious to your Majesty, or to others whom
they desire to please, or so blinded with self-love, that they think Preachers
should speak like Parasites; or so undiscerning, that when we profess our
desire to the Reformation of Religion in England and Ireland, we are fansied by
them to preach or pray against the King and his Royal authority. We fear God,
and honor the King, And have learned not only to put a difference betwixt God
and the King, but also (against the old sophistication now revived) betwixt the
pictures of the Emperor, and the images of the false gods, craftily insert
into them, and know the way how to honor the King without such a mixture and
confusion. Slownesse to believe an evil report, and the constructing of things
doubtful is one of your Majesty's Royal praises, of which the faithful
Ministers of this Kirk desire, against slanders and suspicions to have the
experience: which will prove profitable for your Majesty's honor and
obedience, and our peace and quietness. As the North Wind drives away rain:
So does an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. Righteous lips are the
delight of Kings: and they love him that speaks right.

Concerning the interposing of the General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland,
and our intermedling by commission from them in the Kirk of England; We humbly
entreat your Majesty, to consider of the reasons of this our doing. 1. Although
the Kirks of one Nation be distant in place from the Kirks of another Nation,
yet are they united in the heart and spirit, and are generally but one body and
Kirk, and must as Sisters of one Mother keep the unity of the spirit in the
bond of peace: whence arises the communion of all Gods graces and blessings
amongst the Kirks, that they may not only help, comfort and refresh: but
advise, admonish, exhort, warn and reprove one another, so far as need
requires, and their Christian love and ability reaches. Yet avoiding both
ambition and confusion: there being a co-ordination between Kirks of diverse
Nations, but no subordination: We have not presumed to pass the limits of this
Christian communion: having proceeded by way of charity, and in a ministerial,
or rather brotherly manner, not by authority or magisterially: by way of humble
supplication to your Majesty, Declaration to the House of Parliament, and
advice and exhortation to such of our brethren of the Ministry as were best
known unto us: very far from usurpation or jurisdiction. 2. Our humble Petition
to your Majesty, and our Declaration to the Parliament, were nothing else, but
a prosecution of the demand made by the Commissioners of this Kingdom, and a
pressing of the Answer given by your Majesty and the Parliament, in the last
Treaty; which filled us with hope of what was then demanded, since followed by
diverse Declarations, and now again desired. 3. The experience of the
sufferings of this Kirk from the doctrine, form of worship and government of
the Kirk of England, does beget fears of the like hereafter, which makes our
petition to be unto us a necessary mean of selfe-preservation. 4. Our
encouragements from your Majesty's Letter to the general Assembly, and the
Declaration of the House of Parliament, desiring them to concur in
petitioning your Majesty for settling one confession of Faith, one directory of
the public worship, and one Catechism in all the three Kingdoms, as a mean
to advance the honor and service of God, enlarge the greatness, power, and
glory of the King, confirm the peace, security, and prosperity of all his
good Subjects, make way to the relief and deliverance of the poor afflicted
Kirks abroad, and to the total abolishing of the usurpation and tyranny of
Rome. 5. The pattern we have of this Christian duty both by word and writing in
the Kirk at Jerusalem, and the Kirk at Antioch, which was first Crowned with
the name of Christians, The one of which were Jews, and the other Gentiles;
And in diverse other Kirks recorded in Scripture, many Precedents also in
antiquity before the Kirks did contend for primacie, or knew any pre-eminence
one over another. Many examples of other reformed Kirks; And the practice of
the Kirk of Scotland diverse times after the Reformation writing into England
against the ceremonies, and for union against the Papists and their confederats
banded together by the bloody league of Trent. These and the like reasons we
conceive did sufficiently authorize us in all that we have done, not as
Directors or Judges, but as supplicants and humble advisers. In that day shall
there be an high way out of Egypt into Assyria (from one Kirk and Nation of the
Gentiles to another) And the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians, whom the
Lord of Hosts shall bless.

Upon this and the like grounds, have letters been sent professedly, between
some godly, loyal and peaceable Ministers of the Kirk of England, and the
General Assembly here, and their Commissioners: One of the means intended for
the good of Religion in both Kingdoms against Sects and Shismes, admitted and
approven by your Majesty's Commissioners in the General Assembly, and which
for the form of doing is innocent, and may be profitable, unless the matter
be nocent and hurtful, and thereby deserves censure. We wish we were able by
our Letters, Declarations, or Petitions; To reduce all the Reformed Kirks to a
perfect conformity, to suppress all the Heresy, Superstition and Tyranny of
Papists, and the Paganism of Turks and infidels, and would not doubt of your
Majesty's Royal approbation notwithstanding all the Laws standing to the
contrary, and plea's could be made for their antiquity, happiness and
stability; Common arguments and colors pretended for every Religion, and of
late answered to the full in the point of Episcopal government, from the
verity of Scripture which is true antiquity, and the only solid ground of the
happiness and stabilitie of Religion and government of the Kirk.

The Petitioners were far from laying upon your Majesty any imputation of the
Irish Rebellion beseeching God to mainifest your Sacred Majesty's innocence to
all the world. They made mention of the miseries of Ireland, for no other end,
but to represent the danger of your Majesty's Kingdoms through the prevailing
power of the Popish faction; The British Papists at this time being animated by
the same spirit, working upon the same principles, enraged with the same
furies, breathing out the same threatenings and slaughter, aiming at the same
ends, and emboldened with the same presumption, with the Papists of Ireland,
their confederates. And withal to present our earnest desires for a
pacification, that both the armies may be sent against that horride rebellion,
and peace restored to all your Majesty's Dominions.

The expression in our Petition of Unity in Religion, we have borrowed from
the Article in the Treaty accorded unto by your Majesty, from the
Declarations of the Parliament; and from the General Assembly: By which is
meaned no other thing but one Confession of Faith one common directorie for
worship, and one Catechism. The Papists may know that the true Kirk in all
ages, has been troubled with differences and contentions, as great as any now,
against the Reformed Kirks, which many of the godly have lamented and studied
to compose, and (as it was written of some heretics of old) They themselves
sacrifice in schism and dissension, and greet the world with the name of
peace, whom they drive from the peace of there salvation. They therefore cannot
hence authrize their scandal against the remformation: yet the smallest
differences of practice and diversity of the expressions, are matter of strife
to the contentious, of hinderance of edification to the ignorant, of stumbling
to the weak, and of grief to the godly, when thereby they see against religious
Unity and Christian love, the bowels of the Kirk rent asunder, and people
scandalously divided in some parts of the worship of God: All which evil,
might be perfectly cured in all your Majesty's dominions, the mouths of
Papists stopped, Schism and Separation hereafter prevented, and the face of
the Kirk filled with true beauty and splendour, to your Majesty's greater glory,
and the greater terror of all your enemies: by this blessed and never enough
desired Unity in Religion: Without which tender consciences being freed from
constraint may be in some degree eased by your Majesty, but shall never have
rest, and be satisfied, nor shall the rent of the Kirk arising from different
or contrary practices be cured, but shall from time to time increase.

Concerning uniformity in Kirk government, our hopes thereof and of the unity
of Religion grounded upon the the Article of the Treaty, made this Kirk and
Kingdom to enter into the more strict amity and friendship with England. And
that the amity and friendship builded upon such a foundation might be the more
firm and durable, they have since pressed the same by their Petitions and
Declarations, in all humility and love, without any bitterness of expression:
Only they have declared the government of the Kirk by Assemblies in their
strong and beautiful order, and subordination to be by Divine right, and that
as Prelacie is confessed in this your Majesty's Answer to be the rule of humane
policy, so to be almost universally acknowledged by the Prelates themselves,
and their adherents to be but a humane institution, intoduced by humane reason,
and settled by humane Law and Custom, for supposed conveniencie; which
therefore by humane authority, without wronging any man's conscience, may be
altered and abolished upon so great a necessity, as is, a hearty conjunction of
all the reformed Kirks, a firm and well grounded peace, between the two
Kingdoms, formerly divided in themselves and betwixt themselves by this
partition wall, and a perfect Union of the two Kirks in the two Nations; which
although by the providence of God in one Island, and under one Monarch, yet
ever since the Reformation, have been at greater difference in the point of
Kirk government (which in all places has a powerful influence upon all the
parts of Religon) then any other reformed Kirks, although in Nations at
greatest distance, and under d^vers Princes. Papacy is the greatest cause of
schism in the Christian Kirk, and Episcopacie devised by man, to be a cure,
the greatest cause of schism in the Reformed Kirks.

As the mutual relation and conjunction of true Ecclesiastical and Civil
government is a corroboration of both, so do we conceive that both are much
weakened in their proper functions by that intermixture of the Ecclesiastical
government with the Civil State. And as we know the principles of Prelacy to
be Popish, and contrary to the principles of Reformation: So have we reason to
believe, that such an intermixture is not for your Majesty's honor, while they
maintain and profess that Monarchy cannot subsist without Prelacie: And that
Prelacie had not been cast out of the Parliament, if it had been profitable
there; And thought fit to be altogether abolished, if it had not been an
unprofitable burden to the kingdom, and pernicious to the civil State and
Common wealth: As is contained more fully in the Declaration of both Houses of
Parliament to the General Assembly.

The following of humane inventions, without and against Scripture, and the
ambition and covetousness of Kirkmen, were observed of old, to be the
corruptions which made many to call upon the Pope, and the chief guides of the
Kirk, at that time for a Reformation: but all in vain, for that had been their
own ruin, to which in humane reason, they would never willingly have
consented. That upon the same causes and corruptions there is a necessity of
reformation of the Kirk of England, Is as unanimously confessed, as it is
universally acknowledged, that it is unlikely if not impossible; to be obtained
in the regular and ordinary way: Upon the reason expressed afterward in your
Majesty's answer. Because in the common and ordinary way the passion or
interest of particular men will impose upon the publict: For what greater
private interest then benefits and dignities? Who more interessed in these then
Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons and such ordinary members of the Convocation? And
who can be more sueyed, and biased with passion, then such as have this
interest? Whether this be appliable to the Parliament, whose places and
dignities are uncontroverted, and unquestionable, it is not for us to judge:
but this we know, when the corruptions of the Kirk are grown to such an height,
that she can neither bear her diseases, nor endure the remedies, it is the
duty of the Magistrate and civil authority, by the advice of the more sound,
and sincere part of the Kirk and Ministry, to endeavor a Reformation, since
no Reformation, worthy of that name, can be expected from the corrupt Clergy,
nor has at any time Religion been that way in any tolerable measure reformed:
When the evils are extraordinary, the remedies must be other then ordinary.
Scripture, reason, and experience of the Kirk teach in such an exigence of
Reformation and extremity of debates and contentions, to call a Synod of the
best Divines, best acquainted with the will of God in Scripture, freest of
humane inventions, and innovations, and farrest from pride and avarice; which
are the evils to be purged out, and for afterward prevented; And who against al
Sects and Shismes, unfainedly seek the peace and unity of the Kirk, which by
all good means both for it self, and for the truths sake, is to be procured
and preserved. When by this remedy faithfully applied, and accompanied with
prayers, and tears of repentance; the worship of God and the government of the
Kirk are settled, not after the rules of humane policy, but according to
Scripture, there is hope that God will end his controversy with England, and
bliss the treaties of peace betwixt your Majesty and your Parliament; which
is now our humble desire, and when it comes to pass, shall be the universal
rejoicing of all your good people.

We should be not only unchristian but disloyal and unnatural, if we were
not affected, and afflicted, with your Majesty's many sufferings, and the
troubles of your Kingdoms, and did not heartily wish that your Majesty were
pesent in your Parliament, assembled in the most peaceable and Parliamentarie
way, to your Majesty's greater glory, and their greater strengthening, for the
good of the Kingdom. For the present, the houses of Parliament have professed
in their Declaration to the General Assembly, their desires and willingness,
to settle such a Reformation of the Kirk; as shall be most agreeable to the
word of God, and most apt to procure and conserve an happy union with the Kirk
of Scotland in a peaceable and parliamentarie way; And have pass their bills
in both houses without contradiction against Episcopal government, and
offered them to your Majesty for obtaining your Royal consent: This is the
peaceable and Parliamentarie way, meant by us, and mentioned in our petition,
which we trust can give your Majesty no just offense.

Although the Ministers of the Gospel have authority in some cases to preach
and write not only exhortations, and blessings, but also threats, and sentences
of judgment, against Kings and Kingdoms, which howsoever they be bitter and
unpleasant for the pesent (and therefore seldom ministered to princes) may prove
very profitable, and cordial afterward: Many had perished in their sins if it
had not been told them that they were to perish; faithful are the wounds of a
friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful: and he that rebukes,
afterward shall find more favor then he that flattereth with the tongue. Yet
upon good reason have we abstained from this strain of denuncing of judgment
against your Majesty, having only from the conscience of our duty in anguish
of our souls, faithfully represented the duty and danger with our earnest
deprecation of the wrath not only now incumbent, but yet seven times more
imminent to your Kingdoms, which we daily more and more apprehend, shall
ensue, unless by a through Reformation of Religion and manners it be
timeously prevented. By this our liberty we have delivered our own souls, and
endeavored to deliver your Majesty and your Dominions from the present and
future judgments, which both love and fear constrain us now again; To entreat
your Majesty to hearken unto.

As we cannot deny, but do reverently acknowledge the influence of many and
great blessings from heaven upon the reign of Queen Elizabeth and your
Majesty's Father of blessed memory: So do we not doubt, but your Majesty in
your Christian and Royal wisdom will consider: that the supreme providence
which has set your Majesty after them upon the Throne, has appointed a time
for every action. A wise man's heart discerns both time and judgment, and
where it is not discerned, the misery of man, wrestling with invincible
providence, is great upon him. The many blessings upon the Kings of Egypt,
Babylon, and other Princes, were interrupted in the time of their successors,
which opposed the deliverance of the people of God from the Egyptian bondage,
the Babylonian captivity, the foolishness of Paganism, and the tyranny of
Popery, when the time of their deliverance was come. Many of the godly before
your Majesty's reign have desired and supplicated the Parliament for a
Reformation, but the desires were never so universal as now; Prelacie never so
insolent, nor the evils thereof so well known and so deeply felt; nor was it
ever voted out of the Parliament, nor agreed in Parliament to be abolished in
the Kirk; nor stood merely upon the Royal consent of the King, till this time.
Arminianisme has entered, Papistry has increased, Sectaries have multiplied,
sufferings have abounded, Tender consciences disquieted with old and new
ceremonies, much more of late then before, that all eyes may see how many
things concur now to make a necessity of reformation. It is the never dying
honor of your Majesty's late Progenitors above others that were before them,
that they did begin, continue and preserve reformation, and shall be your
Majesty's greatest and immortal glory to perfect it, with Josiah leaving
nothing to imped or obscure the glory of God: An happiness which the people of
God in this Island have long waited for, which God calls for at your hands,
and we trust has reserved for our times, as a special and incomparable honor
to your Majesty above the best Princes, and matter of joy to your people above
all other in former ages.

As the continual comfort and daily sense of the inestimable benefit, of the
Reformation of this Kirk in worship and government, should stir up our hearts,
to the love of God, whose hand principally, did bring it about, in a way full
of marvels, and full of mercies, And thankfulness to your Majesty, whom we
look upon, not as a naked assenter unto alterations, but as a prime instrument
of settling a blessed Reformation in this Kirk; So does the same comfort and
sense excite in us, a fear to lose that which we so much love, in a way where
in it has run hazard before. Our fears are not counterfeit, to bring any
design of our own, nor politic, or created in us, by the authority of any
assertion of others, to bring any design of theirs to pass, nor panick, or
maginarie, to torment our selves without cause; But are true and real,
grounded upon reason, which teaches to beware of contagion, in so near a
vicinitie, and where there is so frequent commerce and conversing upon bypast
experience of evils from English Prelacie, ever since the beginning of
Reformation, and upon present and daily tasting of the fruits, which partly of
its own corupt nature, and partly through the coruptions of men, It has
brought forth and fomented. And though the Petitioners cannot judge, nor should
intermeddle with questions about your Majesty's, and the Parliaments power, yet
may they well profess from that which every one may understand, that the
denying of the people their earnest desires, may quench that fervor of
affection which is due from a people to their Prince.

Whether the generality of the Nation desires a change of Kirk government,
cannot be better known then by the desires and Propositions of the
representative body of the Kingdom, nor can it be better defined what
government shall be established, than in Synod of learned and godly Divines.
Our part is to wish the pattern in Scripture and the example of the best
Reformed Kirks to be followed, and to pray that God by his Spirit may lead them
into all truth: being confident that reformation having begun by your Majesty's
authority at the head and chiefest parts, all sectaries, and all the inferior
members may be quickly by a Synod brought to such order as may consist with
truth and with the peace of the Kirk.

It was far from our intentions by the general expressions of our Petition
against Papists, To charge your Majesty with compliance and favor to their
opinions. We do from our hearts bless God for all that your Majesty has done
both here and in England against them, and for so free and ample a testimony of
your Majesty's desires of the Queens conversion. Jealousies of that kind, and
hopes in the hearts of such as are popishly affected, of their prevailing
power, proceed from the power of Papists in Ireland, the present posture of
Papists armed about your Majesty in this dangerous time of combustion in
England, and that for so long a time through the connivence or compliance of
the Ministers of estate, laws, have not been execute against them, nor any
means at all used for the Queens conversion. A necessary and essential duty,
from which no oath to the contrary can more give dispensation, then any oath of
old or late, public or private, can bind your Majesty to maintain Episcopacy
or any corruption in the worship of God, or government of the Kirk, when God by
his word gives light and by his providence calls for a Reformation. All
which had need to be seriously and tymously considered. And if the Papists be
not speedily disarmed, the danger is that both in their own project, and upon
the hearing of your Majesty's Declaration to disarme them, when there shall be
no more use of their service, they band together and bend all their wits
against a Pacification, till by their gathering and growing to greater
strength, they be able to plead in equal terms for themselves, for their
share in the places and honors of the Kingdom, at least for peace and
tolleration, as a reward of all their pains, charges and hazards, pretended to
be for your Majesty's honor and safety, but really intended for themselves and
their superstition. We cannot conceive that loyalty can be without allegiance,
or that Papists refusing to take the oath of allegiance, do fight in loyalty
and allegiance to your Majesty, but for their own ends, nor can it be safe for
Protestants to trust them upon the principles of their profession, in any
whether intestine or foreign war. In the time of the greatest foreign
invasion year 88. It was not thought safe to arm the Papists in defense of
the Kingdom. We did not take notice of Papists in the other army, in our
Petition to your Majesty, but did in our Declaration to the Parliament, that
although they had professed in their Declarations that they had no known
Papists in their Army, yet if any were found to be, we desired they might in
like manner be disbanded. Brownists, Anabaptists, and other sectaries which are
the fruits of Prelacy one way as Papists are another, are neither so easily
known as Papists nor so much to be feared: and although they be enemies to
Religion and to the peace of the Kirk, we know not whether they have been so
considerable that the law has taken so far notice of them as to disarme them.

We have so sincerely and from the inward of our spirits, with our hearts and
hands lifted up to the most high God the searcher of hearts, sworn the care of
the safety of your Majesty's person, and of your greatness and authority,
which we have also witnessed in our Declarations to the Houses of Parliament,
that our hearts within us were wounded when we did hear of the danger your
Majesty's person was in the 23 of October. And as we do with the Houses of
Parliament (as is expressed in their Declaration) rejoice and heartily praise
God for your safety, So do we not cease to pray for your Majesty's
preservation in the midst of so many dangers, and for a speedy deliverance by a
happy peace, which we trust shall bury that black and unnatural day so
unhappie and dangerous both to your Majesty and your people in eternal
oblivion, and therefore not to be paralelled by us with the unparalelled plot
of the 5. of November never to be forgotten.

We have detained your Majesty longer then your great affairs of governing
Kingdoms in the time of war could well permit, but not so long as the charge
committed to us by the General Assembly, and the importance of our Petition,
which is of religious and public concernment does require. The crime of
bitterness and want of reverence to your Majesty, the challenge of usurpation,
the aspersion of so much and manifold mistaking, we would bear the more
patiently if we were to be considered as private and particular persons, and
not as Commissioners of public trust: And yet do bear the more patiently,
because we take them (and in this no man shall persuade us that we are
mistaken) to proceed from the pen of the writer, and not from your Majesty's
justice and goodness, unto which we are bold to appeal from his unjust
censure, and from such slanderous tongues and pens as by traducing the
preaching and prayers of the ministry here of disloyalty or sedition, do much
wrong us, your Majesty much more, and truth and peace most of all. Your
Majesty in your wisdom will consider what such Sycophants are seeking, and in
your justice will rather believe our public testimony, in things best known
to our selves and to our ordinary hearers, then any private information flowing
from the malice of some, or the weakness of others. And now in your royal
goodness will be graciously pleased to suffer us your Majesty's most humble
and faithful Subjects to fall down at your feet, and with all earnestness to
renew our Petition, especially that of Unity in Religion, and uniformity of
Kirk Government in all your Majesty's Dominions, which we conceive to be
principally, intended by divine Providence in these unhappy distractions and
troubles of your Majesty's Kingdoms; And to this effect for such an
Ecclesiastical Assembly, as has been formerly described and desired: A
mean so pious, so just and so ordinary in such cases as malice it self can
have no color to object against your Majesty for using it. And which shall
speedily bring on a firm and grounded peace, and with peace all other
blessings spiritual and temporal upon your Majesty and your Kingdoms.
