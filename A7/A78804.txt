HIS MAJESTY'S GRACIOUS MESSAGE To both Houses of PARLIAMENT: Feb. 20.
FOrasmuch, as His Majesty has (together with a Treaty) proposed a Cessation
of Arms to both His Houses of Parliament now 16. days since, to which as yet
He has received no Answer: To the end that His Majesty may clearly understand
the Houses, that no such Imputations (as have been formerly) may after be laid
upon Him upon occasion of any thing that may intervene: His Majesty desires if
a Cessation shall be approved of by them, That the day upon which the Cessation
is thought fit to begin, and such particular Limits and Conditions of that
Cessation as are necessary to be agreed on before the Cessation it self can
actually begin, be proposed by them at the same time with their Approbation of
it, Since as His Majesty supposes by the present great Preparation of several
Forces of the Earl of Essex to march several ways, that till such time as
this be done, they do not conceive themselves obliged to an actual Cessation;
So neither till then does His Majesty conceive Himself obliged to it.

A Letter sent from the Earl of Manchester to the Lord of Faulkland, about the
Assizes: With the Lord of Faulklands Answer, etc.
HIs Majesty has weighed the advice and desire of the Lords and Commons sent
in a Letter to the Lord of Faulkland, from the Earl of Manchester, concerning
the putting off the General Assizes and Jail-delivery throughout the Kingdom:
To which His Majesty returns this Answer. That the present bloody
distractions of the Kingdom (which His Majesty has used all possible means
to prevent, and will still to remove) do afflict His Majesty under no
consideration more, then of the great interruption and stop it makes in the
course and Proceedings of Justice, and the execution of the Laws: Whereby His
good Subjects are robbed of the Peace and security they were born to; and
therefore as much as in him lies, He will advance that only means of their
happiness; at least, they shall see that their Sufferings that way, proceed not
from His Majesty: And since they may expect now by the Laws, Statutes, and
Customs of the Kingdom, the Assizes and general Goal delivery in every
County, His Majesty thinks not fit to command the contrary, but will take
severe and precise Order, that none of his good Subjects shall receive the
least prejudice as they repair thither, by any of His Majesty's Forces; which
rule He shall be glad to be observed by others: And then he hopes by the due
execution of the Laws, even these public Calamities may have some abatement,
and the Kingdom recover its former Peace and prosperity.

God save the King.
