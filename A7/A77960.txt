To the present Assembly, Members of Parliament at Westminster.
The Considerations of a servant of the Lord, upon the present state of
Affairs, presented unto you for to read and consider, as Informations unto you,
concerning present proceedings in this Nation.
FRIENDS,

ALl these overturnings, and almost wonderful changings, that do come to pass
in this Nation, they are all effected through the justice of the Lords Hand,
and his Hand; and Power, is in and over all these things, and if all
particulars which has happened since your first appearing on the throne were
accounted, what has come to pass, but has been accomplished and suffered, to
be by the hand of the Lord, but particularly of the present state of things,
and this last interruption which happened unto you, was it not a just reproof
upon you from the Lord? though effected in ambition, and by corrupted
Instruments, for have not you promised great things unto this Nation in matters
of freedom and liberty, but what have you done? even left this Nation
traveling under great and sore vexations, and undelivered from the bondage of
oppressions, though you have had time after time put into your hands, wherein
you might have done good things for the Lord, and for this Nation, and
righteousness might have bin established amongst you, and in the Nation, But
you negle^ed many precious days, and essected not many good things. It would
be large to instance the particular oppressions, that yet remains upon almost
all souls of people in this Land, which might have been removed long ere this
day, had you been faithful to God; But because from day to day you have been
rather careless, and served your selves more then the Lord; therefore has he
suffered you to be interrupted once, and again, and reproved by a generation of
men, as unfaithful as your selves.

Well but to pass all this, though much might be said, you are now again at
the stern of Government, and on the Throne; and I dare not but say, it is even
of and by the Lord, and that it is he that has done it, contrary to the
expectations of many, and what his end is in it remains with him; But I am
sure one cause is, that you may execute part of his wrath upon that treacherous
generation of hipocritical and deceitful men, some of the Army I mean) some of
whom have bin deceitful to God, and treacherous to the Nation; and who have
been fearful hipocrites by a show of religion more then others: and have
mocked God as it were, and his People; I need not say to you how that many of
them were raised up from a low estate, and instead of serving the Nation,
became their Lords and Oppressors, and they have abused the Lords Mercy to
them, and exalted themselves, and became as great oppressors, and as grievous
to the Nation, as ever t ey were that went before them, and some of them took
the very titles, and estates of their enemies: and followed their tyrannical
spirit also, though the Lord was long suffering to them, and gave them aday,
and put opportunities into their hands, wherein they might have done good, but
they also neglected to serve God, and the Nation to serve themselves, and
because of the ambition and pride of some of them, the Lord suffered them to
make this last interruption upon you, which was great treachery ^n men's
account, that thereby their measure might be filled up, and that he might give
you occasion against them, and suffer you to be filled with indignation toward
them, to break them to pieces; and what you do to some of them in casting them
out, and afflicting them, you are but Gods executioner^ ^herein, you are the
executioners of his anger in what you do to them, and who shall prevent you, or
forbid you to go on, for they have long enough dissembled with the Nation, in
professing more then others, and doing less, and their downfall is now come, and
God has looked upon you, to be hard hearted, and ^ruel enough, and very fit
executioners of vengeance, upon such men as I have mentioned. But now
concerning you, and your present state, as you are in present place and power,
I have something to say to you, though they are fallen, and you yet stand, and
you have a little time after them: but this (...) ^ay, do not glory over their
fall, neither glory as though you should stand for ever, for they were not
greater sinners then you are, neither ar^ you one whit more righteous then some
of them, but you are as sure to fall, as they are fallen, with no less measure
of dishonor and affliction then is come upon them, and you are in your last
hour: And I dare not say that God expects much more from you, then for the end
aforesaid (viz.) to be the executioners of Justice upon men as sinful as your
selves, so do not glory over them that are fallen, but know that your time also
is but short, and your fall may prove to your destruction, and theirs may prove
to make them better, and refine them: And if God has chosen you to execute
some part of his wrath upon them for their wickedness, he will doubtless find
Instruments to execute his wrath upon you, else he will do it with his own
hand, for he purposes not to spare you, for your sins cries as loud as the
sins of any other people, and the oppressions are as great under you, as under
them whom you condemn: And I desire if there be any good men amongst you, that
such who are wise may consider, and mind the hand of the Lord in and through
all these things that are come to pass, for God is a working as well as you, he
is seeking to set up a Kingdom as well as you, and his Government and yours
cannot stand together, and he will make you know that he is stronger, and his
Government of more force, and your Kingdom cannot stand in place with his:
Therefore oh that you would take heed! oh that you would be wise! if so be some
of you may be spared, and be not too zealous in your way, nor too furious in
your proceedings, do but to others, as you intend to receive from others, and
from the Lord; and go not beyond your Commission, for a permission you have (at
least) from God, even to scourge hypocrites, and to be a Judgment upon that
hypocritical seeming religious generation of men aforesaid, which have many
times as it were mocked God, and pretended love to him with their lips, when
their hearts have yearned after self-honour, and treasures of this world; I say
your present hour and permission is for this end, but not to persecute the
people of the Lord, nor to destroy Gods Heritage; but if you shall extend your
power unto such a work, and if you do persecute the Innocent without cause, and
make war against the Lamb and his followers, and make Laws and execute them to
the oppression of the Saints of the most High, then you go beyond your
Commission, for God has not called you unto this, but to be instruments in
another cause; and the Children of Zion, they trust in the living God, and
fears not the terror of mighty men, neither can they be afraid at the roaring
of the Sea, nor at the present threatening of the Heathen, for God is with them.

And I say to you, the servant of the Lord has pondered and considered all
these proceedings, and viewed the present state of things at this day, and
there is no Vision from God unto you, of peace and comfort, nor of a happy and
lasting Government, as you now stand; if any Prophet shall divine this unto
you, he speaks what he has not from the Lord, but the vision of his own heart,
and he deceives you and himself, for you are not established upon a right
foundation, neither are you acted by a right spirit, which can truly govern for
God; but the spirit of wrath and fury is put into you, for the work for which
you are called: and I know not how to warn you, that you do not persecute the
people of God, for why? it may be you must fill up your measure of wickedness
thereby, that God may break you perpetually, yet the less will be your
judgment if you do it not, but and if you do it, the Lord will take occasion
against you, to wound you, and you shall never be healed; and as you do afflict
others, so, and much more shall it be done unto you from the Lord: Wherefore
consider what I have said, for this is the vision of the Almighty unto you,
that shall not go unfulfilled; and what you do, you must do it quickly, for
your time is short, and your power will God subdue, and his Power and Kingdom
will he speedily exalt over your heads, and make you and the whole Nations
know, that he is God, and that all power is with him, and that he can do
whatsoever he will, and it is his right alone to reign, and his childrens
portion to possess the Kingdom with him: Let the whole earth, and all the
powers thereof bow and tremble before him, let not your hearts be stout and
rebellious against him, for he can grind you to powder, and sink you into
confusion and misery, as a stone into the Sea.
