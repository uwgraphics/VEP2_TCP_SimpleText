She should not goo / this make I goo auow
Ha my good sone she says by heaven king
That made this world / and every other thing
Ye may as surely and withouten dread
Suffer her to go as for to say your creed
Thus they depart and on their way be gone
And as they goo / these words than says one
Unto an other he has some Ialousye
It seems well he dredeth Ieopardye
Thus is he mocked by these women's art
For now come galauntes forth on every part
Which at the feast before by adventure
This foresaid work have made and put in ure
And there awaytynge ben upon their need
For to conclude and so forth to proceed
But how this wife now fested is and served
For love of her good man all undeserved
And god wot how she does her self apply
To revel dance / and for to sing on hye
Also she makes good and merry chere
But god wot how she prayseth her bedfere
The husband left at home while she is out
And sees herself so praised among the route
Certes these galauntes than her do advise
And se she is apparaylled in such wise
Perceiving well her chere and countenance
Shortly to her each one him does auaunce
One profreth much / an other offreth more
Hard is to me the cause to tell wherefore
The Ioly chere the praty trotte and pace
With the demeanynge of a woman's face
Will give these lovers cause and hardynesse
To sewe for grace unto their worthynesse
One to her words gracyous does say
An other comes as nygh her as he may
And sets his foot a lofte on hers plain
Eke by the hand quyckly he does her strain
Also an other his look casts a side
Full pyteously and sharply for a tide
An other than unto her does present
A dyamonde right fair and oryent
Or else a rich rubye with a ring
Which she receives with some other thing
By which things may she well understand
Of their intent / and feel it with her hand
If she have any reason brain or wit
And other whiles by fortune happeth it
That from her chair alyght will she adown
To do some works of devotion
Or unto Venus to do sacrefyse
But how can I not say ne in what wise
This sely man at home in poor degree
Is made and brought unto necessytee
For thylke estate that his wife does pretend
The matter thus has driven to an end
And made her goo to gaderynges and feestes
Among a wicked company of gestes
For unto her they yolden be in trust
To have their pleasures appetytes and lust
Upon none other thing do they aweyte
But how they may do this poor man deceyte
The stroke whereof he has without escape
Which comynly is called but a Iape
So he is causer of his propre shame
None other wight thereof is for to blame
And thus it happeth by contynuaunce
That what by signs speech or countenance
Troth of the thing whereof he was in doubt
All openly reported is about
Whereby he falls Ialouse in a rage
Out of the which there is no wight so sage
That him can move / for who that fervently
Of woman feieth the cruel malady
There is no medycyne that may him cure
The sickness is so sharp without mesure
Than will he beat her bytterly and curse
Whereby the works makes he much worse
For chastyce can he not by day ne night
His wife but by his betynge makes light
And hot the love between her and her friend
Thus dryueth he the matter to an end
And son he other whiles fortune may
One of her lymmes break or kytte away
Whereby his castle or his pyle he loses
Than as a mased be he him dysposeth
Withouten care and all he sets at naught
Thus has he found ye pain which he has sought
And never after will she love him more
Because that he has beten her so sore
But for to pass the time and make a show
And of fair words speaks she but few
There this poor man in turment pain and woo
Lives and yet he thinks not so
And all these sorrows / he for Joys does take
So in the lepe he is I undertake
Enclosed deep / and if he were without
Yet shortly would he in withouten doubt
There uses he his life in pain always
And wretchedly / thus ends he his days
Thus ends the second Joy of marriage
Here begins the third Joy of marriage.
(...)


AN other Joy which named is the thrydde
Of marriage in no wise may be hid
The which I purpose shortly to declare
According to mine auctour and not spare
The which is when a man in youth does wedde
A young maid / and when they both in bed
Have had their pleasures largely and desire
And well aswaged is the brennynge fire
The hoot heruest is well ouerblowe
As it with me and other is I trow
Soon after this her belly does arise
