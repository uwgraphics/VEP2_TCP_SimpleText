Now hear this all ye persecuting RULERS, PRIESTS, AND MAGISTRATES Throughout
the WORLD. The tree is known by it^ fruits, so sai^^ the Scripture as may
appe^^ by what Joh^ Waterton ca^^ed a Justice (...) peace, has been long
bearing and has brough^ forth as may appear by these following lines.
Woe, woe, terror, terror, and feirce indignation from the Lord God, even the
true Testimony written in this Book, by the Servant of the Lord Daniel Baker.
T^ is your just recompense from the righteous hand of the Lord even the equal
portion of your Cup, which the farther you go on, in persecution, the deeper
will this Cup be filled with the wrath and sore displeasure of the Lord God of
recompense: And ye Priests, Magi^rates and Rulers of England, New England, and
Rome, who have Laws, made in the corrupt wills of Men, that were in the making
of them out of Gods fear, and not in that spirit and wisdom of God, that
gave forth Scripture, and so unjust grounded Laws, by which the Popes
inquisition, is persecution to death, by fire, for the testimony of a good
conscience. New-Englands Law, after banishment to be hanged to death; Englands
Law, Men's wills, and imprisonment till death; for bearing testimony against
corrupt Laws, and corrupt Men's wills; Oh ye Magistracy and Ministry of
England, and New England, call not the Church of Rome Whore any more, like
ill-bred children (all you that persecute) seeing you may read your selves, and
all that runs may read you, like Mother, like Daughters, in persecution, all
Sons of the Bondwoman, seed of the Adulterer, and the Whore, who must all
drink up this Cup of Gods feirce indignation, and I say again the farther you
go on, the deeper will it he filled to you, and it will be for you the more
bitter to drink it; and all you Constables, Marshall and Servants to him
Goale-keepers and Servants to them, I warn you all, in the fear and dread of
the Lord God, take heed how any of you, or any man obey the command of any
Magistrates, that do, or shall in their corrupt wills, or according to any
corrupt Law, command you to serve them in persecuting the innocent, to hale
them, without a just Order under their hand, and dragge from their presence to
Prison, without a just mittimus, or somewhat to show the crime to be just, for
which you are commanded to do their command, and let Goalers consider how they
receive any into Prison, without a signifying from the Magistrate the crime
laid against them, which is but reasonable, lest blind service be done by them,
and so they be found Servants to the Devil, in doing what the corrupt wills
of Men command them, which fear not God: and so all of you (who join with
them, and lend a hand to them, in persecution) partake with them, in what is
written in this Book, even the feirce and bitter Cup of Gods just indignation.

Now is the time of thy trial come oh John Waterton, who shall most assuredly
give an account before the throne of the Lamb, the light of the holy City, for
all the deeds of darkness done in thy body, who art weighed in the equal
balance of the true Sanctuary, and art found wanting, notwithstanding thou art
called a member of a Church of Christ, who, I am certain never had, nor has,
at this day: such a corrupt, fruitless, unsavory, dark, blind, wicked member
pertaining to his most pure body which is the Church of the living God, the
pillar and ground of truth: which thou art out of. And all sober people may
behold where thou art, and have been, exercising the power of darkness of the
Beast and of the Whore that has bewitched thee with her sorceries and made
thee drunk that thou have long time reeled and staggerd and vomited up thine
own shame through the open streets, thy stink and ill savor (behold I tell
thee, is come up into the nostrils of the most pure Lord God of Sabbath, and
the eternal eye comprehends thee, and all the fruitless and wild trees of the
Forest the land of darkness and barrenness, the fire is already kindled, and
woe to the stuble, the chafe, the vipers and serpents, the deaf venomous
Adders, which in no wise would hear the voice of the Charmer, and can a fire
be kindled among such venomous unclean creeping things, and will they not
hiss make a noise and shoot forth their stinges, surely it has, and will be
so, and who can expect to gather Grapes on Thorns or Figs, on Thistles (I
know their expectations shall fail that do) a member of the true Church of
Christ, or the Man of God, of truth, meek, and merciful, as a Ruler ought to
be, and of sound Judgment, to show forth all long suffering, gentleness,
meekness, sobriety, temperance, purity, moderation, brotherly kindness, love
without dissimulation, or respect of Persons, and these and such like, are the
fruits of the pure clean spirit of the Lord; but mine eye has not yet beheld
these fruits proceed from thee, but contrariwise bringing forth corrupt and
unsavory fruits, by which the poor and needy have been long time eppressed
and burdened under which they have deeply sighed and groaned, chiefly upon the
first days of the week, which thou, in thy blind dark zeal, has often
called the Sabbath, or Lords day, whose is every day, to the shame of thy dark
Teachers, who have not yet taught thee to distinguish, between the days of the
week and the Sabbath and so art found persecuting with the powers of
darkness, them that fear the Lord and keep his Commandments, who said, six
days shall thou labor, and the seventh, the Sabbath which was given for a
sign, to Israel, in the wilderness: where the Idolaters and Murmerers were
destroyed and fell, before the Believers entered into the good Land of rest: and
many shall fall after the same example, amongst whom thou art, who shall give
an account for every Loaf of Bread and ounce of Meat, Flower, and necessary
Food and Raiment which the poor, the Widows and Fatherless have wanted,
which thou through thy persecuting, oppressing, blind, wicked zeal on the
first days of the Week have so frequently taken from them without pity,
compassion or mercy, which is all out of the way of God: whose ways are
equal, and if any Man do the thing that is good, just, or equal, on the
first day which is one of the six, which the Lord commanded Israel, saying,
six days shall thou labor, he does well, and if the Lord command one thing,
and blind persecuting Magidrates, and great Men of the Earth, make Laws and
Decrees to command another thing, whether is it better to obey God or man, let
such as fear, and desire to fear the God of truth, judge; and let every Man
search with the light, his own heart, and so be fully persuaded in his own
mind: see what Daniel in such a matter, and the three children did, Dan.
3.17.18. and Dan. 6. and I am sure it is very unreasonable and unequal
oppression and cruelty for any one who bears the name, Read a Book entitled
an Epistle to all the Christian Magistrates and powers in the whole
Christendom; Sold at the Bull and Mouth near Aldersgate; And another sheet
entitled, the voice of thunder.
especially of a Christian Magistrate or Chris;tian, or of a member of a Church
of Christ, to take food or raiment by force, tyranny and cruelty from the poor
and needy, the Widows and Fatherless, after they have wrought hard for their
bread; then to have their bred, food, and raiment, with violence, force, and
cruelty, taken from them, without mercy, pity or compassion by thee; Oh John
Waterton, how hard will it be for thee with many more that is in thy nature, to
find repentance unto Life, for in these and such like cruelties have thou long
exercised thy self; now the everlasting light of life is springing up, and
will shine over the whole Earth, and spread from Sea to Sea, for it comprehends
the darkness, and fathomes the depths of Satan's wiles, his Laws and Decrees,
and espyeth out the turnings and twinings of the most subtle Serpents: and thou
in any wise cannot be hid from this eye, the light; the Rod of whose mouth,
will smite the Earth, the breath of whose Lips shall slay the wicked, who are
as the troubled Sea that cannot rest; as thou did manifest thy self, the last
first day in thy rage, and fury, without mercy, pity or compassion.

To my wife and children: who are left as the widow, and father less I being
cast into prison, (by unreasonable men) because of my testimony in obedience to
the Lord, against the deeds of the world that lies in wickedness, for they are
evil, and wicked, and the Lord is pleading with the inhabitants of the earth
for these things and thy work, and place should have been, had thou been a
man of God, (the last first day which thou calls the Sabbath) to be a terror to
evell doers and brutish people that are with thee in Cain, Esau, Nimrod, and
Ismaells life and nature, to have stilled and restrained them, from offering and
doing violence against them that depart from evil by the fear of the Lord;
but contrary wise, thou did as much as in thee lay, strengthen the hands of the
wicked to make a prey of the innocent, that fear, and obey the pure spirit of
the Lord, in doing the thing that's Just, Equal, and good in his sight; though
the heathen rage, and persecute, and imagine vain things yet it shall go well
with them that fear the Lord, who is, and is to be worshipped in spirit and in
truth: out of which thou art, otherwise I say thou would not have so
strengthened the hands of evil doers, in going about to ruinate my wife and
family, who, I say was left as a widow and fatherless, by throwing one of my
servants into prison, and putting the other in the stocks, and making (as it
were a prey of my goods, and venting forth bitter wicked vile threatenings and
unsavory words, as is thy usual manner so to do, not becoming a man, thou
bear the name of, but art not, speaking these words, of my wife, calling her
Baker's Wench, and my Maid Bakers Impe, and of such sober people that could not
do, nor act violence with the wicked, calling them Bakers Imps, and sometimes
saying, I was a rogue, oftentimes telling people I was mad: and Baker thou will
be in hell ere long, when I bid thee repent, fear God, and do justice, these,
and such like unsound words, and filthy abominations acted by thee, which are
for judgment, and to be condemned: came from thee, and the eternal eye and
ear of the Lord has seen and heard these things, and behold, the light of
life is arising, who with the hand of his power, is coming near to judgment,
with which he will plead with the oppressors, and the cause of the innocent
suffering seed of Christ in the male and in the female. Yea he is arising (who
comes not to send peace on the earth, but a sword.)

Here followth some particulars written in a mittimus under John Waterton's
hand, who committed my servant Richard Tailor to new B^idewell, who performed
the duty of his place, and trust, and honest fidelity about the space of half
a year, and as the duty of a good servant is, has performed his work the
time of his being my servant, so that I have no evist thing to lay to his
charge, and this I testifye that he served under the command of Captain Whore
in the service of the Commonwealth, immediately before: and since he came to
be my servant who chiefly went through all my business in my honest employment
for the maintenance of my Wife and Family, I being in bonds my self, and this
my Servant by force taken out of my house and cast in to prison by John
Waterton, called a Justice of peace, with the mittimus stuffed with lies slanders
and reproaches.

As the moderate reader may read and understand.

MIDDLESEX.
To the Governors of the house of correction.
These are in the names of the keepers of the libertyes of England, etc. To
receive into your custody the body of Richard Tailor being a dissolute and
disorderly person and cannot give any good account of his living nor whence he
came.


Now herein be it known to thee. John Waterton that thou have much abused,
belyed, and falsely accused the poor man, who did and yet may testify to thy
face that he was my servant, and that he had been so long with me as above
mentioned about half a year: and this was a good account of his living I
bear reccord also, though thou have caused such lies and standers to be
written under thy hand of the poor man my servant, and moreover he told thee
concerning his name where it was to be found in the muster rolls, and also
told thee his name, and when James Brock asked John Waterton why he put my
servant in prison, his answer was because he would do it, then James Brock
asked if this were an answer beseeming a Christian, much more a Christian
Magistrate, and he said twice it is good enough for thee.

And thou telling people (concerning the people of the Lord) who worship him in
spirit and in truth, that they were a company of Whores and Rogues, and that
they met together to play the whore and the rogue, and this is true that thou
said so, but in the fear of the Lord in the behalf of his innocent suffering
people, behold I testify that it is utterly false, and these unclean wicked
ahominations is hated, abhorred, and utterly denied by us. And moreover John
Waterton, thou said to Jeffery Winchurst when he said to thee, that it was
better to suppress the Alehouses which were so many, and the cause of much
sin in the land, then thou told him, it was long of him, and he answered thee,
it was long of thee, and other Justices that did grant them Licenses, next day
thou told J. W. That thou would indite him to the Sessions for denying to put
my maid in the stocks, though J. W. were not then there in thy presence: and
thou may remember that thou said, if thou were a theife thou would rob the
Quakers rather then any other, as thou past the fields with him to Stepny
steeple-house and it is manifest what was in thy heart, was it not fulfilled last
first day of the week, when thou commanded two Men to take my goods out of my
shop, and have not yet restored it again, which was about a bushill of flower,
and its written, the theife should restore fore-fold, or be sold for his theft,
and I would not have the theife hanged, but that he might live to repent and
reform his life. And work with his hands in the thing that is good, and this is
according to Moses spirit in the Scriptures of truth, and the Apostles
doctrine, who said let him that has stolen steal no more, and I would not
have any hanged for stealing on the first day or any other day, as the Mayor
and some Aldermen of the City of London can testify, for I am a friend to
Moses, Christ, the Prophets, and Apostles spirit. O man what will be thy end,
for surely these things will lie heavy upon thy conscience when the hand of the
Lord visits.

And the reason thou gives, in thy lying Mittimus of my Servants commitment was
for asisting silly women to keep open my shop on the Lords day, but art not
thou in the night, in the darkness, and is not the light good, and is not that
which is good called day: and is not the first day of the week a good day, and
so is every day, whose is the Lords, that made them, and tell me which day I
shall open my shop that is not the Lords day.

And whereas thou calls them silly women, whom thou said my servant did
assist, I tell thee again, thou have falsely accused the innocent, and they are
not silly women, for they have learned of Christ the light, the Lord of the
Sabbath, the substance that ends the signs to come out of the shaddows and
likenesses, and thou may read in the Scriptures that they are silly women that
are laden with sins, led away with diverse lusts, ever learning, etc. 2 Timothy 3.
chap.

The thorny briery and unsavory professors of the Prophets good words may read
themselves, who are so proud, haughty, and scornful in their costly array, and
changeable suites of apparel, being at ease in the flesh, whose minds are led
captive after every lust, and vanity, and so become defiled and hardened,
walking haughtily with stretched forth necks, the spirit of envy exercising
their minds, with such scornful eyes, that they can hardly tell how to look
one another in the face without disdain, not knowing a bridle to their own
tongues, nor like to Sarah's adorning within, which will bridle the whole
course of the proud rebellious nature, and I say this is not liked nor believed
in by these which serve the Lusts, Pride, Vanity, Pleasures which are of the
world, and not of the Father of truth, and yet such are called Christians,
members of Churches, and of the body of Christ (the light, the la^ (...) ^fore
whose throne such shall assuredly give an account, and (...) also tell thee,
such are silly women, and they are not so, who learn of Christ whom thou have
falsely accused and freequently vented forth bitter lying reproaches against
them, which I say again, Will lie heavy upon thy conscience, when the Lords
hand visits, from which in any wise thou can not fly, nor hide.

Though thou say he refused to tell his name yet thou knew it and did express
it in thy mittimus, and also to make him odious with thy enmity, thou have
caused to be written in thy lying mittimus these lying reproachful words,
saying he appears before me to be a dangerous suspicious person of idle life,
and this I testify for the poor man my servant to thy face, which will stand
upon thy head that this is evil, and wickedly false, and many people and
neighbors about my dwelling house can bring in their record, and bear
testimony with me against thee; and the Lords eternal witness in thy
conscience will also bear a true testimony, and judge thee for these, and many
other abominations acted by thee, against me, my wife and family from time to
time, and behold this I tell thee, the Lord knows my heart, I desire these
things I have written, might not be laid to thy charge, at the time when if
happily thou may find a place of repentance unto life.
