TO THE Christian Reader.
Christian Reader,
WHEN I consider the divisions that are among us, arising from the diversities
of the Judgments and opinions of men, and the dangers we are in thereby, it
makes me fear, we are fallen into those times, which are said shall come,
which are called perilous times, 2 Timothy 3.1. Men shall be lovers of
themselves, Covetous, Boasters, Proud, Blasphemers, etc. And from self it is,
that men seek to set up themselves, and the brats of their own brain, and
fall so in love with them, as for the obtaining of their desires, they run
desperate hazzards, for they are not willing that truth should prevail, nor
those that seek to hold it forth in their practices; and therefore they
endeavor to make all stoop to them: and to that end they use all means to
obtain their own wills, and therefore they that stand against them, they
endeavor to load with reproach, and slander, and to draw off peoples hearts
from them, and after themselves; nay, they give many privy nips at the power of
Godliness, under smooth pretenses, and expressions, which is very sad to
think of; especially coming from such men as Ministers, and Elders, and in
the Province of London, the chief City and place in the Kingdom, which makes
it the more dangerous, and the more to be lamented. And therefore my desire is,
for thy good, that thou would beg of God such a heart that thou may
observe what our Savior says, that thou would Take heed what thou do
hear or read, and that of the Apostle, Believe not every spirit, but try the
spirits whether they be of God or not, and that, try all things, and hold fast
that which is good: For it is said by our Savior, that there shall arise many
false Prophets, and shall deceive many, nay, if it were possible, they should
deceive the very Elect; and therefore we had need watch and pray, that we enter
not into temptation; and therefore be very careful when thou art to read the
book called the vindication of the Presbyterian Government and Ministers, for
although there be many fair words, and pretenses, yet thou shall find many
things in it, which, if thou do not take heed, may prove very dangerous
unto thee, for there thou may see godliness pretended, but those that
desire to walk up to the power of godliness, reproached, and called
Schismatics, etc. and charged with rending the Church, and people warned to
reject their doctrine; and many such kind of aspersions they are laden with, in
many parts of that book, which is sad to think of. But my intent is to speak
but a word to them in this book, nor to say more of them at this time. But my
intent is as thou may see, mainly, to answer a book that was set out with
forty seven of their names to it, which I think, were all of the same society:
the reason that causes me to think so, is, because many of them, are known to
be of them, and yet there is not a word spoken against their proceedings in
that book, which may give occasion to fear they are all of one mind, which is
sad to think of, there being so much sin in it, and that thou may not think
it strange that it should come forth row so long after: I had brought it near
to a readiness for the Press a good while since, but seeing so many Answers
come to it, I resolved to let it alone. But now seeing a book come forth with
such a dress, as A Vindication of the Presbyterian Government and Ministry, I
took it and did read it, and finding still the same frame of spirit as before,
so far as I was able to perceive, although it were in a smoother way; It put
me upon thoughts to put forth what I had formerly taken some pains in,
especially concerning the National Covenant, it being that which I perceive is
their strong hold to run unto, upon all occasions; and also that is one of
their maine Pillars to bear them up, in what they do speak and write, against
such as walk more strictly in the ways of God then themselves do: And
besides, I perceive that many of those, that I believe, fear God, are much
stumbled at it, and caused to think and speak evil of the present Parliament
and Army for their late actings; and therefore for the vindication of the
Covenant, Parliament, and Army, and yielding some little light to the godly
Readers, I have brought it forth, that so if it be the will of God, people may
be more settled in the way the Lord has cast us into, and give him that
praise which is his due, and their duty to give him.

And that it may appear, neither the Parliament nor Army, in what they have
acted, nor the godly people in what they have Petitioned, have broken the
Covenant; especially in such a manner, as some would make the world believe
they have: but those that cry out so of the breach of Covenant, are the
greatest breakers of it themselves; and therefore that prejudice may be taken
off from the Parliament, Army, and godly people, and the thoughts of unbyassed
Readers may be established, and those that have been, and are the great
Censurers of others, may come to see their sin, and be willing to take the
shame of it; and so cease to condemn others, and learn to condemn
themselves, by owning their own sins, and that the consideration thereof may
be a means to stop them from such high and violent courses, and also from such
uncharitable ways and practices. And others may be kept from doing or approving
these or the like practices, is, and shall be my earnest desire.

And therefore, Christian Reader, my desire is, that thou would read this
book with such a frame of spirit as may cause thee to read it with judgment
and consideration of every part of it, so as to be willing to see the truth,
and to stoop to it, so as thou may understand, love, and practice it: and
therefore my desire is, thou would desire of God an humble and meek heart,
to read withal, that he may teach thee, for he has promised to teach the
humble, and guide the meek to glory, and that he may deal so by thee, shall
be the prayer of him who is,

Thine in the Lord Jesus. NEHEMIA CENT:

A WORD to LONDONS Provincial Assembly.
I Have lately seen a Book called, A Vindication of the Presbyterian
Government and Ministry; with many exhortations to Ministers, and Elders, and
people, joining with you, or separating from you, which I took and read over,
and that without contempt, mocking, or scoffing; which when I had considered, I
saw no cause I should, for I saw more cause of mourning, then of scoffing, and
of pitying of you, then of contempt, and of praying the Lord to bring your
hearts into a better frame then of mocking: And therefore I could but wonder
whence such suspicions should arise in you; and when I had a little considered,
I could not tell, except it were from your own experience in your practices;
for when I considered the substance of the Book, I saw that which did make me
think you had not read the Book of that Reverend Mr. Hooker about
Church Government, or if you have, you have slighted it at the best; for had
you read it with a sound and serious spirit, weighing well what he has said,
it will fully answer many of your allegations, and take away many of your
foundations you seem to build upon in your Book: And for scoffing and
contempt, I should have wondered whence you should have such thoughts, but that
I consider your frame of spirit in your former Book, from which it must arise,
or else from the guilt of your own consciences of what you then did, which you
may fear will render you justly contemptible: at least you might fear it
could not be esteemed, there being so much of that spirit that did show it
self in the former Book: for although there be many good things in it, and
many glorious expressions, yet there is so much Collaquintida in it mixed, as
may make it very dangerous to the takers, if they take not good heed: And the
truth is, it came out unseasonably; for if you intended to set out a
Vindication, you should have stayed until you had first set out a book of your
acknowledgement and humiliation for what you had formerly so sinned in, that so
you might have given satisfaction to those that you had offended, and then
vindication might have come in season, for you must think it is not forgotten,
and if you had done so, it would have been past over, and forgotten of those
that are the people of God; whereas now they see there is cause still of
applying of more of what you had formerly, that if it be possible you may at
the last come to see your sin, and mourn, and give satisfaction for it,
which is one end of the writing of this book, or at least in committing it to
the Press; and another end is, to undeceive the people in that strong hold
which you think you have against them, at least you have made many believe so,
which is the breach of Covenant: for it may hold forth a little light to cause
them to see the Covenant is not broken so as you would make them believe,
especially not by those persons that you so cry out against for breaking of it;
but that the breach will return upon your selves, although in all your
writings still you fly upon that, it being one main thing you center upon in
this book of yours, and by which, and in which, you take occasion to set up
your selves, and to fling filth upon others; And indeed, you had more need to
have condemned your selves, then to set up your selves; and it would have been
more for the glory of God, and the peace and comfort of your own souls, and
more to the furtherance of the work you are going about, which you would have
all to conform unto you in; for all wise humble men will think the worse of
your way, or at least suspect the more, because you seek so much to set up
your selves, for they may fear, and that justly, the Lord will not honor you
so much as to show you the pattern of his house; for they can see what the
Lord says, Ezekiel. 43.10, 11. If they be ashamed of all that they have done,
then show them the pattern of the house, the in-goings, and the outgoings,
and the whole fashion thereof, and all the Ordinances thereof, and the figures,
and all the Laws thereof, etc. So if you had published your shame, for what
you had so sinfully done before, then you and we might have had hope the Lord
would have showed you the pattern of his house; for as you say of your
Presbyterian way, may be truly found of a Church way, it is hard to find, and
more hard to follow, for it is very difficult, and the Lord must show it us, or
else we can never find the right way; for I fear your way is too easy and
broad to be the right way: and he has made no promise to show them the way,
that seek to command, and set up themselves. I hope you have not forgotten
that exhortation, Let another praise thee, and not thy own self; and you know
what our Savior faith of him that sets up himself above others; and who it was
that said, Come see my zeal, and is thy heart right as mine is, it had been
well for him if his heart had been so right as his was which he spoke to; the
Lord give you hearts to examine if there be not too much of that spirit in you,
it does so much show it self in the other book, and this also: And may not
the former instances suit you, between you, and those, at least some of them,
whom you so much condemn, and count so dangerous persons, whom you load with
so many sad aspersions, as rending the Church, and hindering of Reformation, and
of Schism; and warn your people to take heed of them, and of their doctrine,
as being strict above what is written, etc. And does not all this show what is
formerly said is apparent; the Lord help you to consider it, that so you may
take heed how you load others with such aspersions, especially such as your
own conscience will tell you, walk with God in uprightness. Would it not be
better for you to lay before them the truth of your ways by the word of God,
and confute them by the word of God if you be able so to do. But your taking
this course, will give wise men to think or at least to fear you are not able
so to do, or else that you have not found by experience the power of the truth
of God in your selves; for if you had, you should not need to fear, but that
it is of far more power to convince, and prevail with persons, then all such
ways as you take: for all arguments, although they be according to the word of
God, are not able to convince any, except the Lord go with it by his Almighty
power; and therefore not such kind of courses as these be, which his word allows
not of; and therefore you cannot have the least hope to prevail with persons
by them, but you may fear the Lord will appear against you for them, and so
blast you and your ways, which you seek to set up by such kind of doings. I
dare not think you are so little acquainted with the Lord and his power, that
he puts forth in his word, when it is purely and truly held forth, as that he
is not able and willing to vindicate his own truth, when it is held forth in
an humble manner, without such sinful ways as you take; nay assuredly, he
will never own, much less go out with such ways.

I beseech you therefore, fear and tremble to go on in them; for it is just
from him that you should not only lose your labor, but should meet with
disgrace, and if not contempt for your so doing, for God will resist you in
such ways.

And beside, the persons you write to exhort, I hope have not lived so long
within the bounds of the Province of London, where the word of God has been so
long taught, and in such a manner, as it has been, and is still taught by
some faithful Ministers of the word of God, but they have learned to esteem
more of one Argument out of the Word of God, then of thousands of such kind of
expressions; nay I hope they have learned to know the Lord above such kind of
expressions in such a way, and therefore all such who are godly will be so
far like unto him as they will do the like, especially when they are brought
forth against the generation of the just, as your own Consciences cannot but
tell you these be, as has been formerly said, at least some of them, and
therefore you must not think to prevail with any that fear God by such
Arguments, or rather by such revilings, and I desire, for your sakes, you be
not judged at the last day for Raylers; and I fear, you see so much your
selves, that if those you so speak against, if they should speak so of you,
it would be esteemed railing by you, and that you would make the world take
notice you did so esteem them; but blessed be the Lord they do not so, nor I
hope will not deal so by you, but will rather say, the Lord rebuke you or
rather him that furthers such courses; and also pray that the Lord would please
to honor you so far as to make you see the evil of such ways, and be
humble, and also will bring the Word of God, and such Arguments therefrom, as
the Lord may be pleased to go with all as may convince you, and all those to
whom you write, and all those that shall read what you write, as you and they
may have cause to bless God, for while they live in this world, and to all
eternity, and be a means to make you and them to study, and pray the Lord to
bring your hearts into such a frame, that you may be willing to find, and also
to submit unto the way that the Lord Jesus Christ has appointed his people to
worship him in; which I hope will be the end and ^yme of all such as take pen
in hand to write, to answer you in this Book, that so truth, and not victory,
and the glory of God, and his Will may be submitted unto, and not their own
wills may be obtained of all that love the Lord Jes^^ in sincerity, and unity,
and love procured therein, and contention and divisions may cease among us, and
that we may come to serve him and one another in love, that so the Lord Jesus
may take deli^ht in us, and dwell with us, and in us, and among us, while as he
shall see we seek not our own ends but his glory, walking in self denial
and humility, and keeping to his truth exactly; and not do as you have done,
to w^rne people to reject such doctrines as hold forth a strictness above what
is written, and therein bring in all such as teach, that whosoever will enter
into Church Fellowship must first take a Church Covenant.

I pray consider if it be not necessary they should so do, for are not all men
free where they will sit down and dwell, and when they are set down, are they
not still free whether they will join to the Church or not? and if they do
not, if they offend you may tell them; if they refuse to hear you, go and
tell the Church, and if they send for him, if he refuse to come, you can
proceed no further against him by your Churchway; and what is meant by joining,
if it be not by covenanting to walk together with the Church in the ways of
the Gospel? and if a person so do, then you have power over him; so as the
Covenant gives you all the power you have over a person to exercise the Church
Discipline upon him, or else you have none; and if you have not power over them
that are in the Church, then wherefore is Church Discipline? and therefore the
Covenant giving you that power, it must needs be necessary; for that the Church
has such a power is written, and must exercise it upon the offending Brother,
and therefore by necessary consequence from Scripture-grounds, there must be a
Church Covenant, which you may see far more at large, and more clearly
inreverend M. Hookers Book of the survey of Church Government, and therefore it
is not a doctrine above what it written, and therefore not to be rejected; but
such as we must have an ear to hear, and a heart to believe, being agreeable
to the Word of God; and for what you speak of the Lords Supper, that there is
more required then freedom from ignorance and scandal, if you mean gross
ignorance and scandal it is a truth, and such a truth as is written, and the
Lord has a mouth to speak, and therefore we must have an ear to hear, and a
heart to believe, and therefore it ought not to be rejected; for are we not
bidden to examine our selves, and is it not necessary to discern the Lords
Body, and also to know the danger if we do not come worthily? all which,
persons grossly ignorant, or grossly scandalous, cannot, nor will not do; and if
you mean by freedom from these that we should be wholly free, then except you
be able to prove what you say against any that they teach so, it is a slander,
and that which you have cause to acknowledge and repent of, especially you
having put it in print that it may come abroad in the world, for we know none
require any qualifications above these; and therefore I pray consider, if
beside the slander of that you hold forth be not dangerous to your selves, and
those you have written to, and also to as many as shall read your Book, and
which is worse, derogatory to the glory of G^d And then consider, how you will
answer for it before him at that great and dreadful day, when you shall be
called forth, and must appear to answer for all you have done in the body. And
whereas you speak of persons casting reproaches upon the Ministers of Christ,
I beseech you by this little that has been said, if you may not fear it may
be a just hand of God against you that people should so do; as also if you do
but look whether you have not gone before them by your own example, to lead
them so to do, for have you not done so? witness what has been already said
of your dealing with others, and then is it a wonder you should meet with it
your selves? nay, have you not reproached them with unseemly names, as calling
them Sectaries, and Schismatics; nay, have you not gone against the light of
your own Consciences in what you have done, while as they walk peaceably and
conscientiously among you in the ways of God, and so you have done worse then
those you condemn, which have spoken so of you; for although it be not to be
approved of, that any should reproach you, but condemned, yet consider if you
have not given them just cause so to do, which I hope by that time you have
read this Book, and considered, you will smite upon your own hearts and
confess you have, and then I hope you will take the counsel is given you
elsewhere in this Book, and learn better language hereafter, especially to
publish it to the world; for I cannot but believe you are convinced not only
they are the S^rvants of Christ, but the Ministers of Christ, especially some
of them: and what a sad thing it is that Ministers should so speak of
Ministers, if this be not rending of the Church, and if it may not be called
Schism, yet if it be not very like it, let the judicious conscientious, and
impartial Reader judge; as also what hurt this may do in every place where it
shall come, especially it being in print; and I beseech you consider what root
this came from, if it be not from pride, as has been formerly said? for why
should you thus cry out, and speak so much evil of them, because they will
not stoop and come in to you, and be of your judgment, and go on in your way;
why may they not as well find fault with you, because you do not condescend
to them, especially if you consider what has been said, and what is in
reverend Mr. Hookers Book, and we may the rather believe they are in the right
way then you, because they hold forth most self denial, and I beseech you
therefore again and again, take heed you be not found raylers at the Churches
and people of the living God, and such as he will own at the last day, and
bring them in Judgment against you; for you know what became of him that
railed on the Host of the living God, there was a stone came and made him fall
upon the earth and he was destroyed: But yours being not only of the Host, but
also of the Ministers of the Lord Christ; that stone that is spoken of, which
is hewn out of the Mountain will fall upon you and crush you, if you be found
such; for the Church is compared to an Army with Bannors, and the Lord Christ
is their General, before whom you will never be able to stand if he come
against you: which the Lord in his abundant mercy give you hearts to consider
of, together with all the arguments besides, that are written in this book, and
also all that has bin, or shall be written in any other book that some, or all
of them may be so gone along withal by his blessing and the powerful working
of his Spirit, as that it may thoroughly convince you of your sin, that he may
follow it on to bring you to true humiliation, and acknowledgement of it in
such a public way as may be to hi^ glory, and your own peace and true
comfort, that so it may be pardoned, and your souls everlastingly saved; and
that it may do good, and keep from evil all those to whom it shall come, whom
he shall give a heart to read it impartially, which is the whole aim and
desire of him who caused it to be printed, and to that end shall follow it with
his prayers so far as the Lord does assist.

I should have written much more in answer to your Vindication, but that I
having written so much in answer to your former Book, and not doubting but
that others far more able and fit will give you full answers, unto whom I
shall willingly leave it, and pray they may do it effectually, and with such
ends and aims as the Lord who is the searcher of all hearts may be pleased to
go along with them and it, as it may become effectual to his glory, the peace
and comfort of their souls, and the good of all the Church and people of God;
and so for this time I shall commit it to him, and wait and expect his gracious
answer by his blessing upon it.

The Covenant vindicated against all Intruders and Opposers.
Gentlemen;
YOu have in a Letter of yours (to the General and his Council of war) laid
many things to the charge of the Army, and so as you make them great offenders,
which you and all others have cause to consider of, because the things therein
contained do concern the Parliament, and many of the godly party in the
Kingdom; they having been such as have been approved of by the one, and
petitioned by the other, and therefore it will be good to consider them,
again, and again, before we censure them, for God does usually reveal his
mind to them that fear him: and therefore if it be the mind of God they have
done, then I hope you will see, that you have gone against the mind of God in
what ye have done (in this your accusation of them) and that you have cause to
be humble, and give what satisfaction you can; although I fear you cannot
hardly be able to give satisfaction to the full.

And therefore it will not be amiss to consider what our condition was before
the beginning of these troubles, and what it has been since. You may remember
before these troubles began, there were many sore burthen^, which lay upon the
hearts of the honest party in the Kingdom, which, I suppose, many of you, if
not all, were sensible of: I am sure if you were not, some were so sensible of
them that they chose rather to forsake their dear native Country, and hazard
themselves in a wilderness among wild-men and wild-beasts, and many other
sad hazzards to themselves and families, to be at freedom from them, and
enjoy their liberties, to honor God in his own ways, rather then to endure
those burdens: for they saw, and you might see also, that the whole law of God
was violated in ahigh degree; which stands in our duty toward God in knowing,
and worshipping of him, in a right manner, according to his Word, and in our
duty we owe to men, with whom we have to deal, which in sum, is that our
Savior tells us, is the fulfilling of the whole law, and in these are the
privileges of all those that fear God, that they may enjoy both these as God
does require, and you being hindered in both these, your burdens were
insufferable, but we had no remedy, but your only hope, under God, lay in a
Parliament to help to right us, and relieve us in this condition, and
therefore our desires were earnest for a Parliament, which through many
difficulties the Lord was pleased to grant us, and then you thought you had a
power to countervaile that power which before did oppress you, which made you
conceive by this means you might be set at liberty from your fore named
burdens, and procure a freedom in both, to act for the glory of God; but when
it came to the pinch, you know what was done by that power which did hold you
in bondage, what plotting and contriving there was, against that power which
should act for your liberty, as has appeared by many Declarations of
P^^liament, that they were such as tended to bring in Popery and Tyranny.

And it does appear further by their late Declaration of the 18 of January
last, where it appears they sought unto the King, by making their complaints
to him by humble Petitions, and Remonstrances, and Declarations, but all in
vain; and the obstruction did continually flow from the Kings immediate
design, which did appear in what he did offer to the English Army, and also
to the Scots, as to give them the four Northern Counties, and the plunder of
the City of London, as appears, in the sixth page of the fore named Declaration.

And further it appears in that he did in Ireland, as there it appears. And
further his withdrawing from the Parliament, and setting up his Standard
against it, and then they being in such a condition they were fain to raise an
Army, and then seeing in what manner they were opposed, and fearing the people
might be drawn aside, they did enter into a Covenant themselves, and caused the
people so to do, that by this they might have a strong tie upon them, to bind
them to do that they were in duty bound to do, which was to hold for the glory
of God, to maintain that in the Privileges of the Parliam. whereby the Law of
God might be preserved: which caused the most part of the godly people in the
Kingdom to be willing to enter into that Covenant: and I hope it was that you
aimed at in persuading and stirring up the people so to do; and therefore the
Covenant was taken to that end, and must be so taken, if lawfully taken,
according to the rule which we must swear, in Truth, in Righteousness, and
Judgment: and therefore there must not be a Covenant, that any part thereof
should cross that end: so as the King and his party must be preserved to that
end and no further, and the Privileges of Parliament and the liberties of the
Kingdom, must be preserved for that end and no further, for all must stoop to
that maine end, the glory of God, because therein consists all our Privileges,
and peace, and what ever else is good: So, as if the King, or Parliament, in
part, or in whole, or any other person, or persons whatsoever, will go contrary
to that end, the Covenant binds to take them to be enemies to God, and the
peace and Privileges of Parliament, and Kingdom.

For it may be said, as sometime Jehu said to Jehoram, what peace can there be,
etc. So we may say, what peace can there be so long as Idolatry or oppression
remains, or is sought to remain in the Kingdom. And the Covenant does bind
all that have taken it to do their utmost (to bring all such to trial, that
they may receive condign punishment) and that with their lives and estates,
and not only so, but they must aid and assist all those that do take and
bring any such to trial, to receive such condign punishment, as shall be
according to their deserts: And therefore if the King will go contrary to that
forenamed end, the glory of God, wherein stands the Privileges of Parliament,
and the peace and liberties of the Kingdom, he must be brought forth; or if
any in Parliament will do so, they must be brought forth, or any other person
whatsoever: for there is none excepted in the Covenant. And therefore you
preached, curse you Meroze because he came not out to help the Lord against
the mighty, and therefore your aim was against them principally; ask
conscience if it were not them, for who could have carried on that design but
those, and you did well so to do, and to mind the people of their Covenant.

And however then your breadth of charity was such, as you might think the King
was led by evil Counsel at those times, and therefore you might think to
preserve his person, if it could and might appear it was so really, but
however you were resolved to go on in acting for the glory of God, and therein
for the peace and liberties of the Kingdoms to free them from their former
burdens, and therefore he being among them, if he would continue among them,
they must go out as well against him, as against any other, and he might fall by
a bullet or a sword, as well as any other, nay there was more cause to go
against him then against any one man; because he was the only man able to carry
on such a design by his Authority.

And for the Parliament, because you saw nothing, but that they did act for
those ends, you did encourage people, to go fight for them, and their party,
against the King, and his party, which did oppose those ends. But afterward you
might see apparently, that it was not from his evil Council alone, but it was
from himself: which did appear, by his refusal to hearken to those many
Petitions, Declarations, Remonstrances, and other proffers made unto him from
time to time. Nay when his evil Council was taken away, he came not to his
Parliament, but did fly to the Scots. Nay, when he was in Prison, and after,
notwithstanding they did condescend to a Treaty upon terms of disadvantage,
yet he held still to his principles: which had they yielded unto, they had not
only lost the Cause, for which so much blood and treasure, yea innocent blood
of Saints was shed, and that in abundance: but in all liklyhood, they had
brought themselves and the Kingdoms into a greater and worser bondage then
before: And besides, they had broken their Covenant in so doing.

And afterward, when it did appear that many in Parliament did act so as was
against your forenamed ends, and did side in yielding to the King and his
party, then the Army was bound if it were in their power, and so all that had
taken the Coven went are likewise bound so far as their power did reach to
apprehend them, and bring them to their trial, that they might receive condign
punishment, and that by their Covenant. So as if it appear, that the
Parliament still sitting, the Army, and godly party of the Kingdom did desire
and act no other ways then f^r the glory of God, in the Privileges of
Parliament, and liberties of the Kingdom, and in discharge of their Covenant;
then they are so far from deserving blame for what they have done, as they
deserve encouragement and commendations for what they have done. And that they
have so done, may be seen and judged the better, we will set down the Covenant
at large: which is as follows.

I. THat you shall sincerely, really, and constantly, through the grace of God,
in your several places and callings, endeavor the preservation of the
Reformed Religion of the Church of Scotland, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline
and Government, against our common enemies, the Reformation of Religion in the
Kingdom of England and Ireland, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and
Government, according to the Word of God, and the example of the best Reformed
Churches, and shall endeavor to bring the Churches of God in the three
Kingdoms to the nearest conjunction and uniformity in Religion, and Confession
of Faith, Form of Church Government, Directory for Worship and Catechizing,
that we and the posterity after us, may, as brethren, live in faith and love,
and the Lord may delight to dwell in the midst of us.

II. That we shall in like manner, without respect of persons, endeavor the
extirpation of Popery, and Prelacy, that is, Church Government by Archbishops,
Bishops, their Chancellors, and Commissaries, Deanes, Deanes and Chapters, Arch
Deacons and al other inferior Officers depending on that Hierarchy,
Superstition, Heresy, Schism, Profaneness, and whatsoever shall be found
contrary to sound Doctrine; and the power of god^inesse least we be partakers
of other men's sins, and in danger to receive of their plagues, and that the
Lord may be one and his name one, in the three Kingdoms.

III. We shall with the same sincerity, reality, and constancy in our several
vocations, endeavor with our estates and lives, mutually to preserve the
Privileges of Parliament, and the Liberties of the Kingdom: And to preserve
and defend the Kings Majesty's person and Authority in the preservation of the
true Religion, and the liberties of the Kingdom, that the World may bear
witness with our consciences of our true Loyalty; and that we have no
thoughts nor intentions to diminish His Majesty's just power and Greatness.

IIII. We shall with all faithfulness endeavor the discovery of all such as have
bin, or shall be Incendiaries, Malignants or evil Instruments, by hindering the
Reformation of Religion, dividing the King from his People, or one of the
Kingdoms from another; or making any parties, for faction among the People,
contrary to this League and Covenant, that they may be brought to public
trial, and receive condign punishment as the degree of their offenses shall
require, or deserve, or the Supreme Judicatories of both Kingdoms
respectively, or others having power for that effect, shall judge convenient.

V. And whereas the happiness of a blessed peace between these Kingdoms, denied
in former times to our Progenitors, is by the good Providence of God granted
to us, and has been lately concluded and settled by both Parliaments, we shall
each one of us, according to our place and interest, endeavor that they may
remain conjoined in a firm peace and union to all posterity: and that justice
may be done upon the wilful opposers thereof, in manner expressed in the
former Article.

VI. We shall according to our places and callings in this common cause of
Religion, Liberty, and peace of the Kingdoms, assist and defend all those that
enter into this League and Covenant, in the maintaining and pursuance thereof,
and shall not suffer our selves directly or indirectly, by what ever
combination, persuasion, or terror, to be divided from this blessed union and
conjunction, whether to make defection to the contrary part, or to give our
selves to a detestable indifferency, or neutrality in this cause, which so much
concerns the glory of God, and the good of these Kingdoms, and honor of the
King; but shall all the days of our lives, zealously and constantly continue
therein against all opposition, and promote the same, according to our power,
against all lets and impediments whatsoever; and what we are not able of our
selves to suppress or overcome, we shall reveal and make known, that it may
be timely removed or prevented: All which we do as in the sight of God.

Thus you have the Covenant at large, that nothing may be hid, but it may
appear to the Readers view; now let us come to consider what may be the true
meaning of it, as might be in the minds of all that understand the nature of a
Covenant that took it; for every such person, I suppose, will observe the rule
set down by the Lord, which is, Thou shall swear in truth, righteousness,
and judgment; and according to that, let us look seriously at the meaning of
it; and so much the rather, because many that, I suppose, do really seek the
good of the Kingdom, are much stumbled about it, fearing it is broken by those
that have been the most eminent Actors for the Kingdoms good; and partly
because those who should be Incouragers of them that have so acted, whose word
goes far, cry out against for the breach of Covenant, and make it one of their
strong holds.

1. In the first branch, first there is a promise and engagement to maintain
the Scots in that Reformation in Religion, in Doctrine, Worship, and
Discipline, Government, which is exercised and practiced among them against all
common Enemies; so as if the common Enemy should disturb them at any time, the
Covenant binds to go and help them (if they stand in need) as well as if we
were of that Nation; but it does not at all bind us to their manner of
Worship, Discipline, and Government; neither could our Oath have been lawful
if we should so have sworn, because we did not know their Worship,
Discipline, and Government, and so we could not have sworn according to the
forenamed Rule: but if we should have been so weak or sinful to have offered
to have taken such an oath, you that profess to be our guides, would not have
suffered us so to do; and much less have encouraged and exhorted us so to do
as you did: but to make it sure, that your meaning might not be mistaken, you
add, that the Reformation you would endeavor in England and Ireland, should
be according to the word of God, and the example of the best Reformed Churches
which do clearly hold forth that your selves did doubt whether the Reformation
of Religion that is in Scotland, in Worship, Discipline, and Government, be
according to the word of God, or not, or whether it be according to the example
of the best Reformed Churches; and therefore you would weigh it, and examine
it; and in that you did well, and it was a good sure way for the people, for by
that means, they might have liberty to try it before they did receive it; and
in so doing, they might lawfully take such a Covenant: for they might have the
word of God to look into, and by that means they might try the Worship,
Discipline, and Government, whether it were agreeable thereunto or not, and
also might see thereby which were the best Reformed Churches, for that is an
unerring Rule. And you add, you will likewise endeavor to bring the three
Kingdoms into the nearest conjunction and uniformity in Religion: I suppose
your meaning is therein, that England and Ireland should be endeavored to be
as one, according to the Rule formerly spoken of (which was sure) and when you
had attained that Reformation in the manner before spoken of, you would carry
it on with so much beauty, in love, humility, and meekness; and also by
earnest prayer to God, together with brotherly exhortation, that you would win
the Scots to come in, and join with you in your way of Worship, Discipline,
and Government; and this is the substance of the first Article.

2. To the attaining to this end, you Covenant, that without respect of
persons, you will endeavor to extirpate all persons and things, that should
hinder you in that forenamed Reformation, and way of Worship, as Popery,
Prelacy, and their adherents, and also whatever else that is contrary to sound
Doctrine, and the power of godliness; and also that which will not conduce to
your forenamed end; and therefore you would do here, as David said, Away from
me ye workers of iniquity, for I will keep the Commandment of my God: And this
was necessary for you to do, to have all the old Rubbish removed, that you
might the better lay a new foundation: And this I take to be the substance of
the second branch of the Covenant, and the sum of the first and great part of
it, the glory of God, in the manner of his worship.

3. That you will in like sincerity, etc. endeavor with your lives and
estates, the preservation of the Privileges of the Parliament, and the
Liberties of the Kingdom, and the Kings Majesty's person and Authority: But
all these must be in the preservation of the true Religion, and the Liberties
of the Kingdom; but I suppose, you never intended their preservation no
further: so as you would preserve neither Privileges of Parliament, nor the
person, nor Authority of the King, any further, then it might appear they
would preserve Religion in that way of Reformation, as is in the first Article:
And also the Privileges of the Kingdom to the same end; and indeed therein
stands the Privileges of the Parliament, and the true Liberties of the
Kingdom; for that is a guide to both, and the preserver of both; for while we
preserve the honor of God, we provide for both the other; and there can be no
true privilege, nor liberty, nor safety assured without that; for God is the
preserver of all, and he has said, Those that honor me, I will honor, and
those that despise me shall be lightly esteemed; so as the just power and
greatness stood in the up^olding of that; and if he went against that, his
power and greatness was not to be obeyed: for we should obey God rather then
man; and they that were urged to go against a command of God by men, have
chosen rather to go into the fire, and into the Den of Lions, rather then to
obey Potent Kings, when they were not able otherwise to shift for themselves:
and the like may be said of any in Parliament that should join to do the
like. But your Covenant does directly bind you to stand for it in another way,
which was by force, if you could, and therefore you engage your lives and
estates for the obtaining of it, so as if you have not ground out of the word
of God so to do, your Covenant was a sinful Covenant, and then you had not
need to cry out of persons for transgressing of it, but had need to humble your
selves for the taking of it, and encouraging others so to do: for the
Covenant, as it is made, in a true sense, seems to me to be kept, and more
exactly by them that are cried out against, for the breaking of it, then by any
of you that so cry out, etc. by the Parliament now sitting, and the Army.

4. You will with all faithfulness endeavor to discover all those that are
Incendiaries, and evil Instruments, etc. that shall be found to be hinderers
of your Reformation of Religion, as beforesaid, by dividing the King from his
people, and the Kingdoms one from another; and that you will bring them to
trial that they may receive condign punishment, etc. So as here you bind
your selves to this, to all whosoever they be, if they do either of these,
they must be brought forth to trial, and therefore if the King, or any party
in Parliament, or any other whatsoever, shall hinder your Reformation, as
aforesaid, by making factions among the people, or factious, the Covenant
binds to bring them to trial, that they may receive condign punishment
according to the degree of their offenses.

5. You Covenant, that all that wilfully oppose that union made between the
Kingdoms, upon the terms formerly expressed, they must be dealt withal
according to the manner expressed in the for^er Article, and therefore I
appeal to your own consciences, if the King did not oppose it wilfully, in
his not yielding according to that manner as is formerly expressed; and if he
did, then how could the Covenant be kept, if he were not brought forth,
according to that manner? and then if the King should, then all those in
Parliament that did side with him, and endeavor to preserve him in that way,
and give him power so to do in part, or in whole, must needs be dealt withal
after the same manner, or else the Covenant could not be kept and preserved.

6. The Covenant binds not only to do all this, in your own persons, but to
assist and defend all those that have taken the Covenant in their endeavors to
maintain it as aforesaid, and this you will do all the days of your lives,
zealously, and constantly, against all opposition; with all your power; and if
you cannot do it your selves, you will reveal it, and that timely, to those
that may, that so you may not be prevented of that great end you aimed at, the
glory of God, the true privileges of Parliament, and the true liberties of the
Kingdom; and it must needs be thus, or else another party that regard none of
all these, must pretend the Covenant that did maintain the King, and all other
in their way, which I hope you would abhor.

And now let us see, whether the Parliament now sitting, and the Army, have
broken this Covenant in this sense or not, or whether they have not kept it;
and give me leave to join both together, for they are both engaged a like in
what have been done, because allowed and approved of by both.

1. And first, they have defended the Scots against their Enemies, and that
notwithstanding their deserts to the contrary, and did set them in such a
posture, as they might freely act their Reformed Religion in Doctrine, Worship,
Discipline, and Government, and have opposed them in the breach of Covenant,
which they did in many particulars, according as the Covenant did bind them:
Also the Lord has made them isntrumental so to act, as that they have brought
England into such a posture, as they may have liberty to act freely in such a
Reformation of Religion, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Government, as
is according to the word of God, and the example of the best Reformed Churches;
and are about to set Ireland in the same condition, and would be glad if
Scotland would do the like, and they have opposed all those that have acted
the contrary, so far as in them lies, according to this first branch of the
Covenant.

2. They have done as much as in them lies to extirpate Popery and Prelacie;
that is to say, Government by Archbishops, Bishops, etc. so that Hierarchy is
to be abolished: and for any thing is yet done, they may endeavor to do the
like to all that shall be found to be contrary to sound doctrine, and the power
of godliness, which is according to the second branch of the Covenant.

3. They have, with their estates, and lives, endeavored to preserve the
Rights and Privileges of Parliament, in their acting for the glory of God, and
the privileges of the Kingdom, and they have stood by, and for them that have
so acted; and for the Parliament to act freely for the glory of God is their
greatest privilege, and highest right; and for the Kingdom to be set in such
a condition as they may freely worship God, and walk in their several places
and callings, in the discharge of their duties according to the Word of God, is
the greatest liberty that can befall a Kingdom or Kingdoms, and such a
condition have they been isntrumental to set this Kingdom in at present; and
that the Kingdom might be eased of those burdens has been their desire and
endeavors by their Remonstrance and Petitions for many burdens to be removed,
and they have endeavored it by their actings also, and still they continue to
be sollicitous that way; and for the Kings Person, they did defend it after
they had gotten it into their possession, and would have defended it still, and
his authority also, if they could have done it in the preservation of the true
Religion, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Government, and the Liberties
of the Kingdom; and also they would not have diminished his just power and
greatness, which was to be showed forth in acting for the glory of God in the
good of his Kingdoms; but they kept his Person from putting forth his
authority, power, and greatness in unjust ways, and to the overthrow of the
true Religion, and Liberties of the Kingdoms in the Reformation of them
according to the Word of God, and the example of the best reformed Churches;
all which the Covenant does bind them unto.

4. They have endeavored to discover Incendiaries, Malignants, evil
Instruments, that have hindered the reformation of Religion, and sought to make
divisions; and also those that have made Factions, and Parties among the
people, and have brought them to trial, that they might receive condign
punishment according to the degree of their offenses; witness their dealing
with Duke Hambleton, Lord Goring, Lord of Holland, Lord Cap^ll, and the chief
of those that rose in Wales; nay, they have not spared the King himself, so
faithful have they been in performance of their Covenant, nor have they sp^red
any in Parliament that have acted that way.

5. They have endeavored that Justice might be done upon the wilful opposers
of the peace and union made between the Kingdoms; witness their dealing with
the Scots, and those that adhered in that design.

6. They have assisted those that have stood in the performance and pursuance
of this Covenant, against all that have opposed them, witness their dealing
with the Scots when they opposed, and with the King, and with some in
Parliament, and with those parties before named, when they opposed; and as this
may be said for the Army, so the like may be said for the Parliament that now
sit, who have stood to own them, and have approved of what has been done in
these kinds, by adding their authority to it: And the like may be said of the
godly part of people of the Kingdom, who in their plac^ have shown themselves
destrous those things might be done, whereby the Covenant might be performed,
as has appeared by their many Petitions; so that those that are cried out
against to be Covenant breakers, are those that have been the most faithful in
keeping their Covenant of any men in the Kingdom, for the Parliament and Army
have not effected these things, but in hazard of their estates and lives; and
yet they have gone through with it in such a sort, that the Generations to come
may call them blessed, and the present Generation (especially the godly party
of the Kingdom) may say of the present Parliament and Army, as they spoke of
Joseph, Thou have saved our lives. And now let us examine their accusers,
(which do so cry out of the breach of Covenant, and ^^^k ar^ many people by
their so doing) and see whether themselves have not broken the Covenant.

1. They have been zealous for the preservation of that reformation of Religion
here, that is in Scotland, which the Covenant does not at all bind unto here
in England, and Ireland, for there is a manifest difference put between us and
them, as I conceive; for that here, and in Ireland must be according to the
Word of God, and the example of the best reformed Churches* and no mention is
made of the example of Scotland, which shows they were doubtful of that, but
they would be sure of the best Reformation, and therefore they put in according
to the Word of God, and the example of the best reformed Churches; but you have
not endeavored such a Reformation in England, in Doctrine, Worship,
Discipline, and Government, as that before named (which the Covenant does bind
unto) witness your taking up with that which is in Scotland, you have that
manner of Worship, Discipline, and Government, confuted by that reverend Mr.
Hooker, and we cannot but take it, that you are convinced, it is confuted; for
if you were not, you would confute his Arguments, and show the falsnesse of
them, and until you have so done, we shall take what he has said are such
truth^ as you are not able to answer according to the Word of God; and
therefore such as you are bound by your Covenant to reform unto, that being
also the example of the best reformed Churches, so far as y^^ does appear;
which while you do not confute or reform to it, let the Reader consider, if
you break the Covenant, and live in the breach of it; you having liberty so to
do, and so you have not endeavored to bring the three Kingdoms to the
nearest uniformity in that way; nay have you not, and do you not oppose that
Government, although you have not answered those Arguments; neither have you so
confirmed that way you walk in by arguments and grounds out of the Word of
God, so as might establish the people, and leave them without doubt, that you
walk in that way which Christ has set up to be worshipped in, now in the
times of the Gospel; but the people must take it upon trust, and so can never
be soundly established in it.

2. Although you have extirpated Popery, and Prelacy, in the bulk of it in
Church Government, yet if you observe diligently some passages, and Arguments
in reverend Mr. Hooker, you may see you have not wholly done it, but the stumps
of that Dagon do still remain, and is stood for and upholden by you; neither
have you opposed Errors, Superstition, Schism, and Profaneness as you ought to
do; for although you speak against them in the general, you do it in such a
manner, that cannot in the largest breadth of charity be taken to come from
love, there is so much bitterness in the man^r of your expressions: and in your
so speaking in the general, you cause those that are godly (in your own
Judgments, and free from error as your selves be) only they disscent from you
in their judgment and practice, and yet you render them as odious to all your
errors, as those that hold and practice the greatest, and are the grossest
blasphemers, and so you condemn the generation of the Just: and you know what
is said, he that justifies the Wicked, and condemns the Righteous, are both
alike in Gods esteem. And what a sad thing it is, that you that call your
selves, and would have the people think you are, the Servants and Ambassadors
of Christ, should be found in the number of those that speak against and
condemn his Servants and Children. I beseech you consider, how you will answer
it before him at his coming: for by your preaching, the people are not able to
know who you mean, except you mean all those that are not just of your
Judgment and Practice: and therefore, if this be not your mind, distinguish
who they be, that you may not lead people in a mist, or else how can they be
convinced, for truth is plain and open, and therefore you need not be
ashamed, nor afraid to speak it, and therefore, while you forbear so to do, we
cannot but look at you as Covenant-Breakers, except it be so you cannot do it,
for you have Covenanted to do what you can: and for opposing whatsoever is
against the power of godliness, I wish you do not countenance and encourage
such, as if you be asked, or at least if you will seriously ask your own
consciences you will say, they have it not appearing in them and yet you admit
them into your choice society, and make them partakers of the choicest
Ordinances, and encourage them therein, and how this can stand with your
Covenant, I leave the Reader to judge.

3 You have not preserved the Rights and Privileges of the Parliament, nor the
Liberties of the Kingdom as you should have done formerly, as does appear to
the world in Print, and of late it has appeared more clearlie, for whereas it
is their Right, and their greatest Privilege to act freely for the glory of
God, you have not encouraged them ^n the so acting, nor yet have you encouraged
them that have been a means to set them in such a condition, wherein they
might so act, and the like may be said for the liberties of the Kingdom: for
the Parliament have been acting for the liberties of the Kingdom, and you have
not encouraged them therein, and the Army have been isntrumental to set them
in such a condition, as they might so act, and you have not encouraged them
therein) for is it not the greatest liberty to the Kingdom, when they can
enjoy, to have the Ordinances of God in a powerful manner according to his
Word, freely and without control, and likewise to have Justice executed
impartially, and it does not appear that you have been any means to further
it notwithstanding you know what the Word of God holds forth, that Justice
exalts a Nation: nay, which might make a gracious conscientious heart to
tremble, to think that you who have encouraged to the taking of the Covenant,
and gone before others in so doing, by taking it your selves; that you should
so fail, as not to encourage them that have done it. Nay, which is far
worse, have cast dirt and filth in the faces of the Parliament; and trampled
their honor under your feet, and caused all others so to do, so far as have
lain in your power, and that for their faithful discharge of the Covenant.
And you have done the like by the Army, which have so often ventured their
lives and estates, as they have done, and you also have Covenanted to do the
like, so far as in you lies, Nay have you not been Incendiaries to stir up
people to a dislike and contempt of Parliament, and Army, in what they have
done? Nay I desire, that it may not truly be said (of some of you, at the
least) that you have in a sort cursed them: but which is most hideous to
consider, have you not prayed to that God (against them in their proceedings)
to whom you have lifted up your hand, that you would defend and preserve their
honor? whom you know, or should know is just, and have plagues in store upon
such as cry out against others, and do the same things they cry out against,
especially, when as those they so cry against are innocent of it? and ^or the
preservation of the person and authority, I doubt not but you have heard of
one that says, you have set them a King-catching first, For was not his person
in danger of the Bullet, and the Sword in their opposing and pursuance of him,
whom you had encouraged and stirred up so to do. And likewise for his
Authority, did not you encourage and stir up persons to go against it, for was
not that his Authority that they went against, for if he might have enjoyed
his Authority to d^e as he would, then he would not have gone from the
Parliament, neither would he have gone from place to place, but would have
commanded them that came against him to lay down Arms, and that was not your
intent they should, if he had required them, he continuing still in the same
mind he was in when he went away, and could you in that cause persuade and stir
up persons to go against it, and yet cause the same persons to swear to
preserve it, without any destinction or limitation. Nay if he could have come
again to have enjoyed the exercise of his Authority, it is very probable he
would have caused your selves to have felt that you had been the opposers and
not the preservers of his Authority, by your exhorting, and persuading people
to go against him, and in causing them to swear to such a Covenant, and he
would not have suffered you to play fast and loose with it: but you have
limited it, that they should do it in the defense of the true Religion, and
the Liberties of the Kingdom, so as if he would not do that, then down with his
Authority, and person, and all. And yet when that it is made known, that he
continues still in that mind not to yield to either, but rather to the utter
destruction of both (and that after long and patient waiting and bearing with
him, and also by many solicitations of him; to see if at last they might have
prevailed) yet I say after all this, when he came to be dealt withal according
as the Covenant does bind unto, you are so far from encouraging those that
have done it, as you cry out against them in your preaching and prayers. I
beseech you and the impartial Reader to judge, whether this be not breach of
Covenant in a very high degree.

4. I Beseech you consider, if you have not been far from discovering
Incendiaries, etc. when as you are (and I wish I might not say too truly)
cried out upon for being Incendiaries, and evil Instruments, and such as make
faction and parties among the people. I beseech you consider whereto many of
your passages you have in prayer and preaching tend, but to such a thing as to
raise up in the people a dislike and discontent of the acting of the Parliament
and Army, and so weaken the hearts and hands of the godly party (by
occasioning them to sin) and strengthening the hearts and hands of the
ungodlie, and causing them to go on in a higher degree of sinning, and to stir
afresh in their plottings and contrivings, and actings against God, his truth
and people; and is not this breach of Covenant? And for bringing of these to
trial that they may receive condign punishment; how far have you been from
that, when you have opposed openly, so far as in you lies, by preaching,
praying, and writing; especially this your writing, so as the whole world may
take notice of your opposition: And if thi^ be not a breach of Covenant, let
the Reader and your own consciences be judge.

5. And let it be considered, if you have endeavored in your places that
justice might be done upon such as did wilfully oppose the peace and
conjunction of the Kingdom: ask conscience what you think the King aimed at
in going to the Scots, and refusing to go to the Parliament, although often
desired and entreated, and in all his other actings of late; were not, and are
not the Scots constant to hold their Church Government, and did not he always
oppose it, and seek to maintain Bishops, if not worse in England? and would
not he then have broken that peace? and if he, then all that party that took
part with him, must be guilty also; and your Covenant is, that all such in your
places and interest, will endeavor they shall be done to in justice, as in
the former Article; and yet when this is done, you are so far from furthering
it in your places, as that you cry out against those that have done it: And if
this be not breach of Covenant, let any impartial Reader judge.

6. You have Covenanted to assist and defend, according to your places, all
those that enter into this League and Covenant, in the maintenance and
pursuance thereof; and this you will do zealously, and constantly all the
days of your lives: and have you thus done? have you encouraged them that have
acted thus? have you preached for them to tell people it was their duty to
honor them, they having done so much for the good of the land; and that all,
especially the godly party, have cause to bless God for them? and have you
prayed for them that the Lord would prosper them, and carry them through
courageously? If you have not, consider if you have not broken Covenant by not
doing what you could for them in your places: but if on the contrary part you
have spoken evil of them, preached, and prayed against them, and so cast
discouragement, and dishonor upon them, for their so acting, then let all that
read or hear, judge if this be not notorious breach of Covenant: And the
premises considered, let the Reader judge, nay let your conscience judge, if
you have not broken every branch of the Covenant: and if you have, then what a
condition are those in, that shall be a means to pull down heavy wrath upon
themselves from heaven by thus preaching and praying against themselves, and
condemn themselves for abominable sinners, and yet continue in that course
without repentance? for you must needs be the men that are the greatest
Covenant-breakers; which may amaze a gracious heart to think of, that you that
are such knowing men, and would be accounted so, especially in matters
concerning conscience, and have been the promoters, if not the contrivers of
the Covenant, and you to be found the greatest transgressors, it must needs be
lamentable, and much weaken the authority of your Ministry.

And now to come from the Covenant, to the Book it self:

Wherein they are charged with doing that which was unseemly, in that they
called the Ministers to a consultation in matters of Religion, when they should
have desired a conference, and therefore they did not do that which was
suitable to them, they being but private persons.

To which may be answered, they had been acting according to the Covenant,
which they had encouraged them to take, and now they were to act in a higher
degree in it; and therefore it was beseeming them to call them to desire a
consultation with them who had formerly encouraged them so to do: But whereas
they pretend they were but private persons, it appears they were public
persons, and set in high public place; and that by the highest Authority in
the Land: and therefore it would have been no disgrace, or unbeseeming thing
for Ministers of the Gospel to have gone to consult with them, nor would it
have necessitated them to have been partakers with them in sin, if they
could have seen any; for they might have witnessed against it, and they might
have counseled the contrary, and so might have prevented sin, if the way
they went in had been sinful; which does not yet appear, but the contrary;
but they were doing their duty, and that according to their Covenant.

Again, they say they had gone against a direct Rule of the word of God: It
may be answered, they did that which the word of God does require, by your own
confession, for they were performing of the Covenant, and Oath of God which was
upon them; as may appear in that which has been formerly said in the matter
of the Covenant, in maintaining the Parliament in a free condition to act for
the glory of God, and the liberty of the Kingdom, in apprehending Delinquents,
and bringing them to trial, that they might receive condign punishment
according to their deserts; and so to remove them that would hinder them in
their so acting, all which they are bound unto by their Covenant: And whereas
it is said, they did that which was out of their sphere, and so made themselves
guilty of sin: but they did that which was in their sphere, for they did that
for which they were raised and sent out at the first, which was to preserve the
Parliament in such a way as they might act freely for the glory of God, and
therein for the liberty of the Kingdom, in the removing of those persons and
things that might hinder them in their so acting, as have formerly been said;
and therefore they were not guilty of sin in their so acting.

And whereas they seem to charge them with former miscarriages; if you mean
their not disbanding when they were bidden: It may be answered, it had been ill
for the Kingdom (as well as for themselves) if they had so done: and it may be
considered, if it had not been unreasonable, they should have so done, they
not having their wages which was their just due; nor an act of indemnity for
what they had done (in the extremity of the Wars) against some Laws of the
Kingdom, for which their lives might have been taken away: and beside, were
they not exceedingly provoked, when for desiring these things which were but
just and equal, they should be accounted enemies to the Kingdom, if they did
persist in so doing.

Again, it is said in their late acting, they have resisted lawful Authority,
especially in their Remonstrance: To which may be answered, that the
Remonstrance was in way of proposalls in some things, and the rest was, that
which they might conceive was their duty, grounded upon the word of God, and
also upon the Covenant, in performance of that; for they might perceive evil
instruments had been working, and had brought their design near to a period,
against the glory of God, privileges of Parliament, and liberties of the
Kingdoms; nay to the ruin of them all, as much as men were able to do, which
they were bound to discover, and hinder as much as in them lay, and that by
their Covenant, which they faithfully did.

And whereas it is said, they opposed the Parliament: It may be answered, they
did not oppose the Parliament that acted for the end for which they were chosen
and sent, which was for the glory of God, and the Privileges and liberty of
the Kingdom; for they did that which they have approved of since, witness
their Declaration of the 18 of January; for they have set them at liberty, so
to act, by removing those that did hinder them in their so acting, which was
their duty so to do, and that for which they were raised, and sent out at the
first, and to which the Covenant does bind.

And whereas it is further said, they seized and imprisoned the King, without
the consent or knowledge of the Parliament: To which it may be answered, for
his imprisonment, it was before they seized him, and for their seizing of him,
it was the Kingdoms safety, and their own also, that so no greater misery
might come upon the Kingdom, nor upon themselves: for they might perceive
there was an evil affected party in the Parliament, that might prevail, and
so join with him; and so things might be brought into a worse condition then
they were before the Wars began; and themselves, the godly party in the
Parliament and Kingdom, might have hazarded to have been destroyed: which
being perceived by them, they were bound to prevent it, and that by their
Covenant: And for its being done without consent of Parliament; if we take the
Parliament for those which according to their trust committed to them, did act
for the glory of God, and the liberties of the Kingdom, and if they did not
consent before to it, yet it shows they were willing it should be done, because
they have never declared openly against it, but have approved of it, as it does
appear by their Declaration of the 18 of January.

And whereas it is said, they offered violence to the Members of Parliament,
hindering them from sitting in Parliament, and imprisoning some of them, though
known to the Ministers to be of eminent worth and integrity: It may be
answered, the violence was only keeping some of them back from sitting in the
House; the reason was, they saw them to be such as had voted against the honor
of God, the privileges of Parliament, and the liberties of the Kingdom; and
that has appeared, in that they voted to that, which since has been unvoted
again, being such as was dangerous to the privileges of Parliament, and the
liberties of the Kingdom, and declared so to be by the Parliaments Declaration
of the 18 of January; and so they did not keep them back as Members of
Parliament, but as acting very dangerously against the Parliament and Kingdom:
And howsoever some of them might formerly be known to the Ministers to be of
eminent worth and integrity, yet this act of theirs did appear otherwise to
them, that with an impartial eye look upon it; but for some of them they had
been accused, and were feign to forsake the Parliament, and yet they were
brought in again by a strong disaffected party that were in Parliament,
against the mind of those that acted for the glory of God, and the true
liberties of the Kingdom, which afterward was declared to be of dangerous
consequence, as tending to the destruction of Justice, and the peace of the
Kingdom, witness the Parliaments Declaration of the 18 of January: and
likewise many other Votes after they came in, as there it, does appear, and
therefore there was a cause some of them should be imprisoned, and be brought
to their trial; and so it was that the Covenant binds unto.

Another thing they lay to their charge, is, the framing a new moddel of Laws
and Government, which is against the lawful Authority that God has set over
us and contrary to the obedience we do ow unto them, and those manifold oaths
and Covenants, we have bound our selves to render to them; and against the Law
of God also: For answer to this, is it against our Oaths taken, or against the
lawful Government, or against the authority of Magistrates, for men to
propound their apprehensions to them when they are set in place to make Laws,
so as they leave them to themselves to consider of, let the impartial Reader
judge; and this is all that is yet done, for there is none of these things
forced yet: and therefore for any to charge them with it yet, is to judge
before the time, and so against that rule which bids us judge nothing before
the time, and against the rule of charity that thinks not evil.

It is further said, they have no color of legal Authority, but merely upon
presumption of strength to attempt these changes: To which it may be answered
(as to what they have acted by way of Authority) they have a real authority so
to act, for they have it from the highest Authority in the Land, and it is
manifestly known; and for their strength it was raised, as is manifested
before, which was for the defense of the Parliament, that they might act freely
for the glory of God, and the true liberties of the Kingdom: an^ therefore
they need not act from presumption, but from faith, grounded upon a promise,
that being their way, and in his also, they might look for protection and
preservation, for he has promised to keep us in all our ways; and he has
done so to this day, and will so do, if they seek his glory as their end, and
walk in his way as the means.

It is further said, they have gone contrary to their trust, which was to
preserve the Parliament, Religion, and liberties of the Kingdom, and the
Laws: To which it may be answered, that which has been said before, might be
sufficient: but we may say they have done according to their trust; and if they
had not done what they did, they had gone contrary to their trust indeed, for
that was the great trust for which they were raised, to preserve the
Parliament, in acting freely for God, and so for Religion, and the liberties of
the Kingdom, which else might have been destroyed; and as has appeared by
what has been said many times before, this they have done in their late
actings, and therefore they have showed themselves faithful and trusty in what
they have done, in performing their engagements.

Again, it is said, their violence they offered to the Parliament, did exceed
that of the Kings by far: For answer to this, consider the violence pretended
by them, offered here, was because they kept out some persons that were a
hindrance to the Parliament in their acting freely, for the glory of God in the
liberties of the Kingdom, and such as had acted against the glory of God, and
the true liberties of the Kingdom; witness the Parliaments Declaration of the
18 of January, by acting in those votes there mentioned, contrary to what had
been voted before, and were such as when the Parliament was set free to act,
they were fain, (for the Kingdoms good and safety) to unvote again: but that
of the King, was in demanding those that did appear to be most active for the
glory of God, and the good of the Kingdom. And again, that which the Army
did, they were bound to do by Covenant (as will appear, if what has been
said be considered) but what the King did, was manifestly against it; and also
that which they did, was their duty to do, as the cause then stood, and that
which the King did, was that which he ought not to have done; so as the
violence the King did offer, did as far exceed theirs, as a man that goes
directly contrary to that which the word of God calls for; and a man that goes
directly to do, what the word of God does enjoin; and therefore the Army did
what in conscience they were bound to do; and what the King did, was that which
in conscience h^ should not have done.

It is further said, they have usurped Authority over King and Parliament: To
which it may be answered, for that of the King, they were set in authority to
do it, and the Covenant did bind them to do what they did, and so no
usurpation; and the like may be said of what they did to those of the
Parliament, so as they have neither gone beyond the authority that was given
them, nor contrary to the end for which it was given them; if that which has
been formerly said, be well weighed, and therefore far from usurpation.

It is said, they intermeddle with things that belong not unto them; for
answer, it may be said they did what belonged to them to do (that which they
did being necessary to be done) for no other could have done it, because they
were not able; and it being in their power to do it, they were bound to do it
by the Covenant, what they did to the King, and those Members of Parliament,
and what they did in their proposals was lawful for them to do in the way
they did it, that so they might communicate their thoughts to the Parliament
thereby; and I never heard that the Parliament did find fault with them for so
doing, nor so upbraid them as you have done, and yet I think it belonged more
properly to the Parliament to do it, then to you.

It is further laid to their charge, that they effect that by power which the
Laws of God, Nature, and Nations do not allow; for answer, you allow the
Parliament might take up Arms against the King and his Party, for their own
defense, which do warrant them in what they have done, because what they did
was in subordination to the Parliament, as owning them to be above them; for it
is plain, what justice was executed upon the King, or has been upon any other
(except that which does properly belong to them as Soldiers) has been done by
the authority of Parliament; they did but bring them to Trial, which the
Covenant did bind them to do; and they have not hindered the Parliament, much
less usurped authority over them; but they have done that which your selves
acknowledge they were raised to do, which was to preserve the Parliament from
the King, and such as were evil disposed, and so evil instruments: nor have
the Parliament declared against them any such thing, nor showed any dislike in
what they have done, but rather justify what they have done by their
Declaration, and this the Covenant calls for, and therefore they are not so to
be charged.

And whereas it is said, they offered violence to the Person of the King,
contrary to the intention of the Parliament in taking up Arms, and that they
divested him of his regal Authority; to which it may be answered, when the
Parliament first took up Arms, the breadth of their charity, and tenderness
of his honor was such, as made them to think possibly he might be led chiefly
on, only by his evil Counselors; and yet they were more tender over the
honor of God, and the privileges and Liberties of the whole Kingdom; and
therefore they raised an Army to go against him if he would oppose that, but if
he would forsake those ways he went in, and come and join with them for the
honor of God, and the good of the Kingdom, they intended no violence to his
Person; but if he would not, nor they could not obtain it no other way, then
they res^lved to offer violence to his Person; for their raising an Army, and
sending them out, and keeping them in the Field, against whom was it but
against his Person and Authority? for who could have been able to have carried
on such opposition but he? And besides, he was among them in person, and
therefore as subject to the Bullet and Sword as another man; but afterward when
many apparent grounds were, that it was not from his evil Counselors alone,
but from himself; as appeared when his Cabinet was taken, and after, when his
evil Counsel was gone, he went to the Scots, and would not come to his
Parliament, neither has he yielded since, as has been said before, so as they
who will not be wilfully blind, may see, the Cause was otherwise, and that
which was done, was necessary, and according to the Covenant, to divest him of
his regal authority, for the chief ground did still remain as at the first;
for the glory of God, and the Privileges, and true Liberties of the Kingdom
must be maintained which could not have been don otherways, witness the
Parliaments Declaration of the 18th. of January, and they knew better how the
State-affaires stood, then you and we do, besides consider, what is said in
Mr: Cooks book, and it will appear plainly.

And again it is said, they being private persons, seek to overthrow and
subvert the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom. For answer to the first, their
being private Persons, consider what has been said formerly, and for
overthrowing the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, that is not so: for the
contrary is declared by the Parliament, for they have said they will maintain
them, what the Army did, was in proposalls as has been said formerly, and so
they are not subverted and overthrown.

Again, it is said, their doings are licencious, tending to the subversion of
Religion, Laws, and Liberties of the Kingdom. Answer. The doings of those
(especially, that your Letter is directed unto) have not been irregular, if
what has been formerly said be weighed; much less licencious, so far as they
have yet acted, nor have they been to the subversion of Religion, etc. but they
have acted to the preservation of all, while they have set the Parliament in
such a condition, as they may act for the preservation of them all.

It is said, they have gone against their Oath and Covenant, in what they have
done. For Answer, That may suffice that is said formerly, they have been so far
from going against them, that the Parliament and Army have kept them better
then any in the Kingdom, for they have performed what the Covenant desires in
a high degree.

It is again said, they are fallen into such a condition, as they should not
be bidden God speed, nor be wished well in the name of the Lord. Answer, What
some dare or will do I know not, but they have acted and kept the Covenant so
faithfully of late, as the Parl. and Kingd. especially the godly party in the
Kingdom, have cause to bless them in the name of the Lord, and to pray for
them, for we may not only say Instrumentally, they have saved our lives, but
our families, and estates that we have, but they have been Isntrumental also
to save our liberties, and which is most of all, our Religion in a more free
and full enjoyment of it, more then ever before, and this by their late
actings; for without this, all the former blood and treasure had been lost, and
the Cause, and all the Kingdom, left in a worse condition then before.

It is said, they fear they are opening a door to damnable Errors, Heresies,
and licentious wicked practices. For Answer, I do not see Cause so to think,
much less to speak, but least of all to write so, for love thinks no evil,
nor dares not, except it have manifest witness, and we are commanded to judge
nothing before the time, which Rules I conceive are broken in a very high
degree, being divulged to the world, especially against persons as are in such
places, and of such deserts.

Again it is said, Religion is made to stink by reason of their miscarriages,
and the faces of Gods servants covered with shame, and their hearts filled with
sorrow and grief for it. It may be answered, Religion may be made beautiful,
and it, and the people of God made a sweet savor unto God by their means, for
they have been a means to set them at liberty, that have power in their hands
to give liberty to the people of God so to do: and therefore so far from
having their faces covered with shame, as they may look their enemies in the
face with boldness, and so far from having their hearts filled with sorrow, as
there is cause they should be filled with joy and gladness, to think, that
now those in Parliament may act freely for God, in setting his people at
liberty to serve him according to the Rules of his Word, and the example of the
best Reformed Churches, and that they may act freely also in the execution of
justice between man and man, without fear, and without partiality and also for
any other thing, for freedom, and liberty, of Parliament and Kingdom.

Again it is said, the golden cord of Government and Authority of Magistrates
is broken, and laid in the dust by them; for answer, it is so far from being
broken and laid in the dust by them, that it is exalted, and made strong by
them, for they have been a means to set them in such a posture, they need not
to fear; but be bold and courageous in acting for God, and his glory, and be
bold in the true execution of Justice, and you know Justice exalts a Nation,
so as there is a way made by them instrumentally to the exaltation of the whole
Nation.

Again, it is said they have made the Parliament contemptible, and torn them
in sunder in one day; to which it may be answered, they have set the Parliament
in such a condition, that if the Lord be pleased to give them hearts to lay
hold of it, they may be more exalted and honored then over Parliament was, for
they are in such freedom to act, as never Parliament was before, for they have
no negative voice to trouble or hinder them, in going on in any good motion
that God shall put into their mind, or any other can help them to understand
by informing of them: and for their being torn in sunder, I hope that is far
off, for I hope they are joined more sure together then ever, and there
appears nothing contrary in their acting, but they are more then ever, and
there is need they should, having so many enemies to join against them, and
they so few that stand to act close for God, in seeking his glory, only for
being in such a condition as they are, they have opportunity sweetly to accord
and agree together, and keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace, they
having obstructions removed as they have been, and are.

Again it is said, they have gone against the Law of God, in what they have don
in going against Magistrates, and are such as God has condemned under pain of
damnation, and so are like Caine, and Corah and his company; and so are
gathered together against the Lord, and so to be taken as wicked men, and
rebels, and as if Jehu like, they murdered Kings under specious pretenses. For
answer, They have done the Law of God, which says, whosoever sheddeth man's
blood, by man shall his blood be shed. And thou shall take n^ recompense for
the life of a murderer, for blood defiles the Land; and the Land cannot be
purged of the blood that is shed; but by the blood of him that shed it: so as
what they have done in bringing such to trial, has been their duty to God,
the Covenant, and Kingdom, and therefore, are not such as God will condemn,
but approve of; and instead of going against Magistrates, they have, and do
act, for the upholding of them in their acting for God, and therefore they may
comfortably expect a blessing from God, they being for God and their Covenant:
and so are far unlike Caine, and Corah, etc. and therefore do not deserve the
name of wicked men in their sense, for they rebelled against the servants of
the Lord, to set up themselves, and so have not these done yet. Nor are they to
be accounted as Rebels, for they have been apprehending of Rebels, and have
been so far from going against them that have acted for the glory of God, that
they have acted for their peace, and for the safety, preferment, and liberty,
not only of such of them as are in Parliament, but for those that are al over
the Nation, and therefore may be called more truly Saviors, then Rebels. And
for Jesuitish practices, for private persons to murder Kings, It is very evil
to apply this to them, for as has been said formerly, they were not private
men, but public, being set in public place by the highest Authority, and
what they did was far from murder, for they did but bring him forth to Trial,
which the Covenant did bind them unto, and he had his Trial according to the
power of the highest Court in the Kingdom, and therefore they are not to be
called murderers of Kings, nor in any degree to be held forth to be such as
have done any such thing under specious pretenses.

And whereas it is said, they do that which they would condemn in others, in
possessing the Kings person, and carrying him from place to place, without and
against the Parliaments consent, and the like was in the removing the
Parliaments guards, and continuing new modells destructive to this and all
other Parliaments, with other acts of like nature. Answer, They have done that,
which I hope they would commend in others, and charity binds me so to think,
for because that they did was good; for, for ceazing the Kings person, was
necessary for their own, the Parliament, and Kingdoms safety, that so he
might not be at his own, nor the Parliaments dispose (at present) while there
were so prevalent a party for him, which might have endangered all that which
they had been so long striving for, and that had cost so much blood and
treasure, and that it was so, appears in the Parliaments Declaration, for
they say there was a strong party to hinder the good of the Kingdom. And for
the removing of the King from place to place, that was to the same end.

But whereas it is said to be against the Parliaments consent. Answer, it has
not appeared so, for they did never send to the Army to have him out of their
hands; and besides, they had him not so, but the Parliament might have free
access to him at their pleasure, and had, until they voted they would have no
more; and yet afterward when their minds changed, they had acccesse to him
again, and such as might have hazzarded the good of the Kingdom, and Cause,
and all; and besides, they offered no wrong to him all the while they had him
in their custody, and for removing the Parliaments guards, what harm was in
that, or cause of complaint? for the City was eased thereby of a burden, and
charge, for it was all one price, for the Soldiers must have been paid, if
they had not done it, and for the Parliament they never complained of it: and
for contriving new modells it has been often answered, it was but propounded,
but that, that which was propounded was destructive to this, and all other
Parliaments I never yet understood, but it was for the better carrying on of
this and all other Parliaments, and keeping them from corrupting, and easing
them of the burden of sitting so long, before they have any respit, and
setting the people of the Kingdom at liberty often in their choice, that so if
they be mistaken one time, they may endeavor to avoid it in the next, and so
one Parliament may amend if others have done amiss; and for other causes of
the like nature, and you may see they were mistaken in their thoughts of this
Parliament, being set a time, but they sit still, and those that propounded for
their breaking up, are content, and I hope thankful to God and them, that they
are content to sit and take pains for to settle the work they have begun, and
made so great a progress in; and I hope I may say the like for many of the
godly party in the Kingdom.

And it is further said, it was once thought of them a matter of offense, of a
high nature, to endeavor the destruction of fundamental Laws, and to
dissuade the calling of Parliaments, and the breaking up of Parliaments, and to
countenance Arminians, and connive at Papists; and now, as if it were
commendable in them to contrive the subversion of the whole Laws and Government
of the Kingdom, and to endeavor a total universal Toleration, as they fear:
Answer, it was indeed a matter of offense of a high nature, for one man for the
satisfaction of his own will, to overthrow the fundamental Laws of the
Kingdom; but that is not their case, for they would not have any alteration to
be made at the will of any one man; and for the fundamental Laws to be
altered, that is not like to be, but is declared to the contrary, and that was
an offense of a high nature, to dissuade from the calling of Parliaments; and
therefore they seeing and feeling it to be so great, they have desired it may
be prevented for time to come, a Parliament being the next way of refuge and
safety to the Nation under God; and the breaking of it up at the pleasure of
one man, was a great burden, and high offense; and therefore they propose,
that they might have their time set how long they should sit, that so they
might not be broken up before, except they themselves see fit so to do, for the
good of the Kingdom.

And for what you speak of Arminians and Papists, it was cause of grief to
every gracious heart, the one being gross Idolaters, and the other but little
better; but in some sense may be more dangerous and hurtful: but your
inference will not hold; as if it was commendable to contrive the subversion of
the whole Laws and government of the Kingdom, and to endeavor a total and
universal Toleration; for it does not appear that any, especially those whom
you do write unto, do account it a commendable thing to contrive the
subversion of the whole Laws and government of the Kingdom, for they have not
propounded that; and therefore how can any (without breach of charity) say they
commend it: nor have they propounded for an universal Toleration, and
therefore we dare not conclude they do approve of either, and therefore they
will never account it commendable, but that they will oppose it, and any that
shall labor so to do; and as they have been, so they will continue to be for
the glory of God, and the good of the Kingdom, and for the good of the people
of God, who we hope are dear unto them: And as for your fears you hold forth
against persons of such eminent note, with no better grounds; we cannot but
witness against it as a sin so to do, being a breach of the 5. 6. and 9.
Commandments.

It is said, they are confident upon their former successes, which is no good
ground, especially they being before in the ways of God; but now they are not:
Answer, if ever they might be confident of successes, because they were in the
ways of God, they might be now; for the way they are now in, is as much
approved, as any way they ever walked in, since they took up Arms, for this
did tend much to the consummation of all they had labored for, and the trial
greater; and therefore for them to hold out, is a great sign that God is with
them, and will be with them, and give them good successes.

It is further said, there was no necessity of their so acting, but of their
own making, but they make a necessity to sin: Answer, that there was a
necessity is true, but that made, it does not appear; for the necessity lay in
the power and greatness of the parties they had to deal withal, which made
the work difficult, and so a necessity for them to act as they did: and
although necessity does not warrant to sin, yet necessity may make that
lawful, which without necessity is unlawful; as for David, and those that
were with him, to eat the shewbread, was a sin, had not necessity caused them
to do it; but when they were in necessity they might eat it, and not sin in so
doing; and it might be shown in many other things: and so it was your own
case in taking up Arms against the King, which had been sinful, if necessity
had not been, and that does continue still: but they needed not to have
pleaded necessity, for they had the word of God, and the Covenant, which they
had taken to bear them out, as has been formerly showed.

Again, it is said, their necessity was doubtful, and not clear and
certain, because it was seen by none but themselves: Answer, if persons will
not see, none can make them; but to them that will see, it was plain enough;
for any rational man might see that there was nothing held forth by the King
that could be a ground to think other, but that all should be as bad as ever,
if not worse, if ever he came upon the Throne again; nor any thing in those
Parliament men that were kept back, that might be ground they would not act
for the hurt of the Kingdom, they having so acted the last time they were
there, by their voting, notwithstanding the Army was in London, and the King
was taken off from treating, and removed to another place; and therefore it
could yield no hope, but that they that would so act in such a time as that
was, might go further to the undoing of all, and therefore no further to be
trusted in that kind for the present.

It is further said, the Parliament did act freely for the Covenant, until
they were forced by the Army: Answer, it is manifest they have acted for God,
since those members were kept back, witness their repealed Votes, and in
their execution of Justice; but that they did so before, does not appear, but
the contrary; witness those Votes they made, that are since Repealed, and the
danger of them held forth by the Declaration of Parliament: And also it was
clearly against the Covenant they acted for; is it not against the Covenant to
shelter from Justice those that had deserved death by Treason? as Duke
Hambleton, and the Lord Goring, etc. And is it not against the Covenant to
keep any Delinquents from trial, that they might receive condign punishment?
so that they were so far from acting for the Covenant, as they acted against
the Covenant.

It is further said, they are busybodies in other men's matters: Answer, it is
true, they are busy for the good of other men, even many thousands, but they
are busy in the place they are called to, and fitted for by God, and in which
they were set by the Parliament, who caused that to be their work by
appointment, as they were Soldiers; so as they are busy in their own work
for the Kingdoms good, and that was their duty, and they were faithful in it,
for the glory of God, the good of his people, and the Nation, and the cause
they were to defend; and therefore to be commended for being so faithful in
their places; and they are to be prayed for to the Lord, that he would keep
them faithful in their places, and keep them from turning, That they being
faithful to the death, the Lord may give them the Crown of life.

I pray therefore consider of all these particulars, and consider, if it be not
a sad thing, so many of you, as 47. should be found guilty of so many grievous
sins, as this is, to charge people with so many things, and can prove none;
for all those charges are sins of a high nature, and some of them are sins of
a very high nature, and deserve great and high punishments from God and man;
and therefore do render justly those persons detestable to God and man, that
are guilty of such things as these: But if guiltles, then consider what a
condition such men are in, as do thus charge persons, although they be but of
ordinary rank; if they cannot prove what they charge them with, their sin is
very great; for we know, what the Lord has said against false witnesses (those
that lay so many things to their charge as these have done, and not prove them,
are false witnesses in a high degree) and the Lord has told us, look what
they intended to bring upon the party by such witness, the same shall be done
to them; but how much more, when this is not done to one person, but to many,
and that not to men of a mean rank and place, but those of a high rank and
place, and such as have deserved to be honored for what they had done, and
were doing, it being that the Law of God allows of, and the whole Kingdom has
cause to bless God for, what ever may be held out to the contrary, by persons
disaffected to the Kingdoms good, that may aim at their own ends in so
doing; and therefore God will find out such persons, if men pass them by; and
he will power out contempt for contempt, and disgrace for disgrace, and
reproach for reproach; for he is a just God, and he knows also the most
secret workings of such as work against his people, for their own ends, and
their secret grudgings against them; and therefore we may say to such, Be not
deceived, for God is not, nor will not be mocked, for what a man, or men sow,
that they shall reap: But how much more is it to be admired, that such as lay
such heavy burdens upon others, should be more guilty of those very things, if
not greater, themselves; and therefore it will not be amiss to examine whether
they be guilty, or not.

May it not be said, it was an unseemly thing, if not too much arrogance of
spirit for you to call them private persons, and account it an unseemly thing
for them to desire a consultation with you? for if they were private persons,
they were none of the meanest sort, which if they had, you should not have
slighted them. Again, have you not gone herein against a direct rule in the
Word? or against many rules? have you not gone against the fifth and sixth
Commandment? and that of the Apostle, love thinks no evil, and that, Judge
nothing before the time. Nay, I wish you had not broken the third Commandment,
by misapplying the Word, if not mis-interpreting the Word.

Again, have you not don that which is out of your sphere, in meddling with
matters of the Commonwealth in such sort as you have done, and with persons in
highest places in the Kingdom, and throwing filth upon them? And may not you
be charged with former miscarriages, if all that was written of some of your
carriages in your preachings in your morni^g Lectures be true? which I may
believe, because I never heard it denied by you yet.

May it not be truly said, your late carriages have been against lawful
Authority, when you tax Parliament and Army with things of so high an offense
that have been done against the King? May it not be said you oppose the
Parliament, when you will not acknowledge them to be a Parliament? at least not
pray for them as a Parliament, and also oppose their proceedings, and that
before, and to the whole world, so far as in you lies, and thereby take off
the hearts of the people of the Kingdom from them, as much as in you lies, and
by justifying men to be eminent, and of worth, and integrity, which have been
declared by the Parliament, to have acted directly against the good of the
Kingdom? and this you have done since they so did: And it may be said, that
which you have done is against lawful Authority, and Magistrates that God has
set over us, and contrary to the duty you owe unto them by the law of God and
man; nay which is yet more against your Oaths and Covenants, which you so
plead for; for if that which they did, was in performance of the Covenant, as
has been said formerly, then what you have done must needs be against it.

And may it not be said you have gone against all those Scriptures you have
alleged against them in that kind? for if the Word speak against them for
doing any thing, if you do the same, it will take hold of you as well as of
them. And have not you done something without color of authority of the Word
of God, if it be taken in a right sense, and not abused? And have not you gone
against your trust and many Engagements, in opposing what you have done,
tending to overthrow that for which so much blood and treasure have been shed
for, which was the purity of the Ordinances, and in bringing us into a worse
condition then ever we were in before the Wars began; and you were preserved
in your places by them, that so you might preserve them in purity, and do you
not go against it, and show your discontent because they are removed, which did
hinder it? And do you not usurp authority over the Parliament and Army, so far
as you can, with your clamours and threatenings? if we may judge your hearts by
your wriings, you make high opposition.

And may it not truly be said, you meddle with things not belonging to you? did
it belong to you to write in control of the Proceedings of the Parliament and
Army as you have done, and so to take off the hearts of the people from both?
And is not your doings irregular, and tending to the overthrow of Religion,
while you seek to preserve them that would do it. And O that it might not be
truly said! you are fallen from your former Judgments, and Principles, of
Curse you Meroz, because they came not out to help the Lord against the
Mighty, for now you do little better to those that have, and do help. And are
not you in such a condition that the people of God that understand themselves,
dare not, nor may not bid you God speed, nor wish you well in the name of the
Lord in this action? and such like. And do not these your desires tend to open
a door to Popery and Prelacy, while as you plead for them that will bring in
both? And may it not be truly said, that Religion is made to stink by your
means? when you that are Teachers of others in it, and profess your selves so
to be, do so manifestly disgrace those that seek to maintain it in the most
pure manner, and plead for those that would throw it down; and that you should
be turned from what you were in the beginning of the Parliament: and if it do
not make Religion stink, yet there is cause the faces of Gods people should be
covered with shame for your miscarriages in this thing, and our hearts filled
with sorrow and grief; and the Government of the Parliament, and the courage
and faithfulness of the Army, by you is sought to be laid in the dust, and so
have made them contemptible.

And let it be considered, if your cause may not be compared to Caine and
Balaam, yea, whither it will not suite with Corah and his company, for they
rebelled against Moses and Aaron in their acting for God; and have not you done
the like against the godly Party in Parliament, and Kingdom, which may appear
by what has been formerly said, and in that sense may you not be called
Rebels? And may it not be more truly said of you, in your acting in this paper,
that you act the parts of Jesabels, while you seek, under pretense of the
Covenant, to cast filth upon the Parliament and Army, stirring up the people to
slight, if not to contemn and rebel against them, and so be a means to
hinder all that good they have labored and endeavored to procure, if not
stir up to another war.

And may it not be further said, you do that which you condemn in others,
when you condemn others for breaking the Covenant, and yet you do it your
selves? and condemn others for not obeying the Parliament, and you do not
obey it your selves; nay contemn it, or slight it at the best, and condemn
others for resisting the powers, and you do it your selves, etc.

And may it not be truly said of you, that the time was, you did think they did
exceeding evil that did not go out to war, against the enemies of the
Kingdom, and bring them to trial, if not destroy them, and now you are
against them that so do? And ask Conscience, if you have not slighted
providence when it has so wonderfully appeared, to the just offense of many a
godly heart, and therefore much more against that, that has declared himself
so wonderfully for us; witness your not taking notice of them, and that when
you have been enjoined to do it by the highest Authority in the Kingdom; and
also slighted the successes: formerly you have kept days of Thanksgiving, for
providence and successes, but now you slight both, although they be as great,
if not greater then ever before.

And whereas you tax them for being led by the impulse of spirit, it may be
truly said, in this you were not led by the Spirit of God, for that is pure and
peaceable; but it is to be feared you are led by the contrary spirit in this,
or by your own spirit at the best; and if any evil should have befalne you by
this your acting, it might truly have been said, it had been contracted by your
own miscarriages; and may it not be truly said of you that you were
beautiful, when you acted for God, in the beginning of the Wars, but now you
are cut of his ways, and therefore you may fear he, and his, will forsake
you; or at least he will suffer contempt to be brought upon you. And may we not
admire to hear you say, they were acting freely for that which was Covenanted
for, until the Army came and forced them? was it Covenanted, that all should
be brought again into the old Channel, or into a worse condition then they
were before the Wars began, as has been formerly spoken to? and therefore
consider who may look for the flying Roll, and who are to be accounted
busybodies in other men's matters; and therefore the Lord give every of you a
heart to consider, that the mouth of the Cannon may not be turned against your
selves, I mean those charges you have laid upon them: and which is more, those
Scriptures which should be as Cannons indeed, which we should not stand
against, but fall before them when they come against us, especially those, or
the most of them which you have brought against them, as I have hinted before,
for if these things be thus, have not all the people of God cause, (especially
the Ministers that have not offended as you have done) to cry aloud, and show
you your transgressions, and your sin; and consider if they do hold their
peace, whether they do not make themselves guilty of your sins, and if we must
not have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness?

I beseech you consider what has been said, and see if you have not bin such
in this act, and if we are bidden to abstain from all appearance of evil, how
much more from real evil? and if you consider what has been said, you will
see yours real as well in this; and therefore it must follow, that the people
of God must abstain from you, and have no fellowship with you, while you act
in this manner; and if we must not meddle with them that are subject to change,
then by what has been said we must not meddle with you, for have not you
changed, when you cry out against what you formerly cried out for? and cry
down that which formerly you have cried up? and if we must withdraw from every
Brother that walks disorderly, then, we beseech you, see, if you be not the
men by what has been said, and by what your selves have said, and what your
selves can say? who know more of the secrets of your own hearts then any other
man, or men: but the fruits we may judge by your own instance, I take it, and
that may most prevail with you, if it be as your selves say, it is disorderly
not to be subject to Principalities, and obey Magistrates, if you be not the
men, consider; besides, all your expressions in prayer those days of
Humiliation, and those days of Thanksgiving that have been commanded of late,
may sufficiently declare to all that have been near you. Nay, has it not
further appeared, when you have gone about to cast an odium upon them, not only
in our own Land, but in all others, so far as in you lies; by your causing it
to be put in print; and you have further showed it, by doing the like upon
their proceedings, and upon the Army, which they have set up, and as is in
print, by giving them unseemly terms, and reproachful, all which your selves
cannot endure; and do you think your selves better then they? and is not this
the way to bring them into contempt, and is it not against that text you bring
in the Romans 13.1, 2. Let every soul be subject to the higher powers, for
there is no power but of God; and is not the Parliament a power? and is not the
Army a power? nay, what is there said further, He that resists the power,
resists the ordinance of God; nay, he that so does, shall receive damnation.
What will you say, and how will you answer it before the Lord at the last day?
and how can you answer Conscience at present, when it gripes you with it? what
can I say why I should not receive damnation, if I continue still in this
condition, especially when you think you made use of it to make others
troublesome? and may not that text be applied to you, Ezekiel. 17.14, 15.18, 19.
He that has broken the Covenant shall he prosper? he shall not prosper: the
Lord show you in mercy, how much, and how often you have broken the Covenant,
and do still, especially you crying so as you do against those that so do;
and do you not hear the voice within, Shall I prosper? I shall not, I cannot,
it is the Lord that has spoken it, and I my self have applied it to others;
and say further, surely the Kingdom has no cause to say, We bless you in the
name of the Lord, or the blessing of the Lord be upon you; nor to bid you good
speed in this you have done, wherein you have done so many evil deeds, but to
follow your counsel that you give others against the Army, that so we may not
be partakers with you in those evil deeds; and that in Jude does come fully
upon you, for you have spoken evil of dignities, and have despised their
dominion, and therefore all that text belongs to you; and have you not run
after the error of Balaam, and I wish, it be not for a reward, and therefore
persisting, may you not fear you shall perish in the gaine-saying of Corah;
and also have not you followed, and so may apply that text to your selves, for
have not you cried out, the Parliament and Army have taken too much upon them?
and is not this act of yours, in gathering together so many of you, is it not
against the Lord, while you gather together against them that are acting for
the Lord? and may not that text in the same sense you apply it to others, be
applied to your selves, while you go on in the same way? and there were a
considerable company of them eminent men, and famous in the Congregation, and
would not you be thought to be so? and are not there many of you in this? and
you have in some sense exceeded them, for they did but speak against Moses,
and Aaron; but you have not only spoken, but written, and caused it to be
printed, that so it might be sent all over the world; and therefore consider
how fitly that text, Romans 1.32. Are not you the men that have done such things?
that have condemned that in others that you do your selves; and therefore we
cannot but think that you apprehend it to be a virtue, and do not you delight
in them that do as you have done? and if so, then ask your Consciences, if
you be not the men that have done things worthy of death? and also that, Romans
2.13. And think thou oh man that judge, and do the same things, that
thou shall escape the Judgment of God? but you have done that, you have judged
others; for as contemning powers, and Magistrates, and verse. 2.6. and 11. we
are sure the Judgment of God is according to truth to them that do such
things, who will render to every one according to his works: and there is no
respect of persons with God; except it be you that have more means by your
parts, gifts, and places, God will look for more from your hands, as is said
of Corazin, and Bethsaida in another kind; and may not that text in
Ecclesiastes be applied to you? because sentence against an evil work is not
executed; therefore the hearts of the children of men are set in them to do
evil. You have spoken largely before, and no body opposed you, and now you have
not only spoken, but written, and so the world may take notice of it, and is
no^ this a great evil? And further, I beseech you to consider, if you have not
mis-applyed those Texts 1 Samuel 14.4. and, 1 Samuel 26.8, 9. and Job 13.7. For
wherein have they done wickedly for God, or have not you done so? and that
flying Roll you speak of, may it not be more truly applied to you, then to
them? as has been formerly said, who have been breakers of that Solemn Oath
and Covenant.

And although you have not done violence to the Parliament; and Army, in their
persons; yet have you not offered violence to their names? witness what is in
Print in Mr. Prices book, in answer to your Letter. And have not you accused
them falsely, that have laid so many false things to their charge, as is
formerlie showed? And it were to be desired, you would be as well content with
your wages as they have bin, and consider if they have not gone beyond you, in
being so content as they have been, for they have not only been content with
their wages, but they have been content to be without their wages, which if it
had been your case, it is to be feared, the City and Country should have
heard of it by you, as injustice; and justly you might have don so, but where,
or when have you spoken for this on their behalf, although it has bin the
cause of many evils, as discontents, discouragement in the Soldier, and
oppression of many by free Quarter, and so to raise up the spirits of the
Country to hate them, and despise them, whom they have so much cause to
esteem, and honor, for what they have so faithfully done, in defending the
Country, and offending their enemies; and if the labourer be worthy of his
hire for a days work, when he may work without danger; is not he much more,
that goes in danger of his life ev^rie day, and hour, in defense of his
Country, and the Cause of God especially? and yet it seems, that you have
not taken so much notice of it as you should, because you have spoken no more
in their behalf, and may you not fear, if you persist in your way still, that
which is said in Numb. 32.23. You have sinned, and your sin will find you out.

And whereas you say, you have been threatened if you persist in stirring up
sedition among the people, the Lord help you to consider if it be not so. But
whereas you say, your bewayling their sins before God is accounted so; it may
be feared, you speak against your own consciences in saying so; if you speak
not against conscience, you speak against charity: I entreat you, ask
conscience, if you think, that he that, you say, threatened you, did think,
that bewayling of sin, before God, be sedition? But it may be in that time
when you say you bewail your sins before the Lord, and among your
bewaylings, you might have some or many seditious expressions, or expressions
tending to Sedition: And I beseech you, ask conscience if it has not been so,
for you know what is in Print, and that was that you were advised to take heed
of, and, it may be, you account that threatening of you, which if you did, it
was evil done of you, for it was a friendly part so to do; and if you should
do so, you did add sin to sin.

And whereas you speak, you were threatened, that some might do you mischief,
if they had, I fear you would have had but a little comfort in it: And as for
stirring up discontents in the people, and so occasion another War; what
mischief soever should befall any thereby, might lie heavy upon you.

And whereas you say, you have delivered your own souls, you may rather
consider that Text, Who required these things at your hands? for if thy brother
offend, tell him between him and thee: have you done so? or if you say you dare
not, you should have bewailed it before the Lord: But when did you ever read
that you should publish it unto the world by, writing and Printing of it before
it was publicly made known by others: nay, you refused to go, when you were
sent for, to them, and might have had opportunity to tell them so; and instead
of delivering your own souls, you have further stained them; and instead of
suffering, as Christians, for well-doing, you may fear you shall suffer for
your evill-doing; and instead of those sufferings, being acceptable before God,
there is cause to fear, it is highly displeasing to God, and greatly to his
dishonor: And although the death of his Saints be precious in his sight, yet
it could not be for your comfort to dye in such a condition, or for such an act
as this is, in setting forth such a Book.

And whereas you say, When he makes inquisition for blood, he forgets not the
humble: The Lord help you to see how little humility you have showed in this
book, from the beginning, to the end of it: I know not what you can make
appear to your selves; but I fear, an humble judicious Reader, can find very
little in it, but much of the contrary; for is it not through pride man makes
contention? and what this book could do less, let the judicious and
conscientious Reader judge, coming out at such a time as it did; Is it not
through pride, that men that be sent for in a loving and honorable way to be
consulted withal; in weighty matters, and refuse to go upon such terms as is
set down? Is it not pride to set up our selves above others, especially such
as are in high degree? Is it not pride to call others but private men in
respect of our selves, that are above us in public place set by the Lord? Is
it not pride for us to meddle in things too high for us, which God has not
employed us in? etc.

And whereas, you say, you were told, if you put your selves upon suffering,
you might have suffering enough: Is it not true, for who can either have
^omfort in sufferings, or expect to get out of them, that pull them needlessly
upon themselves? especially by venturing upon unlawful courses as this of
yours is: and therefore how can you say, The God whom you serve, will deliver
you, when in this you do not serve the God of heaven, who is the God, I hope,
you mean: And therefore, I beseech you, consider if you do not abuse his
name, in so saying, as if he would patronize a thing that is so evil as this
is; it is true, in the discharge of your duty, that he calls you unto, you may
commit your souls into his hands as to a faithful Creator: but this is not a
work that he set you about, or will own; and therefore you cannot so commit
your souls to him while you go on in such sinful ways.

All these things considered, how will it appear that what you have done, is
out of zeal to Gods glory, for he is, and will be much dishonored by this
writing: neither can you say, you have discharged your duty, for it is not your
duty to dishonor God, as you have done by this: And how can any think that it
is with an earnest desire after the comfort and salvation of their souls, when
you speak with that bitterness as you have done, and laid so many false
things to their charge? and is not this to speak wickedly for God?

It is true, you have spoken freely, but I wish it might not be said
unfaithfully; but if it be not so, I desire any judicious, conscientious,
impartial Reader, to judge. It may be you have declared your judgments, but I
would hope the contrary; for if this be your judgments, it shows, they be
very corrupt, whereas you have spoken so much bitterness, and many untruths
against them both for their former and latter proceedings; for should you be
satisfied in your desires? all would have been in a worser condition then they
were before the blood and treasure was spent, for not only an enemy should
have been let loose upon us, but an enemy enraged; and therefore if that
should have reformed in your sense, all the Church of Christ would have had
great cause of mourning and sadness for what they had yielded unto, and we
might have taken it as a just recompense for our sin; but their not taking your
advice, we have cause to bless the Lord for, and that he has made them
isntrumental to set forth his glory, and also a mercy, and salvation, and
enlargement to his people; and so you found false Prophets as well as you have
bin falls accusers, in what you say that their present actings do certainly tend
to misery and confusion; but oh that it might not truly be said, that your
present actings, if for the sin of the Kingdom you should prevail, they will
bring unavoidable misery and confusion: Oh therefore that the Lord would
please to set things sadly upon your hearts, and bring you to a serious and sad
consideration of what you have done; you have had diverse answers formerly, and
therein the Lord has appeared diverse ways unto you, in his offers of
conviction, which seem some tokens of his favor unto you, if he give you a
heart to search, and see what his will is toward you in it: Consider
therefore, I beseech you, what your selves are by your own account, in respect
of your places and standing, and do not overthrow such honorable standings,
places, and titles, etc. by dishonorable ways: I beseech you consider, will
you take the name of Ministers of the Gospel, Ministers of Jesus Christ,
Ambassadors of Christ, and Pastors of Churches, all honorable titles, but how
unlike you have acted, others have told you, and the Lord grant you may
consider it: but for such as have such titles, or challenge themselves,
consider, for you to do, and speak, and write such things, which make the
enemies of God to take content in, if not rejoice in, and to gratify
Malignants, and to grieve the people of God, and sad their hearts, if not all
of them, yet a great many of them that love the Lord Jesus Christ, and his
ways; and that it should be said of you, as if you should be Incendiaries, to
stir up the evil affected to another war, and so to daunt the hearts of
many of the people of God, so as their hearts should sink, so as they should
question their way; nay, lead some of them to be forward in opposing the way of
truth and peace.

Again, consider not only you give yourselves these titles, but that you say
you are within the Province of London, (although it seem by the writing of
some you are not all of you so) so those that are within the Province of
London, where you are (...) are one another, and so may be helps one to
another; what, in the City of London, the chief City in the Kingdom, that
has been famous for the Gospel, for so many to join together in such a
calumniating Letter as this was, against such persons as this is against; is it
not an evil example to the whole Kingdom? for you may please to consider, the
generality of the people are led more by example then by precept, and more by
the precepts of men then of God, especially of them that are in such places as
you are in; for you are, or at least should be the lights of the world, as our
Savior says, But if the light that is in you be darkness, how great is that
darkness? Oh what a sad thing it is to hear the people say, the Ministers are
most discontent with what is done, and for you to stir up discontents in the
people, and make them fit to contrive new designs to bring more misery, if
not ruin to this poor Kingdom; and how sad a thing is it to hear people say
(especially the people of God) if ruin and misery come upon the Kingdom, We
may thank our Ministers next our sins? Again, consider the time when you did
this, when the greatest business was in hand that ever was in the Kingdom,
and Justice was in a good readiness to be executed, and upon the point of
execution, and in such a sort as you could not but hear the greatest part of
the Kingdom was discontented with, and crying out against, and so the work was
very difficult in it self; but then for you to come in to gratify those
persons, ask your Conscience what that must work that was for his
preservation, and setting him up in his throne again? Again, ask your
Consciences what you think of many of them that were against what was done?
were not such as would have hindered that work which you prosecuted, for the
most part of them, Papists, Cavaliers, and Malignants, and profane people? and
do you not fear to go with those, and gratify them? and the most part of
those that were for it, if you ask Conscience it will tell you, they were such
as have some fear of God before their eyes, and are such as go on
conscientiously in performance of the Covenant, and is it that Christ allows?
to have those opposed, and spoken against, and disheartened, for doing that,
the Law of God, and the Covenant call them to do? nay, to have such persons
stirred up, and inveterate against them that do it?

I beseech you consider, and fear, if herein you do not fight against God;
and would it not make a gracious heart mourn, to see so many that call
themselves Ministers of the Gospel, servants and Ambassadors of Christ, to go
so directly against his Rules, which he has set down in his holy word for us
to walk by; the Lord in mercy help you to consider it, and lay it to heart;
what a sad thing is it, that you that preach Christ, as you say, and are his
Ambassadors, should be so unlike ^im in life, and conversation; Christ bids us,
Learn of him, he is humble and meek, and when he was reviled, he reviled not
again: but in this ye have done, here appears pride and passion; and instead
of not reviling, when you are reviled, you revile those that are doing you
good, so as you reward evil for good: nay, you revile those that have, and
were venturing their lives, to save the lives of you and yours: nay, all the
godly part of the Kingdom: nay, you revile them for doing it: Oh again, I
beseech you, examine your own consciences, how you think to answer it before
the Lord Christ, at the great day, when you must appear before Him, Angels,
Men and Devils; and once at the last, if it may be, smite upon your own
hearts, and entreat the Lord to help you to be willing to take, and bear the
shame of it here, by a free and full confession, that so you may avoid
everlasting shame for ever, and ever. Oh, what shall I further say, Tell it not
in Gath, nor publish it in Askelon; yea, but that it is too late; you have done
it your selves, and now we cannot help it, nor well free our hands of it, but
by witnessing against it: for my part, I could rather have taken the part of
Shem to Jephtah, to have gone far to have covered it; but that you have not
only been naked, but you have spread your nakedness, and laid it open to the
world, and so it is brother then can be covered, and so I am stopped there.

And I could have been willing to observe the Rule of Christ, If thy brother
offend, tell him between thee and him; but you have put it past that, and have
put me upon the Rule of the Apostle, He that sins openly, rebuke him openly;
but I have forborne it as much as I could, to be faithful in what I have
undertaken: my aim is, if the will of God be, that he would by some means,
show you your sin; and bring you to repentance, that so as you have
dishonored God by your sin, you might honor him by your acknowledgement of
your sin, that the Rule of God, and the people of God, may have some
satisfaction, that as you have grieved them by your sin you may rejoice them in
your repentance and humiliation; for godliness appears in power, when it
works the heart to bear shame and take shame openly for their sin; for it is a
persons weakness to fall into sin, but it is his strength to rise again by
repentance, and acknowledging of it freely, which the Lord in mercy help you
to do.

One argument more before I leave, give me leave to present unto you, which is
the work you are going about, which is the setting up of the Presbyterian
Government: for may not wise men reason thus; Are these men fit to govern the
Church of Christ, by having all the power put into their hands, when so many of
them in one Province, and that the chiefest in the Kingdom, that are so near
together, which may take counsel one of, and with another; and if they
miscarry so shamefully, what shall we look for in the other parts of the
Kingdom, if they dare thus to confront the powers of the Kingdom, in the
condition they are now in? what will they do, if they get the power in their
hand? and how will they lord it over the poor people, that must be under them?
and they may suspect you, by your eager desire you have to have the power all
in your own hand; for they may well know, that a conscientious humble heart,
will fear to take the burden of teaching, much more of ruling a Congregation,
but will be far from desiring to take it upon him alone, or with one or two
to help, but will be glad of the help of all in the Congregation to be joined
in power with him; and also to watch over him also, being fearful he should
miscarry, and being willing to be helped, if he so do, as we may instance in
this present act of yours; if any of these Ministers had but a company of godly
people in their Congregation, that would have called them to an account, and
had power so to do, they would have feared to have done such an act as this
was; or if they had, they should have been made to give public satisfaction:
And may it not be feared, they know it well enough, and therefore they think
to make it sure, they will have the power in their own hand, that so they may
combine together, if occasion serve, as they did now, and have none to call
them to account: And this considered, I see not, but the Lord may have a hand
in it, to keep you from that power you seek, and give his people hearts to
embrace such a Government in the Church, as Christ does approve of, that so he
may ride in Triumph in Church and Commonwealth.

FINIS.
