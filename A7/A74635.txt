London, Printed for JOHN Hanson. 1642.

A general Advertisement for the better observing of our monthly Fast.
FOR the better observing and keeping of this our great and General Fast,
commanded by His Majesty and both Houses of Parliament, for the general good
of the whole Kingdom, in which is found much neglect by many sorts of people
to the great dishonor and disobeying His Majesty's Command, and the Command of
both Houses of Parliament herein.

It is thought fit and requisite therefore, that all Good Christians and true
Subjects, of what nature soever, that are Householders, to order themselves and
their affairs, so that upon that day or days wherein they are commanded to
fast, they have not any let or hindrance to withdraw them from so good a work,
but for that time or times to lay aside all manner of worldly affairs, and
tend only to the service of God, and to be careful to see that their
Children, Servants, and all such as be under their charge, may truly and duly,
keeping the Church, hearing Divine Service and Sermons, abstaining from all
manner of Flesh, or delicious meats, and likewise from all manner of vices or
any thing that is contrary to the keeping of a tru^ fast, or may any ways
hinder our devotion or draw us from the true service of God, To the breach of
the command of his Majesty and both the Honorable Houses of Parliament.

and for the better understanding of the true fast is that as I had said
before, we must first abstain from flesh and all manner of Delitious meats; hot
wines, or strong drink or the like, whereby the flesh is pampred and made
high, that many times it rebels against the spirit, causing in us a neglect of
the service of God, and carlesnes of our duty toward out parents, and Prince,
or regardlesse of the love we ought to bear to our neighbor, and make us more
apt daily and hourly to run into all manner of viees which is the cause that at
sueh times of fast we ought to abstane from flesh not for that it is hurtful
to the body to eat, but hurtful for the soul, in that we are hereby drawn
into temtations and so herehy loose the benefit thereof which is the grace and
favor of God, for when are men more apt to sin then in the heat of flesh the
heat of blood, and the like.

Then if we will fast from sin as we pretend let us first fast from the
causers of sin which is delitious meats, hot drincks and the like as I said
before and by that doing we may with out doubt the better fast from sin and so
fasting from sin, gain the grace and faiuor of almighty God his eternal love,
and in love of our Neighbor which are the things required of us in this Fast,
it is good also that all Innes, Tavernes, and Alehouses be more strictly looked
unto, and that they be not suffered on these days appointed for Fast, to open
their doors to let in any company to drink, more then upon necessity, as to
Strangers, Travelers, or the like.

For it has been observed and noted, that many disorders have been and daily
are seen in this Fast, commitred by diverse people on those days, as
extraordinary eating, drinking, swearing, and diverse other abuses or
absurdities, not fitting the time, nor indeed not fitting any time, especially
upon such a time as we are commanded to offer to God the sacrifice of our
hearts, by Fasting and Ptayer, which are works to be done with a true and
sincere devotion, in a godly and most Christian-like way, suppressing our
wonted untamed wills, and not to run on headlong, not minding what we go
about and like bruit beasts make all days and times alike, which is no fast at
all.

Therefore if we mean hereby to gain the Grace and Favor of God, the love
of our King and Parliament, and our own general good; Let us obey their
Commandments, and if commanded to fight, let us fast; if to pray, let us pray,
but in this we are strictly commanded to fast and pray not for the good and
benefit of them in particular, but for the general good and benefit of the
whole Kingdom, the establishing of the true faith, and the obtaining of true
peace and unity amongst us all.

For which we are commanded to offer to Almighty God in recompense of our
disobedience to his eternal Majesty every month a day, and that day to be
seriously kept according to the promises it being not sufficient, as is before
said, to fast all day and to feast at night, or to fast all day and to be
drunk at night, as too many in this City and Kingdom does, but we endeavor
to keep it duly and truly, not violating and profaning any part of it, but
that the night as well as the day being observed from all manner of vices,
dedicating our selves for that time wholly to the service of God, otherwise it
is no Fast at all, but a deceiving of our selves, and a robbing of God of his
Honor and Glory, for which it was instituted and commanded.

Surely we have more need to offer to God every week a day, and every day an
hour to be spent in prayer and good works, whereby to appease the wrath and
anger of God, which we are so daily like to fall upon us in this dangerous time
of war, being altogether uncertain how long we shall live, or how soon we
shall be cut off; therefore if we duly consider with our selves the dangers
that we now live in, we shall find that we never had more need to Fast and
pray then now.

Wherefore let us all with one assent submit our selves to His Majesty's just
Command, and the just Command of both Houses of Parliament, in the true keeping
of this great and general First, as a work of piety, craving the aid and
assistance of Almighty God herein, that we may the better dispose our selves
thereto, to His honor and glory, and so doing there is no question but we
shall thereby gain the Grace of God with his love and Favor in all that we
desire a true unity between Mis Majesty and the Parliament, an establishment
of the Laws Spiritual and Temporal, the abolishing war, and the settling of
peace throughout the whole Kingdom, Almighty God grant it.

Amen.
Where Is quiet pe^ce
Where Is wrath and anger,
Where Is Love and Friendship,
VVheres hate and envy
Where Neighbors love,
There will true happiness
Which here in England
All rest, repose, content
Then Fast and pray,
Serve God each day
FINIS.
