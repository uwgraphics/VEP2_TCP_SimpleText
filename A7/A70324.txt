To all our Friends and Brethren, at the several Monthly and particular
Meetings; in and throughout the County of York
GREETING,
WE your Friends and Brethren, who are Assembled togeth^^ in the fear of God,
to consider of the affairs of the truth in ^^lation to our Christian Society
in the County afforesaid, have under our tender and Christian Consideration the
great Lo^^ Mercy and Favor of our God, in making known unto (with many more)
the way of Life and Salvation, in and the Blessed Appearance of our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ, who by the di^^^veries of his Light, Grace and Holy
Spirit, has not only given us to see vanitys and wickedness of this present
World, but also through Faith in him, a^^ by the Glorious power and virtue of
his spirit and goodness; he has in a g^^^^ measure gathered a Remnant out of
those vanities, defilements and pollutio^^ wherein the World lies, to walk with
him in that Divine light and Heav^^ly way which has always been the Path of
the Just, and wherein the Faith to God do find great peace, comfort and
satisfaction in him, having been ^^^cretly touched and inwardly wrought upon by
his power and spirit, not onl^ the mortifying of Sin and evil, but also to the
Quickening and raising up of souls of many unto newness of Life, and so are
thereby brought into a capa^^^ of worshipping and serving God; not in the
oldness of the Letter, but in the ^^^ness of that Spirit and Life, wherein
acceptance with the Father is known, whereby we are brought into a spiritual
fellowship and Communion with in the Son of his Love, and are made liveing
members, of that Spiritual bo^^ whereof Christ our Lord is the head, who is to
have the Rule and prehemin^^ in the Church that so every member therein may be
acted and governed, by power and spirit, to the praise and glory of God and
mutual comfort o^ another.

Yet in as much as we have all one common Enemy, to watch against wh^ his
temptations does endeavor to ensnare the weak and (if possible) by his
^^tillty and allurements to overcome many (whom the Lord by his grace and (...)
has been at work withal) and draw them back again, into those vanities
defilements which they have formerly been subject to, and which the Lord his
spirit does testify against; therefore it is very necessary for every one
(...) ^ath known and experienced the goodness of the Lord in order to call and
ga^^er them out of the ways of the World, and his heavenly hand to be stretched
(...) for their help and deliverance, that they be very careful and watchful
in ^^eir ways, that the enemy prevail not again upon any of them to darken
^^eir minds, and bring them back into folly and vanity, and make them sub^^ct
to that power and spirit of darkness, whereby their minds may become alienated
from God; and their understandings veiled, so that its possible, they ^ay
return again, into the practice of those things which they have formerly ^een
addicted to, and which once they have been sensible the Lord by his Spirit ^ath
testified against, and reproved them for, as also its possible that such may
(...) too prone, to admit of, or otherwise Indulge, such things not only in
them^^^ves, but also amongst their Children and Families, which in the time of
their ^st Convincement, they durst not allow of, nor are they to be allowed of
in our ^hristian society.

Therefore, we being thus sensible of the great love and kindness of our God,
^^wards his people on the one hand, and of the wiles of the Enemy, of the other
^^nd, and being Jealous that but too many (especially in a time of outward ease
^^d Liberty) who have proffest the truth of our God, and have outwardly walk^^^
in society with us, both have been and still may be, not so Cautious, diligent
^^d circumspect as they ought to be, upon diverse accounts: And also having
^^der our Consideration the many Living, sound, wholesome and Christian
testimonies, Cautions, Admonitions and directions which have formerly been ^^^m
time to time, and upon several occasions given forth by our ancient Friends
^^d Brethren, who have Labored amongst Us, in the word and Doctrine; As ^o the
Counsel and advice of our Friends and Brethren Recommended unto (...) at
sundry times, and in diverse Letters and Epistles from the Yearly Meeting at
^^^don, desiring Friends care in the matters and things hereafter mentioned; As
^evivall of the former testimonies, cautious advice and directions as
aforesaid, ^^d in order to stir up Friends in their several and respective
monthly and par^^^^lar meetings, unto a holy care and diligence in these
respects: We have ^^nd it to be our place and duty at this time in the love of
God, and under the ^^^y exercise, of his divine Grace and Goodness, wherein the
Lord is pleased to ^^cerne us, with many more of his Children and People, to
recommend the ^^^^owing particulars unto all our Friends and Brethren, at their
several Month^^ and particular meetings in the County aforesaid, and by way of
