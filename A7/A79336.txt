A PROCLAMATION For speeding the Payment of the Arrears of Seventy thousand
pounds for three Months Assessments, due and payable the First of August last
past.
CHARLES R.

WHereas in Our absence an Ordinance of both Houses of Parliament was made,
Entitled, An Ordinance of the Lords and Commons for the Assessment of Seventy
thousand pounds by the month upon England, for three Months, for the supply
of Our present Occasions, and for and toward the payment and satisfaction of
the Armies and Navies, continued for the defense of this Kingdom, and for other
the necessary and urgent occasions thereof, And for the due levying and raising
of the said Moneys, an Act also passed in this present Parliament, for putting
the said Ordinance in execution, and thereby all and every the Clauses, Powers
and Provisions in the said Ordinance mentioned, are enacted to be put in full
execution.

And whereas by the aforesaid Ordinance, it is Ordered and Required, That the
full Sum of the said three months Assessments, charged upon the several and
respective Counties, Cities, Boroughs, Towns and Places, within Our Realm of
England, and Dominion of Wales, should be wholly paid in and completed to the
Receiver General thereunto appointed, at or before the first day of August last
past; Nevertheless the same is in a very great measure, as We are informed,
uncollected: And for Non-payment thereof, the necessities they were appointed
to supply are disappointed; and the disbanding of such part of the Army, to
whom is assigned some of those Arrears, will be much retarded:

We therefore by and with the advice of Our Privy Council, do hereby Require
and Command, under the penalty of Our High Displeasure, all and every the
Commissioners named in the said Ordinance, for the respective Counties, Cities,
Boroughs, Towns and Places, within Our Realm of England, and Dominion of Wales,
speedily and very effectually, to put in full execution all the Powers,
Authorities, Orders and Rules mentioned and laid down in the aforesaid
Ordinance, as may best conduce to the speedy carrying on of the public Service
thereby required, and that all and every the Head-Collectors, Sub-Collectors,
Receivers, and other persons empowered by any Clause, Article or Order, in the
said Ordinance, do with all diligence and care, perform the duty of their
several Employments, under the Penalties by the said Ordinance imposed; To the
end that there be no failer in any part of the due execution of the Service by
the said Ordinance appointed: But that the whole Arrears of the said
Assessments being paid in without delay, the great inconveniences which
otherwise will ensue, may be prevented and avoided.

And lastly, We do hereby straightly charge and command all persons whatsoever
to yield all due obedience forthwith as to the paying their and every of their
Arrears of the aforesaid Assessments, in manner as by the said Ordinance is
Ordered and directed, as they and every of them will answer the contrary at
their utmost peril.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Twenty sixth day of September, in the
Twelfth year of Our Reign, 1660.
