A Sayler new come over:
And in this Ship with him those of such fame
The like of them, mere unto England came,
Men of such quality and parts most rare,
Reading this Ditty, will show you what they are.
To the tune of A Sayler new come over.




A Saylor new come over,

A Pirates lately taken,

This to be true you need not doubt,

And by his valorous courage stout

A Jew is come from Venice,
plays curiously at Tenis,
Has costly Jewels rich and rare,
to give or sell to Ladies fair,
Will to his Chamber make repair,
Which he brought in a Pinace,
When as he came from Venice.
Likewise a Turk, and Grecian,
with one of every nation:
All in a Ship, together be,
come ore to England for to see
Our gallants in their bravery:
and note each several fashion,
that's worn in this our nation.
The second part

For to convert the lewdest wife,
that ever wrought her husbands grief,
You never see a quainter

He is skild in Negromancy
to make a young man faincy,
A woman live she North or South,
that in her head has nere a tooth,
Decrepid, blind, and lame both,
yet her that he shall fancy,
by this his Negromancy.
If you will not believe me,
or rightly can conceive me,
To credit that this same is true,
I formerly have sung to you,
To singing I will bid adue,
And at this time give over,
To see these sights at Dover.
Printed at London for Henry Gosson.
