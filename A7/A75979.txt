A Petition to his Majesty.
KING, I was your Messenger impostened in God's will concerning your return to
this place so soon again: I was laid harbourless that same year that I saw the
Vision of your return to England again. I do desire some liberty for my own
practice of my own household Ordinances, as I was chosen Messenger of your
return again, and saw it Justice that you should have this Land again, so you
do not oppress the weak spirits of God's Majesty in his Saints, but let them
have recourse in whatsoever passion God shall be pleased to raise himself in
his Ministers; So I my self shall stand a mother in God's house in these
cases: I shall also entreat some liberty concerning my labor on your Jewish
Sabbath. I dourterly defy all Jewish forms of Religion: or keeping any one day
above another; for in so doing you keep out the profession of Christ's, natures
practice: So you may be left damned souls as the Jewish people was, which was
always requiring a Savior, and yet at last themselves left Vagabonds, for
want of the true Spirit to serve them with wisdom, and the supply of God's will
in his Christ, which God had sent to be their Teacher and Savior, both in his
son and Apostles: so you will be left in the same passion, as your standing is
now in these Nations, being divided in service, and all confusion, which will
breed a speedy destruction, except you will adhere to let the Saints make
themselves a body in Christ's passion: and you your self must stand Protector
of these occasions: So your Country will be blessed with this presence, more
then any parts of the Dominions of the world besides you; So the Saints will
have their Prerogative, and your souls will have salvation by their presence,
and your blessings will abound more then other Nations, as you shall consent to
these Propositions: So I rest, Christ's Minister in this present hour,

Amen. Ahivah's Petition to his Majesty for the Saints Liberties.
I shall also entreat, that whenever God shall be pleased to manifest any of
his fore-speaking words, and they be brought forth to cry it in the open
street, or any place of City or Counry, that you will grant some Protection by
Constables, or some other means, that they be not abused in such conditions, as
I my self have been; as being cast into Bedlam that same year for a mad body,
when I had the sight of the return of your Majesty to this place again: And if
my Father, God Almighty, had not made a way in my self to get me out of their
hands, I had been destroyed for a mad body: For these conditions of God's
action are strange to your worlds understanding, in the time of God's action in
us.


So I rest, Your Minister, if you please to accept of my office in Christ's
name, AHIVAH.

The World, and the Worlds Minister.
