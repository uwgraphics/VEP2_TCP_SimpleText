THE ATHEISTICAL POLITITION OR A BREIFE DISCOURSE CONCERNING Ni. Machiavell.
nouemb: the 23th 1642
Nicholas Machiavell is cride down for a villain, neither do I think he
deserves a better title, yet when I consider he was not only an Italian but a
Courtier, I cannot choose but commiscrate his fortune, that he in particular
should bear the marks, which belong to the wisest Statesmen in general.

He that intends to express a dishonest man calls him a Machiavillian, when he
might as justly say a Straffordian or a Cantabirian; We embrace the first
apparition of virtue or vice, and let the substance pass by untoucht.

For if we examine the Life of Lewis the 11th of France, we shall find he
acted more ill, than Machiavill writ, or for ought we know ever thought; yet he
has wisdom inscribed on his Tomb; And had he not kissed his Crucifixe ever
after the doing a dishonest thing; pronouncing a sentence or two that
discovered the complexion of his heart, he might have past for as honest a man
as all wise Ancestors or any Prince living in his time, who now lie quiet in
their Graves; A favor this man is denied by ignorant and ungrateful posterity.

He was Secretary to the state of Florence, of which he has written an
excellent and impartial History, he had lived in the days of Pope Alexander
the sixth, been familiar with his Son Caesar, and what these Princes were is
sufficiently known.

No time was fuller of action, nor showed the instabilitie of worldly honors
than the occurrences that happened in Italy at this time; Now from a man wholly
employed in Court affairs, where it was thought madness to look beyond
second causes; worse things might have been with better reason expected, than
these so bitterly condemned; which are indeed but the History of wise
impieties, long before imprinted in the hearts of ambitious pretenders, and by
him made legible to the meanest understanding, yet he is more blamed for this
fair expression, than they are that daily commit far greater impiety, than
his or any penelse is able to express.

It was his profession to imitate the behavior of Princes were it never so
unseemly; Nay Religion cannot condemn the speculation of ill in Ministers of
State without laying her self and professors open to all injury.

For upon how great disadvantage should a good Prince treat with a bad
Neighbor; if he were not only familiar with the paths of wickedness, but
knew other ways to shun them; and how to counterminde their treacherous
practizes:

Do any blame Albertus for writing obscenely, nay do they not rather call him
the Great, because he has so plainly set open the Closet of Nature? Indeed if
any can pretend a just quarrel to Machiavell, they are Kings; for as it is the
ordinary course of light women, to findefault with the broad discourse of that
they maintain their power by; So Statesmen may best blame the publication of
these Maxims, that they may put them in practice with more profit and
security.

The unjust Steward is commended for his wordly wisdom; and what does he say
more of Caesar Borgia, than that he was a politic Tyrant? and if without leave
of the Text he propose him for an Example, yet it is of ill; And who is more
fit to be a Pattern to a Villain than one of the fame coat.

Most of the Estates in Italy did then voluntarily, or were compelled to change
their masters, neither could that School teach him any thing more perfectly
than the way to greatness, nor he write a more acceptable Treatise then
Aphorisms of State.

He saw the Kingdom of Naples torn out of the house of Angieu by Ferdinand,
and the people kept in Tyranny both by the Father and the Son; he saw the no
less mad than disloyal ambition of Lodowick Duke of Millan, who took the
government upon him out of the hands of young Galeas with as much treachery and
cunning as Francis Sforca father to Galeas had done from the Dukes of Orleance;
he beheld Charles the 8th King of France brought into Italy by the said Duke of
Millan to keep the people at gase, whilst he poisoned his Nephew, who was to
expect the Dukedom when he came of age; He saw the descent of Charles winked
at by Pope Alexander the sixth, in hope to raise a house for his Son Caesar out
of the ruins of some of the Princes, in which he was deceived; For the French
King made himself Master of all Italy, entered Rome twice, put the holy Father
to take Sanctuary in the Castle Saint Angelo, and there to subscribe to such
conditions as the victorious King was pleased to prescribe him; upon which his
Holiness came out: And though Charles in show of reverence did kiss his foot,
yet he took his Son Caesar for hostage, to secure the performance of his
promise, though he covered it with the name of Embassage ever to reside with
the King in token of Amity; and after Caesar had made an escape the Holy Father
contrary to his oath made a league against the French King.

He was an eyewitness of an Amity contracted between the Vicar of Christ
and his known enemy the Turk; with whom he agreed for money to poison his
brother, who was fled into Christendom for fear of Bajazet then reigning, and
was under the Popes protection at Rome; And might have been of excellent use to
any Prince that would have invaded the Turk, had not his holiness observed
his promise to this monster, which he seldom kept with the best of men.

After all this he saw the French King loose all Italy with the same dexterity
he had gained it, And Pope Alexander and his son both overthrown by own
draught of poison, prepared by themselves for others, of which the father dyed
presently but the son by reason of youth and antedote, had leisure to see
what he had formerly gotten, torn out of his hands; And he forced to flee to
his father in Law the King of Navarre in whose service he was murdered.

To these ambitious practices of princes, may be added the domestical impiety
of the Pope, who was a corrivall with his two sons in the love of his own
daughter the Lady Lucretia; whom they all three enjoyed; which bred such a
hatred between the brothers that Caesar being jealous that the other had a
greater share in her affection; killed him one night, and threw him into Tiber;
Nay it could not be discerned when the head of the Church spoke truth or
falsehood but by the extraordinary execrations he used when he meant to deceive.

Neither are these only the commodities of Italy but the usual trafique of all
the Courts in the world, for the mark that God has set upon Jeroboam (who
according to our dialect) may be styled the Machiavell of the Jews,) cannot
scare most Princes out of his path; For how many Kings have failed to set up
Altars, both at Bethel and Dan, when they think their power may be weakened by
the people going to Jerusalem; Saul being a private man went to the Prophet to
ask after his Fathers Asses, But being a King went to the Devil to know the
success of a battle.

Christ himself says, not many great, not many mighty are called; Men in
soft raiment may be found at Court but their consciences are commonly scared
and hard.

This makes me think the wise men that came from far to see our Savior,
thought him an earthly Prince and not the King of heaven, else they would never
have sought him in the Court of Herod from whence nothing could come but
cruelty and oppression.

The Church of Rome that did anciently deserve honor of all the world; After
it came to be a Court grew fruitful only in impiety; and though we do
acknowledge her still to be a Church because she has all the liniament of
Religion in her, yet they are so blended in superstition, pomp and cruelty,
that it is no easy task to find the truth amongst them. For as a good
fruit-tree leaves not to be the same it was before, though covered and embraced
with ivy and ill weeds, the natural daughters of time, which neither spare
things sacred nor profane, so Rome may be called a Church still, though covered
with trash and idle ceremonies; in which the Pope and the Cardinals shroud
themselves, so as if knowledge occasioned by the elumination of God, had not
houted them out of some corners of the world, they had not only made good, by
an unquestioned prescription those errors in being, but brought in more, and
being themselves masters of all temporal estates, and were there nothing else
against them but greatness and impiety, it were enough to convince them, of
falsehood and novelty, pride is acknowledged by all to be the root of ill, now
where does it prosper so well or grow so strong as in Princes and such as do
attend on their affairs, the effects of which sin, can be contained in no
narrower compass, than the whole mass of impiety that is apt to commit, for
it made Phocas kill his Master, Caesar to overthrow the liberty of the bravest
Commonwealth that ever the world did or is likely to behold, it prompts the
hand of children to pull unseasonably the pillowes from under the heads of
their dying fathers, it is this that fills heaven and hell with souls, the
earth with blood, this pride made Charles the fifth to arm himself against his
own Pope, that very year in which God had done him the honor to take one of
the greatest Monarchs in christendom prisoner, it caused his son Philip to
mingle the blood of his own child with the infinite quantity hespilt upon the
face of Europe, yet his thirst could not be quenshed, though he set a new world
abroach in America, which he let run till it was as void of people, as he was
of pity.

Is a Prince named in any Chronicle, but in read letters, nay what are
chronicles registers of blood and projects to procure it, yet none blames them
that write them I do not intend to make an Apology for him; being so well
acquainted with the miseries of those, that are so unhappy as to fall under the
government of such principles, all I aim at is, to prove that if he were justly
arrained he could not be condemned by men in like place, who ever were his
peers if not worse, because advice without execution hurt only the giver.

Yet Machiavell says, what Prince had not rather be Titus than Nero, but if he
will needs be a Tyrant he shows him the way that is least hurtful to his
temporal estate, as if he should say thou have made thy self already an
eenimie to God and thy people, and have nothing to hope for, beyond the honor
of this world, therefore to keep thee from the fury of men be sure thou art
perfectly wicked, a task not hitherto performed it being yet beyond example
that any Tyrant should perform all the mischief, that was requisite for his
safety no more than the best Kings, did ever all the good; and of this he makes
Caesar Borga Alexander the 6 son a pattern, who removed all the impediments
that stood between him and his desires, and provided against all cross
accidents but his own, being sick at the time of his fathers death, which
hindered him so as he had no leisure to attend his business, which was to make
one suoceed in his fathers place, that might at least have favored his
projects; But I verily believe, as I see by daily experience, that those which
go on in the same track, though they have brought their purposes to as happy a
conclusion, yet they shall not want impediments, or discontents, that shall
out-talke the pleasure of their Ambition, but since it is oftentimes the will
of God to give success to ill means wisly contrived, who can advise better
than this Florentine a member of the Roman Church, and is in that regard to be
less blamed, because he had as much Religion as the Pope then in being; with
whom all impieties were as familiar as the air he breathed in.

Neither are these rules he speaks of omitted in the best Kings, if they be
wise; for which of them does not dispatch his ungrateful actions by deputies;
and those that are popular, with his own hands? do any observe their promise
so exactly as not to fail when they ee the profit greater than can be expected
at another time? and all this he says only to a Prince. For had he given those
documents to a Son, or any other that had filled any narrower room than a
kingdom; he might with juster reason have undergone all censure; but being to
make a Grammar for the understanding of Tyrannical government, is he to be
blamed for setting down the general rules of such Princes? Now if falsehood
and deceit be not their true dialect, let any judge that reads their stories?
Nay cozenage is reduced into so necessary an art amongst them; that he that
knows not how to deceive, knows not how to live. That breach of faith in
private men, is damnable, and dishonerable, he cannot deny. But Kings seem to
have larger Charters by reason of their universal commerce, and as Ambassadors
may be excused if they lie abroad for the good of their Country; because they
represent their Masters persons; with far greater reason may they do it than
they that employ them, provided they turn not the edge of these qualities
toward their own people to whom they are tide in a more natural, and honest
Obligation.

For a Commonwealth is like a natural body, and when it is all together
shows a comely structure, but search into the entrals from whence the true
nourishment proceeds, and you shall find nothing but blood, filth, and
french; the truth is, this man has raked too far in this, which makes him
smell as he does in the nostrils of ignorant people; whereas the better
experienced know, it is the wholesome favor of the Court, especially where the
Prince is of the first head.

FINIS.
