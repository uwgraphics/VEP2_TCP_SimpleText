ARMILLA CATECHETICA.

A CHAIN of PRINCIPLES; Or, An orderly concatenation of Theological Aphorisms
and Exercitations; Wherein, The Chief Heads of Christian Religion are asserted
and improved: By JOHN ARROWSMITH, D. D. Late Master both of St John's and
Trinity-Colledge successively, and Regius Professor of Divinity in the
University of CAMBRIDGE.

Published since his Death according to his own Manuscript allowed by Himself
in his life time under his own hand.

ECCLESIASTES 12. 9, 10, 11. Because the Preacher was wise, He still taught the
people Knowledge. Yea; He gave good heed, and sought out and set in order many
Proverbs.

The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written
was upright, even words of Truth.

The words of the Wise are as goads and as nayls fastened by the Masters of the
Assemblies, and given by one Pastor.

To the Reader.
IT is the Profession of the Apostle Paul to the Corinthians in regard of
Himself; That as a wise Masterbuilder 1 Cor. 3. 10.
he had laid the Foundation; Whereby he would signify and declare thus much
unto them: That the laying of the Foundation is the work of a Master Builder,
as also that some skill and wisdom is both required and shown in the right
laying of it.

This has been Eminently the care of the Reverend and Learned Author of these
ensuing discourses, who being sufficiently sensible of the defect, as well as
necessity of a settled and wellgrounded knowledge in the Fundamentals of the
Doctrine of Christ; Heb. 6. 1.
has therefore with all diligence applied himself hereunto in this Treatise,
which he has left to the world.

Neither was this more seasonable for the Time then it was proper and fitting
for the place, in which at first it received it is Beginning, being in One of
the Schools of the Prophets, and a Principal Seminary of Divines, St John's
College in Cambridge. Where being at that time Master (and having as yet no
other public employment, which might take him up) he was willing to lay
himself forth so much the rather in this way of his Ministry, by Catechetical
Lectures in that Chapel on the Evenings of the Lords day. As Elisha when he
came to Jericho, 2 King. 2. 21.
casting salt into those springs of water, for the preserving of all
savouriness and fruitfulness in them.

Now these Sermons of his he had drawn up (so far as to the preaching of them)
into a complete Body of Divinity in thirty distinct Aphorisms with their
respective Exercitations; being also the sum, and extract of most of his former
labors in the whole course of his ministry; which He had intended (if God had
permitted) to have fitted, and prepared for the press. But being prevented of
this his purpose by a long and tedious sickness, and much weakness growing upon
him, and at last by Death it self; he finished only these six, which are now
presented to view; and authorized under his own hand for those which he allowed
of as his, Exclusively to any other besides: and committed them to our care
alone for the management of the publishing of them: which accordingly we have
endeavored to do with all fidelity.

The Book is not unfitly styled (and that by the Author himself) a Chain of
Principles. For such is the Nature of the Truths propounded in it; as in order
to other Points of Divinity, which are founded upon them, so likewise to the
Life of a Christian, which is much regulated by them in the right improvement
of them. Every Article of Christian Religion has somewhat in it of Principle
to a Gracious and Holy Conversation which it is carried and directed unto.
Hence 1 Timothy 3. 16. It is said, Great is the mystery of Godliness, God
manifested in the flesh etc. The Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection, Ascension
of Christ and the like they are all matters of Godliness: because that they
tend to Godliness in the Nature and Discovery of them, as also promote
Godliness in the true Compliance and closing with them.

It is called A Chain of Principles for sundry reasons likewise.

First, From the Connection, which they have one with another. For like as in a
chain there are diverse links joined together, and these in a mutual dependence
and concomitancy and subordination; Even so is it likewise with the Doctrines
and Principles of Christian Religion. They are connexed, and knit so together,
as that there cannot be a denial of one of them: but more will consequently
fall with it. Look as in things necessary to be done, there is a dependence and
connection of Commands, so that he, who breaks one Law is interpreted to break
all the rest, and to be guilty of an Universal transgression; because he sins
against that General Authority, whereby all the rest were given; so also in
things necessary to be believed; he that denies One Article of faith which is
offered to him by God to be received, denies the Faith 1 Timothy 5. 8.
it self in the latitude of it: as sinning against the General Veracity of him
that propounds it, and weakening all other Truths, which are dependent upon it.
Though perhaps in so doing, he may not always actually intend it.

Secondly, A Chain also for that special Concord and Agreement which it
breeds (and ought to breed) in those that profess it, notwithstanding all
collateral and circumstantial differences whatsoever. The Principles of
Christianity as they are united within themselves, so they do marvellously
unite those who do really and cordially embrace them, and make them to speak
the 1 Cor. 1. 10.
same thing that there be no divisions amongst them; But to be perfectly joined
together in the same mind, and in the same judgment: as the Apostle
expresses it. From thence it comes to pass, that there is so much disunion in
Affection because there is so much distraction in opinion. Whereas the Acts 4.
32.
Primitive Believers, whiles they were all of one Faith, they were answerably
all of one heart and of one soul; and so preserving the unity Ephesians. 4. 3.
of the spirit in the bond of peace.

Thirdly, A Chain also for the worth and dignity of it, Prove. 1. 9. They shall
be an ornament of Grace unto thine head, and Chains about thy neck. Persons of
Quality and Authority they are wont to wear their golden Chains wherewith they
are set out and Genesis 41. 42. Dan. 5. 29. Ezekiel. 16. 11.
adorned. It is the expression of Christ to his Church, Cant. 1. 10. Thy cheeks
are comely with rows of jewels. Thy neck with chains of Gold. And again,
Canticles 4. 9. Thou have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse, thou have
ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one Chain of thy neck. This
systeme and Body of Truth which is here in part commended unto us, is the
precious and glorious chain upon the neck of the true Spouse of Christ, which
makes her to look pleasingly, and amiably in the eyes of her Beloved, and
distinguishes her from all false and counterfeit lovers.

To all this we may finally add, what it is in the very work it self, and the
contrivances of it: wherein (not to anticipate the thoughts of others that
shall peruse it) soundness of judgment with elegancy of expression; Sublimity
of Notion with sobriety of spirit; Variety of reading with accurateness of
composure; Sweetness of wit with savouriness of heart, do seem to be linked
together in so rare, and happy a conjunction, as which makes this Chain of
Principles to be a chain of Pearls.

The Lord by his holy spirit set home the Truths in it upon the hearts of all
those who shall be made partakers of it. To him be Glory in the Church by
Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without end.

A Collection of the several Aphorisms and Exercitations contained in the
ensuing TREATISE.
APHORISM. I. Page 1. Man's blessedness consists not in a confluence of
wordly accommodations, which are all vanity of vanities; but in the fruition of
God in Christ, who only is the strength of our hearts, and our portion for
ever. EXERCITATION 1. Page 2. Psalm. 144. end opened. Blessedness what. Solomon's
scope in Ecclesiastes. Why he styles himself Coheleth. His testimony concerning
the creatures. Their threefold transcendent vanity. Intellectual
accomplishments brought under the same censure, by reason of the folly, enmity,
anxiety, and insufficiency that attend them. An apostrophie to the world.
EXERCITATION 2. Page 20. A gloss upon Psalm 36. 8. God in Christ a
soul-satisfying object. The circular motion of humane souls, and their only
rest. A threefold fullness of God and Christ opposite to the threefold vanity of
the creatures. EXERCITATION 3. Page 29. Two conclusions from Psalm 73. 25, 26.
The Psalmists case stated. The frequent complication of corporal and spiritual
troubles. How God strengthens his peoples hearts against their bodily
distempers; how under discouragements of spirit. The secret supports of saving
grace. What kind of portion God is to the Saints. A congratulation of their
happiness herein. EXERCITATION 4. Page 43. The first inference grounded upon
Isaiah 55. 1, 2. by way of invitation, backed with three encouragements to
accept it, viz. The fullness of that soul-satisfaction which God gives, the
universality of its tender, and the freeness of its communication. The second
by way of expostulation, and that both with worldlings and Saints. A conclusion
by way of soliloquy. APHORISM. II. Page 61. We are conducted, to the fruition
of God in Christ by Christian Religion, contained in the divine oracles of holy
Scripture. EXERCITATION 1. Page 61. The safe conduct of Saints, signified by
the pillar in Exodus, performed by the counsel of God himself, the abridgement
whereof we have in the doctrine of Christian Religion. How that tends to
blessedness. EXERCITATION 2. Page 72. The insufficiency of other Religions for
bringing men to the enjoyment of God inferred from their inability to discover
his true worship. John 4. 24. opened. God to be worshipped in and through
Christ a lesson not taught in natures school. Faults in Aristotle's Ethics.
EXERCITATION 3. Page 84. Oracles of God vocal, or written. Books of Scripture
so called in five respects, viz. In regard of their declaring and foretelling,
their being consulted, prized and preserved. EXERCITATION 4. Page 95. How
Scripture-Oracles far excel those of the heathen in point of perspicuity, of
piety, of veracity, of duration, and of Authority. The divine authority of
Scripture asserted by arguments. An inference from the whole Aphorism.
APHORISM III. Page 111. Scripture-Oracles, supposing it sufficiently clear by
the light of Nature, that there is a God, make a further discovery of what he
is in his Essence, Subsistence and Attributes. EXERCITATION 1. Page 111. 1 Corinthians. 15. 34. expounded. Opinionists compared to sleepers and drunkards.
Three observations from the end of the verse. What knowledge of God is
unattainable in this life. What may be had. The knowledge we have concerning
God distinguished into Natural, Literal, and Spiritual. EXERCITATION 2. Page
120. That there is a God, the prime dictate of natural light; deducible from
man's looking backward to the creation, forward to the rewards and punishments
dispensed after death, upward to the Angels above us, downwards to inferior
beings, within our selves to the composition of our bodies, and dictates of our
consciences, about us to the various occurrences in the world. EXERCITATION 3.
Page 129. Reasons three ways of discovering God fall short of manifesting what
he is. The expression in Exodus 3. 14. most comprehensive. A brief exposition
thereof. Satan's impudence. Nature and art both unable to discover the Trinity.
What Scripture reveals about it. Basils memento. Julians impiety. Socinians
branded. The three Persons compared to those three wells in Genes. 26.
EXERCITATION 4. Page 143. Divine Attributes calling for transcendent respect.
They are set down in the Scripture so, as to curb our curiosity, to help our
infirmity, to prevent our misapprehensions, and to raise our esteem of God.
Spiritual knowledge superadding to literal clearness of light, sweetness of
taste, sense of interest, and sincerity of obedience. APHORISM IV. Page 155.
Goodness and Greatness are Attributes so comprehensive, as to include a
multitude of divine perfections. EXERCITATION 1. Page 155. God described from
goodness and greatness both without and within the Church. A lively
pourtraiture of his goodness in the several branches thereof. Exodus 34. 6, 7.
Bowels of mercy implying inwardness and tenderness. Our bowels of love to God,
of compassion to brethren. Mercy not to be refused by unbelief, nor abused by
presumption. EXERCITATION 2. Page 169. Grace what. From it spring Election,
Redemption, Vocation, Sanctification, and Salvation. A Caveat not to receive it
in vain. It purges and cheereth. Glosses upon Tit. 2. 11, 12. and 2 Thessalonians. 2.
26, 27. The exaltation of free grace exhorted to. Longsuffering not exercised
toward evil Angels, but toward men of all sorts. It leads to repentance; is
valued by God, and must not be slighted by us. A dreadful example of goodness
despised. EXERCITATION 3. Page 181. The bounty of God declared by his benefits,
viz. giving his Son to free us from hell, his Spirit to fit us for heaven, his
Angels to guard us on earth, large provisions in the way, and full satisfaction
at our journeys end. John 3. 16. James 1. 5. and Psalm. 24. 1. Glossed. Isai.
25. 6. Alluded to. Inferences from divine Bounty, beneficence to Saints; not
dealing niggardly with God, exemplified in David, Paul, and Luther. Truth in
God is without all mixture of the contrary. It appears in his making good of
promises, and threatenings; teaching us what to perform and what to expect.
EXERCITATION 4. Page 201. Keeping mercy for thousands explained. Men exhorted
to trust God with their posterity. Luthers last Will and Testament. Iniquity
transgression and sin what. Six Scripture expressions setting out the pardon
thereof. Gods goodness therein. Faith and repentance the way to it. Pardon in
the Court of Heaven, and of Conscience. The equity and necessity of forgiving
one another. We are to forgive as God for Christ's sake forgiveth us, viz.
heartily, speedily, frequently, thoroughly. A twofold remembrance of injuries,
in cautelam and in vindictam. EXERCITATION 5. Page 223. The latter clauses of
Exodus 34. 7. so translated and expounded as to contain an eight branch of
divine goodness, viz. Clemency in correcting. Equity in visiting iniquities of
the fathers upon the children. Clemency in stopping at the third and fourth
generation. A lesson for magistrates. A speech of our Queen Elizabeth. Gods
proclamation in Exodus 34. Improved by Moses in Numbers 14. EXERCITATION 6.
Page 234. Job. 11. 7, 8, 9. expounded of divine Greatness. Three reasons of
that Exposition, with the resolution of a question about it. The height of Gods
universal, unaccountable, omnipotent Sovereignty proved and improved.
EXERCITATION 7. Page 253. The depth of Divine Omniscience seen in discerning
the deep things of man, yea of Satan, yea of God. Our Nescience discovered and
acknowledged. The longitude of Gods perfection stated. Eternity proper to him.
Not assumed by, or ascribed to men without blasphemy. EXERCITATION 8. Page 263.
Divine Immensity shadowed out by the breadth of the Sea. Divine Omnipresence
cleared and vindicated. The proposal hereof as an antidote against sinning in
secret. Five practical Corollaries from the greatness of God in general.
APHORISM. V. Page 277. The Goodness and Greatness of God are both abundantly
manifested by his decrees of Election and Preterition, together with his works
of Creation and Providence. EXERCITATION 1. Page 277. How predestination comes
to be treated of here. Election described from the Nature, Antiquity, Objects,
Products and Cause of it. Romans 11. 33. 2 Timothy 1. 9. with Tit. 1. 2. Ephesians. 1.
4. with Matthew. 25. 34. opened. Of Acts supposing their objects. Of acception of
persons, what it is; and that Predestination does not import it. Acts 13. 48.
Expounded and vindicated. Whether one Elect may become a reprobate? The
negative maintained, and 1 Cor 9. 24, 25, 26. cleared. Ephesians. 5. and 11.
enlightened. Concerning the good pleasure of Gods will and the counsel thereof.
EXERCITATION 2. Page 310. Preterition described. The term defended. Ephesians. 1.
4. compared with Revel. 17. 8. Ephesians. 1. 9. and Romans 9. 13. expounded. God not
bound to any creature, except by promise. The parable in Matthew. 20. urged. The
three consequents of negative reprobation. Dr Davenants Animadversions against
Mr Hoards book recommended. The goodness of God manifested in Election, as in a
most free, peculiar, ancient, leading, and standing favor. EXERCITATION 3.
Page 327. An Introduction to Romans 9. Most part of that chapter expounded,
together with sundry passages in chapter 10, and 11. for proof of these two
conclusions. 1. That Paul in Romans 9. does upon occasion propound and prosecute
the doctrine of Predestination. 2. That he derives the Decree of preterition
from the Sovereign greatness of God. A Consectary showing how useful the said
doctrine is to sober minds. EXERCITATION 4. Page 359. Creation what.
Pythagoras and Trismegist. Hebr. 6. 3. opened. Scripture-Philosophy. Ex nihilo
nihil fit, how true. Creature what. Gods goodness in works of creation,
particularly in the framing of Adam. The consultation upon which, pattern after
which, parts of which he framed. Two histories, one of a Priest, the other of a
Monk. The original of body and soul improved. EXERCITATION 5. Page 381. The
same and other attributes of God declared from his providential dispensations,
the interchangeableness whereof largely discoursed of and applied from
Ecclesiastes 7. 14. A gloss upon Isaiah chap. 10. 11. Cheerfulness a duty in
six respects; Crosses how to be considered. APHORISM VI. Page 400. Providence
extends it self, not only to all created beings and to all humane affairs,
especially those that concern the Church: but even to the sins of Angels and
men. EXERCITATION 1. Page 400. Introduction concerning the contents of this
Aphorism. Providence over all created beings. Preservation of men to be
ascribed to God himself, not to good men, yea not to good Angels, in whom

unto the good of the Saints. Isaiah 27. 2, 3. explained. The Church preserved
from, in, and by dangers. EXERCITATION 3. Page 438. Hard-heartedness made up of
unteachableness in the understanding, untractableness in the will,
unfaithfulness in the memory, unsensibleness in the conscience, and

and of this writer.
A CHAIN OF THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES, Or, An orderly concatenation of Aphorisms
and Exercitations, Wherein The chief heads of Christian Religion are asserted
and improved.
APHORISM I. Man's blessedness consists not in a confluence of wordly
accommodations, which are all vanity of vanities; but in the fruition of God in
Christ, who only is the strength of our hearts and our portion for ever.
EXERCITATION 1. Aph 1.
Psalm. 144. end opened. Blessedness what. Solomon's scope in Ecclesiastes. Why
he styles himself Coheleth. His testimony concerning the creatures. Their
threefold transcendent vanity. Intellectual accomplishments brought under the
same censure, by reason of the folly, enmity, anxiety and insufficiency that
attend them. An apostrophe to the world.
. 1. THis is a case, which has long since been determined by the Prophet
David, who in Psalm the hundred forty fourth, after he had twice charged
those, whom he calls strange children, with a mouth speaking vanity, once in
the eighth, and again in the eleventh verse, goes on to record (as good
Interpreters ancient and modern do conceive) Augustine. Genebrard. Ainsworth.
Jo. Baptist. Folengius in Psalm. 144.
the substance of their vain talk in a way of boasting about their flourishing
condition in reference to thriving of children, Our sons, say they, are as
plants grown up in their youth (not wishing they might, as we read it, but
boasting they were) our daughters as Exerc. 1.
corner-stones polished after the similitude of a palace; To plenty of
provision, Our garners are full affording all manner of store; To increase and
usefulness of cattle, Our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our
streets, Our oxen are strong to labor; To peace and tranquillity of estate,
There is no breaking in, nor going out, no complaining in our streets. Hereupon
they applaud themselves, and as placing their happiness in such outward
accommodations, say, as it is in the former part of verse the fifteenth, Happy
is the people that are in such a case. Beatum dixerunt populum cui haec sunt.
Which sense is extremely favored, not only by the vulgar Latin, inserting
Dixerunt, but also by the Septuagint, who render it by (...), both concur ring
to have it read, They pronounced the people blessed that were in such a case.
Then come in the last words according to this interpretation, as the Psalmists
resolution in the point, by way of Epanorthosis, or in express contradiction
rather to so gross a mistake, yea blessed are the people which have the Lord
for their God.

. 2. There is one center in which the desires of all men meet, however
distanced in the circumference; One port, for which they are all bound,
although embarked in several vessels, and affecting different winds to sail
by. That center and port is Blessedness, which may admit of this description.
It is the acquiescence of rational appetites in an object so full of real and
durable goodness, as to be able fully to satisfy all their longings. The
question debated in Ecclesiastes is, whether any thing under the sun be such an
object. The Preacher resolves it in the negative, by reason of that universal
vanity, which overspreads the whole creation. Therefore it is, that the eye
Eccles 1. 8.
(as he tells us) is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing,
because these two senses of discipline, when they have given their utmost
intelligence cannot present the soul. of man, with any created accommodations
perfectly good without defect, and perpetually good without decay. Solomon was
one that had both men and money at command, to assist him in making difficult
and costly experiments; a wise heart able to dive into natures secrets; a
peaceable reign, in which he met with nothing to take him off from the work, or
disturb him in it; strong inclinations and constant endeavors to find out the
utmost of what could possibly be discovered in any creature, yet he it is that
concludes, upon trial, not upon hearsay, or conjecture, Vanity of vanities,
Eccles 1. 1.
says Coheleth, vanity of vanities, all is vanity.

. 3. Coheleth, which is the style he gives himself in that Book, comes from a
root, that signifies to collect and gather, and, though it be of a feminine
termination, is, for want of a common gender in the Hebrew tongue, (as other
words of the like form) capable enough of a masculine construction. To him it
may be thought agreeable upon four different notions, each whereof contributeth
much validity to what he testifies. First as a Preacher, who having gathered
sundry arguments to convince the sons of men of the insufficiency of all things
below God himself to render them happy, in that Discourse speaks as to a
Congregation; whereas in the Proverbs he had spoken as to one man, frequently
using this compellation, My son. So Hierom, and Cajetan. Secondly as a writer,
who had collected into a Synopsis all the opinions of those, who had been taken
for wise men by their several followers concerning happiness, confuting such
as were erroneous. So Grotius. Thirdly as a Student, who had gathered much
wisdom by observation and experience, which he there gives demonstration of.
So Broughton. Lastly as a Penitent, who having by his gross idolatry and other
sins fallen from communion with the people of God, and being desirous to have
his return stand upon record, and to testify his repentance in that book, for
the Churches satisfaction gathers together many experiments of his own personal
folly, and makes an humble confession of them: whereupon he was restored, and
again gathered into the bosom of the Church. So Cartwright and Junius. The
witness we see is beyond exception.

. 4. In his Testimony, Vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities all is vanity,
the Assertion is repeated, as in Pharaohs dream, to show its certainty; and
the term of vanity doubled, partly to manifest the transcendency thereof, as
the most holy place was styled The Holy of Holies, and the most eminent
Canticle The Song of Songs: and partly to note the multiplicity, as Scripture
calls that the Heaven of Heavens, which, being highest, contains many heavens
within its circumference. For there is in the creatures a threefold
transcendent vanity; as may appear in that they are

First so unprofitable, as to be hurtful withal. Upon this the Preacher seems
to have had a special eye, because after All is vanity, he subjoyns
immediately What profit has a man of all his Eccles 1. 3.
labor, which he has taken under the sun? He has done nothing but filled his
hands as it were with air, who has been toyling all his days to replenish his
chests with wealth: And what profit Eccles 5. 16.
has he that has labored for the wind? Just so much, and no more, then that
Emperor got, who having run Septimius Severus.
through various and great employments, made this open acknowledgement, Omnia
sui, sed nihil prosuit, I have been all things, but it has advantaged me
nothing at all. Neither are they simply unprofitable, but this sore evil did
Solomon see under the sun, namely, Riches kept for the owners thereof to Eccles
5. 13.
their hurt. They often prove prejudicial to the outward man, exposing it to
danger. Who ever robbed a poor beggar, or begged a poor fool? more often to the
inward: whence that of Agur, Give me not riches, but feed me with Prove. 30. 8,
9.
food convenient for me; lest I be full, and deny thee, and say who is the
Lord? As if abundance made way for Atheism in those that know not how to
manage it. Plenty betrays many souls to slavery. Which made the good Emperor
Maximilian second of that name, when a mass of treasure was brought in, refused
to have it hoarded up, professing himself A keeper of men, not of Hominum ^on
opum mihi demandata est custodia; quibus si semel capiar illico e Rege servus
futurus sum. Beyerlinck. Apophtheg. Christian. page 210.
money, and fearing lest by falling into love therewith he should cease to be a
Sovereign Lord, and become a servant to the mammon of unrighteousness.

. 5. Secondly so deceitful as to frustrate expectation when men's hopes of
advantage by them are at the highest. Let him that would rightly conceive of
vanity (says a late Casuist) imagine the Idea of a thing made D. Sanders.
praelect. de Jurament. page 40. Jonah 2. 8.
up of nothing as the matter, and a lie as the form of it. Scripture speaks of
lying vanities, and uses the terms deceitful and vain as equipollent. Favor
(says Bathsheba) is deceitful, and Prove. 31. 30.
beauty is vain. The Poet interprets Vanus Virg. Aeneid. 2. carm. 80.
by mendax; and in old Latin vanare was the same with fallere. The creatures
are wont shamefully to frustrate men's hopes, and seldom or never make good to
the enjoyer what they promised to the expectant. Yea as Jonahs gourd (having
done him no service in the night, when he needed it not) withered in the
morning, when he hoped for most benefit by it against the ensuing heat of the
day: so the blessings of this world frequently wither at such times as we
looked to find the most freshness in, and refreshment from them. None but
Haman was invited with the King to Queen Esthers banquet; this filled his
bladder with windy hopes, which ended soon after in his ruin.

. 6. Thirdly so inconstant and mutable as to be gone all on the sudden without
giving their owners warning. That is said to be vain which vanishes. Man is
like to vanity, Psalm. 144 4.
his days are a shadow that passes away. Accordingly the two sons of the first
man carried in their names a memorandum of what they and their posterity were
to expect. Cain signifies possession, Abel vanity: All the possessions of this
world are of a vanishing nature, and liable to a speedy decay; or rather, they
are not Possessions but Quod mirari^ pompa est. Ostenduntur istae res, non
possid^ntur, and dum placent transeunt. Senec. epist. 110.
Pageants, which whilst they please us, pass away from us in a moment. Those
we have here are running banquets, delicate, and served in with state, but soon
over. How many does swift destruction snatch every day out of the arms of
worldly felicity, and stab to the heart at one blow! Behold Belteshazzar in the
midst of his cups and concubines struck into a deadly trembling. Herod, when
the people had newly invested him with a Godhead presently, ere it was well on,
had it pulled over his ears, and became a prey to worms. The rich man in our
Saviors parable invited himself to a feast of delicacy, and talked of
prosperity laid up for many years; but that very night was his soul required of
him to pay the reckoning.

. 7. These things duly weighed, I could not but be affected with that gallant
speech of a Christian writer, If P. De la serv's myrrhour p. 85.
the fruition of all the world were to be sold, it would not be so much worth
as the labor of ones opening his mouth only to say, I will not buy it: Yet
wondered less at it, when I remembered how much some even heathen Philosophers
have disdained Major sum, and ad majora genitus, quam ut mancipium sim
me^corporis. Senec. epist. 65.
to think of scraping to themselves an happiness out of the worlds dunghill,
how generously they have professed their living above such accommodations as it
affords. I am really greater (could Seneca say) and born to far greater things
then that I should become a slave to my outward man. For there are some higher
acquests gloried in by more sublimed flesh and blood, as much more conducing to
blessedness, I mean intellectual accomplishments of wisdom and learning. Yet,
as when the enquiry was Where shall wisdom be found and where is the place of
understanding? The Job 28. 13, 14.
depth said it is not in me, and the sea said it is not with me; So if the like
question be put concerning Happiness, worldly wisdom it self must return the
like answer, and say It is not in me, by reason of the folly, enmity, anxiety
and insufficiency that attend it, so as the Preacher might well determine even
of it, This is also vanity. Eccles 2. 15.


. 8. I. Folly. The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. So the
Apostle, 1 Cor. 3. 19.
who speaking elsewhere of those who bore the name of most knowing men, says
They became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart Romans 1. 21, 22.
was darkened, professing themselves wise, they became-fools. With men indeed a
little science may make a great show; but he only is wise in Gods esteem who
is wise to salvation. Give me a man as full of policy as was Achitophel, of
eloquence as Tertullus, of learning as the Athenians were in Paul's time; If
with Achitophel he plot against the people of God, with Tertullus have the
poison of asps under his lips, with those Athenians be wholly given to
superstition; for all his policy, eloquence, and learning, one may be bold to
call him fool in Scripture Language. The learned Logician, whom Satan daily
deceives by his sophistry, and keeps from offering up to God reasonable
service, is no better then a fool for all his skill: Nor the subtle
Arithmetician who has not learned to number his days that he might apply his
heart to saving wisdom: Nor the cunning Orator, who although he be of
singular abilities in the art of persuading men, is of Agrippa's temper himsef
but almost persuaded to be a Christian.

. 9. II. Enmity. The wisdom of the Romans 8. 7.
flesh is enmity against God. He that calls it so, found it to be so indeed
in his own experience; for Paul was no where more opposed then in Greece the
eye of Acts 17. v. 16. 18, 32.
the world, more derided then at Athens the eye of Greece. Whence it is that S.
James, not contenting himself with the epithets of earthly and sensual, James
3. 15.
brands it also with the name of Devilish wisdom. What else was Matchievel but
the Devils professor in politics, as Arius, Socinus, and such like masters of
error have been in Divinity? And of such Devilish wisdom what other issue can
be expected but that it should lead men to the Devil from whom it came? where
Bernard Sinete sapientes hujus seculi alta sapientes, and terram ^nge^ter
sapienter descendere in infernum. De vita solitar.
leaves them saying, Suffer the wise men of this world to go wisely down to
hell.

. 10. III. Anxiety. Wisdom is neither attained with ease, as requiring much
study which is a weariness to the flesh; neither does it, when attained,
administer ease, but the contrary rather: for when study has been midwife to
knowledge, knowledge becomes nurse to grief. Let Solomon speak; I gave my heart
to know wisdom, I perceived Eccles. 1. 17, 18.
that this also is vexation of spirit. For in much wisdom is much grief, and
he that increases knowledge increases sorrow. Many and dreadful are the
damps that seize upon such as dig deep in the mines of learning. Sharp wits
like sharp knives do often cut their owners fingers. The deep reach of a
prudent man makes him aggravate such evils as are already come upon him, by
considering every circumstance so as to accent every sad consideration, and
anticipate such as are yet to come, by galloping in his thoughts to meet them.
Had not Achitophel been so wise, as to foresee his inevitable ruin in the
remote causes of it, when Hushai's counsel was embraced, he would never have
made so much have, as he did, to hang himself.

. 11. Lastly Insufficiency to render men either holy or happy. For when the
worldly-wise have dived into the bottom of Natures sea, they are able to bring
up from thence in stead of these pearls of price, nothing but hands full of
shells and gravel. Knowledge indeed and good parts managed by grace are like
the rod in Moses his hand wonder-workers; but turn to serpents when they are
cast upon the ground, and employed in promoting earthly designs. Learning in
religious hearts like that gold in the Israelites earrings is a most precious
ornament: But if men pervert it to base wicked ends, or begin to make an idol
of it, as they did a golden calf of their earrings, it then becomes an
abomination. Doubtless these later times, wherein so many knowing men are of a
filthy conversation, and have joined feet of clay to their heads of gold, would
have afforded good store of additional observations to him that wrote the
famous book concerning the vanity of Sciences, which appears Corn. Agrippa.
in nothing more then their inability to produce suitable deportment in such as
enjoy them; without which there can be no solid foundation laid for true
happiness.

spirit.

EXERCITATION 2. A gloss upon Psalm 36. 8. God in Christ a soulsatisfying
object. The circular motion of humane souls, and their only rest. A threefold
fullness of God and Christ opposite to the threefold vanity of the creatures.
. 1. What shall we then say? Are the sons of men, in whom such strong desires
and longings after blessedness are implanted left without all possible means of
attaining that in which rational appetites may acquiesce? God forbid. They
shall be abundantly satisfied, with the fatness Psalm. 36. 7, 8.
of thy house, and thou shall make them drink of the river of thy pleasures: so
David to God concerning such as put their trust under the shadow of his wings.
Creature Comforts are but lean blessings in comparison, there is a fatness in
Gods house, such as satisfies, and that abundantly. They afford but drops,
Christ a river of pleasures. Look as when an Army of men comes to drink at a
mighty river, a Jordan, a Thames, Exerc. 2.
they all go satisfied away, none complaining of want, none envying another,
because there was water enough for them all: whereas had they come to a little
brook there would not have been found enough to quench the thirst of every one.
So here. The creatures are small brooks that have but a little water in them,
yea broken cisterns that hold Jerem. 2. 13.
no water: No wonder if souls return empty from them. But Christ has a river
for his followers, able to give them all satisfaction. We must not expect more
from a thing then the Creator has put into it. He never intended to put the
virtue of soul-satisfying into any mear creature, but has reserved to himself,
Son and Spirit the contenting of spirits as a principal part of divine
prerogative. To such as expect it elsewhere, that person or thing they rely
upon may say as Jacob did to Rachel, Am I in Gods stead? Genesis 30 2.


. 2. Certain it is that none can make our souls happy but God who made them,
nor any give satisfaction Neque enim facit beatum hominem nisi qui sent hominem
Deus. Aug. epist. 52.
to them but Christ who gave satisfaction for them. They were fashioned at
first according to the image of God, and nothing short of him who is styled the
brightness of his Fathers glory, and Heb. 1. 3.
the express image of his person can replenish Ad imaginem Dei facta anima
rationalis caeteris omnibus occupari potest, repleri non potest. Bernard. Sermon.
de bonis deserend.
them. As when there is a curious impression left upon wax, nothing can
adequately fill the dimensions and lineaments of it but the seal that stamped
it. Other things may cumber the mind, but not content it. As soon may a trunck
be filled with wisdom as a soul with wealth; and bodily substances nourished
with shadows, as rational spirits fed with bodies.

Whatsoever goodness creatures have is derivative, whatsoever happiness they
enjoy stands in reduction to the Original of their being. The motion of
immortal souls is like that of celestial bodies purely circular. They rest
not without returning back to the same point from whence they issued, which is
the bosom of God himself. Fishes are said to visit the place of their spawning
yearly, as finding it most commodious for them; and sick patients are usually
sent by physicians to their native soil, for the sucking in of that air from
which their first breath was received. Heaven is the place where souls were
produced; the spirit of man was at first breathed in by the Father of spirits,
and cannot acquiesce till he be enjoyed, and heaven in him.

. 3. Witness was born to this truth by the Amen, the faithful and true
witness, when speaking of those whom the Father had given him, he uttered that
remarkable assertion, This John 17. 3.
is life eternal that they may know thee, and Jesus Christ whom thou have
sent. Also when he made his followers that promise of rest, Come unto me all ye
that labor, Matthew. 11. 28, 29.
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, etc. and
ye shall find rest to your souls. God would not rest from his works of
creation till man was framed: Man cannot rest from his longing desires of
indigence till God be enjoyed. Now since the fall God is not to be enjoyed but
in and through a Mediator: Therefore when any man closes with Christ, and not
till then, he may say with the Psalmist, Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for
the Lord has dealt bountifully with thee. That which the King of Saints
testified will be most readily attested by all his loyal subjects. Enquire of
such as are yet militant upon earth, wherein their happiness consists, the
answer will be in their having fellowship with 1 John 1. 3.
the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. Let those who are triumphant be
asked what it is that renders their heaven so glorious, their glory so
incomprehensible, ye shall have no other account but this, it is because they
have now attained a complete fruition of that alsufficient, alsatisfying,
ever-blessed and ever-blessing object God in Christ.

. 4. Nor can it easily be denied by such as consider that in this object there
is found a threefold fullness, opposite to the threefold vanity in the
creatures, which I discoursed of before. First a fullness of utility opposite to
their unprofitableness. Infinite goodness extends it self to all cases and
exigents without being limited to particulars, as created bonity is. Hence in
the Scripture God and Christ are compared to things most extensive in their
use, and of most universal concernment. Philosophers look at the Sun as an
universal cause: Christ is called the Sun of Malac. 4. 2.
righteousness by the Prophet; and The Psalm. 84. 11.
Lord God, says the Psalmist, is a Sun and shield. In a Tree the root bears
the branches, and the branches fruit. Christ is both root and branch. A root in
Isaiah, In that day shall there be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an
ensign of Isa. 11. 10.
the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek, and his rest shall be glorious. A
branch in Zechariah, Behold I will bring forth my servant the Branch. In a
building the Zech. 3. 8.
foundation and cornerstone are most considerable in point of use. Christ is
both. Thus says the Lord God, behold I Isa. 28. 16.
lay in Sion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone,
a sure foundation. In military affairs what more useful for offense then the
sword, for defense then the shield? The Lord is both. Happy art thou O Israel
who is like Deuteronomy. 33. 29.
unto thee O people? saved by the Lord the shield of thy help, and who is the
sword of thine excellency. In civil commerce money is of most general use for
the acquiring of what men need, of which Solomon therefore says It answers
all Eccles. 10. 19. Quicquid nummis prasentibus opta, and veniet; clausum
possidet arca Jovem. Petron. Arbit.
things (whence it is that worldlings look at a full chest as having a kind of
Deity in it, able to grant them whatsoever their hearts desire) of God in
Christ it is most true. He only can answer all the desires, all the
necessities of his people; and is accordingly said to be their silver and gold
as Junius renders the place in Job. To him a soul may not only say as Thomas
did, My Job. 22. 25. Erit Omnipotens lectissimum aurum tuum, and argentum,
vire^que tibi.
Lord and my God, but as another, Deus meus and omnia, My God and my all.

. 5. Secondly a fullness of truth and faithfulness opposite to their deceit. The
creatures do not, cannot perform whatsoever they promise, but are like
deceitful brooks, frustrating the thirsty travelers expectation. We read of
Semiramis that she caused this Motto to be engraven upon her tomb, If any King
stand in need of money, let him break open this monument. Darius, having
perused the inscription, ransacks the sepulcher, finds nothing within, but
another writing to this effect, Had thou not been unsatiably covetous, thou
would never have invaded a monument of the dead. Such are all the things of
this world. They delude us with many a promising Motto, as if they would give
us hearts ease; but when we come to look within, instead of contentment, afford
us nothing but conviction of our folly in expecting satisfaction from them.
With God it is otherwise. He is faithful that promised, says the Apostle;
Heb. 10. 23.
And again, Faithful is he that 1 Thessalonians. 5. 24.
calls you, who also will do it. I am the way, says Christ of himself, the
truth John 14. 6.
and the life. In him believers find not less, but more then ever they looked
for; and when they come to enjoy him completely are enforced to cry out, as the
Queen of Sheba did, The half was 1 Kings 10. 7.
not told me.

. 6. Thirdly a fullness of unchangeableness opposite to their inconstancy. This
God challenges to himself, I am Malac. 3. 6.
the Lord, I change not; And Jesus Christ is said to be the same yesterday, and
to day, Heb. 13. 8.
and for ever. Another Apostle, speaking of the father of lights, from whom
descends James 1. 17.
every good and perfect gift, (therein alluding, as Heinsius conceives, to the
Heinsius in locum.
High Priest his Urim and Thummim, that is lights and perfections; to Urim in
these words father of lights, to Thummim in these Perfect gift) tells us that
with him is no variableness neither Exerc. 3.
shadow of turning. The metaphor is (...). Pareus in loc.
thought by some to be borrowed from the art of painting, wherein pictures are
first rudely shadowed; then drawn to the life. In the creatures we find a full
draught and lively pourtraiture of mutability; but not so much as the rudiments
of a draught, as the least line or shadow of it in God and Christ.

EXERCITATION 3. Two conclusions from Psalm 73. 25, 26. The Psalmists case
stated. The frequent complication of corporal and spiritual troubles. How God
strengthens his peoples hearts against their bodily distempers; how under
discouragements of spirit. The secret supports of saving grace. What kind of
portion God is to the Saints. A congratulation of their happiness herein.
. 1. FRom that patheticall passage in one of the Psalms, Whom have Psalm. 73.
25, 26.
I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.
My flesh and my heart fails; but God is the strength of my heart, and my
portion for ever. these two conclusions may be raised.

1. There is no person or thing in heaven or earth short of God in Christ to be
looked upon and desired as our utmost good.

2. The fruition of God in Christ is able to make and to continue a man happy
even in the midst of utmost extremity.

The former I have treated of in the foregoing exercitations, intending to
handle the latter in this. That I account an utmost extremity as to kind,
(though as to degrees it may be either more intense or more remiss) when there
is a complication of sufferings both in body and mind at once. Such was the
Psalmists case here. It is not flesh alone, or heart alone, but my flesh and my
heart, in conjunction, both failed him at one and the same time. Such is the
sympathy of soul and body, that when it fares ill with one, the other commonly
is disturbed. If the soul be in an agony, the body languisheth. Satan's
buffeting Paul with blasphemous thoughts, as some conceive, proved a thorn to
his flesh. On the other 2 Cor. 12. 5. (...).
side, if the outward man be tormented, the inward is wont to be dismayed, even
to failing of heart. The Stoics indeed, those magnificent boasters, talk of an
Apathie, and Plutarch tells us that Agesilaus, when he lay sick of the gout,
and Carneades, who came to visit him, observing what pains he conflicted with,
was about to leave him as one not in case to be spoken to, bad him stay, and
pointing at once to his own feet and to his heart said, Nothing Mane Carneades,
Nihil enim illine huc pervenit.
comes from thence hither; as if his mind were no whit disquieted for all the
sufferings of his flesh. But far better men then any of them have born witness
to the contrary. Our flesh had no 2 Cor. 7. 5.
rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were
fears. So Paul. David in one of his Psalms thus, O Lord heal me, for my bones
are Psalm. 6. 2, 3.
vexed; my soul also is sore vexed. In another thus, There is no soundness in
my Psalm. 38. 7, 8.
flesh; I am feeble and sore broken, I have roared by reason of the
disquietness of my heart.

. 2. But as when Peter walking upon the waves, and perceiving how boisterous
the winds were, began to sink, Jesus immediately stretched forth his hand and
caught him: So when the Psalmists flesh and heart failed, God even then was the
strength of his heart; according to the Original The rock of it. Rocks are not
more fortifying to Cities and Castles built upon them, then God is to his
peoples hearts. A sincere believers soul is therefore assimilated by our
Savior to an House Matthew. 7. 25.
founded upon a rock; which was every way assaulted, in the roof by rain
descending upon that, in the foundation by floods washing upon it, in the walls
by winds blustering against them; and yet stood because it was strong, was
strong because founded on a rock. Such a rock is our God, and that even in such
a case as has been described.

. 3. Hezechiah whom God had Isa. 38. 1.
chosen to life, was sick unto death. Lazarus whom Jesus loved, sickned John
11. 3.
and died. Timothy had his often infirmities. 1 Timothy 5. 23.
The Psalmists flesh failed him, or, to speak in Paul's phrase, his outward man
perished; yet God meanwhile 2 Cor. 4. 16.
was the rock and strength of his sick servants heart. First by preserving
therein an expectation of such fruit as saints use to reap from such trials.
Fruit which relates partly to sin and partly to grace. To sin by way of cure.
Diseases when sanctified drain the inward as well as the outward man, and help
to spend out the bad humors of both. Sickness (says Isidore) wounds the
flesh, but heals Adversa corporis remedia sunt animae. Aegritudo carnem
vulnerat, mertun curat. Isidor. l b 3. de Sum. bono.
the mind; is the bodies malady, but the souls medicine. For instance,
weakness kills the itch of worldliness. Let pleasure open all her shops, and
present a sick man with her choicest rarities: Let Mammon bring forth all his
bags and gingle them in his ears; produce all his Crowns, Sceptres, Mitres, and
lay them at his feet, how ready will he be to cry out, Away with them. Behold I
am at the point to die (as Esau once reasoned) and what Genesis 25. 32.
can these vanities profit me? The like may be said of self-confidence and
pride which are also frequently antidoted by diseases. A special end (as Elihu
tells Job) which God aims at in his chastening with pain is to hide Job 33 17.
pride from man, that is, to remove it, as what we hide is removed out of
sight. A Christian Emperor, one of the Ferdinands, Ab. Scultetus Idea Concion.
in Isaiae cap. 9. page 1. 7 In agone Invistissimi titulum agnos^e^e no^bat, etc.
when his Chaplain Matthias Cittardus came to visit him as he lay upon his
deathbed, and according to the mode of the Court styled him most Invincible
Emperor, finding himself overcome with sickness, would not admit of that
compellation, but charged him not to use it more: whereupon the Chaplain made
his next address on this wise, Go to dear brother Ferdinand, endure hardship as
a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

. 4. Next to Grace, in point of growth. The rise of grace is sometimes
occasioned by a sore disease. Beza tells Morbus isle verae sanitatis
principium, etc. Epist. praefix. Confessioni.
us of himself, that God was pleased to lay the foundation of his spiritual
health in a violent sickness which befell him at Paris. The growth of grace is
always promoted when God makes use of this means. It is not more usual with
children to shoot up in length, then with Christians to wax taller in grace in
or after a sickness. See it exemplified in the famous Protestant Divines:
Olevian said upon his deathbed, In this disease I have learned to know Mel.
Adam. in vitis Germ. Theol. p 601.
aright what sin, and what the majesty of God is. Rollock upon his, I am not
ashamed Idem in vitis Exterorum. page 189.
to profess that I never reached to so high a pitch in the knowledge of God, as
I have attained in this sickness. Rivet upon his, Danberi Orat. funeb. in
excessum Andreae Riveti page 90.
In the space of ten days since I kept my bed, I have learned more, and made
greater progress in Divinity, then in the whole course of my life before.

. 5. Secondly by infusing and exciting a principle of Christian patience, which
is therefore able to support and strengthen the heart when Philosophical
Stoical patience cannot do it; because it self is strengthened from such divine
Topics, as Philosophy knows but little, if any thing, of. I shall instance in
two, The pains of hell deserved by us, and the pains of Christ endured for us.
Well may the consideration of Hell Torments due to us all, as being by nature
children of wrath, conduce to the working of patience in us under these petty
sufferings in comparison. For what are these rods to those scorpions? A fever
to those everlasting burnings? The stone or gout to that fire and brimstone? A
sickbed to Hell, where the fit never goes off, the fire never goes out, the
worm Mark 9. 44.
never dies? So also when upon our beds of sickness we think of that garden
wherein Christ lay prostrate upon the ground, in our fits of his Agony, in our
sweats of his water and blood; the consideration of his torments, and of our
interest in them, may well mitigate the sense of our present sufferings, if not
wholly swallow them up, as Aarons rod devoured those of the magicians. Art thou
afflicted with sore pain in this or that part? He had hardly any member free.
Are thy spirits feeble and faint? His very soul was exceedingly Matthew. 26. 38.
sorrowful even unto death. Do thou cry My God, my God, why have thou
afflicted me? Jesus cried with a loud voice, My God, my God, why have thou
Matthew. 27. 46.
forsaken me?

. 6. Yea but how manifest soever it be that when the flesh fails the heart
may be strengthened, how the heart it self should fail and yet be strengthened
is not so evident. I am therefore to make it appear in the next place; that
these two clauses, My heart fails, and God is the strength of my heart, may
both be verified at once without a paradox in different respects. By reason of
remainders of unbelief in the most regenerate on this side heaven, when Satan's
temptations shall strike in with their corruptions, holy men may be induced in
a fit of dejection because the Lord has cast them down, to conceive and say he
has cast them off. David once said, I had fainted, unless I had believed to
Psalm. 27. 13.
see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Such fainting flows
from not believing; such unbelief is much fomented by not considering that (as
no outward blessing is good enough to be a sign of eternal Election, seeing
God often fills their bellies with hid treasure, who treasure up to
themselves wrath against the day of wrath, so) no temporal affliction is bad
enough to be an evidence of Reprobation; seeing the dearest son of Gods love
was a man of sorrows, and acquainted Isa. 53. 3.
with grief. Yet may the same heart at the same time be strengthened from
another cause, namely God, who easily can, and usually does supply such
effectual grace as is able to keep the head above water, when the rest of the
body is under it, able to preserve the Spouse in a posture of leaning upon her
Cant. 8. 5.
beloved in a wilderness; to make one with Abraham believe in hope against Romans
4. 18. Job 13. 15.
hope, and say with Job, Though he kill me, yet will I trust in him. Faith can
support when Nature shrinks; call God father when he frowns; and make some
discovery of a sun through the darkest cloud. When it sees no light it may feel
some influence, when it cannot close with a promise, it may lay hold upon an
attribute, and be ready to make this profession, Though both my flesh and my
heart fail, yet divine compassions fail not. Though I can hardly discern at
present either sun, or moon or stars, yet will I cast anchor in the dark, and
ride it out till the day break. Time was when Jonah said, I am cast out of thy
sight, but Jonah 2. 4, 7.
added with the same breath, yet will I look again toward thy holy temple; and
presently after, when my soul fainted within me, I remembered the Lord, etc.

. 7. The connection of these words in the psalm My heart fails, but God is
Quaecunque me angustiae corporis aut animae urunt, Tu meo anims es robur, dum
te aeternam mihi haereditatem fore spero. Simmius in Psalm. 73.
the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever, may seem to imply some such
thing; to wit that in times of languishment, God affords a strengthening
support in secret by encouraging a believer to wait upon himself as his portion
for ever, notwithstanding all his sufferings for the present. There can be no
better, or more sovereign cordial then this, if we consider the sutableness,
and sufficiency of God to this purpose. In the choice of a portion as of a
wife, fitness is chiefly to be regarded; she is a wife indeed, who is a meet
help, that a portion indeed, which is suitable to the soul of man. God only is
so. For the soul is a spiritual and immortal substance, therefore to her
worldly accommodations are unsuitable, because they are, most of them
corporeal, All of them temporal. But God who is a Spirit, and who only John
4. 24.
has immortality, fits her exactly in both respects. The uncreated Spirit
becomes a portion for ever to this his everlasting 1 Timothy 6. 16.
creature. As for sufficiency, the souls appetite is too vast for any creatures
to fill up the measure of its capacity: but when she has once pitched upon God
self-sufficient in his being, all-sufficient in his communications, she then
has enough, and is ready to profess with David, The Lord is the portion of
Psalm. 16. 56.
mine inheritance and of my cup: the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant
places, yea I have a goodly heritage. Indeed what can one wish in an heritage
that is not to be found in God? Would we have large possessions? He is
immensity. A sure estate? He is immutability. A long term of continuance? He is
Eternity it self. I shall therefore shut up this with a serious congratulation
to the Saints, and an high applause of their blessedness. Happy, thrice happy
you, dearly beloved in the Lord, Quid potest co esse selicius cujus efficitur
suus conditor census; and haered^tas ejus dignatur esse ipsa Divinita^? Prosper
de vit. contemplat. lib. 2. cap. 16.
because when those men of the world which have their portion in this life, as
David speaks, part with theirs (as they must all do at death, if not before)
you are led to a fuller fruition of your portion. Theirs at the best is but
some good blessing of God, that will in time be taken from them; yours is the
good God himself, blessed and blessing you for ever. He is so at present, and
he will be so to all eternity; A portion of which you can never be plundered.
Impoverished you may be, but not undone; discouraged, but not disinherited.
Your flesh perhaps, yea and your hearts too may fail, but God will be the
strength of your hearts, and your portion for ever. I shall add no more, but
only reminde you of what is written in the hundred forty and sixth Psalm,
Happy is he that Psalm. 146. 5.
has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God.

EXERCITATION 4. Exerc. 4.
The first Inference grounded upon Isaiah 55. 1, 2. by way of invitation,
backed with three encouragements to accept it, viz. The fullness of that
soul-satisfaction which God gives, the universality of its tender, and the
freeness of its communication. The second by way of expostulation, and that
both with worldlings and saints. A conclusion by way of soliloquy.
. 1. IN the synagogues of old upon the eighth day of the Feast of Tabernacles,
called by the Jews Hosanna Rabbah the great Hosanna, and by the Evangelist, The
last day, the great day of Jos. 7. 37. vid. Ludov. de Dieu in loc.
the feast, four portions of Scripture were wont to be read. viz. The close of
the fifth book of Moses, called Deuteronomy, the last words of the Prophet
Malachy, the beginning of Joshua, and that passage concerning Solomon's rising
up from his knees after his prayer, and blessing the people with a loud voice
in the eighth chapter of the first book of Kings. Then did Jesus, who was the
end of the Law and the Prophets, the true Joshua and Solomon stand up saying,
If any man thirst, let him John 7. 38.
come unto me and drink. He that believes on me, as the scripture has said,
out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. But why did he then speak
of waters? Tremellius gives this account of that out Annot. in loc.
of the Talmud. The Jews, says he, upon that day used with much solemnity and
joy to fetch water from the river Siloah to the Temple, where being delivered
to the Priests, it was by them poured upon the altar, the people in the mean
time singing out of Isaiah, With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells Isa.
12 3.
of salvation. Our Savior therefore to take them off from this needless, if
not superstitious practice, tells them of other and better waters, which they
were to have of him, according to what he had elsewhere said by the ministry
of the same Prophet in these most emphatical words, Ho every one Isa. 55. 1, 2.
that thirsts come ye to the waters; and he that has no money, Come ye, buy
and eat; yea Come; buy wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore
do ye spend money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which
satisfies not? Words that, besides an intimation of the forementioned truths
concerning the creatures inability, and the sufficiency of God in Christ to
satisfy souls, clearly hold forth a double improvement thereof, one by way of
invitation, the other by way of expostulation.

. 2. The Invitation is set on with vehemence and importunity, Ho come, but as
not content with that, he doubleth it, yea Come ye, and tripleth it, yea Come.
Not Come and look on, or Come and cheapen, but Come and buy, buy and eat. They
may be rationally said to Come who frequent the Ordinances, wherein Christ is
usually to be found; They to buy, who part with somewhat, are at some cost and
pains in pursuit of him; They to eat, who feed on him by a lively faith.
Careless wretches will not so much as vouchsafe to Come, by reason of their
oxen, or farms, or some other impediment, the Lord must have them excused.
Formal professors Come indeed, but refuse to Buy, will lay out no serious
endeavors in searching the Scriptures and their own deceitful hearts, but are
merely superficial in such undertakings. Temporary believers (whose hearts are
really, though not savingly wrought upon) seem to have bought, yet do not eat,
for want of that spirit of faith, which ingrafts men into Christ, and makes
them as truly one with him as the body is with the meat it feeds upon. Want we
encouragements to accept of this invitation? The place it self presents us with
three.

. 3. One from the fullness of that satisfaction which is here tendered under the
metaphors of water, wine, milk, and bread: the last whereof is implied partly
in those terms of opposition, For that which is not bread, as if he had said,
ye might have had that of me which is bread indeed, partly in the verb Eat,
which cannot so properly be applied to any commodity here mentioned, water,
wine, and milk being liquids, as to bread. Now there is somewhat in Christ to
answer each of these. His flesh is bread, his blood is wine, his John 6. 51.
Matthew. 26. 28, 29. John 7. 38, 39. 1 Pet. 2. 2.
Spirit is waters, his doctrine is milk. But because I conceive the Holy Ghost
in this place does not so much intend a parallel of these, as a declaration of
that sufficiency which is to be found in Christ and his benefits for saving to
the utmost of all those that shall come unto God by him; I shall only pitch
upon that consideration, and by adding unto this a like place in the
Revelation, briefly demonstrate from them both how all-sufficient a Savior he
is. This in Isaiah holds forth somewhat proper to every sort of true believers.
Milk for babes, water for such Vinum Lac senum.
as are young and hot, wine for the aged, bread for all. The other is that of
Christ to the Angel of the Church of Laodicea, I counsel thee to buy of me gold
Rev. 3. 18.
tried in the fire that thou may be rich, and white raiment that thou may
be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear, and anoint thine
eyes with eye salve that thou may see, where he commends his gold for such as
is tried in the fire, his raiment for such as will take away shame, and his
eye salve for a special virtue to make the blind see. Take them together, and
there is in them enough to supply our principal defects, viz. unbelief in the
heart for which there is here gold tried in the fire, whereby we may probably
understand the grace of faith, concerning which we read in Peter, That the
trial of your faith, 1 Pet. 1. 7.
being much more precious then of gold that perishes, though it be tried with
fire, might be found unto praise. And unholiness in the life, for which there
is the white raiment, if by it we understand inherent righteousness, according
to that in the Apocalypse, To her was granted that she Rev. 19. 8.
should be arraied in fine linen, clean and white, for the fine linen is the
righteousness of the saints. Lastly Ignorance in the mind, for which there is
his Eye Salve to remove it, according to the Apostles prayer for his Ephesians,
that God would give them the spirit of wisdom Ephesians. 1. 17, 18.
and revelation, the eyes of their understanding being enlightened etc.

. 4. A second encouragement is from the universality of this offer. Ho every
one that thirsts come; so he do but thirst he shall be welcome, how unworthy
soever he may be in other respects. Dabit desideranti gratiam, qui dat gratiam
desiderii.
He will give grace to the thirsty, who enables them to thirst after grace.
Christ is far from turning such persons away; yea but for such he would have no
customers in the world; his commodities must lie by him dead for want of vent;
seeing others will not take them off, but leave them still upon his hand, as
things in which they see no need, have no esteem of. This let all men know for
certain, that such as thirst so as to come, come so as to buy, buy so as to
eat, will never have cause to repent of their bargain. I have somewhere read of
a great Commander, who being extremely tormented with thirst, sold himself and
his Army into enemies hands for a draught of cold water; which when he had
drunk he repented and said. Oh quantum ob quantillum! How very little is that
for which I have parted with so very much! Believers may take up the like
words, but in a far different sense: O how much grace, how much happiness have
I got for a little thirsting, a little trusting in Jesus Christ!

. 5. A third from the freeness of communication, amply declared in this clause,
Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. In the place hitherto
insisted upon, the word money occurs thrice, twice in the first verse and once
in the second, but not in the same signification. In the first it is clearly
interpreted by price and signifies merit; They are said to have no money, who
being conscious to themselves of their having nothing of their own to answer
divine justice with, to fetch them in pardon, peace and righteousness, wholly
disclaim all self-sufficiency, and come unto Christ as to one that expects not
to receive but to be received; looks for little or nothing from us but that we
be nothing in our selves, desirous to have all from him, and to partake of his
fullness grace for grace. In the second it is expounded by labor, and denotes
industry. Men are said to spend money for that, which they lay out their pains
about. Money answers all, says the Preacher: The Heathens have a proverb
Eccles 10. 19. D^i laboribus om^ia vendunt.
which ascribes as much to labor. We say not with them, that God sells his
benefits to us for our pains; but this we acknowledge, he gives them so as to
require our industry about them. Yet is not this any prejudice to the freeness
of his grace, or any contradiction to that clause Buy without money and without
price, because our labor can no way merit his blessings. As when a
Schoolmaster teaches a boy gratis, the youth cannot possibly attain to
learning unless he be industrious, and take pains at his book; but it does not
therefore cease to be free on the teachers part, because the learners pains are
required. So it is here.

Yet some in all ages have been so vain as to dream of bringing their money
with them whenever they come; I mean that, which if not in it self, yet in
their opinion seems to deserve what they come for. So the Pharisees of old, and
the Papists of late. Insomuch as Cornelius a lapide in his comment Emptio est
dispositio liberi arbitrii.
upon this very place, which makes altogether for the contrary doctrine,
countenanceth the popish tenants of free will and merit of congruity. Emitur
pretio non condigno, sed congruo.
So Elephants, they say, are wont before they drink to bemud the water, which,
if it were suffered to remain clear, would discover their deformity to them.

. 6. I proceed to the Expostulation contained in the next words, Wherefore do
ye spend money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which
satisfies not? Words applicable both to worldlings, and to such believers as
have not yet got clear of the world. First to worldlings, who manifestly spend
not their money only, but their souls for that which is not bread. In the
Lords prayer Bread is put for all necessaries, and used in the Lords supper to
signify the absolute necessity of receiving Christ, by whom spiritual life is
supported, as the natural life is by bread. Now the accommodations doted upon
by men of the world, and often purchased with the loss of salvation are justly
said not to be bread, because they are neither absolutely necessary to be had,
nor able to support such as enjoy them. A man's life, says our Savior,
consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses. Luke 12. 15.
Wealth indeed is an accessory good, but no necessary blessing. None are made
really happy by it (though Latinists use the same word Beatus to signify both
rich and blessed) A Christian may be happy without it; really happy, yea and
really wealthy too, for he is abundantly rich that possesses Assatim dives est
qui cum Christo pauper.
Christ in the midst of poverty; and does not make treasure his God, as the
servants of Mammon do, but God his treasure.

. 7. Furthermore, as the expression there is, They spend their labor for that
which satisfies not. A late Jesuit Cornel. a lapide Comment. in Isa. 55. 2.
tells us a story of a feast made in Germany by a certain Magician for Noble
men, who whilst they sat at table with him received good content, and fared
to their thinking very deliciously, but when they departed found themselves
hungry, as if they had eaten nothing at all: which indeed was their case; if
the Jesuits relation of the magicians art and fact may be credited. Such
entertainment does this present world afford its principal guests. They are not
fed with satisfying substances, but with deluding shadows rather. Surely every
man walks in Psalm. 39. 6.
a vain show, surely they are disquieted in vain. David speaks it of such as
heap up riches: of whom also Solomon says, The rich man's wealth is his strong
city, and Prove. 18. 11.
as an high wall in his own conceit. A strong city in his conceit, but indeed a
castle in the air. One that applies the scaling ladders of Scripture and reason
to such walls, may easily climb so high as to reach and pull down those
ensigns of vanity, which makes such a flourish on the battlements thereof.
Sooner shall men gather grapes of thorns and figs of thistles, then find that
a fountain of all good to any soul, the love whereof Paul has branded for the
root of all 1 Timothy 6. 9. 10.
evil. It drowns in perdition; how can it then crown with happiness? Oh that
ever so rich an heir, as the soul of man, should run away with so servile a
thing as money is, or give the least consent to a match so far below her birth
and breeding!

. 8. Let authority be added to wealth, and great honors to great revenues, yet
will the product of both sums be not soul-satisfaction and blessedness, but
vanity and vexation of spirit. How often is the sword put into mad men's hands,
the bramble advanced to rule over better trees, and walls of mud shined upon
while marble pillars stand in shade? How often do goats clamber up the
mountains of preferments whilst the poor sheep Ambitio te ad dignitatem nisi
per indigna non ducit. Senec. Natural. quaest. in Praefat. lib. 1. Ambitio
charitatis simia. Charitas patiens est pro aeternis, ambitio pro terrenis.
Didac. Stella de Contemptu mundi part. 1. page 88.
of Christ feed below? yea how often is greatness acquired by base, and
confounded by weak means? Flattery held Absolons stirrup. He that is every ones
master now, was a while since at every ones service. Well might Stella call
Ambition, Charities ape; for it also believes all things, hops all things,
yea and bears all things too till what it hoped for be attained, then grows
intolerable it self. It may further be observed that God usually takes a
course to break the staff of such pride by confounding the power of worldly
Potentates, not with Lions and Tigres, but as Pharaohs of old, by frogs and
lice. The Apostle I remember says An Idol is nothing, and yet the silversmiths
cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. Diana then was a great nothing.
Such are those men of place idolized by common people, when the Lord begins to
blow upon them in his wrath, like those nobles of Idumea concerning whom Isaiah
said, All her Princes shall Isa. 34. 12.
be nothing.

. 9. Secondly, as for those saints whose wings are still somewhat clogged with
the birdlime of this world, I humbly desire them to consider, how ill it
becomes the offspring of heaven to go licking up the dust of this earth, the
woman's seed to content it self with the serpents food; Any one of the posterity
of Japhet, after he has been persuaded into the tents of Sem, to bring on
himself Canaans curse, A servant of servants shall thou be, by subjecting his
soul to that, which God made to serve its servant the body. Verily if this
present world, or any thing in it be over precious in thy sight, O Christian,
thou Cujus anima in oculis ejus est pretiosa, in ejus oculis mundus est parvus.
Dictum Hebraeorum apud Buxtorf. in florileg. p. 225. Pecuniam habes? vel
teipsum, vel pecuniam vilem habeas necesse est. Senec.
art become vile in the eyes of God, yea in thine own: for none can set an high
price upon things without him till he have first undervalued his soul. Time was
when Satan showed our Savior all the kingdoms of this world, and the glory of
them. If ever the world appear unto thee temptingly glorious, suspect it for
one of Satan's discoveries. Sure I am the Scripture uses diminishing terms when
it speaks of creature comforts; as in styling the pomp of Agrippa and Act. 25.
23. 1 Joann 1. 17.
Bernice much fancy, no reality; in calling men's temporal estates this worlds
Matthew. 13. 22
goods, not theirs but the worlds, deceitful 1 Timothy 6. 17. Habak. 2. 6. Amos
2. 7.
and uncertain riches, thick clay, and dust of the earth, wind, grass and the
flower of grass, the least things, hardly things. Solomon Eccles 5. 16. James
1. 11. Luke 16. 10. 15.
brings them down to the lowest degree of entity, yea to nullity, saying,
Labor not to be rich, will thou set Prove. 23. 4, 5.
thine eyes upon that which is not?

. 10. Let Diotrephes then say, It is good for me to have the preeminence,
Judas, It is good for me to bear the bag; Demas, It is good for me to embrace
this present world. But do thou, O my soul, conclude with David, It is Psalm.
73. 28.
good for me to draw near to God. Thou art now as a bird in the shell, a shell
of flesh, which will shortly break, and let out the bird: This crazy bark of my
body ere long will be certainly split upon the fatal rock of death; then must
thou its present pilot forsake it, and swim to the shore of eternity.
Therefore, O everlasting creature, see and be sure thou content not thy self
with a transitory portion. I do not Lord, thou know I do not. Of a small
handful of outward things I am ready to say, It is enough: but that which I
long so passionately for is a large heart full of God in Christ. Thou art my
sun, the best of creatures are but stars, deriving the luster they have from
thee: Did not thy light make day in my heart, I should languish for all them in
a perpetual night of dissatisfaction. There are within me two great gulfs, a
mind desirous of more truth, and a will capable of more good then finite
beings can afford; Thou only can fill them, who art the first truth, and the
chief good. In thee alone shall my soul be satisfied as with marrow Psalm. 63. 5.
and fatness, and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips.

APHORISM II. We are conducted, to the fruition of God in Christ by Christian
Religion, contained in the divine oracles of holy Scripture.
EXERCITATION 1. The safe conduct of Saints, signified by the pillar Exerc. 1.
in Exodus, performed by the counsel of God himself, the abridgement whereof we
have in the doctrine of Christian Religion. How that tends to blessedness.
. 1. THere is no possibility of arriving at Blessedness without a safe conduct,
nor at glory without guidance; No infallible guidance but by the counsel of God
himself. All which the Psalmist is like to have had in his eye, when in his
humble address to God he expresses himself in this manner, Thou shall guide me
with thy counsel, Aph. 2.
and afterward receive me to glory. The Psalm 73. 24.
husbands duty in relation to his wife is to be the guide of her youth. Such
Prove. 2. 17.
has Christ (one of whose names is Counselor) been to his Church in former
Isa. 9. 6.
times, is at this day, and will continue to the end of the world. In Exodus we
meet with the history of the Jewish Church, her youth, and her strange manner
of guidance; which when the Levites in Nehemiah came to Nehem. 9. 19.
commemorate they do it thus, Thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not
in the wilderness; the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day to
lead them in the way, neither the pillar of fire by night to show them light,
and the way wherein they should go. It was not only a seasonable act of mercy
to them in that age; but may be looked upon as an emblem of that safe conduct,
which the Church in all ages may expect from Jesus Christ. For as in that
cloudy-fiery pillar there were two different substances the sire and the cloud,
yet but one pillar. So there are two different natures in Christ, his Divinity
shining as fire, his Humanity darkening as a cloud, yet but one person. As that
pillar departed not from them by day or by night, all the while they traveled
in the wilderness. So whilst the Churches pilgrimage lasts in this world, the
safe conduct of Christ by his Spirit and Ordinances shall be continued. But as
at their entrance into Canaan, a type of heaven, the pillar is thought to have
been removed, because not mentioned in the sequel of the story, and because
when Israel passed over Jordan we read not of the pillar but the Ark going
before them; So when the Church shall arrive at heaven, her resting place, the
mediatory conduct of Christ is to cease, and the Ordinances, which are here of
use, to disappear.

. 2. Mean while this infallible counsel of God has been most effectually
administered by the Prophets and Apostles, especially by Christ himself, whose
words were such as led directly to everlasting bliss. Insomuch as when Jesus
said to the twelve will John 6. 67, 68.
ye also go away? Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go? Thou have the
words of eternal life. As if he had said, Go whither we will to other teachers,
we shall be sure not to meet with words of eternal life any where else. Such
are proper to Christ's school taught only by himself, and his underofficers:
whereof one has left this profession upon record, That which we have 1 John 1.
3.
seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us:
and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. So
the Disciple whom Jesus loved in his first epistle. Another this, I take you to
record this day, Act. 20. 26, 27.
that I am pure from the blood of all men: for I have not shunned to declare
unto you all the counsel of God. So Paul in his valedictory speech to the
Elders of Ephesus. Which he could not have said, had not the doctrine he
preached among them been sufficient to have led all his hearers to the fruition
of God in Christ, and therein to complete happiness. That by the counsel of God
he intended to decipher Christian Religion is manifest, because that was the
sum of all his ministry, as we find him declaring elsewhere, Having obtained
help of Act. 2^. 22, 27.
God, I continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great, saying none
other things then those which the Prophets and Moses did say should come: That
Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the
dead etc.

. 3. Counsel it is, and therefore styled sometimes mystery, and that a great
one, Without controversy great is 1 Timothy 3. 16.
the mystery of godliness. (...), of Religion, as others render it; meaning the
Christian, an epitome whereof follows, God manifest in the flesh and 1 Cor.
2. 6, 7.
sometimes wisdom, and that not among punies and novices, who see not into the
depth of things, but among them that are perfect. Sometimes, The wisdom of
(...). Just. Ma^t. Expos. fidei.
God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the
world, unto our glory. Which made an ancient writer affirm, that the mysteries
of our Religion are above the reach of our understanding, above the discourse
of humane reason, above all that any creature can comprehend. Yea it will be
found the Counsel of God himself, and not of man, if we do but consider a few
of its materials; viz. principles above the reach of man's wit, A resurrection
of the dead, a mystical union of all believers among themselves and to their
head; A Trinity of persons in one Essence, two Natures in one person; God
reconciled to men by the blood, men to God by the spirit of Christ, with others
of the like elevation. Doctrines contrary to the bent of man's will. As that of
original sin, which represents him to himself as a child of wrath, worthy,
before he see the light, of being cast into outer darkness. And that of
self-denial, which takes him off from confidence in his own abilities;
whereas proud Nature challenges a self-sufficiency, and will hardly be content
with less. Lastly, Promises and threatenings beyond the line of humane motives
and dissuasives, exhibiting to the sons of men, not temporal rewards and
punishments only, but the gift of eternal life and the vengeance of eternal
fire: Things which not any of the most knowing Lawgivers and Princes of this
world did or could hold forth, till the only wise God was pleased to reveal
and urge them in the sacred authentic records of Christianity.

. 4. Now Christian Religion promotes our guidance to the fruition we treat of
these two ways, viz. by discovering God in Christ, and by uniting to him, the
former it performs as Christian, the latter as Religion.

First as Christian it discovers God in Christ, which other Religions do not.
No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the
bosom of the John 1. 18.
Father he has declared him. So the Evangelist, or, as others think, the
Baptist. All things are of God, who has reconciled 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19.
us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given unto us the ministry of
reconciliation, to wit that God was in Christ etc. So the Apostle. The poor
Pagan knows neither God nor Christ, but ignorantly turns the truth of God
into a lie, worshipping creatures; and in stead of Christ is directed by his
Theology to the service of a middle sort of divine powers, called Demons, and
See M. Mede his Apostasy of the latter times. page 9, 10, and sequent.
looked at as Mediators between the celestial Sovereign Gods, whom the
Gentiles worship, and mortal men. The modern Jew acknowledges the true God of
his fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, but owneth not Jesus the son of Mary for
the true Christ; yea disowneth him so far, as not only to expect another
Messiah, but (if writers deceive us not) to blaspheme and curse him and his
followers. The deluded Mohammedan confesses one God, the Creator of heaven and
earth; yea conceives so well of the Lord Jesus, as not to suffer any Jew to
take up the profession of a Musulman, till he have first renounced his enmity
against Christ: yet will neither acknowledge his satisfaction, upon which our
salvation is founded, nor his Divinity by virtue whereof that satisfaction is
meritorious. Whereas the true and pious Christian is by his Religion taught to
say with Paul, in direct opposition to all the three forementioned sects, We 1
Cor. 8. v. 4, 5, 6.
know that an Idol is nothing in the world; and that there is none other God
but one. For though there be that are called Gods, whether in heaven or in
earth (as there be Gods many and Lords many) yet to us there is but one God the
Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom are all things, and we by him.

. 5. Secondly as Religion, (a term which both Austine and Lactantius derive a
religando because by the true Religion improved men's souls are tied and
fastened to the supreme Being) it unites us to God and to Christ. The graces of
union are especially Faith and Love; Christian Religion is made up of these
two. Kiss the Son, says David, Psalm. 2. 12.
which implies the affection of love; Blessed are all they that put their
trust in him, which holds forth an expression of faith. Hold fast the form of
sound 2 Timothy 1. 13.
words, says Paul, which thou have heard of me, in faith and love, which is in
Christ Jesus. Love is the fulfilling of the Law, faith the fulfilling of the
Gospel, both the fulfilling of Christian Religion. These two pipes being
rightly laid from a Christians soul to the fountain of living waters fetch in
from thence a daily supply of such grace as will certainly end in a fullness of
glory: whereas worldlings all the pipes of whose spirits are laid to cisterns,
broken cisterns that can hold no water, must needs continue empty still; and
for want of Christ (who is not seen but by those two eyes, nor embraced but by
those two arms) fall short of happiness, how eminent soever they may be in the
pursuit of by-ways. Thus to discover and to unite are acts of prerogative not
communicable to other professions. For to maintain (as some do) that a man may
be saved in an ordinary course (I meddle not with extraordinary dispensations,
but leave the secrets of God to himself) by any Religion whatsoever, provided
he live according to the principles of it, is to turn the whole world into an
Eden; and to find a Tree of life in every garden, as well as in the paradise
of God.

EXERCITATION 2. The insufficiency of other Religions for bringing men to the
enjoyment of God inferred from their inability to discover his true worship.
John 4. 24. opened. God to be worshipped in and through Christ a lesson not
taught in Natures school. Faults in Aristotle's Ethics.
. 1. IT has appeared already in part by what has been hitherto discoursed,
that as the other Patriarchs sheaves made obeisance to Joseph's, so other
Religions must bow down to Christianity, by name those three grand
competitours, Paganism, Judaisme, and Mahometisme: as also those other leading
books, by name the Talmud, the Alcoran, and the much applauded writings of
heathen Philosophers must all do homage to the Bible. Yet will it not, I
suppose, be unworthy of my pains and the Readers patience further to clear the
insufficiency of all exotic doctrines by an argument taken from divine
worship, to which I proceed by certain steps. Exerc. 2.


I. Religion is a thing which distinguishes men from beasts more then reason
it self does. For some brute beasts have appearances of reason, none of
Religion. Man is a creature addicted to Religion may perhaps be found as true a
definition, as that which is commonly received, Man is a living creature endued
with reason.

II. Some kind of Deity is acknowledged every where throughout the world, and
wherever a Deity is acknowledged, some kind of worship is observed. Should a
Synod of mere Philosophers be convented to consult about the matters of God, I
make no question but in the issue of their debates they would pronounce one
Anathema against Atheism, and another against Irreligion. Among the Romans
Parcus Deorum cultor and infrequens. Horat. lib. 1. Ode 34.
to worship sparingly was accounted the next door to being an Atheist.

III. None but the true God can discover what the true worship of God is. As
that glorious eye of heaven is not to be seen but by its own proper Desine cur
nemo videat sine Numine Numen Mirari; Solemn quis sine sole videt?
light; A million of torches cannot show us the Sun: so it is not all the
natural reason in the world that can either discover what God is, or what
worship he expects without divine and supernatural revelation from himself.

. 2. IV. Before the settling of Christianity and spreading the Gospel
throughout the world, many every where were unsatisfied concerning the worship
they performed, and inquisitive after some teacher who might help them therein
by his advice. This may be gathered not only from that, which was said by the
woman of Samaria in that dispute of hers with our John 4. 25. Donec in terris
apparuerit sacratior aliquis qui fontem veritatis aperiat, etc. Marsil. Ficinus
in vita Platonis. Vid. Livium Galan. praetar. page 8.
Savior about worship, I know that Messiah comes, which is called Christ:
when he is come, he will tell us all things. But also by what Ficinus reports
concerning Plato, to wit, that being asked by one of his scholars, how far
forth and how long his precepts were to be obeyed, he returned this answer,
Until there come a more holy one, by whom the fountain of truth shall be
opened, and whom all may safely follow.

V. The precepts and practice of such as teach and profess other Religions are
inconsistent with those Gospelrules which Christ and his Apostles have given
for the regulating of divine worship. Two whereof I shall instance in.

The first is that which fell from our Saviors own mouth, God is a Spirit,
John 4. 24.
and they that worship him, must worship him in Spirit and in truth. Where
Spirit in the latter clause seems to stand in opposition partly to the
formality of the Jews, who did so wholly addict themselves to outward
observances in a spiritless way, as to give our Savior occasion of saying,
well has Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people
honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. In vain do they
worship Mark 7. 6, 7.
me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. Partly to the Idolatry of
the Gentiles, who in stead of tendering service suitable to a spiritual Being,
worshipped God in and by representations and images of this or that visible
creature. The word Truth in like manner may probably seem to be opposed partly
to the typical worship of the Jews, in which there were many resemblances and
shadows of things to come, as sacrifices, incense and other rites, the truth
whereof was exhibited in Christ and in Gospel-service: partly to the
perfunctory worship of the Gentiles, who for want of Scripture Light framed to
themselves sorry forms of devotion, which the wisest among them were altogether
unsatisfied with, yet as knowing no better, and being loath to give offense,
observed them only for fashions sake, so worshipping in show, rather then in
truth.

. 3. Doubtless what Seneca professed in his time, was a principle, which the most
judicious Heathen walked by, both in that and the ages foregoing. He, speaking
of their religious observances, plainly said, A wise man Quae omnia saptens
servabit tanquam legibus jussa, non tanquam Diis grata. Sic adorabimus ut
meminerimus cultum magis ad morem quam ad rem pertinere etc. August. De Civit.
Dei lib. 6. cap. 10.
will keep them all as things commanded by our laws, not as things acceptable
to the Gods; for custom rather then conscience sake. Thereby showing (as
Austine observes) that he himself misliked what he practiced, and did not
approve his own adoration. What else was this but mock-worship? And although it
must be granted that some of them were more serious in that way of superstition
which the Gentiles Theology prescribed, yet was not their worship in Truth; for
being destitute of Christ, who is the way, the truth and the life, they John
14. 6. Psalm. 51. 6.
wanted that Truth in the inward parts, required by God in all holy services.
The Pelagians indeed were of opinion that those virtues which appeared in
heathen Philosophers and others of eminent note for morality, though they had
not received the knowledge of Christ, were true graces. But if Austin may be
credited, this above all their Hoc est unde vos maxim Christiana detestatur
Ecclesia. Contr. Julian. pelag. lib. 4. cap. 3.
corrupt tenants was that for which the Christian Church did most abominate
them and their doctrine. Yea Paul, whom we are bound to believe, in the fourth
Chapter of his epistle to the Ephesians, is thought to have concluded the
contrary: we find there the life of the Gentiles Ephesians. 4. verse. 17. 18. 21.
24.
clearly opposed to the life of God, which they, says he, were alienated from;
as also to the truth as it is in Jesus, and to that true holiness, or holiness
of truth wherewith every spiritual worshipper is endued. And so far is the
Apostle in that place from excepting their philosophers, that, as Grotius
thinks, he aims especially at them; because his phrase in the seventeenth
verse, That ye Vide Grotium in Ephesians. 4. 17. and in Romans 1. verse. 21, 22.
walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, is fully
parallel with that in his epistle to the Romans, They became vain in their
imaginations: which is certainly meant of their philosophers, for it follows
professing themselves to be wise (...) (the name whereby that sort of men were
commonly known, witness the seven wise men of Greece) before Pythagoras
invented that other of (...) lovers of wisdom, as more modest.

. 4. The second grand direction about the manner of worship is, that it be
performed in the name, and through the mediation of Jesus Christ, who says of
himself I am the way, No man Joh. 14. 6.
comes to the Father but by me: And of whom Paul says, Whatsoever ye do in
Coloss. 3. 17.
word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus; whereupon Luther was bold
to Quicquid oratur, docetur and vivitur extra Christum est idololatria coram
Deo and peccatum. Luther. tom. 3. edit. Jenens. p. 300.
assert, That all the prayings, teachings and actings of men are out of Christ
idolatry and sin in the sight of God. Now although the first direction were not
altogether unknown to some of the Gentiles, as may be gathered from sundry
passages in their writings, cited by Grotius in his notes upon John the fourth
at the four and twentieth verse, and by Doctor Meric Casaubon in his second
book De cultu the third chapter: yet of this second they had no knowledge at
all; for it is not a lesson to be learned in Natures school. The heavens
indeed, and so the earth, with all the creatures in them both, declare the
glory of God in himself; but the glory of God in the face of Christ as
mediator is not declared by any of them. Insomuch as Paul tells the Ephesians,
that while they Ephesians. 2. 11, 12.
were Gentiles, they were at that time without Christ; although Ephesus then
was full of Philosophers and eminent scholars, witness the proverb of Ephesian
letters, (...) Act. 19. 19.
and that story in the Acts, which mentions the burning of books there to the
value of fifty thousand pieces of silver, by such as were taken off from the
study of curious arts upon their conversion to the faith. As for Jews and
Mahometans, the former we know have espoused long since another Messiah, and
the latter set up that impostour Mahomet for their mediator.

. 5. Now the argument built upon the foundation of these premised
considerations stands thus, No religion or doctrine can bring us to the
fruition of God but such as instructs us how to worship him aright; No religion
or doctrine but Christianity teaches the right worship of God; Therefore none
but it can bring us to enjoy him. The proposition is bottomed upon that
necessary connection which is between the fruition of God and his adoration; he
being wont to communicate himself in or after acts of worship, according to
these and the like places. He that has Joh. 14. 21.
my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves
me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest my self
to him. Behold I stand at Rev. 3. 20.
the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come
in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. The Assumption has been
already cleared. But if further proof be needful, I shall add one argument
more. So far is the light of nature from making a full discovery of what
belongs to divine worship, that the wisest Philosophers in their moral
tractates have not only been silent as to faith in Christ, and repentance from
dead works and such other eminent duties of religion, but commended to their
readers some habits and actions for virtues and duties, which in Scripture are
represented as vices and sins. For example, Aristotle one of Natures high
priests, in his Ethics, one of the choicest pieces of morality extant, makes
a virtue of Eutrapelia, which Paul under that very term prohibits as a thing
inconvenient for Christians, Neither filthiness, nor Ephesians. 5. 4.
foolish talking, nor Eutrapelia Jesting, which are not convenient. So also
Nemesis, that is, grief and indignation at the prosperity of unworthy men is by
him reckoned among such affections as are near of kin to virtues, but condemned
at large by David in Psalm the thirty seven, and by Solomon in the Proverbs,
saying, Fret not thy self because of evil Prove. 24. 19.
men, neither be thou envious at the wicked. Another of his virtues is (...)
Magnanimity, which he describes to be the judging of a man's self worthy of
great things when he is so. Whereas our Savior directs us even when we have
Luke 17. 10.
done all things that are commanded us, yet to say we are unprofitable
servants. He would have such a person a despiser (...).
and contemner of others, which is plainly Pharisaical; thinks all that
savoureth of humility unworthy of his magnanimous man, whereas Solomon tells
us, It is better to be of an humble Prove. 16. 19.
spirit with the lowly, then to divide the spoil with the proud. Yea he
allows him in case of contumely to speak evil of his adversaries, whereas our
Saviors rule is, Bless them that curse you, pray for them Matthew. 5. 44.
that despitefully use you.

EXERCITATION 3. Oracles of God vocal, or written. Books of Scripture so called
in five respects, viz In regard of their declaring and foretelling, their being
consulted, prized and preserved.
. 1. IN the epistle to the Hebrews these two phrases The first principles Hebr.
5. 12. and 6. 1.
of the oracles of God, And the principles of the doctrine of Christ import one
and the same thing, implying also that Scripture Records are the only
Storehouse and Conservatory of Christian Religion. I shall therefore from hence
take occasion to show, That books of Scripture are oracles of God, why they are
so called, and wherein they excel other oracles. For the first. There were two
sorts of Oracles belonging to God, vocal and written. The vocal were those
answers he gave from between the Cherubims on the top of 1 Kings 6. often and
Chapt. 8. 6.
the Mercy-seat which covered the Ark, by reason whereof the Holy of Holies,
where that Ark stood, was styled the Oracle. The written are the two tables
Exerc. 3.
of the Law, called by Stephen the lively Acts 7. 37.
oracles, and the Canonical books of Scripture, as well those of the old
Testament of which Paul speaks when he declares it as the great privilege
of the Jews, that to them were committed the Romans 3. 2.
oracles of God; as those of the New, to which Peter is like to have had a
peculiar respect in that saying of his, If 1 Pet. 4. 11.
any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God, (...). Especially if his
meaning be to admonish such as speak in congregations, public teachers, or as
another Apostle styleth them Ministers 2 Cor. 3. 6.
of the new Testament, that they be careful to deliver Scripture-truths in
Scripture-words, New-Testamentmatter in New-Testament-language, taking the
particle (...) in that text for a note, not of similitude, but of identity; as
when it is said, We beheld his John 1. 14.
glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, it is not meant of a
glory like his, but the very same; So let him speak as the Oracles of God, that
is, the self-same things which Vid. Gerhard Coment. in 1 Pet. 4. page 631, 634.
God has spoken in his word.

. 2. The word (...), whereby heathen writers had been wont to express their
oracles, (chiefly such are were uttered in prose, while such as were delivered
in verse went under the name of (...)) was enfranchised by the holy Ghost, and
applied to the books of Scripture to intimate (as I conceive) that these books
were to be of like use to Christians, as those oracles had been to Infidels;
whereof take a five-fold account.

I. Those declared to heathen men the will of their Idols, whence also they had
their names of (...) from (...), and oracula from orare, quod inerat illis
Deorum oration, as Tully gives the etymology, because they contained what the
Gods spoke, and delivered to be their mind. The Scriptures in like manner
contain the mind of Jehovah. Somewhat of his nature we may learn from the
creatures, but should have known little or nothing of his will, had not
canonical Scripture revealed it. We use to call a man's Testament his last will,
because in it he makes a final declaration of what he would have his executours
do. He that would exactly know the will of God, must look into his two
Testaments: there he shall find it fully expressed, and no where else.

. 3. II. Those foretold future events, which made them to be so much frequented
by such as thirsted after knowledge of things to come. These read every one
his destiny, and acquaint him aforehand with what he may or may not infallibly
expect according to his present and future qualifications. Not to mention
prophesies in the New testament, whereof the principal magazine is the
Apocalypse, the old contains very many predictions beyond the activity of
humane foresight. For although such effects as depend upon natural causes
(which are uniform in their workings) may be foretold by a skillful naturalist;
and a wise Statesman, observing the present constitution of a government, may
prognosticate what events are like to ensue upon those counsels and courses
which he sees taken: yet the quickest eye upon earth cannot foresee such future
contingents as have their dependence upon the mere free will of persons yet
unborn; and whereunto, when they are born, not common principles, but heroic
impulses must incline them. Whereas in the Scriptures we meet with the names of
Josiah and Cyrus, and with their performances long before they had a being. We
find old Jacob foretelling the respective fates of all his children, and of
their posterity; Isaiah speaking of Jesus Christ, as if he had written an
history rather then a prophecy; And Daniel, who lived under the fitst,
describing the several revolutions under all the other Monarchies, as if he
had seen them with his eyes.

. 4. III. Those gave advice in doubtful cases, and were in all undertakings of
moment consulted with by devout Heathens, who as Strabo testifies, Lib. 16. in
descript. Judaeae.
in their chief affairs of state relied more upon the answers of their oracles
then upon humane policies. These were David's delight and his counselors,
Psalm. 119. 24.
as we use to advise with those friends, whom we take most pleasure in. He had
many wise men about him, but in all their meetings for advice the word of God
was still of the Quorum, and nothing to be concluded of in the result without
its consent. Scripture must not only be heard in all our debates, but when any
thing comes to be voted, always have a negative voice. Concerning Achitophels
advice it was said, what he counseled in those days was as if a man had
enquired at the Oracle of God; 2 Samuel 16. last.
which words (being as it is well said by Peter Martyr, Comparatio non
aequiparatio, a comparison only, not a parallel) sufficiently intimate that
all the Oracles of God are to be consulted, and also that their counsel is to
be rested in. I shall therefore be bold to say to him that reads, whoever he
be, as Jehoshaphat once did to Ahab, Enquire I pray thee 2 Chronicles. 18. 4.
of the word of the Lord to day; As Paul to his Colossians, Let the word of
Christ Coloss 3. 16.
dwell in you richly in all wisdom. yea as Christ to his hearers, Search the
Scriptures. Joh. 5. 39.
Other books may render men learned to ostentation, none but these can make
them really wise to salvation. Philosophical speculations, quaint notions and
strains of wit, if compared with these oracles, are but as so many spiders webs
to catch flies, fitter for the taking of phansies then the saving of souls.

. 5. IV. Those were exceedingly prized by such as enjoyed them, as the great
advantage of their States, and the great donative of their Gods, who were
thought to gratify their worshippers by nothing more, then by oracular
discoveries. These are certainly the highest privileges wherewith a people can
be gratified; witness that discourse of Paul in the beginning of his third
chapter to the Romans; where he handles and decides the controversy between
Religionum vincula sunt arctissima. Religionum odia sunt acerbissima. Reddimus
obstoenae convitia debita genli, Quae genitale caput propudiosa metit. Septima
quaeque dies turpi damnata veterno, Tanquam lassati mollis imago Dei. Rutil.
Itiner. lib. 1.
Jew and Gentile about precedencie. Consent in Religion is wont to tie the
fastest knots of mutual accord; but there are no greater animosities then those
that arise from diversity of professions. The Jews of old abhorred the Gentiles
as uncircumcised, ignorant Idolaters; the Gentiles on the other side derided
the Jews for their circumcision as savouring of obscenity, and for their
sabbaths, as favoring idleness: Paul who was by birth a Jew, by office a
teacher of the Gentiles, well knew what fewds, and also what odds there were
between them; yet equally involves them in the guilt of original sin throughout
the whole second chapter. And because the Jew, who stood upon his points,
esteeming himself every way the better man, would be ready to take offense at
this, and to say, as it is, in the first verse of the third chapter, What
advantage then has the Jews, or what profit is there of circumcision? The
Apostle answers by way of concession: and though he hold his conclusion firm
(which is that both Jews and Gentiles, considered in their naturals, are all
under sin, and that in this Romans 3. 9. 22.
respect there is no difference) yet he readily grants that in some regards
the Jews far excelled the rest of the world. Diverse of their privileges are
insinuated in the former part of the second verse, Much every way; in the
latter one instanced in, as most considerable, Chiefly because unto them were
committed the Oracles of God.

6. V. Those were preserved with much solicitude. History tells us how great
care the Romans took for Vid. Molinaei Vates, lib. 3. cap. 12.
the safe custody of the Sibylline oracles in their Capitol after Tarquin had
bought them: when the Capitol was burnt and those books in it, what means were
used to get other copies out of Greece; and how a College of Priests was
appointed to keep them safe. These do surely deserve as much and more care in
every suitable, possible way. The ancient Jews preserved the letter of
Scripture entire, but lost the sense; as the Papists now keep the text, but let
go the truth. A good Christian will not be backward in giving all diligence to
hold-fast both, by laying the Scripture up in his judgment, conscience and
memory. We are all desirous to have fair and well-printed Bibles. Believe it,
the fairest impression of the Bible is, to have it well printed on the readers
Acts and Monum. vol. 3. edition last. p. 705.
heart. Mr Fox tells us of one Crow a seaman, who being shipwrackt lost all
his wares, and also cast five pounds in money into the sea, but kept his New
Testament hanging still about his neck, so swimming upon a broken mast, till
after four days (all the rest of his company being drowned) he was discovered
and taken up in that posture alive. The only way of preserving souls from
being drowned in eternal perdition, is having the grace and truth of Scripture
so bound upon the heart as to be willing to part with money or any thing else,
for the safety of them. It is well worthy of our best consideration how much
and how often Solomon in the proverbs presses this. It is known how careful
the most are to get and keep silver and gold, but Receive Prove. 8. 10.
my instruction (says Wisdom there) and not silver; and knowledge rather then
choice gold. Yet as well as men love money they will rather let go that then
lose their members, whereof none are more dear then the apple of the eye. My
son (says Chap. 7. 1, 2.
he) keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee: keep my commandments
and live, and my law as the apple of thine eye. Yet skin for skin and all a man
has will he give for his life: if the loss of a member or two will save that
they shall go. His advice to his son is, Take fast hold of Chap. 4. 13.
instruction, let her not go; keep her for she is thy life. Yet the martyrs
parted even with their lives to save their souls; our keeping of these is
really as of great concernment as the keeping of our very souls, for so says
Solomon, He that Chap. 19. 16,
keeps the commandment, keeps his own soul.

EXERCITATION 4. How Scripture-Oracles far excel those of the heathen in point
of perspicuity, of piety, of veracity, of duration, and of authority. The
divine authority of Scripture asserted by two arguments. An inference from the
whole Aphorism.
. 1. HAving showed wherein they Exerc. 4.
agree, I am now to make known wherein these Scripture-Oracles differ from and
excel those other. viz.

I. In point of perspicuity. Apollo's oracles were delivered in so dark and
ambiguous terms, as gave the Grecians, though they were his chief worshippers,
occasion to style him by the name of (...), because he seldom answered
directly in doubtful cases, but Eusebius. praeparat. Evangelic. lib. 4.
used such a form of words as might be diversely interpreted, to the end his
credit might be salved, whatever event the business had about which he was
consulted with. Whereas Scripture is so framed, as to deliver all things
necessary to salvation in a clear and perspicuous way. There are indeed some
Pascimur apertis, exercemur obscuris, illic fames pellitur, hic fastidium.
August.
obscure passages in it to exercise our understandings, and prevent our lothing
of overmuch plainness and simplicity: yet whatsoever is needful for us to
satisfy hunger, and nourish our souls to life eternal, is so expressed (I do not
say that it may be understood, but so) as men that do not wilfully shut their
eyes against the light, cannot possibly but understand it.

. 2. II. In point of piety. The heathen were put upon many ungodly practices
Plutarch. in Publicols. Livius lib. 21, and 22. Sr Walt. Raleigh, lib. 5. page
374, and 393.
by their oracles, if good historians may be credited, even by those of the
Sibyls, which were of greatest esteem for sanctity. But the frame of Scripture
is according to godliness. Piety sparkleth in every leaf, and throughout the
whole there runs a constant exaltation of God in Christ. Well nigh all sorts of
Poems (to instance in them) with which we meet in humane writings have their
parallels in the Canonical books; but they are such as carry in them a genius
and strain of godliness far beyond any thing that occurs in the Poems of men.
There are (...), Songs of victory; but such as exalt, not the prowess of man,
but, the glory of God. So Exodus the fifteenth. (...) funeral songs, but such
as celebrate Christ's death and the good will of God therein; so Psalm the
twenty second, and Isaiah the fifty third. (...) songs of love, but such as set
forth the love of Christ to his Spouse the Church, and her mutual affection to
him. So Psalm the forty fifth, and the Canticles. There are also (...) sacred
pastorals, but such as magnify no other Shepherd but God alone, so Psalm the
three and twentieth. Yea (...) too, but such as ascribe all to him. So Psalm
sixty fifth. Let Virgil be asked Quid faciat laetas segetes, he will wholly
insist upon this or that secondary cause of fertility. Ask David, he presently
falls in his Georgicks upon praising God as the author of all fruitfulness.
Thou visitest the earth and waterest it, Thou make it soft with showers. Thou
blessest the springing thereof; Thou crownest the year with thy goodness, Thy
paths drop fatness, etc. in the end of that forecited Psalm.

. 3. III. In point of veracity. Many falsehoods were uttered, much flattery
practiced by their oracles. As when Socrates was declared by the father of lies
to be the wisest man upon earth, Helvicus p. 18.
notwithstanding the two great Prophets Haggai and Zechary were his
contemporaries: and when Apollo was said (...) by reason of his so palpable
Vide Sirenium de fato l. 9. c. 12 and 13.
favoring of king Philip in his responses. Whereas Scripture is free, not
only from all degrees of falsehood (for of it we may say, Verity of verities,
all is verity) but of flattery too. Insomuch as it may be observed concerning
the penmen of holy Scripture, that, contrary to the custom and guise of
humane writers, they are not more free, full and impartial in any relations,
then in those which concern their own failings, and theirs who were nearest and
dearest to them. Moses his unbelief, David's bloud-guiltiness, Jonahs
pettishness, Jeremies impatience, Paul's persecution are recorded by their own
pens. And whereas the other Evangelists in the enumeration of Christ's Apostles
barely name Matthew for one, without setting any brand upon him, he himself
tells us what he had been before Christ called him, Matthew the publicane.
Matthew. 10. 3.
Yea whereas Paul in his epistle to the Galatians had brought in a charge
against Peter for Judaizing, and spoken Galat. 2. 11.
of his own resisting him openly, because he was indeed to be blamed; yet Peter
for all this in his second epistle (which was written a good while after)
styleth him his beloved brother Paul, and commends 2 Pet. 3. 15, 16.
not his wisdom only, but all his epistles, even that wherein he himself was
reproved. As for their carriage toward others, Moses who loved the Hebrews so
well as to wish himself blotted out of Gods book, rather then they should
perish, yet spares not to relate their many rebellions, with the aggravations
thereof to the full. The idolatry of his brother Aaron, the murmuring of his
sister Miriam, the frowardness of his wife Zipporah, are as freely recorded by
him, as any other historical passages whatsoever. Luke who was Paul's companion
and scholar tells us in the Acts what havoc he had made, and how sore an
enemy he had been to the Church of Christ. Mark, whom Peter 1 Pet. last. 13.
styleth his son, aggravateth the story of his dear fathers sin against Christ,
more then some of the other Evangelists. Luke and John tells us barely of his
denying; but Mark adds further Mark 14. verse 68. 70. 71.
that he began to swear and curse, saying, I know not the man.

. 4. IV. In point of duration. Satan, who is Gods ape in very many things, had
his oracles also of both sorts, Vocal; as at Delphi and Dodona, which Ovid in
that respect joyneth together in one verse, Non mihi si Delphi, Dodonaque
diceret ipsa; Written; as in the Sibyls books contained at first in three
volumes, two whereof, as it is said, were purposely cast into the fire by her
that presented them, because Tarquin Plin. nature. hist. lib. 13. cap. 13.
would not go to the price of them; and the third sold for as much as was
demanded in the beginning of the treaty for all three. Now providence so
ordered things that there was was a remarkable failing of the former sort upon
the coming of Christ in the flesh, and a total cessation of them not long after
his death, insomuch as Plutarch wrote a book of their defect: and a destruction
of the latter after Christianity -- Sibyllinae fata cremavit opis. Vide Baron.
tom. 4. ad annum Christi 389. n. 56. and Molin. Vates p. 182.
had taken root in the Roman empire, when Stilico burnt the Sybils books as
fomenters of paganism and profaness. He that was manifested to destroy the
works of the devil stopped the mouths of those evil Angels that gave answers by
oracles. The Sun of righteousness arose, and those wild beasts were forced to
betake themselves to their dens. Then was the prince of this world judged, and
his Angels dislodged, for the Lord Christ had ejected them. But the old
Testament Scriptures received a strong confirmation from Christ by his
appealing to them, arguing from them and expounding of them. Yea so far were
the Oracles of God from any diminution by his coming, preaching and dying, that
they received not a confirmation only but a glorious augmentation, in that
within a while after there was added to them by his Secretaries the Evangelists
and Apostles another Volume, I mean the books of the New Testament; upon the
publishing whereof there came out from God as it were a second edition of his
Oracles much enlarged.

. 5. Fifthly and lastly. In point of authority. Those were from the father of
lies, as has been said; but these from the Father of lights. Scripture is of
divine authority: Holy men of God 2 Pet. 1. 21.
(says Peter) spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. They wrote
accordingly. All Scripture, says Paul, was given 2 Timothy 3. 16.
by inspiration of God. It is not more true that they are oracles for their
use, then that they have God for their author. Many large volumes have been
written for to make good this assertion. It is a thing wherein the Spirit of
God, who indicted the Scripture, gives such abundant satisfaction to the spirits
of godly men, as to make other arguments, though not useless, yet to them of
less necessity; He alone bearing witness to the divinity of holy writ, and to
the truth of his own testimony, so putting a final issue to that controversy.
But because there is need of other reasons for the conviction of other men, I
have produced certain arguments T^ctica Sacra. lib. 2. cap. ult.
elsewhere, and shall here make an addition of two more, which are not
mentioned in that discourse, one from consent, another from continuance.

. 6. From consent thus. Writings of men differ exceedingly one from another,
which made Seneca say, Philosophers Tunc inter Thilosophos conveniet quando
inter Horologia.
would then be all of one mind when all clocks were brought to strike at one
and the same time. Yea it is hard finding an author that does not differ from
himself more or less, if he write much, and at various seasons. But here is a
most harmonious consent. The word since written fully agrees with that which in
former times was delivered to the Patriarchs, and transmitted by word of mouth.
As the word God is the same to day, yesterday and for ever, although not
incarnate till the fullness of time came, and then made flesh: So the word of
God, although till Moses received a command to put it in writing, there wanted
that kind of incarnation, was for substance the same before and after. And as
the written word agreed with the unwritten, so does one part of that which is
written harmonize with another. The two Testaments, Old and New, like the two
breasts of the same person give the same milk. As if one draw water out of a
deep well with vessels of different metal, one of brass, another of tin, a
third of earth, the water may seem at first to be of a different color; but
when the vessels are brought near to the eye, this diversity of colors
vanishes, and the waters tasted of have the same relish: So here, the
different style of the historiographers from Prophets, of the Prophets from
Evangelists, of the Evangelist from Apostles may make the truths of Scripture
seem of different complexions till one look narrowly into them and taste them
advisedly, then will the identity both of color and relish manifest it self.

. 7. From continuance thus. Notwithstanding all the confusions that have
happened in the world, all the fires that have been kindled, the massacres that
have been executed, and the battles that have been fought against the true
Christian Religion, the storehouse thereof has continued to this day, and
these Oracles of God been preserved in spite of hell. Solomon's philosophical
treatises, which the world had no spleen against, but a liking of, are long
since lost; whereas his Canonical writings are extant still. When the earth
clave asunder to swallow up Korah and his company, there are that think some of
his children were taken up by the hand of God into the air till the earth
closed again, then set down without having received any harm because in the
titles of sundry Psalms mention is made of the sons of Korah, whom Tirinus in
Numer. 16. nota ultima.
they suppose then preserved to propagate these whose service the Lord had a
purpose to use so long after. How often has persecution opened her mouth from
age to age, and swallowed up millions both of men and books! Yet the bible has
been continued still by the overruling hand of heaven, yea, which makes it
more remarkable, God has so befooled the devil herein, as to preserve his own
Book many times by the hands of his and its enemies. It is too well known how
small friends the Jews are and have heretofore been to the truth contained in
the old Testament, yet of them did the Lord make use to keep it, and they
proved careful feoffes in trust for making over the assurances of life to us
Gentiles. Concerning one book of the New Testament, viz. the Apocalypse, it is
very observable that when the authority thereof was questioned of old, the
Church of Rome struck in with her testimony, and was a special means to have it
kept in the number of Canonical books; not without a special providence. God,
who made Pharaohs daughter a second mother to Moses, whom he had appointed to
bring destruction afterward upon her fathers house and kingdom; did then make
the Romish Church a dry nurse to preserve this Book (whose meaning she knew
not) that it might bring desolation upon her self and her children afterward.
Well may we therefore conclude and say of the holy Bible, as Gamaliel once did
of the Apostles Acts 5. 38, 39.
preaching, Had this work been of men it would have come to naught longere
this, but being it is of God, the devil and his accomplices have not been able to
overthrow it.

. 8. Learn we also from that has been said, to magnify the grace of God, who
in order to the promoting of our blessedness, has brought us of this nation to
the knowledge of Christian Religion, for want whereof many millions in other
parts still sit in darkness and the shadow of death. It was a memorable act of
Witekindus, Sr H. Spelman in Aspilogia p. 71.
one of the Dukes of Saxony, who flourished about the nine hundredth year of
Christ; after his renouncing paganism, and receiving the faith of the gospel,
he caused the black horse, which he had formerly born in his military colors,
to be laid aside, and in stead thereof a white horse to be born, in testimony
of his triumphant joy for that great change: perhaps because among Qui candore
cum nive certabant. Pompon. Laetus.
the Romans the manner was to make use of such colored steeds in their
triumphs. It put me in mind of what we read in the sixth of the Revelation
verse the second, where Christ is described as going out in the ministry of
the Gospel, which was then newly embraced by that Prince; Behold a white horse,
and he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was givne unto him, and he went
forth conquering and to conquer. Yea whereas there are sundry modes of the
Christian Religion, we are therefore to have our hearts and mouths filled with
the highest praises of God, because we have it in the purest, that is, the
Protestant way, which allows the people in general a free use of Bibles in
their native language. In In Hispania in Indice librorum prohibitorum Regulae
sexta sic habet. Prohibentur Biblia in vulgari lingua cum omnibus suis
partibus. Azor. Instit. moral. Tom. 1. lib. 8. cap. 26. page 714. Anglia, mons,
pons, sons, Ecclesia, foemina, lana.
sundry parts even of Europe it is far otherwise, particularly in Spain, where
the Bible in their vulgar tongue is reckoned among prohibited books, and
suffices to bring him that reads it into danger of the Inquisition. Wherefore
let such as list make their boast of other things which England is said to be
famous for, as beautiful Churches, bridges, women, etc. If I were asked what
advantage have English men and what profit is there of living in that Island,
mine answer should be much every way; but chiefly because to them are committed
the Oracles of God, and liberty to read their fathers mind in their mother
tongue.

APHORISM III. Scripture-Oracles, supposing it sufficiently clear by the light
of Nature, that there is a God, make a further discovery of what he is in his
Essence, Subsistence and Attributes.
EXERCITATION 1. 1 Corinthians. 15. 34. expounded. Opinionists compared Exerc. 1.
to sleepers and drunkards. Three observations from the end of the verse. What
knowledge of God is unattainable in this life. What may be had. The knowledge
we have concerning God distinguished into Natural, Literal, and Spiritual.
. 1. AWake to righteousness and sin 1 Cor. 15. 34.
not: for some have not the knowledge of God; I speak this to your shame. These
are the Apostles express words to his Corinthians. Which will be better
understood, if we consider.

I. That there was a time, when Aph. 3.
of all the Nations in the world Greece was held the most licentious, and
Corinth of all the cities in Greece; insomuch as in common speech revellers
were said to play the Grecians, and fornicatours Pergraecari. (...).
to play the Corinthians. Also that after the grace of Christ (who came to call
sinners to repentance) had appeared there in planting Christianity, this
riotous humor was notably fed in false brethren by those false teachers, who
opened a gate to all profaness by denying the resurrection.

II. That of such teachers and professors Paul speaks in this chapter, How say
some among you that there is no resurrection? Verse 12.
and calls upon them in the beginning of this verse to awaken unto
righteousness, because the many and gross vapors that ascended from this
heresy had cast them into a deep sleep, wherein all their spiritual senses
were bound. Heretics may perhaps pretend to the highest strains of devotion,
and make their boast of strongest assurances: yet all this be but like the
talking or walking of men in their sleep, or like the quick and nimble
phantasmes of dreaming students. Their devotion is but a dream of pieety, their
assurance will prove but a dream of happiness.

. 2. III. That the word (...) there used by the Apostle is very emphatical, and
properly signifies an awaking out of such a sleep as has been occasioned by
too much drink. Thus Noah awoke from his wine, and Awake (...) Genesis 9. 24.
(...). Joel. 1. 5.
ye drunkards says Joel. Neither will it be difficult to discern in a sensual
opinionist the symptoms of a drunken man. Ye may see him reeling to and fro,
now entertaining this odd conceit, to morrow that, and the next day a third,
unstable in all: well if not vomiting too and casting out scornful reproaches
upon all that are of a contrary judgment, as upon dark and low-spirited men.
Ye may perceive him full of tongue, as drunkards commonly use to be, prating,
and venting his own apprehensions every where; yea perhaps boasting of himself
and his party as too many, too hard for all their opposites. So one drunkard,
our proverb says, is forty men strong. Who so attempts to reason with him
will easily find him as incapable of conviction, as Nahal was of Abigails
narration 1 Samuel 25. 37.
till his wine was gone out of him.

IV. That the cause was manifest why such men had a charge given them not to
sin, Awake unto righteousness, says the Apostle, and sin not. For that the
desperate opinion they had embraced was an highway to abominable courses. The
denial of a resurrection has a natural tendency to looseness of life,
inclining men to say, as they did, Let us eat and drink for to 1 Cor. 15. 3^.
morrow we shall die. And the more licentious any man is, the more willing to
close with such an opinion. Accordingly among the Jews, whereas most of the
common people adhered to the Pharisees, who professed strictness, and amused
them with outward forms of godliness, the Gentry and such as gave themselves
most to voluptuousness became followers of the Sadducees, who denied the
resurrection. Such men (says Theophylact) are not so (...). Theophyl. in 1
Cor. 15.
easily persuaded of a resurrection, because they are afraid of punishments in
another life, if any be.

. 3. V. That these especially were the persons whom Paul there censureth for
gross ignorance, such as they had just cause to be ashamed of. He had said
before in the twelfth verse, Some among you say there is no resurrection: in
the four and thirtieth speaking still of the same men, Some have not the
knowledge 1 Cor. 4. 14.
of God. Only whereas in case of personal affronts to himself and his
fellow-preachers he had appeared much more mild in the fourth chapter, I write
not these things (says he there) to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn
you. Here he sets an edge upon his rebuke, and tells them he spoke it to
their shame; because the heresy he strikes at, struck at the root of all
religion, and became an inlet to Epicurisme, yea to Atheism.

VI. That from the latter part alone, Some have not the knowledge of God, I
speak this to your shame, three observations may be raised without offering
violence to the words, one as implied, the rest as expressed, to wit,

1. There is a knowledge of God to be had. 2. Some have it not. 3. The want of
it is a matter of shame.
All which I intend to insist upon in this and the following Exercitations.

. 4. Concerning the first. There is a knowledge of God to perfection, which is
always saving; and another to salvation indeed, but as yet imperfect. The
former has been proudly challenged by some sons of delusion, and accounted
attainable in this life by the sole improvement of reason. For we read of
Aetius that he dared to say, I so know God, (...). Epiph. haeres. Totum quod
Deus est humana ratione comprehendi posse O siand. hist. Eccles. centur. 12. p.
265.
as I do my self; yea I do not know my self so well as I do God. A certain
evidence to make it appear, that the wretch neither knew himself, nor God. And
Petrus Abelardus is said to have maintained this assertion, That the whole of
Gods essence may be comprehended by humane reason. But the truth is, it is
neither attainable in this life, as being reserved for another world (according
to the Apostles doctrine, We know but in part. 1 Cor. 13. 9, 10.
When that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done
away) nor at all by the sole improvement of reason. The lesser cannot
comprehend the greater; God is greater then our heart, 1 John 3. 2.
faith St. John, therefore incomprehensible by the shallow reason of
shipwrack'd nature. He and the Sun are alike in this, both refresh wary
beholders, but put out the eyes of curious pryers. However faith may look upon
God with much comfort, for reason to stare too much upon him is the way to lose
her sight. When she has tired and wildered herself in searching after the true
God her return must be Non est inventus, He is not to be found, at least not by
me. Faith only can find him out, yet not to perfection neither, although to
salvation it may and does.

. 5. Which is the latter kind of knowledge abovementioned, and that I am now
speaking to, as attainable here. Even the lowest rank of Christians, whom John
styleth his little children are described by their having known 1 John 2. 13.
the father: And because the new covenant runs thus, They shall all know
Jerem. 31. 33.
me from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the Lord. But
although it be most true, that there is a saving knowledge of God attainable
here, yet for any man to presume, that whatever knowledge of God he attaineth,
it will certainly save him is a most strong delusion. For whereas there is a
Natural and a Literal as well as a Spiritual knowledge, it will be manifest by
the sequel of this discourse, that none is saving but the third. The first is
that which may be fetched out of the book of nature without any further
manuduction of higher principles. Antony the religious Monk, when a certain
Philosopher asked him, how he did to live without books, answered he had
Socrat. Eccles. histor. lib. 4. cap. 23.
the voluminous book of all the creatures to study upon, and to contemplate God
in. Believe me, said Bernard to his friend, as one that speaks out of
experience, Bern. epist. 107. Aliquid amplius invenies in sylvis quam in libra.
There is sometimes more to be found in woods, then there is in books. Trees
and stones will teach thee that, which is not to be learned from other masters.
The Book of Scripture without doubt has the preeminence in worth by many
degrees; but that of the creatures had the precedence in time, and was extant
long before the written word. We may therefore well begin with it.

EXERCITATION 2. That there is a God, the prime dictate of natural light;
deducible from man's looking backward to the creation, forward to the rewards
and punishments dispensed after death, upward to the Angels above us, downwards
to inferior beings, within our selves to the composition of our bodies, and
dictates of our consciences, about us to the various occurrences in the world.
. 1. THere are six several acts which every man of understanding is able to
exert in a way of contemplation: He may respicere, prospicere, suspicere,
despicere, inspicere, and circumspicere. Whosoever shall advisedly exercise any
of these will undoubtedly meet with some demonstrations of a Deity; much more
if he be industriously conversant in them all.

I. If he do respicere look backward to the creation of the world (which the
light of nature will tell him had a beginning) he will see and understand
Exerc. 2.
the invisible things of God by the things that Romans 1. 20. (...) (...). Hex.
are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, as Paul speaks. Basil therefore
called the world a school wherein reasonable souls are taught the knowledge of
God. In a musical instrument when we observe diverse strings meet in an harmony,
we conclude that some skillful musician tuned them; when we see thousands of
men in a field, marshalled under several colors, all yielding exact obedience,
we infer that there is a General, whose commands they are all subject to. In a
watch, when we take notice of great and small wheels all so fitted as to concur
to an orderly motion, we acknowledge the skill of an artificer. When we come
into a Printing House and see a great number of different letters so ordered as
to make a book, the consideration hereof makes it evident that there is a
composer, by whose art they were brought into such a frame. When we behold a
fair building, we conclude it had an architect; a stately ship well rigged and
safely conducted to the Port, that it has a Pilot. So here. The visible world
is such an Instrument, Army, Watch, Book, Building, Ship, as undeniably argues
a God, who was and is the Tuner, General, and Artificer, the Composer,
Architect and Pilot of it.

. 2. II. If he do prospicere look forwards to the rewards and punishments, to
be dispensed in another world, (which the heathens Elysium Vid. Livium Galant.
Christian. Theolog. cum Platonica comparat. lib 12. page 341. and sequent.
and Tartarus show them to have had a slight knowledge of by the light of
nature) he cannot but acknowledge some supreme Judge, whom they are dispensed
by; and that he is a searcher of hearts, wherein piety and sin do chiefly
reside; seeing it were impossible for him otherwise to pase righteous judgment
without mistaking good for evil, and evil for good. Some discourses of Plato,
and some verses of Menander, besides many other testimonies make it appear that
the notion of (...). Menand.
these things was entertained by the wiser sort both of Philosophers and Poets,
and that which they held of a world to come is a topic sufficient to argue
from, for the being of a God in the world that is.

III. If he do suspicere, look upwards to a rank of creatures above himself, I
mean good and evil spirits, of which the heathens were not ignorant; witness
their large discourses of Demons, of Intelligences, and of a bonus and malus
Genius. For if such creatures as Angels be acknowledged, so good, holy, wise
and powerful as they are said to be by all that take notice of them, they must
have a maker better, holier, wiser and powerfuller then themselves; seeing the
cause is always more noble then the effect, and has that perfection which it
communicates much more eminent in it self. If there be Devils, whose mischief
and might are both of them so confessedly great, there must needs be a God to
restrain and countermand them; else the world would soon be turned into a a
mere hell, full of nothing but abominations and confusion.

. 3. IV. If he do despicere, look downward to things below himself, whose
nature is inferior to that of man; the contemplation of elements, plants and
brute beasts will extort the confession of a Deity. The heavens declare Psalm.
19. 1.
the glory of God, and the firmament shows his handiwork. Nor these alone,
which have so much of magnificence in them: but the least fly, if it could be
anatomized, would be found to have in it more miracles, then parts; such
proportion of members, distinction of offices, correspondence of instruments,
as speaks the infinite power and wisdom of the Maker. Well might Job say, as
he did, Ask now Joh. 12. 7, 8, 9.
the beasts and they shall teach thee, and the fowls of the air, and they shall
tell thee: or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee, and the fishes of
the sea shall declare unto thee. Who knows not in all these that the hand of
the Lord has wrought this?

V. If he do inspicere, look within himself, and that either to the composition
of his body, or to the dictates of his conscience. We are so fearfully Psalm.
139. 14. Galen. lib. 3. de usu partium, Compono hic canticum in Creatoris
nostri laudem, etc. Multa miser timeo, quia feci multa proterve, Exemplique
metu terecor ipse mei. Ovid. l. 1. Amor. Eleg. 1.
and wonderfully made, that the great physician Galen, though an heathen, being
amazed at the wisdom which he discovered in the frame of every member in man's
body, could no longer contain himself, but fell to praising the Creator in an
hymn. As for conscience there is nothing more common then for wicked men after
the commission of gross sins to be inwardly tormented and affrighted by reason
of somewhat it suggests, the substance whereof is, that there is a God, and
that he will judge them for what they have done. Calvin tells us of a certain
profane fellow who was ranting at his Inn, and blasphemously wresting that of
the Psalmist, The heaven of heavens is the Lords, and the earth has he given
to the children of men, as if God left us to do what we list upon earth,
confining himself and his providence to the heavens; thereby as far as he
openly durst disavowing a Deity. Whereupon he was struck suddenly with extreme
torments in his body, and began to cry out O God, O God. So natural it is even
for the worst of mankind to acknowledge a God in their extremities; and for
others more ingenuous, even among those that want Scripture Light (as
Tertullian has observed) to be frequently saying, God sees. I commend it to
God, God will recompense: which drew from him an exclamation that must be
warily understood, O the testimony of a soul naturally O testimonium animae
naturaliter Christianae! Tertull. Apolog.
Christian!

. 4. VI. If he do circumspicere, look round about him to the various
occurrences in the world; the great deliverances vouchsafed to some, the great
calamities brought upon others, both beyond all expectation. The Lord is, Psalm.
9. 16.
and cannot but be, known by the judgments which he executes; so by the
blessings which he bestows. Who can see a Daniel rescued from reasonable
lions, unreasonable men, a Moses preserved in an ark of bulrushes, a Noah in a
deluge of waters, others in a furnace of fire? Who can behold a Pharaoh
plagued, an Herod eaten up with worms, an Achitophel making away himself, a
Judas bursting asunder in the midst, an Arius voiding of his bowels, and not
cry out, as it is in the Psalm, Verily Psalm 58. last.
there is a reward for the righteous, doubtless there is a God that judges the
earth? We meet with a passage in Atheneus not unworthy, as I conceive, to be
taken notice of, and recorded here. When at a public meeting in some place of
receipt, a beam of the house suddenly falling had dashed out the brains of a
notoriously wicked man in the sight of many bystanders to whom he was known;
one Stratonicus brake out into a speech so emphatical in the Greek, as (...).
Athen. Deipnosophist. l. 8.
it can hardly be translated without much loss, yet take it thus: Sirs, said
he, the beam of light which I have, convinces me that there is a God; if any
of you be otherwise minded, this beam of wood may suffice to beget in him the
same persuasion.

. 5. But notwithstanding all this, as it fared with the wise men from the east,
who, although they were assured by the appearance of a star that a King of the
Jews was born, yet needed the prophets manuduction to give them notice who he
was, and where they might find him: so though natural reason improved can make
it appear that there is a God, yet there is a necessity of Scripture-revelation
to inform us who and what he is, in regard of his Essence, Subsistence, and
Attributes; in all these the written word goes far beyond whatever was or could
be discerned in Natures school, and becomes the fountain of that literal
knowledge which we are now to treat of.

EXERCITATION 3. Reasons three ways of discovering God fall short of
manifesting what he is. The expression in Exodus 3. 14. most comprehensive. A
brief exposition thereof. Satan's impudence. Nature and Art both unable to
discover the Trinity. What Scripture reveals about it. Basils memento.
Julians impiety. Socinians branded. The three Persons compared to those three
wells in Genes. 26.
. 1. DIvines tell us of three ways, Exerc. 3.
whereby reason goes to work in her enquiry after God; but none of them all is
able to make a full discovery of his Essence. The first is via causalitatis,
when from the creatures, whereof God is the supreme universal cause, reason
begins to contemplate him as their efficient, because they could not make
themselves. But hitherto it only discovers Quod sit, that there is a God, to
whom all things ow their beings; not Quid sit what he is. The second is via
remotionis, when it considers the several imperfections of creatures, and
removes them all from God, as inconsistent with a Deity. Thus it conceives
him immortal, impassible, impeccable, because to die, suffer, sin, are
imperfections. But this only shows Quid non sit, what he is not; she is
still to seek for what he is. The third is via eminentiae, when reason
considers the sundry perfections, which are scattered here and there among
created beings, and ascribes them all to God in an eminent and transcendent
way. As when finding in Angels and men wisdom, holiness, and strength, it
conceives God to be most wise, most holy, and most strong. Yet even this does
but show Qualis sit, non quis, what kind of being God is, not who is he.
Reason for that must be beholding to revelation. In which respects I cannot but
applaud the wise answer of that Philosopher, ( Epictetus, as some report) who
when his hearers said to him, Sr you have uttered many excellent things
concerning God, Joh. de Carthag. hon il. Catholic. lib. 1. hon il 8. p. 47.
but we cannot as yet understand what he is, told them plainly, Were I able
fully to set forth God, I should either be God my self, or God himself cease to
be what he is. Si omnino ego Deum declararem, vel ego Deus essem, vel ille Deus
non foret.

2. Were all such passages set aside as are not originally the Heathens own,
but borrowed from Jewish or Christian authors, I should not be afraid to
affirm, that there is one very short expression in Scripture, to wit this, I am
that I am, which reveals Exodus 3. 14.
more of God, then all the large volumes of Ethnic writers. An expression so
framed as to take in all differences of time, according to the idiome of the
Hebrew tongue, wherein a verb of the future tense, as Ehieh is, may signify
time past and present, as well as that which is to come. Hence arises a great
latitude of interpretation; for according to different readings it implies
different things. Reading it, as we do, I am that I am, it imports the
supremacy of Gods being. The creatures have more of nonentity then of being
in them: It is proper to him to say I am. (...). so the Septuagint. Or the
simplicity thereof; whereas in creatures the Thing and its Being, Ens and
Essentia are distinguishable, in him they are both one. Or the ineffabilitie;
as if the Lord had said to Moses, enquiring his name, I am my self, and there
is nothing without my self that can fully express my Being. Which put Scaliger
upon inventing that admirable Scalig. de Subtilit. Exercit. 365. 2.
epithet (...), that is, Ipsissimus Ipse. Or lastly, the Eternity thereof;
since there never was, never will be a time, wherein God might not, or may not
say of himself I am. Whence it is that when Christ would manifest his goings
out from everlasting, as Micah phraseth Micah 5. 2.
it, he makes use of this expression, Before Abraham was, I am, not I Joh. 8.
58.
was; for that might have been said of Enoch, Noah and others who lived before
Abraham's time, yet were not eternal, but I am. If it be rendered I am what I
was, as Piscator would have it, then it speaks his Immutability: I am in
executing, what I was in promising, Yesterday and to day and the same for ever.
If, as others, I will be what I will be, then it denotes his Independency. That
essence which the creatures have depends upon the Creatours will; None of
them can say I will be, not having of and in it self any power to make it self
persevere in being, as God has. It may perhaps intimate all these, and Quae
verbulo hoc continentur omnium hominum capacitatem transcendunt. Andr. Rivet.
in Exodus 3. 14.
much more then the tongues of Angels can utter. Verily it is a speech
containing more in it (as a learned writer acknowledges) then humane
capacities can attain.

. 3. I shall therefore forbear to enlarge upon it. Let me only observe before
I leave it the notorious impudence of apostate spirits. Satan not contenting
himself to have got the name of Jove in imitation of Jehovah, the
incommunicable name of God, prevailed with his deluded followers to ascribe
unto him that, which the Lord of heaven and earth assumeth to himself in this
mysterious place of Exodus, saying I am that I am. For over the gate of
Apollo's temple in the city of Delphi, so famed for oracles, was engraven in
capital letters this Greek word (...). which signifies Thou art, whereby
those that came thither to worship, or to consult Satan's oracle, were
instructed to acknovvledge him the fountain of being, and the only true God:
as one Ammonius is brought in discoursing at large of this very thing in the
last Treatise of Plutarchs morals, whereunto I refer the reader.

. 4. As to the point of divine subsistence, Jehova Elohim, Father, Son and Holy
Ghost: three persons, but one Deus indivise (...) in Trinitate, and inconfuse
trinus in unitate.
God; or in Leo's expression, One God without division in a Trinity of Persons,
and three Persons without confusion in an Unity of Essence; it is a discovery
altogether supernatural: yea Nature is so far from finding it out, that now
when Scripture has revealed it, she cannot by all the help of Art comprehend,
or set it forth as she does other things: Grammar it self wanting proper and
full words whereby to express, Logic strong demonstrations whereby to prove,
and Rhetoric apt similitudes whereby to clear so mysterious a truth. The terms
Essence, Persons, Trinity, Generation, Procession and such like, which are
commonly made use of for want of better, have been and will be cavilled at as
short of fully reaching the mystery in all its dimensions. Of the similitudes
usually brought for its illustration that which Hilary said is Omnis comparatio
homini potius utilis habeatur quam Do apta. Hilar. lib. 1. de Trin.
most true, They may gratify the understanding of man, but none of them
exactly suit with the nature of God. For example, Not that of a root, a trunk,
and a branch; the trunk proceeding from the root, the branch from both, yet but
one tree: because a root may for some time be without a trunk, and a trunk
without a branch, but God the Father never was without his Son, nor the Father
and Son without their coeternal Spirit. Neither that of a crystal Ball held
in a river on a Sunshineday, in which case there would be a Sun in the
Firmament, begetting another Sun upon the crystal Ball, and a third Sun
proceeding from both the former, appearing in the surface of the water; yet but
one Sun in all: for in this comparison two of the Suns are but imaginary, none
real save that in heaven; whereas the Father, Word and Spirit are distinct
Persons indeed, but each of them truly and really God.

. 5. Well therefore may Rhetoricians say, It is not in us and in our
similitudes fully to clear this high point; Logitians also, It is not in us and
in our demonstrations fully to prove it. For however reason be able from the
creatures to demonstrate a Godhead, as has been said, yet it cannot from
thence a Trinity; no more then he that looks upon a curious picture can tell
whether it was drawn by an Englishman, or an Italian, only that the piece had
an artificer, and such an one as was a prime master in that faculty: because
the limbner drew it as he was an artist, not as one of this or that nation. So
the world is a production of that Essence which is common to all three, not any
personal emanation from this or that subsistent; which is the reason why a
Deity may be inferred from thence, but not any distinction of Persons, much
less the determinate number of a Trinity. The doctrine whereof is like a Temple
filled with smoke, such smoke as not only hinders the view of the quickest
eye, but hurts the sight of such as dare with undue curiosity pry into it. A
mystery, which my faith embraces as revealed in the word, but my reason cannot
fathom. Whilst others run themselves on ground, and dispute it till their
understandings be non-plust; may I be enabled to believe what Scripture
testifies concerning an unbegotten Father, an onely-begotten Son, and an Holy
Spirit proceeding from both; Three, yet but One: and therein to acquiesce
without enquiring as Mary did, when the Angel foretold her miraculous
conception, How can this thing be? To which question my return should be no
other but that of Austine, who notwithstanding his fifteen books concerning the
Trinity, modestly said, Ask thou^ me Nescio, and libenter nescire profiteor.
August. sermon. de tempore 189.
how there can be Three in One, and One in Three? I do not know, and am freely
willing to profess my ignorance herein. Verily this light is dazzling, and our
eyes are weak. It is a case wherein the wisest clerks are punies, and the
ablest Orators infants.

. 6. Yet is the mystery it self written in Scripture as it were with the
Sunbeams. I reject not as invalid, but only forbear as less evident the
places commonly cited out of Moses and the Prophets; choosing rather to insist
upon New Testament discoveries, when the vail which formerly hid the Holy of
Holies from men's sight was rent in pieces, and the secrets of heaven exposed to
more open view, then whilst the Church was in her minority. At our Saviors
baptism there was a clearer manifestation of the Trinity then ever before; as
if God had reserved this discovery on purpose to add the greater honor to his
only Sons solemn inauguration into the office of Mediatour-ship, which was
then most visibly undertaken. Who so casts his eye upon the third chapter of
the Gospel according to Luke, will quickly discern the Father in an audible
voice, heard but not seen, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well Verse. 21,
22, 23. Voce Pater, Na^us flumine, Flamen ave.
pleased. The word made flesh now in the water, receiving baptism, and after
praying, so both heard and seen. The Spirit like a Dove descending and resting
upon Christ, seen but slot heard. Insomuch as the Catholics were wont in the
times of Athanasius to send the misbeleeving Arians to Jordan, there to learn
the knowledge of a Trinity.

. 7. Behold after this a clear nomination of the three coessential Persons in
that commission which Christ our Lord sealed to the Apostles before his
ascension, in the end of the Gospel according to Matthew, when he sent them out
to make disciples in all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Who can but see a Trinity (...). Basil.
epist. 78.
here? How can any who by virtue of this institution has been baptized, refuse
to believe it? It becomes us (says Basil) to be baptized as we have been
taught, to believe as we have been baptized, and to glorify as we have
believed, the Father, the Son, and the holy Spirit. This the great Apostate
Julian, was not a little sensible of; wherefore considering that he could not
fairly disclaim the Trinity, till he had renounced his baptism, he took the
blood of beasts offered in sacrifice to the heathen Gods (as Nazianzen tells
Nazian. Orar. 1. aduers. Juliar. circa medium.
us from the report of his own domestical servants) and bathed himself therein
all over; so, as much as in him lay, washing off the baptism he had formerly
received. Add hereunto that impregnable place (which has hitherto, and will
for ever hold out against all the mines and batteries of heretics) in the
first epistle of John, There are three that bear witness in heaven, 1 John 5. 7.
the Father, the Word, and the holy Spirit; and these three are One. Where a
Trinity is proclaimed both in numero numerante, there are three; and in numero
numerato, telling us plainly who they are, Father, Word, and holy Spirit: And
that the same Essence is common to them all. For these three are One.

. 8. Yet is there a late generation, of men commonly known by the name of
Socinians, who although they maintain against Atheists the Personalitie and
Eternity of God the Father, have confounded Christian Religion by denying the
Eternity of the Son, whose Personalitie they acknowledge; and the personalitie
of the Spirit, whose Eternity they confess. Methinks it fares with these three
blessed Persons, as with those three noted wells of which we read in the
twenty sixth of Genesis. Two of them Isaacs servants were enforced to strive
for with the herdmen of Gerar, which made him call the one Esek, that is,
contention, the other Sitnah, that is, hatred. A third they got quiet
possession of, and he called the name of it Rehoboth, saying, Now the Lord has
made room for us. The Fathers Godhead is like the well Rehoboth, which there
was no strife about, the Sons divinity like the well Esek, we are forced to
contend for that, as also for the Deity of the Spirit, which is as Sitnah to
the Socinians; they hate the Exerc. 4.
thoughts of it, much more the acknowledgement.

But can any man say by the Spirit of God, that the Spirit is not God? Is it
not as clear by Scripture Light that Christ is God, as by Natures light that
God is? Are they Christians and Spiritual, who deny the divinity of Christ and
the Spirit? Let the judgment of charity enjoy its due latitude: but for my
part, I would not for a thousand worlds have a Socinians account to give at the
end of this.

EXERCITATION 4. Divine Attributes calling for transcendent respect. They are
set down in the Scripture so, as to curb our curiosity, to help our infirmity,
to prevent our misapprehensions, and to raise our esteem of God. Spiritual
knowledge superadding to literal clearness of light, sweeteness of taste, sense
of interest and sincerity of obedience.
NExt to the Essence and Subsistence of God, his Attributes are to be
considered; concerning which I premise this rule.

. 1. The degrees of our respect are to keep proportion with degrees of worth in
persons and things; ordinary worth requiring esteem, eminent calling for
reverence, supereminent for admiration, yea and adoration too, if it be an
uncreated object. Hence the Psalmist upon contemplation of God cries out as in
an ecstasy, O Lord, our Lord, how excellent Psalm. 8. 1, and 9.
is thy Name in all the earth! His Attributes are his Name; their worth so
superexcellent, as far to transcend the utmost pitch of that observance, which
we, poor we, are able any way to render. Seeing as the stars of heaven
disappear, and hide their heads upon the rising of the Sun that out-shineth
them: so creatures seem not to be excellent, yea, not to be, when the being and
excellency of their Maker displayeth it self, according to that, All nations
before Isai. 40. 17.
him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less then nothing and vanity.
The best of them have but some perfections: God either has (as manna is
supposed to have had the relish of all meats) or contains all; Sovereignty
comprehends inferior honors. The best of their perfections are mixed with
some defects: but God is light, 1 John 1. 5.
and in him is no darkness at all. They may be perfect and good in their kind:
He is perfection and goodness it self. In them we may find matter of
wonderment, but of astonishment in him, witness that eminent place Nehem. 9. 5.
Blessed be thy glorious Name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
Nature, though not altogether silent upon this argument, to wit the divine
Attributes, yet enjoys but a dim light to discover them by, whereas the
Scripture represents them most magnificently in sundry respects.

. 2. First, so as to curb our curiosity. For which end it expresses diverse of
them negatively, as when God is said to be infinite, immortal, invisible,
unsearchable: whereby we are taught that it is easier for us to know what he is
not, then what he is; which is known only to himself. The best terms (as
Scaliger has it) for men to manifest Scalig. de Sub^ili^. Exercit. 365. (...).
(...). Nazi anz hymn. ad Deum. Melius seitur nesci^ndo. Aug. lib. 2. de ordine.
their understanding of God by, are those which manifest that they understand
him not. Thou, O Lord, says Nazianzen, have produced all those things of which
we speak; but art unspeakable thy self. All that can be known by us is from
thee, but thou thy self can not be known. Yea Austin was not afraid to affirm
that Nescience is the better way of knowing God.

Secondly, so as to help our infirmity. For whereas we are not able by any one
act of our finite understandings to comprehend that infinite Essence, which is
it self one simple Act, but comprehensive of all perfections; Holy Scripture,
condescending to our weakness, allows us to take up as it were in several
parcels, what we cannot compass at once; and in contemplating the Attributes to
conceive some under the notion of divine properties incommunicable to
creatures; such as are Immensity, Independency, Eternity, Simplicity,
Self-sufficiency, Allsufficiency, Omnipotence, Omniscience, Omnipresence.
Others under that of divine faculties; such are Understanding, Will, and Memory
ascribed to God. It gives us leave to look at some as divine affections; such
are his Love, Hatred, Anger, Grief and Delight. At others as divine virtues;
such are his Mercy, Justice, Patience, Faithfulness, Holiness, Wisdom, etc.
and at other some as divine excellencies resulting out of all the former; such
are Majesty, Blessedness and Glory.

. 3. Thirdly, so as to prevent our misapprehensions. The Attributes of God
however diversified in our conceptions (as has been said) are identified with
his Essence, which is but One: though to us they appear to be different each
from other, and all from it; as the vast ocean, though but one, receives
diverse names from the several shores it washes upon: so however Justice,
Mercy, Power and the rest, be several names suited to different operations;
yet God is but one simple Act under those various denominations. Lest we should
therefore apprehend them to be such qualities as our virtues are, really
distinguishable, yea and separable from our being (as appeared when the first
man fell from his holiness, yet continued a man still) Scripture does sometimes
predicate them of God in the abstract: as when Christ is styled Wisdom; when
it is said, God Proverb. 8. 1 John 1. 8. 1 John 5. 6.
is love, and the Spirit is truth. Men may be called loving, wise and true: God
is love, wisdom and truth it self. The Apostle tells us that if God swear,
he does it by himself and no other; yet we Heb. 6. 13.
find him in the Psalm swearing by his Psalm. 89. 35.
holiness: whence it follows that his holiness is himself. Christ is usually
said to sit at the right hand of God; but in one place it is expressed by sitting
on the right hand of power: Therefore God Mark 14. 62.
is Power, as well as Love. There is the same reason of all his attributes.

. 4. Fourthly, So as to raise our esteem of God. Some there be which are
frequently called Communicable Attributes, because in them the creatures share,
as being, immortality, goodness, and wisdom. Lest we should in this respect
have lower thoughts of God then becomes us, Scripture is wont to ascribe them
to him in such a way of supereminence as, (however they be participated by
Angels and men yet) he only is said to have them. Witness these texts, There
is none Isa. 49. 6.
besides me. Who only has immortality. 1 Timothy 6 16. and Chap. 1. 17. Matthew.
19. 17.
God only wife. And There is none good but God. Because in him they are all
infinite, all eternal, all unmixed, and without the least allay of
imperfection. An apostrophe borrowed from a devout, though popish, writer,
shall shut up this. O abyss of divine perfections! How admirable art thou, O
Lord, who possessest in one only perfection the excellecy of Fr. Sales. Love
of God. lib. 2. cap. 1. 3. page 74.
all perfections, in so excellent sort, that none is able to comprehend it but
thy self!

. 5. There is yet behind, a third kind of knowledge far exceeding both the
former. A knowledge of God not proceeding from the light of Nature alone, as
the first does; nor of Scripture alone, as the second; but from effectual
irradiations of the Spirit of Ephesians. 1. 17.
wisdom and revelation, accompanied with purging and cheering influences from
the same spirit. Look as the Literal makes an addition of further discoveries
to the Natural (which has been sufficiently proved) So this Spiritual
knowledge of God superadds even to the Literal sundry particulars, not unworthy
of our serious consideration, viz.

First, Clearness of light. Since the Canon of Scripture was perfected, the
things which the Holy Ghost discovers are no other for substance, but those
very things which are contained in the written word: only he affords
regenerate persons clearer light to discern them by, then any they had before
their conversion. Take a man that is now become a learned Critic, turn him to
the same Author which he perused when he was a young student; he will find
the self-same matter, but see a great deal further into it, because he has now
got further light. So is it here.

Secondly, Sweetness of taste. I sat Cantic. 2. 3.
down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.
So the Spouse. O taste and see that the Lord is Esal. 39. 8.
good. So the Psalmist. Upon which place the Schoolmen have founded their
distinction of knowledge of sight and a knowledge of taste. Spiritual science
Scientia visus gust^^.
is steeped in affection; taking delight in the things known, and not barely
apprehending, but relishing and savouring what it apprehends with abundance
of love and complacency. Whence those expressions in Solomon's song, Because of
the savor of thy Cantle. 1. 3. Nescit divina, qui non optat, qui non amal. Jo.
Eusebius. Nicomb. Theopolit. page 91.
good ointments, thy name is as an ointment poured forth, therefore do the
Virgins love thee, He does not know the things of God (says a late writer
well) who does not desire and love them.

. 6. Thirdly, Sense of interest. Of the Zidonians God said, They shall know
that I am the Lord: But of his own people Ezekiel. 28. 22. compared with verse 26.
Ephesians. 1. 13.
Israel, They shall know that I am the Lord their God. Paul of the believing
Ephesians concerning Christ, In whom ye trusted, after that ye had heard the
word of truth, the Gospel of your salvation. Others may consider the Gospel as
a word of truth, and a doctrine holding forth salvation; but such as are
savingly enlightened and sanctified by the Spirit, view the salvation it
holds forth as theirs, and are ready to say of every truth therein contained,
This is good and good for me. Happy man, whosoever thou art, that can look by
an eye of faith at the Gospel as the Charter of thy liberties, at the
condemning Law as cancelled by thy Surety, at the Earth as the footstool of thy
Fathers throne, at Heaven as the portall of thy Fathers house, at all the
creatures in Heaven and Earth as an heir is wont to look at his fathers
servants, which are therefore his, so far as he shall have need of them,
according to that, All 1 Cor. 3. 22, 23.
are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is Gods.

Fourthly, Sincerity of obedience. No doubt but Elies two sons, being Priests
had a literal knowledge of God; yet being profane, they are said expressly not
to have known him. They 1 Samuel 2. 12.
were sons of Belial; they knew not the Lord. When Lucius a bloody persecuter
offered to confess his Faith, in hope thereby to beget in the auditors a good
opinion of his orthodoxy, Moses the religious Monk refused to hear him, saying,
The eye might sometimes judge Ruffin. histor. Eccles. lib. 2. cap. 6.
of ones faith as well as the ear: and that whosoever lived as Lucius did,
could not believe as a Christian ought. Fully consonant hereunto is that of
James, I will James 2. 18.
show thee my faith by my works. That of John, He that says, I know God, and
keeps 1 John 2. 4.
not his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him. And that of Job,
Behold the fear of the Lord that is wisdom, Job 22. last.
and to depart from evil is understanding.

APHORISM IV. Goodness and Greatness are Attributes so comprehensive, as to
include a multitude of divine perfections.
EXERCITATION 1. Exerc. 1.
God described from goodness and greatness both without and within the Church.
A lively pourtraiture of his goodness in the several branches thereof. Exodus
34. 6, 7. Bowels of mercy implying inwardness and tenderness. Our bowels of
love to God, of compassion to brethren. Mercy not to be refused by unbelief,
nor abused by presumption.
. 1. THe most learned among the Heathen made account they had sufficiently
characterized their Jupiter, when (...). Optimus Maximus.
they styled him Good and Great, yea the Best and Greatest of Beings. Neither
can it be denied that these two attributes, if we take them in their latitude,
Aph. 4.
comprehend very many of those perfections, which commonly go under other
names. And this perhaps may be the reason why David in Psalm one hundred forty
fifth (which the Rabbis are said to have esteemed so Coppen in argumento Psalm.
145.
highly of, as to determine, but with more superstition then truth, that
whosoever repeated in thrice every day might be sure of eternal life) having
set himself to extol God and to bless his name, as appears by the first and
second verses, insisteth chiefly on these two. Great is the Lord, and greatly
to be Psalm. 145. v. 3.
praised, and his greatness is unsearchable. Shortly after, They shall
abundantly utter Verse. 7. 8, 9.
the memory of thy great goodness. The Lord is gracious and full of compassion,
slow to anger and of great mercy. The Lord is good to all; and his tender
mercies are over all his works. I shall accordingly treat of both, and first of
his Goodness.

. 2. Moses was skilled in all the Acts 7. 22.
learning of the Egyptians; yet as not content herewith, he becomes an humble
suitor to God for some further and better knowledge, I beseech thee (says he)
Exodus 33. 18.
show me thy glory. Other notions may fill the head of a moral man: nothing
short of the knowledge of God can satisfy the heart of a Saint. Wherefore in
answer to this request, the Lord makes him a promise, saying, I will make
Verse 19.
all my goodness pass before thee. The thing desired was a sight of his glory;
the thing promised a view of his Goodness. Which intimates that however in
themselves all the Attributes of God be glorious, yet he glories most in the
manifestation of his goodness, neither does any bring him in so much glory from
the creatures who are wont to magnify this most. I will mention the Isai 63. 7.
loving kindnesses of the Lord, and the praises of the Lord, according to all
that the Lord has bestowed on us; and the great goodness toward the house of
Israel, which he has bestowed on them, according to his mercies, and according
to the multitude of his loving kindnesses. So the Church in Isaiah.

Now the forementioned promise made to Moses in Exodus the three and thirtieth,
was made good in chapter the thirty fourth, where the Lord is said to have
passed by him, and proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God merciful Exodus, 34, 6. 7.
Totum hunc locu^ ad bonitatem Dei pertinere asserit Ludovic. de Dieu
Auimadvers. in loc.
and gracious, long-suffering and abundant in bounty and truth, keeping mercy
for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and sin, and that will by
no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
children, and upon the childrens children unto the third, and to the fourth
generation. All which clauses, (even the latter, expounded by most of Gods
Justice) may be so interpreted as to relate to his Goodness rather.

It is twofold, one Essential, that wherewith God is good in himself, the other
Relative, that whereby he does good to his creatures. The former is here set
forth by the term Jehovah, which is doubled, and does most fully serve to
express it, as coming from a root, that signifies Being. For Goodness and
Entity are convertible, and Diabolus in quantum est, bonus est. August p. de
Nature. (...). c. 5.
every thing so far forth as it partaketh of Being, partaketh also of Bonity:
wherefore God in whom all degrees of Entity meet is undoubtedly most good. The
latter in the title El, which as a learned Jew affirms, does not less clearly
express his influence, then Jehovah does his Essence: El and Elohim Abarbanel
apud Joann. Buxtorf fill. in Dissertat. de Nominibus Dei Hebraice these. 39 and
41.
in their most proper notion (as he tells us) signifying the author and
producer of things by an infinite power. Of this Relative goodness there are
sundry distinct branches mentioned in this superexcellent Text, which are
spoken to in their order.

. 3. The First is Mercy. The nature (...) (...) (...) intra viscera recepit,
(...). Luc. 1. 78.
whereof may receive much light from the Hebrew word which is here made use of.
It comes from a root that signifies shutting up in ones bowels, as
childbearing women retain and cherish their dearest offspring within their
wombs. Accordingly we read in Luke of the bowels of Gods mercy; a phrase which
implies both inwardness and tenderness. First inwardness, our bowels are the
most inner parts: The mercy of God springs from within, and has no original
cause without himself. Humane affection is commonly both begotten and fed by
somewhat without, in the thing or person beloved; as culinary fire must be
kindled and kept in by external materials: But God loves because he loves,
Deuteronomy. 7. 7, 8. Exodus 33. 19.
and shows mercy on whom he will show mercy; as celestial fire is fuel to it
self. He freely extends mercy to us in making us good, then does us good for
being so; is not this a merciful God? Secondly tenderness. The forecited
passage in Luke runs thus in our translation, Through the tender mercies of
our God. Of all parts the bowels relent and earn most. In them we are wont to
find a stirring, when strong affections of love or pity are excited, as Joseph
did upon sight of Benjamin. Genesis 43. 30.
God speaking after the manner of men uses this pathetical expression
concerning his people, How shall I give thee Hos. 11. 8.
up Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah?
how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings
are kindled together. His people accordingly cry to him, Where is thy zeal,
and thy strength? the Isai. 63. 15.
sounding of thy bowels, and of thy mercies are they restrained? Of all humane
bowels those of mothers are the tenderest. Can a woman (says the Lord) forget
her sucking Isai. 49. 15.
child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yet sooner
shall all the mothers in the world prove unnatural, then he unmercifull: for so
it follows, yea they may forget, yet will not I forget thee.

. 4. Well may this notion of mercy put us in mind of returning bowels of love
to God, according to what David said in the beginning of Psalm the eighteenth,
I will love thee O Lord my strength; where the word comes from (...) Ex
intimis visceribus diligam te. Psalm. 18. 1.
the same forementioned root, and intimates exercising love out of his most
inward bowels: as also of extending bowels of compassion to those especially
that stand in nearest relation to him, according to that of John, Whosoever has
this worlds goods, and sees his brother has need, and shuts up 1 Job. 3.
17.
his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him? But
that is not all the improvement we are to make of this Attribute. As it is a
most tender affection, so is it to be most tenderly used. Take we therefore
diligent heed, as of refusing it by unbelief, so, of abusing it by presumption.

First, of refusing mercy by unbelief. Many, Jonah. 2. 8.
as the phrase is in Jonah, forsake their own mercy, by giving way to
objections arising from the flesh, like smoke out of that bottomless pit in
Revelation. Say not therefore God is so angry with me, the arrows of the
Almighty stick so fast, and the poison thereof does so drink up my spirit, that
I cannot expect any mercy from him. Know that the Lord is wont even in wrath to
remember mercy: and that the Habak. (...). 3.
correction which thou at present look at as an argument of wrath, may
perhaps be an evidence of love, and an act of mercy. God is not about to hew
thee down, as thy unbeleeving heart imagines, but to prune thee for prevention
of luxuriancy. Be sure the right hand of his clemency knows whatever the left
hand of his severitie does. Thou had better be a chastened son, then an
undisciplined bastard. There is no anger to that in Isaiah, Why Isai. 1. 5.
should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: That in Ezekiel,
I will Ezekiel. 16. 42.
make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee;
and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry; That in Hos. 4. 17. Tunc magis
irascitur quando non irascitur. Super o^nen iram miseratio ista. Bernard.
Hosea, He is joined to idols, let him alone. Then is God most angry of all,
when he refuses to be angry; yea there is no anger of his to be compared to
this kind of mercy. Men that are fatted to destruction often go prosperously
on in the world, have few afflictions in their life, no bands in their death:
but as Erasmus once said, From this prosperity Absit a nobis, chrissimi, alis
selicitas. Erasm. in concione de misericordia.
good Lord deliver us.

Say not I am unworthy, and must therefore despair; for mercy is free, and if
God should show mercy to none but such as are worthy of it, he should show
mercy to none at all, seeing All have sinned and come short, as of the glory,
so, of the mercy of God. Say not my sins are many and great, too many and too
great to be pardoned: but oppose to the multitude of thy transgressions that
multitude of tender mercies mentioned Psalm. 51. 1.
by the Psalmist; not forgetting the gracious invitation by another Prophet,
Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughtss; and let
him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for
he will abundantly pardon, or, multiple pardon, as the original phrase imports.
To the greatness of thy sins oppose the riches of Gods mercy, and greatness of
his love spoken of by the great Apostle. God, says he, who is rich in mercy,
for his Ephesians. (...). 4.
great love wherewith he loved us. Lo here a vast heap, whereunto men may come
with confidence, be it never so much they have need of, because these riches
are not impaired by being imported. The mercies of an infinite God are infinite
mercies, and so able to swallow up all the sins of finite creatures. What
though thou have heretofore delighted in sin? despair not, for he delights in
Micah 7. 18.
mercy, mercy pleases him, as much as ever any sin did thee. What though thy
rebellion has been long continued? The Psalm 103. 17.
mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him.
Yea what though to former guilt thou have added backsliding, and relapses to
rebellion? yet remember that in Jeremiah. Return Jerem. (...). 22.
ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings, together with
that in the last of Hosea, where Israel had no sooner said, In thee the
fatherless finds mercy, but it follows immediately, I will heal Hos. 14. 3,
4.
their backslidings, I will love them freely. But lest any should surfeit on
these sweet meats, take we heed.

. 5. Secondly, Of abusing mercy by presumption. Mercy improved opens to us
the surest refuge; Mercy abused brings upon us the sorest vengeance. It would
be considered that there is one kind of presumers whom mercy it self is
resolved to have no mercy on, so long as they continue such: to wit, those that
dare expect it, notwithstanding their resolution to go on in their impenitence,
and ignorance of God. For thus says the God of heaven concerning him, Who
blesses himself in his heart, saying, I Deuteronomy. 29. 19, 20, 21.
shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart, to add
drunkenness to thirst, The Lord will not spare him, but the anger of the Lord
and his jealousy shall smoke against that man; and the curses that are written
in this book shall lie upon him; and the Lord shall blot out his name from
under heaven; and shall separate him unto evil. And again, It is a people of no
Isa. 27. 11.
understanding; therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he
that formed them will show them no favor. Such shall at length find to their
costs that the Justice of God, as well as his Mercy endures for ever: And that
as nothing is more calm then a smooth, more raging then a tempestuous sea;
nothing more cold then lead when it is taken out of the mine, nor more scalding
when it is heated; nothing blunter then iron, yet when it is whetted nothing
more sharp: So none more merciful then God, but if his patience be turned to
fury by our provocations, none more terrible. Because I have purged thee, says
the Lord, and thou wast not purged; thou shall not be purged from thy
filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee. I the Lord
have spoken Ez^k. 24. 13, 14.
it, and I will do it I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I
repent etc. Woe and again woe to them all, against whom mercy it self shall rise
up in judgment. Look as the power of God, though infinite, receives
limitations from his will; He could have made millions of worlds, would make
but one: In like manner his infinite mercy is also limited by his will; and his
word the interpreter of his will; plainly tells us that, as Physicians begin
with preparatives, so he begets fear in their hearts, whom he intends mercy
to. Look as a father pittieth his his children, so the Lord pittieth them that
Psalm. 103. 13, 17, 18.
fear him. The mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them
that fear him, to such as keep his Covenant, and to those that remember his
commandments to do them. Not they that presume, but that fear; not such as
break, but as keep his Covenant; not those that forget, but that remember his
Commandments to do them; or at least whose earnest desires and endeavors are
that way bent, may expect and shall Exerc. 2.
receive mercy from him. They shall find by sweet experience the infallible
truth of what Mr Peacock once said Mr R. Boltons Instructions page 87.
upon his recovery out of a deep and long desertion, viz. That the sea is not
more full of water, nor the sun of light, then the Lord is of mercy.

EXERCITATION 2. Grace what. From it spring Election, Redemption, Vocation,
Sanctification and Salvation. A Caveat not to receive it in vain. It purges
and cheereth. Glosses upon Titus 2. 11, 12. and 2 Thessalonians. 2. 26, 17. The
exaltation of free grace exhorted to. Long-suffering not exercised toward evil
Angels, but toward men of all sorts. It leads to repentance; is valued by
God, and must not be slighted by us. A dreadful example of goodness despised.
. 1. A Second branch of Gods goodness is Grace, which relates to unworthiness,
as the former did to misery. God is merciful to the ill-deserving, Gracious to
the undeserving. So far are we from being able to merit so much as the crumbs
which fall from his table, that even temporal favors are all from grace. Noah
was preserved in the deluge. Why? because He found Genesis 6. 8.
grace in the eyes of the Lord. Jacob was enriched, and had enough. How came it
to pass? Because God, said he to Esau, Genesis 33. 11.
has dealt graciously with me. But beside that common favor which all share
in more or less, there is a more special grace, which the Psalmist prays for,
Remember me, O Lord, with the favor that thou bear unto thy people; O visit
me with Psalm. 106. 5.
thy salvation.

. 2. This third is drawn throughout the whole web of salvation, and there is
not a round in the ladder to heaven, which does not give every one that
steppeth upon it just occasion of crying, Grace, Grace. Did the Lord elect thee
to life and glory, when so many were passed by? What reason can be given of
this but free grace? Paul styleth it the election of grace in his Romans 11. 5.
epistle to the Romans; and tells his Ephesians that God had chosen them in
Ephesians. 1. 4, 5, 6.
Christ before the foundation of the world, according to the good pleasure of
his will, to the praise of the glory of his Ibid. verse. 7.
grace. Have thou obtained redemption through the blood of Jesus? That also,
says he there, flows from the riches of his grace. Has the Lord effectually
called thee? Bow down thine head and adore free grace, as the cause thereof.
For he saves and calls us 2 Timothy 1. 9.
says the same holy Apostle, with an holy calling, not according to our works,
but according to his own purpose and grace. So in the Acts, when a great number
believed, and were turned to Christianity, Barnabas saw the grace of Act. 11.
21. 23.
God, shining forth in their conversion. Have thou received any abilities
tending either to thine own sanctification, or to the edification of others? Do
the like upon this occasion too, as Paul did, saying, By the grace of God I am
what 1 Cor. 15. 10
I am; and his grace, which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I
labored more abundantly then they all; yet not I, but the grace of God, which
was with me. In a word, do thou find in thy self any beginnings of
salvation, any hopes that it shall be perfected? Remember what that great
asserter of free grace has left upon record to all posterity. By grace Ephesians. 2.
8.
ye are saved through faith; and that not of your selves, it is the gift of
God. Remember it so, as

. 3. First, to beware of receiving the grace of God in vain, it being ordained
for better ends, to wit, purging and cheering of such as receive it. The grace
of Titus 2. 11, 12.
God that brings salvation, has appeared to all men, teaching us that
denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously and
godly in this present world. All partakers of grace should not only deny that
gross ungodliness of conversation, which the very sons of morality decrie and
abhor; but also worldly lusts, which others are secretly indulgent to. Neither
should they content themselves with a negative purity, such as that of the
Pharisee was, I am not as Luke 18. 11.
other men; not as this publicane; not an extortioner, not an adulterer,
(Logicians say of this particle Not, that it is of a malignant nature; Divines
know that the malignant Church is much built up by such negatives) but also
practice positive holiness, by living soberly, righteously and godly, and that
too in this present world: not putting on a vizard of these, as the manner of
some is, on a sick bed, or death bed, when they can no longer look at
themselves, as men of this world, but of another. As for cheering, remarkable
is that prayer made in behalf of the Thessalonians, Now our Lord Jesus Christ
himself, and God 2 Thessalonians. 2. 16, 17.
even our Father, which has loved us, and has given us everlasting
consolation, and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts. It implies that
whereas we cannot possibly raise from our selves any ground of hope, or have
any lasting, much less everlasting consolation from the creatures, Grace is a
firm foundation for both. And this is it, which has put the prince of darkness
(whose desire it has always been to keep men in as hopeless and comfortless
condition as he can) upon using his utmost endeavors in all ages of the
Church, either to obstruct the doctrine of free grace, as by Pelagian and
Arminian tenants, or to poison this fountain with corrupt deductions and
inferences, as by Antinomians and Familists. Wherefore remember it so, as

. 4. Secondly, In all thy tenants and discourses to magnify and exalt that to
which thou owe so very much, indeed thine All that good is. Think it not
enough, with some, of a Non est devotionis dedisse prope totum, sed fraudis
retinuisse vel minimum.
thousand parts to ascribe nine hundred ninety and nine to free grace,
reserving but one for free will: for as Prosper resolves the case well, It is
not devotion to give almost the whole to God, but deceit to retain the least
part. And again, Grace is Gratia Dei tota repellitur, nisi tota suscipiatur.
wholly repelled, where it is not wholly entertained. I list not now to dispute
the point: Only let me have leave to commend to thy reading and observation a
paper of verses, inserted by certain Divines that were present at the Synod of
Dort, into their suffrage, and comprehending a brief decision of the five
Articles there debated, with a pious inference from thence; because with me
they have ever been of great esteem since I first met with them in the Acts of
that Synod.

Gratia sola Dei certos elegit ab aevo; Acta Synod. Dordrect. in 4o. page 293.

Dat Christum certis gratia sola Dei;
Gratia sola Dei fidei dat munera certis;
Stare facit certos gratia sola Dei.
Gratia sola Dei cum nobis omnia donet,
Omnia nostra regat gloria sola Dei.
In English thus, Free grace alone elected some to bliss;
Free grace alone gave Christ to death for some;
In some free grace works faith that saving is,
Some by free grace to perseverance come.
Since Gods sole grace does all our good provide,
Let Gods sole glory all our motions guide.


. 5. A third branch of divine goodness is Long-suffering; whereby God has been
pleased to put a notable difference between Angels that fell, and the lapsed
sons of Adam. Of them Peter says, God spared not the Angels that 2 Pet. 2. 4.
sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of
darkness, to be reserved unto judgment. This was quick and speedy work. But
the Lord says 2 Pet. 3. 9.
the same Apostle, is Long-suffering to usward. He exercises much patience,
very much, even toward all, though vessels of wrath. For so Paul, What if Romans
9. 22.
God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much
longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction? How profane was the
old world? How wicked a place was Jericho? yet was he one hundred and twenty
years in warning those of that age, before he brought the deluge upon them: And
he that made the world in six, was seven days in destroying that one city. The
great Doctor of the Gentiles was not much more then thirty years old, when God
converted him: yet we find him looking at this as infinite patience, as all
long-suffering, that he was born with so long. I obtained mercy (says he) that
in me first 1 Timothy 1. ^6.
Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering. How sensible then ought they
to be of this Attribute, whom God has born with forty, fifty, sixty years,
and still continues to cry unto, as it is in Habakkuk, Woe to him that
increases that Habak. 2. 6.
which is not his: How long? as in Jeremy, O Jerusalem wash thine heart from
wickedness, Jerem. 4. 14.
that thou may be saved: How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?
And again, Woe unto thee O Jerusalem, wilt Jerem. 13. 27.
thou not be made clean? When shall it once be. All which places declare
sufficiently that the long-suffering God does in a manner long to see our
conversion to him.

. 6. And that indeed is the most proper use we can make hereof according to
Paul's expostulation, Despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance,
Romans 2. 4.
and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to
repentance. Verily we cannot meet on this side hell with a worse temper of
spirit then that which inclines a sinner to despise the forbearance of God, and
to kick against the bowels of his goodness: As that profane Arian did, who was
executed at Norwich, concerning whom Mt Greenham acquainteth us with this
strange and prodigious narration. Mr Greenham in his treatise entitled, A
sweet comfort for an afflicted conscience on Prove. 18. 14. circa medium.
This hellish heretic, says he, (for so were the deniers of Christ's Divinity
accounted of in those days, whatever thoughts be had of them in these) a little
before he was to be executed, afforded a few whorish tears, asking, whether he
might be saved by Christ or no? When one told him that if he truly repented he
should surely not perish; he brake out into this speech, Nay, if your Christ be
so easy to be entreated indeed, as you say, then I defy him, and care not for
him. Horrible blasphemy! desperate wickedness for a man to draw himself back
from repentance by that very cord of love, whereby he should have been drawn to
it. The next degree of impiety is, when men are therefore bold to continue long
in sinning, because he with whom they have to do is a long-suffering God. A
vice which the Preacher of old took notice of. Because sentence against an evil
work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully
set in them to do evil. But let such fear and tremble at what follows, Though
a sinner does evil Eccles 8 11, 12, 13.
an hundred times, and his days be prolonged; yet surely I know it shall not be
well with the wicked. The Lord valueth every moment of his forbearance, as in
the parable, Behold these three years I come seeking Luke 13. 7.
fruit on this fig tree, and find none. Christ sets an high price upon every
exercise of his patience, as in the Canticles, Open to me, for my head is
filled with Cantic. 5. 2.
dew, and my locks with the drops of the night. Take we heed of sleighting that
which God and Christ value. Know and consider that patience may be tired, that
however the Lord be long-suffering, yet he will not suffer for ever, but be
weary of repenting in case men will not be weary of sinning. Hear what was once
said by himself to Jerusalem, Thou have forsaken me, says the Lord, thou
Jerem. 15. 6.
art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and
destroy thee: I am weary with repenting.

EXERCITATION 3. Exerc. 3.
The bounty of God declared by his benefits, viz. giving his Son to free us
from hell, his Spirit to fit us for heaven, his Angels to guard us on earth,
large provisions in the way, and full satisfaction at our journeys end. Joh. 3.
16. James 1. 5. and Psalm. 24. 1. Glossed. Isai. 25. 6. Alluded to. Inferences
from divine Bounty, beneficence to Saints; not dealing niggardly with God,
exemplified in David, Paul, and Luther. Truth in God is without all mixture of
the contrary. It appears in his making good of promises, and threatenings;
teaching us what to perform and what to expect.
. 1. OUr Bibles in the next clause, making use of the generical term, have it,
Abundant in goodness. I will make bold to vary a little from the common
translation, and to read it, Abundant in bounty, because the word, as Zanchy
and others have observed, most properly signifies that kind of (...) proprie
significat benignitatem, seu liberalem beneficentiam. Zanch. de Nature. Dei, l.
1. c^. 18. Vide Fulleri miscellan. lib. 1. c. 8.
goodness, which we call Bounty or Benignity, and which makes a fourth branch.
This God is abundant in: witness the greatest of his gifts, by which we are
wont to measure the bounty of benefactours. I shall instance in some of the
chief. He bestows upon us,

First, His son to free us from hell. God Joh. 3. 16.
so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son. He did not grant him
upon Non concessit, sed purissime dedit. Stella.
the request and earnest suit of lapsed creatures; but freely gave him unasked;
not a servant but a Son; not an adopted son, such as we are, but a begotten,
begotten, not as Saints are, of his Jam. 1. 18.
will by the word of truth, but of his Nature; he himself being the Word and
the Truth; not one of many, but an only Son thus begotten; and this not for
the procuring of some petty deliverance, but that whosoever believes in him
should not perish, but have everlasting life. Well might this gift of royal
bounty be ushered in with a God so loved the world. Majesty and love have been
thought Non been convenient, nec in una sede morantur Maj^stas and amo^.
hardly compatible. Yet behold the majesty of God bearing love, and that to the
world, the undeserving, yea illdeserving world of mankind. Herein is love,
(says St John elsewhere, let me say, herein is bounty) not that we loved 1 John 4. 10.
God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our
sins. Loved, and So loved; that particle is most emphatical, and notes the
transcendency of a thing, either good or evil. Paul speaking of the incestuous
Corinthian decyphers him thus, Him that has so 1 Cor. 5. 3.
done this deed; so impudently, so abominably, so unchristianly. The officers
being astonished at our. Saviors doctrine, cried out, Never man spoke so as Joh.
7. 46.
this man; so excellently, so powerfully, so incomparably. Here, God so loved
the world, that is, so freely, so infinitely, so unspeakably. The Apostle
himself, who had been rapt up to the third heaven, and there heard things not
to be uttered, wants words, when he comes to utter this; and uses an
accumulation of many; because no one could serve his turn to express it
sufficiently. Not content to have styled it love, mercy, grace; as not having
yet said enough, he calls it great love, glorious grace; rich mercy, yea,
exceeding riches Ephesians. 2. 4, 5, 7.
of his glorious and merciful grace, in his second chapter to the Ephesians.

. 2. Secondly, His Spirit to fit us for heaven. Our heavenly Father is he that
gives the holy Spirit to them that ask Luke 11. 13.
him. The Spirit thus given works in us regeneration (we are therefore said
to be born of the Spirit) and that real holiness, Joh. 3. 5. 6.
concerning which the Apostle says, without it no man shall see the Lord:
Hebr. 12. 14.
So preparing us for that place, which our Lord Jesus is gone before to prepare
Joh. 14. 2, 3.
for us. A daily conversation in heaven is the surest forerunner of a constant
abode there. The Spirit, by enabling us hereunto, first brings heaven into
the soul, then conducteth the soul to it. Whence it is that Nehemiah, recording
the acts of Gods bounty to Israel, reckons this as one of the principal, Thou
gave also thy good Spirit to instruct Nehem. 9. 20.
them.

Thirdly, His Angels to guard us on earth. After David had said, The angel of
the Lord encampeth round about them that Psalm. 34. 7, 8.
fear him, and delivers them, he adds immediately, O taste and see that the
Lord is good; herein good, in bestowing such a guard upon us. It was an act of
royal benignity toward Mordechai in king Ahashuerus, to make Haman the
favorite, his attendant as he rode through the streets: Lo here a far greater;
the holy Angels, those favorites in the Court of heaven, are all ministering
spirits, Hebr. 1. 14.
sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation. A task which
they perform without grudging, (although in themselves more noble creatures
then we are) both out of love to their younger brethren, of whom they have a
most tender care; and out of obedience to God, their Father and ours, Psalm. 91.
11. Mittis Unigenitum, immittis Spiritum, ne quid vacet in coelestibus ab opere
solicituelinis, Angelos mittis in ministerium.
who has given them charge so to do, as it is in the Psalm, He shall give his
Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. Lay this to the former
(as Bernard did) and we shall see the whole heaven at work for our
preservation; God the Father sending his Son to redeem us; the Fathet and Son
sending their Spirit to guide us; the Father, Son, and Spirit sending their
Angels to minister for us. O taste and see that the Lord is good, bountifully
good!

. 3. Fourthly, Large provisions in the way. We consist of body and soul; he
provideth plentifully for both; giving 1. Tim. 6. 17.
us richly all things to enjoy, as one Apostle phraseth it, yea as another,
giving unto Jam. 1. 5.
all men liberally and not upbraiding. Whereas ordinary benefactours, by reason
of their stinted abilities give either but a few things, or to a few persons
only, or if to many, but sparingly; and are besides apt to corrupt and blemish
their good turns by casting them in the Authors pereunt garrulitate sui.
Martial.
receivers teeth, and making their boast continually of them: all these are
here removed from God, whilst he is said to give unto all men, and that
liberally, yea and so as not to upbraid; although whatever men receive, yea
whatever they are, (sin excepted) be wholly his. That of the Psalmist is very
emphatical, and well deserves our consideration. The earth is the Lords, Psalm.
24. 1.
and the fullness thereof, the world, and they that dwell therein. The house
wherein a man dwells, may be his landlords; but the furniture his own. Here
we are told that not the earth only, but the fullness of it is the Lords. Both
house and furniture may be another; but he that inhabiteth it his own man.
Here they that dwell therein are the Lords, the inhabitants themselves, as the
room and the stuff. To which agrees that of St Paul, ye are not your own; 1
Cor. 6. 19.
and that of an ancient writer cited by Heinsius. Our very being is none of
Nostrum non est quod sumus, multo minus quod habemus.
ours; much less the things we have in possession. As for spiritual provisions,
his people use not to be scanted in them. Another particular reckoned up by
Nehemiah, when he set himself to celebrate the acts of divine bounty toward
Israel^, was the institution of Ordinances. Thou came down also (says Nehem.
9. 13. 14.
he speaking to God) upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and
gave them right judgments and true laws, good statutes and commandments;
and made known unto them thy holy Sabbath. One way whereby great Princes are
wont to manifest their royal bounty is the making of great feasts, as
Ahasuerus, and Solomon did: we may safely allude to the Prophets expression
(though the place have another meaning) and say of the Church in that respect,
In this mountain does the Lord of hosts make Isai. 25. 6.
unto all people a feast of fat things, of wine on the lees; of fat things full
of marrow, of wine on the lees well refined. Good Sermons and Prayers are like
well refined wines: and as Christ himself is a Savior full of merits, so is
his Gospel a doctrine full of promises; his Supper a Sacrament full of
mysteries; his Sabbath a day full of opportunities; all his Ordinances fat
things full of marrow.

. 4. Fifthly, Full satisfaction at our journeys end. Now indeed, as the
natural, so the spiritual eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the spiritual
ear with hearing; because we see but as through a 1 Cor. 13. 12.
glass darkly, not face to face, and know but in part that of which we hear.
Then shall eye and ear have enough, when we shall see God as he is; and hear
Christ 1 John 3. 2.
saying, Come ye blessed of my Father; inherit Matthew. 25. 34.
the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. Here, although
believing souls have fellowship with Sistitur appetitus in via, satiatur in
patria.
God in Christ sufficient to stay their stomachs as at a breakfast; yet that
degree of fruition is wanting which should satiate them fully, as at a feast
beyond that of Ordinances. What shall there be enjoyed will replenish every
chink of rational appetites; the first Truth filling up our understandings, and
the chief Good our wills to the very brim. Then shall that be to the utmost
verified, which David once said of regenerate persons, They shall be abundantly
Psalm. 36. 8. 9.
satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shall make them drink of the
river of thy pleasures: for with thee is the fountain of life, in thy light
shall we see light.

. 5. For improvement hereof. As our Savior once said, Be ye merciful: so Be
ye bountiful, let me say, as your father is bountiful. St Paul having praised
the Macedonians for their deep poverty abounding unto the riches of their
liberality, urges the grace and benignity of Christ as a principal motive to
excite his Corinthians to a like exercise of bounty toward the poor Saints at
Jerusalem. For ye know, says 2 Cor. 8. 2, 9.
he, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your
sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be-rich. More
especially let us all learn from hence not to deal niggardly with God himself;
but to think no pains too great, no expense too much, no time too long that is
spent in his service: Not, as the manner of some is, who so manage the
profession of religion, as if their main care and study were how to serve him
with most ease, and to come off with the cheapest performances. David, Paul,
and Luther, were men of another spirit. The first, as he delighted in the
commemoration of divine bounty to him, saying, I will Psalm. 13. 6.
sing unto the Lord, because he has dealt bountifully with me: And again,
Return Psalm. 116. 7.
unto thy rest O my soul, for the Lord has dealt bountifully with thee; so he
was no niggard in his returns, but ever and anon enquiring what he should do to
testify his thankfulness, What shall I Psalm. 116. 12.
render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me? And as providence
offered occasion laying himself out for God; witness that his resolution,
testified to Araunah the Jebusite, not to offer unto the Lord of that which
cost him nothing. 2 Samuel 24. 24.
The second was willing to 2 Cor. 12. 15.
spend and to be spent in the work of his ministry; and not to be bound only,
Acts 21. 13.
but to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus, who had there
suffered not bonds only, but death for him. The third, during his retirement
in the castle at Coburga for the Nullus abit dies quin ad minimum tres horas,
casque studiis aptissimas in orationem parat. Melch. Adam. in vita Lutheris.
page 138, 142.
safety of his person, having then more time to spare for devotion then his
many public employments had been wont to afford him, was no niggard of it; But
as one Vitus Theodorus, who then lived with him, informed Melanchthon, spent no
less in prayer to God then at least three hours every day, and those such
hours as were fittest for study. And yet O the business of some men's spirits!
whose services cost them very little or no intention, whilst in stead of using
the world, as if they used it not, they use good duties as if they did not use
them; pray as if they prayed not, hear as if they heard not, keep the Sabbath
as if they kept it not, and repent as they did no such thing: Who although they
profess believing in Christ, and know that God spared not Romans 8. 32.
his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, yet deal so sparingly with the
Lord, as to grudge him (I say not every drop of blood, but) of sweat, yea
almost every minute of time that they spend in his immediate service. Let such
men know that to be over-thirfty in our expenses upon God is the worst piece of
husbandry in the world. I shall dismiss them with that of Moses to those
unthankful men of Israel, Do ye thus requite Deuteronomy. 32. 6.
the Lord, O foolish people and unwise!

. 6. A fifth branch is faithfulness. One letter of this glorious name is
Abundant in truth, that is, in faithfulness. Multus fide, so Junius renders it.
These two are frequently joined in Scripture, as exegeticall of each other. So
when Christ is styled the Amen, the Apoc. 3. 14.
faithful and true witness, and the counsels of God said to be faithfulness
and Isa. 25. 1.
truth. God abounds in it so as to have no mixture of the contrary, although
the best of men have some. Whence that of Paul, Let God be true, that is, Romans
3. 4.
owned and acknowledged for such, but every man a liar. A lightsome body may
have somewhat of darkness in it; for example a precious stone some speck or
cloud, but light it self admits of none. God is light, and in him there is 1
John. 1. 5.
no darkness at all: So God is truth, and in him there is no falsehood at all.
God that cannot lie, says the Apostle. Satan is so the father of lies, as that
he does Tit. 1. 2. Deus est veritas siac fallacia, bonitas sine malitia,
selicitas sine miseria. Fulgent. lib. 1. ad monim. 2 Timothy 2. 13. Diabolus
semper fallax est, sed non semper mendax.
notwithstanding at times speak some truth, to the end he may deceive the
better: God so the father of truth, as that he can never lie, no more then he
can deny himself; which is utterly impossible. If we believe not, yet he
abides faithful, he cannot deny himself. Now his truth appears especially
in two things.

First, The fulfilling of all his promises; which shall as surely receive their
accomplishment in due season, as that of Christ's Incarnation did when the
fullness Galat. 4. 4.
of time was come; and that of bringing the people of Israel out of Egypt at
the Exodus 12. 41.
end of four hundred and thirty years; which was most exactly performed the
self-same day in which that number of years was expired. The Greek word for
truth (as some think) according to its Etymology implies not forgeting (...) ab
(...) particula negetiva and (...) oblivio.
what one has promised. God remembereth whatever he has at any time said, and
that so effectually, as to make every one of his promises good, although
perhaps long after the making of them; yea and after many appearances to the
contrary. See it in Abraham. He receives a command to Genesis 12. 7, 10.
go out to a land which the Lord should show him, and a promise that it should
be given to him and his. He goes; but meets with a great famine at his first
coming thither, which forced him to flee into Egypt for bread, because he was
like to starve there. Yet afterward it proved a land flowing with milk and
honey to his posterity. Another grand promise made to Abraham Genesis 15. 5.
was that his seed should be as the stars of heaven for multitude: yet Isaac
the son of promise was not born till a good while after; and being grown was
like to have been offered up for a sacrifice at Gods command. But the Lord
spared Genesis 25. 20. compared with 26.
him, and a wife is at length procured for him; yet for twenty years together
after his marriage he has no issue by her. All this while how small appearance
is there of a numerous seed? Neither did the posterity of Isaac begin to
multiply of a long time after this: for all the souls of the house of Jacob
Genesis 46. 27.
which came into Egypt were no more but threescore and ten. In Egypt a course
was taken by Pharaohs tyranny to keep them from increasing. But behold the
faithfulness and truth of God, who being mindful of his promise, caused such
fruitfulness amongst them, notwithstanding all obstacles, that there were
numbered in the second year after their coming out of Egypt, more then Numb. 1.
1. compared with chap. 2. 32. 33.
six hundred thousand fighting men, besides women and children, and the whole
tribe of Levi.

. 7. Secondly, The accomplishing of all his threatenings, as it is written, I
the Ezekiel. 24. 14.
Lord have spoken it, it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go
back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent. Accordingly when the seven
Angels appeared with the seven last plagues, they that stood on the sea of
glass, said in their song, Great and mavelous are thy works, Lord God
Almighty, Just and True are thy Rev. 15. 1, 2, 3.
ways, thou King of Saints. And when the third of them poured out his vial upon
the rivers and fountains of water, an Angel out of the altar said, Even Rev.
16. 4, 7.
so Lord God Almighty, True and righteous are thy judgments. If it be objected
that destruction was threatened to Nineve at the end of forty days, but not
then executed, the answer is at hand; Their repentance prevented their ruin.
For as some of Gods promises are made with the condition of faith and
perseverance; so his threatenings are denounced with the exception of
repentance; which though concealed for the most part, is always included, and
sometimes expressed, as in that place of Jeremiah, At what instant I shall
speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, Jer. 18. 7, 8.
to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; If that nation, against whom
I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I
thought to do unto them. Be we admonished from hence,

First, What to practice in reference to God, to wit Truth in our promises to
and covenants with him, that so our returns may be answerable in kind to our
receipts. All his ways are mercy and truth Psalm. 25. 10.
to usward; therefore all ours should be truth and faithfulness toward him.
Thrice happy we, whatever our outward condition prove, if we be able to profess
in the sincerity of our hearts, as they did in Psalm the forty fourth, All
this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt
falsely in thy Covenant. Our principal comfort flows from Gods keeping his
Covenant of grace with us; it should therefore be our principal care to keep
touch with him.

. 8. Secondly, What to look for in reference to our selves. To wit, an exact
fulfilling of all promises and threatenings that are conditional, according to
their several conditions. Has the faithful and true witness said, He that
believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believes not shall be
damned? Let no unbeleever then, whilst he continues in that estate, expect
salvation: neither any that believes and walks in Christ fear damnation,
seeing he has Truth it self engaged for his safety; and seeing the faith of
Gods Tit. 1. 1, 2.
elect, according to St Paul's doctrine, should go hand in hand with the hope of
eternal life, which God that cannot lie promised before the world began. Let
all that wish well to Zion make full account that in due time, The mountain of
the Isai. 2. 2.
Lords house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be
exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow into it; because it has
been promised of old. Let them also know assuredly, that the Lord will consume
Antichrist with the spirit 2 Thessalonians. 2. 8.
of his mouth, and destroy him with the brightness of his coming; because this
commination stands upon the file in holy Scripture, and is not yet completely
verified. Former ages have seen Antichrist Nascent, when the Bishop of Rome
first usurped authority over all the Churches; Antichrist Crescent, when he
began to maintain the doctrine of adoring Images, and praying to Saints
departed; Antichrist Regnant, when he exalted himself above Kings and
Emperors, setting up his mitre above their crowns; yea Antichrist Triumphant,
when he once became Lord of the Catholic faith, so as none might believe
without danger more or less, or otherwise then he prescribed. To this
observation made by one of our own learned countrymen, let me add; we our Dr
Crakanthorp. in his Vigilius dormitans chap. 13. 24.
selves have seen him Antichrist Cadent, falling and waining ever since Luther,
Calvin, Perkins and others were set on work by God to unmask him. And no Exerc.
4.
doubt, if we do not, our posterity shall see him Antichrist morient, dying and
giving up the ghost: for the Lord faithful and true has not only threatened
his ruin, but foretold that his day is coming.

EXERCITATION 4. Keeping mercy for thousands explained. Men exhorted to trust
God with their posterity. Luthers last Will and Testament. Iniquity,
transgression and sin what. Six Scripture-expressions setting out the pardon
thereof. Gods goodness therein. Faith and repentance the way to it. Pardon in
the Court of Heaven, and of Conscience. The equity and necessity of forgiving
one another. We are to forgive as God for Christ's sake forgiveth us viz.
heartily, speedily, frequently, thoroughly. A twofold remembrance of injuries,
in cautelam and in vindictam.
. 1. THe sixth branch of divine goodness, is the Lords keeping mercy for
thousands; which phrase admits of sundry notions, worthy of diligent
consideration.

First, Keeping it as in a storehouse. God is said to be rich unto all that
call upon Romans 10. 12.
him, and we read of the riches of his goodness. These riches are laid up with
him, and kept as in a magazine, to be made use of upon all occasions according
to the emergent necessities of his people. Whence it is, that we also read, of
their obtaining mercy, and finding Hebr. 4. 16.
grace to help in time of need.

Secondly, Keeping it for the present age, as well as having dispensed it
formerly to predecessors. Our fathers were all liberally supplied out of Gods
forementioned Treasury, as it is in Psalm the two and twentieth, Our fathers
trusted in thee; Psalm. 2^. 4, 5.
They trusted, and thou did deliver them; They cried unto thee, and were
delivered; they trusted in thee, and were not confounded. This should be no
disheartning to us, as if his Treasury were exhausted; but encourage us rather,
as Paul's example did succeeding believers. For this 1 Timothy 1. 16.
cause I obtained mercy (said he) that in me first Jesus Christ might show
forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe
on him to life everlasting. Which is the next observable.

Thirdly, Keeping it for time to come, as well as dispensing it at present. God
has mercy in hand, and mercy in store. We now say, as it is in the
Lamentations, It is of the Lords mercy that Lam. 3. 22.
we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. The same will they have
occasion to profess that shall come after us. God keeps mercy, and mercy
keeps us. Created goodness indeed, being limited, may be justly suspected of
penury. Esau might have somewhat to plead for his saying, Have thou but one
blessing my father? But Divine goodness is like an ocean without either banks
or bottom. Our heavenly Father has blessings reserved, as well as bestowed:
many more blessings then one, yea for many more persons then one; as it
follows.

Fourthly, Keeping mercy for thousands, and that not of persons only, but, as
it is in the Chaldee, for thousands of generations. One generation goes, says
the Preacher, and Eccles. 1. 4.
another generation comes; but the earth abides for ever. Not one of all
these generations but coming and going tastes of mercy; and the whole earth,
during Psalm. 33. 5.
the time of these revolutions are still full of the Lords goodness. When the
ark rested Moses said, Return, O Lord, unto the many Numb. 10. 36.
thousands of Israel. He that charged his providence with the thousands of
Israel, is ready to charge it with the thousands of England, both in this and
after ages, if they do not apostatize from him, and so forsake their own mercy.

. 2. Well may we therefore trust God with our posterity, seeing he that has
showed mercy to us keeps mercy for them. As that fountain of light the Sun is
not weary with shining; it gives us light, and keeps light for our
Antipodes: so this fountain of mercy is never tired with communicating goodness
to one generation after another. Good parents in bad times are often troubled
with great solicitude, when they think what will become of their children after
them. Let such consider that they leave them in his hand, who is a God keeping
mercy for thousands: as Luther did, who had this passage in his last Will and
Testament. Lord God I thank thee for that thou have Melch. Adam. Vit. German.
Theol. p. 134.
been pleased to make me a poor and indigent man upon earth. I have neither
house, nor land, nor money to leave behind me. Thou have given me wife and
children; I restore them to thee. Lord, nourish, teach and preserve them, as
thou have hitherto done me, O thou that art a Father of the fatherless, and a
judge of the widows. Let them remember how much mercy is entailed upon the
issue of believers by virtue of these and the like places, He will bless them
Psalm. 115. 13, 14.
that fear the Lord both small and great. The Lord will increase you more and
more, both you and your children. The just man walks Prove. 20. 7.
in his integrity; his children are blessed after him. And that Satan never
can, God never will cut off this entail, unless either the children degenerate;
or the parents, distrusting providence, make use of some unlawful means for
their promotion. In which case, Woe to him, says the Prophet, that coveteth an
Hab. 2. 9, 10, 11.
evil covetousness to his house, that he might set his nest on high -- Thou
have consulted shame to thy house -- For the stone shall cry out of the wall,
and the beam out of the timber shall answer it. If Jeroboam out of design to
secure the kingdom, and settle the crown in his own line, will take the
practice of Idolatry as a means to this end; This thing becomes sin unto the
house of 1 King. 13. 34.
Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the
earth. No wonder then, if when Gods own peculiar people begin to distrust him,
and by reason of unbelief take irregular courses for their advancement in the
world, this very thing prove an obstruction to that mercy, which they and
theirs might have otherwise been partakers of. Such as would be sure to find
him a God showing and keeping mercy unto Exodus 20. 6.
thousands, must be careful to be found in the number of those that love him
and keep his commandments, as he himself informs us in the Decalogue.

. 3. The seventh branch is forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin. Where the
terms are multiplied to note the readiness of God to forgive our offenses, how
many soever they be, though transgression be added to iniquity, and sin to
transgression. How great soever See Muis on Psalm. 51. 2.
they be Pescha, which signifies rebellious, as well as Chattaah, which
imports failings; and of what kind soever they be, whether original, viz. the
crookednes and perverseness of nature, intimated in Avon the word used in that
speech of David, Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, or actual, expressed by the
two other terms. To help our understanding herein, the Holy Ghost in Scripture
is pleased to make use of sundry expressions very significant, when he speaks
of Gods pardoning sin. viz.

I. Taking it away, as in that place of Hosea, where the Church is directed to
make her addresses on this wise, Take Hos. 14. 2.
with you words, and turn to the Lord, say unto him, Take away all iniquity,
and receive us graciously; so will we render the calves of our lips. Not as if
when iniquity is forgiven it were presently to be taken out of the memory; but
that which the Saints desire is to have it taken out of the conscience, that
their hearts may accuse them for it no more. As a thorn in the hedge is a
fence, but an offense in the midst of a garden: So sin in the memory may do
well to keep us from relapsing, but is a grievance in the conscience. Which
made Austin after assurance Quid retribuam Domino quod recolit haec memoria
mea, and and anima mea non metuit inde? August. Confess. lib. 2. c. 7.
of forgiveness, when he had made confession of his former aberrations, bless
God that he could now call them to mind without being affrighted at the
consideration of them.

II. Casting of our sins behind his back. So in Hezekiahs song, Thou have in
love to my soul, says he, delivered it from the Isa. 38. 17.
pit of corruption; for thou have cast all my sins behind thy back. This God
does with a purpose never to view them more Oculo vindice, so as to take
vengeance for them, though Oculo judice, he cannot but by reason of his
Omniscience see and discern them. All the while David's sins were before his own
face, and he making a penitent confession of them as in the one and fiftieth
Psalm, I acknowledged Psalm 51. 3.
my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me, they were cast behind the
back of God, as the Prophet Nathan assured him, saying, The Lord has put 2 Samuel 12. 13.
away thy sin, thou shall not die.

III. Scattering them as a cloud, or as a mist. So the Geneva translation has
it in that cheering passage of Isaiah, I have Isa. 44. 22.
put away thy transgressions like a cloud, and thy sins as a mist. Sin is that
which interposeth it self between the soul and the light of Gods countenance:
But whether it be a slender mist or a thick cloud, an infirmity or a rebellion,
the sun of righteousness eyed by faith can and will dispell it so, as to make
it vanish.

. 4. IV. Covering or hiding them. So in the Psalm, Blessed is he whose
transgression Psalm 32. 1.
is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Men never Si texit peccata Deus noluit
advertere; Si noluit advertere noluit animadvertere; Si noluit animadvertere
noluit punire. August. in loc.
punish hidden sins, because the law takes notice of none, but such only as
come to light, by breaking out in words or actions. God is accordingly said to
cover and hide those sins as it were out of his sight, which he never intends
to inflict punishment for.

V. Throwing them into the depth of the Sea. Thus in Micha's Prophecy, Who is
Micah 7. 18, 19.
a God like unto thee that pardons etc. He will subdue our iniquities, and
thou will cast all our sins into the depths of the Sea. Alluding perhaps to
what befell Pharaoh and his host in the red sea, which drowned the greatest
Egyptian Commanders, as well as the meanest common soldier. The vast Ocean
overfloweth both the lowest sands and the highest rocks: that of Gods pardoning
grace removes both the smaller prevarications, and the grosser abominations of
all such, as are truly penitent believers.

VI. Blotting them out, as in David's petition, Have mercy upon me, O God,
according Psalm. 5. 1.
to thy loving kindness; according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot
out my transgressions. Wherein he alludeth to the custom of Creditours, who
use to set down what every one owes, and when debts are either forgiven, or
paid, to blot them out. Our sins are called debts in the Lords Prayer: Christ
as our surety has given satisfaction to divine Justice for them; When this is
once apprehended and applied by a lively faith, God issues out a pardon;
drawing as it were, the lines of Christ's Cross over the lines of his debt-book;
so as he may still see the sum we were indebted in, but sees it cancelled,
never to be exacted more.

. 5. Be we then advertised from hence in the first place, to acknowledge the
singular goodness of God to us in this particular, of forgiving our iniquity,
transgression and sin. David in the place last cited speaks of it as a
special evidence of loving kindness and tender mercies. The Apostles Creed,
having premised the articles concerning Christ, by whom all blessings were
procured for the Catholic Church, when it comes to recite them, names
forgiveness of sins in the first place, as the choicest privilege on this side
heaven. And in that compendious prayer, which our Savior taught us, there is a
remarkable connection of two petitions by a conjunctive particle, not to be
found in any of the former. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us
our trespasses. To show that as our daily sins make us unworthy of daily bread,
so there is no sweetness in them till the other be pardoned. Bread and all
other outward mercies a man may receive from an angry God: pardon of sin never
comes but from favor and special love, yea riches of grace, as Paul
expresses it, speaking of Christ, In whom we have redemption Ephesians. 1. 7.
through his blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his
grace.

. 6. In the second, to believe and repent, that we may be found in the number
of those to whom this choice blessing is imparted. Scripture tells us men
must be turned from darkness to Acts 26. 18.
light, from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of
sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified, by faith that is in
Christ. Also that God has exalted him with his right hand to be a Acts 5. 31.
Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of
sins. Observe the method, Repentance first, and then forgiveness. God does not
bestow his distinguishing favors upon all men promiscuously. Pardoning mercy
does indeed come from him with ease (he is called a God ready to pardon) but
Nehem. 9. 17.
droppeth not from him at unawares, that I may allude to what Seneca said Sinum
habet facilem, sed non perforatum. de benefic.
of his liberal man. He will know whom he bestows his forgiveness upon.
Unbeleeving, unrepenting sinners never obtained it; faithful penitents never
yet went without it. They may perhaps not be so sensible of it in times of
temptation and of desertion: but, to make use of a known distinction, whereas
there is a double forgiveness, one in the high Court of heaven, of which the
Lord speaks in his answer to Solomon's prayer, Then will 1 Chronicles. 7. 14.
I hear from heaven and forgive their sins. (all authentical pardons are coined
there; the stamping of them is a part of prerogative royal; and it is no less
then high treason in the Pope to have his mint of Indulgences going at Rome)
Another in the Court of conscience, spoken of in the epistle to the Hebrews,
The worshippers once purged should have had no Hebr. 10. 2.
more conscience of sins: it may safely be asserted that forgiveness is
certainly passed in the Court of heaven, whenever Christ is received by
faith; according to that, Be it known unto you, that through this man, meaning
Christ, is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins; and by him all that
believe are justified from all things, from which they could not be justified
by the law of Moses. Yet may there for some space of time after this, not
determinable by any man, be wanting a seal upon earth to this pardon; and the
believer continue not so fully acquitted in the court of his own conscience, as
to be assured of forgiveness till the Lord has taught him by experience to see
and acknowledge, that assurance of pardon is a free gift of his, as well as
faith, or pardon it self.

. 7. In the third place, To be followers Ephesians. 5. 1. and 4. 32.
of God as dear children, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God
for Christ's sake has forgiven us. We should

First, Forgive one another. The equity and necessity whereof are both
exceedingly pressed by our Savior, to the end we might not look at it either
as unreasonable, or as arbitrary. The former by his parable in the eighteenth
of Matthew. The wrongs we suffer compared to the sins we commit, are Matthew. 18.
from verse 23. to the end.
but as an hundred pence to ten thousand talents; great odds both in number and
weight: for number, ten thousand to one hundred; and for weight, the one sort
are talents, the other pence. What more equal then that we who have so many
talents forgiven us, should be ready to forgive so few pence? The latter in an
express declaration annexed to the Lords prayer. If ye forgive men their
trespasses, your Matthew. 6. 14, 15.
heavenly Father will also forgive you; But if ye forgive not men their
trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Whence it
follows, that persons addicted to revenge, so often as they repeat that
petition Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against
us, do in effect make a dreadful imprecation against themselves; and fetch
down a curse from heaven in stead of a blessing. For he that says with his
tongue, Lord, I pray thee forgive me, as I forgive others; but meanwhile says
in his heart, I cannot, I will not forgive such an one, does he not by
consequence say to God, Forgive not me? does he not pronounce himself unworthy
of pardon, and in effect subscribe to the sentence of his own condemnation? Yet
alas how common a sin is revenge! As the heart in the natural body is the first
member that lives, and the last that dies: so revenge in the heart is a lust
that soonest appears in children, and is often longest ere it be healed in
the regenerate. Molanus tells us that the Christians Augusti^i seculo ad
vocem Nobis quilibet Christianus pectus suum tundebat. Jo. Molanus. Theol.
practicae compend. p. 211.
of old in Austins time, were wont to beat upon their breasts in a deep sense
of their sins, at the Nobis in the beginning of the forementioned Petition,
Forgive Us: well may the most of men now adays beat their breasts for grief,
and hang down their heads for shame at the Nos in the latter clause, As we
forgive. For how few are there that do it aright? Seeing that,

. 8. Secondly, we should forgive others, as God for Christ's sake has forgiven
us. to wit,

First, Heartily without dissembling. Christ denounces a terrible threatening
against such, as do not from their Matthew. 18. 35.
hearts forgive every one his brother. It is not a making a fair show in
outward carriages, not binding up, as it were, the broken bones of peace with
good looks and sweet words, that God accepts, if the heart be full of
wormwood and gall. Joab kissed, and stabbed, Judas kissed and betrayed. Hail
Master, said the one to Christ; Art thou well my brother? said the other to
Amasa. How hateful is such dissimulation to God and man? Forgiveness is a
fruit of love: My little children, says St John, let us not love, so say I,
let us not forgive 1 John 3. 18.
in word and tongue, but in deed and in truth.

Secondly, Speedily without delay. Be Nehem. 9. 17. Bis dat, qui cito.
like God, ready to pardon. As in bestowing, he doubleth his benefit that
gives betimes: so in pardoning, he forgiveth twice that forgiveth with speed;
his forgiveness receives a double welcome, and shall have a double reward. It
is not for Christians to harbor animosities in the course of their lives, and
think to salve it by saying we forgive all the world, when they lie upon their
death beds. For that may be applied to pardoning, which Divines usually say of
repenting, True forgiveness is never too late, but late forgiveness is seldom
true. Wherefore let not the sun go down upon Ephesians. 4. 26.
your wrath, as Paul advises his Ephesians. If that which was but a mote at
Ira festuca, est odium trab^. August.
first, be watered and cherished with the fresh suspicions of some few days, it
will turn to a beam, and go near to put out the eye of love.

Thirdly, Frequently without stint or limitation. God multiplieth pardon; so
Isai. 55. 7.
should we. When ye stand praying, forgive, Mark 11. 25.
says Christ; and Paul bids us Pray 1 Thessalonians. 5. 17.
continually. We should therefore be inclined to forgive continually; and to
make actual performance whenever there is an opportunity. Peter thought he
had offered fair when he asked, How often shall my brother sin against me, and
Matthew. 18. 21, 22.
I forgive him? adding till seven times, as making account that surely that was
often enough. But our Savior makes nothing of that number; would by no means
have him stay there. Jesus says unto him, I say not unto thee till seven
times, but until seventy times seven: putting a certain definite number for an
indefinite, and thereby intending to teach that his followers should forgive
Toties quoties so often as they shall be trespassed against.

. 9. Fourthly, Thoroughly, as without excepting, so without remembering any
offense. God excepteth not any of our sins when he affords us pardoning
grace. 1 Jo^. 1. 9.
But if we confess, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Should he reserve but one unforgiven, that
one would sink our souls to hell. It is our duty to imitate him herein.
Forgive, says Christ, if ye have ought against any. Whoever the person, Mark
11. 25.
and whatever the thing be, you must forgive. One of the Evangelists sets
down the petition thus, in our Saviors form of prayer, Forgive us our Luke 11.
4.
sins, for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. It must then be
performed without excepting any either person or essence. As also without
remembering any. God does so forgive our sins as not to keep a register of them.
I, even I am he, says the Lord, that blotteth Isai. 43. 25.
out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins. Yet
with us what more frequent then saying, I forgive such a man, such a wrong; but
shall never forget it or him? A distinction that came not out of Christ's
school, but Satan's mint. Paul was of a different spirit; witness that
remarkable passage of his to the Galatians, Brethren, I beseech you be as I am,
for I am Galat. 4. 12. Vide Bezam and Grotium in loc.
as ye are; ye have not injured me at all. Where he seems to desire that
every member of the Church in Galatia would be to him as an Alter ego, another
self, seeing he was affected as another self to each of them. But had they not
injured him? yes very much, in preferring the false Apostles before him,
questioning his doctrine, yea becoming his enemies, and that for telling them
the truth; yet behold him professing here, Ye have not injured me at all,
because these wrongs were as no wrongs in his estimation, it was not his
purpose to impute them; he speaks as one that had really forgotten them by
reason of his resolution to forgive them. There is I confess, a kind of
remembrance not inconsistent with true forgiveness, when prudent men remember
offenses and offenders in cautelam, so as to beware for the future of exposing
themselves to the like injuries: But Christians ought not to remember in
vindictam, so as to revenge themselves upon the delinquents for wrongs done in
time past. I say to revenge; for otherwise a Christian may Exerc. 5.
seek to right himself in a legal way, yea and to bring offenders to condign
punishment; still retaining a charitable mind toward them: even as God,
though he have forgiven justified persons, may notwithstanding and often does
chastise them with his fatherly corrections.

EXERCITATION 5. The latter clauses of Exodus 34. 7. so translated and expounded
as to contain an eighth branch of divine goodness, viz. Clemency in correcting.
Equity in visiting iniquities of the fathers upon the children. Clemency in
stopping at the third and fourth generation. A lesson for Magistrates. A speech
of our Q. Elisabeth. Gods proclamation in Exodus 34. Improved by Moses in Numb.
14.
. 1. THe following clauses have somewhat more of difficulty in them then any of
the former, as being variously rendered and expounded by Interpreters. The most
read as we do, That will by no means clear the guilty, visiting etc. But
amongst these that do agree in the translation there is some difference about
the meaning of the words. The major part of that combination apply them wholly
to the Justice of God in taking vengeance upon obstinate sinners. Some few
(whereof Mr Ainsworth is one) respecting the scope of the whole context, which
is to set forth the Goodness of God, consider this also as relating to that.
His words are these. This his Justice upon the wicked is a part of his goodness
toward his people, as it is said, The just shall rejoice, when he sees the
vengeance. He Psalm 58. 11.
shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. A gloss that may receive
confirmation from certain passages in Psalm one hundred thirty six. Where the
destruction of opposite Princes is recorded as an evidence of Gods mercy to his
Church. He slew famous kings, for his mercy endures for ever. Sihon king of
the Amorites, for his mercy endures for ever. And Og the king of Bashan, for
his Psalm. 136. v. 18, 19, 20.
mercy endures for ever. As also from that in the first of Nahum, The Lord is
good, a Nahum 1. 7, 8.
strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knows them that trust in him: But
with an overflowing flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, that
is, the oppressing city Niniveh, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.

. 2. But the learned Critic Ludovicus de Dieu, considering that in other
places, by name Zechar. 5. 3. the word Nakah signifies to make void, and to
cut off, by altering the translation of these words, puts them into a posture
of looking directly at the goodness of God, and not with an oblique glance. He
renders them thus, Evacuating, cutting Evacuando non evacuabit, succidendo non
succidet. Lud. de Dieu. Animadvers. in Exodus page 81, 82.
off or destroying, he will not evacuate, cut off, or destroy; visiting the
iniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth
generation: making this the sense, So great is Gods goodness, that even when he
is angry and punishes, yet he will not utterly overthrow: He visits indeed
the sins of the fathers upon the children, but it is to the third and fourth
generation only, not for ever. Now according to this interpretation (which for
ought I know may well be received) the expressions import an eighth branch of
divine goodness, to wit, Clemency in correcting, here set forth by a general
declaration, and by a particular instance.

First by a general declaration in these words, VENAKKEH LO IENAKKEH,
destroying he will not destroy, that is not altogether, not so destroy as to
make a full end, according to the expression in Jeremy. Thus in like forms of
Jerem. 46. 28.
speech, Delivering thou have not delivered, that is, say our Translatours,
Neither have thou delivered this people at all. Redeeming he cannot redeem,
that is, say they, None of them can by any means Exodus 5. 22. Psalm. 49. 7.
redeem his brother. Proportionably here, Destroying he will not destroy, that
is, God will not at all, he will not by any means utterly destroy his people,
however he may correct and chasten for some time. Suitable whereunto is that in
Amos his Prophecy, Behold the eyes of the Lord God Amos 9. 8.
are upon the sinful kingdom; and I will destroy it from off the face of the
earth, saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, says the
Lord.

. 3. This sense is exceedingly favored by a parallel place in Jeremy, I am
with thee, says the Lord, to save thee. Jer. 30. 11.
Though I make a full end of all Nations whither I have scattered thee, yet
will I not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in measure. Then
follows, VENAKKEH LO ANAKKECA, which Pagnin rendereth, And destroying I will
not destroy thee. It may further, and yet more strongly be confirmed by a
passage in the fourteenth of Numbers. The hand of faith having once fastened
upon God, will not readily let go his hold. Moses had taken fast hold of that
discovery, which the Lord was pleased to make of himself in this place of
Exodus, and accordingly upon occasion improveth it, by pleading with him for
Isreal's preservation from a total ruin; which was then deserved and
threatened, making use to that end of those very terms the discovery was made
in, and among others of those now under debate, as most argumentative in the
sense contended for. It is as if he had said, Will thou, O Lord, Numb. 14. 17,
18.
bring an utter destruction upon this whole people? What shall then become of
that goodness of thine which it pleased thee to proclaim to thy servant in
Sinai? If thou be resolved to punish them, yet remember what thou have said,
Destryoing he will not destroy. If their iniquities must be visited upon their
children, O let it not be for ever, Lord, but only to the third and fourth
generation, as thou have spoken. Whereas from the words in that other sense,
which is commonly received, Moses could not possibly have drawn so strong a
plea. For if God will by no means clear the guilty; all Israel having at that
time contracted a deep and deadly guilt, what inference could be made from
thence, but that all Israel were of necessity to perish?

. 4. Secondly by a particular instance contained in the last clause, Visiting
the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, and upon the childrens
children, unto the third, and fourth generation. For the cleerer explication
whereof, it will be requisite to demonstrate that God in so doing exercises
both equity, and clemency, lest either should be doubted of. Concerning the
former; Although by an express law Magistrates Deuteronomy. 24. 16. compared with 2
Kings 14. 6. Vide Grotium de jure belli and pacis. lib. 2. cap. 21.. 14.
be forbidden to put children to death for their parents sins; yet God, who is
author of life and death, has reserved to himself a liberty of so doing,
whenever it pleases him, by reason of his supreme dominion over all: and
therefore for him to inflict inferior temporal punishments in that case,
cannot but be accounted just. The rather if we take into consideration that
children may be accounted part of the parents themselves: for as a man's wife is
himself divided, so his children are himself multiplied. However they are
undoubtedly part of their parents goods, and so esteemed. When God had once
said concerning Job, Behold, Job 1. 12.
all that he has is in thy power, Satan by virtue of that Commission slew not
his cattle and servants only, but his sons and daughters. And when he had
determined concerning Achan, Let Josua 7. 15, 24, 25.
him, and all that he has be burnt with fire, the Israelites in obedience to
that command burnt his children, together with his other substance.

. 5. As to the latter, Gods visiting on this wise will be found an act of
clemency, as well as of equity, if it be considered,

First, That it is but to the third and fourth generation, not to all
generations, and for ever, according to the Psalmists expostulation, Will thou
be angry Psalm. 85. 5.
with us for ever? will thou draw out shine anger to all generations? Not to do
thus is mercy, witness that in Nehemiah, For thy great mercies sake thou did
Nehem. 9. 31.
not utterly consume them, nor forsake them: for thou art a gracious and
merciful God.

Secondly, That all sorts of sinners are not so punished, but only or mainly
such as are guilty of the most heinous provocations; chiefly Idolaters and
worshippers of false Gods. For the second commandment (which is the first place
of Scripture wherein we meet with this expression) has it thus, I the Lord thy
God am a jealous God, Deum odisse insacris literis peculiariter illi dicuntur
qui falsos Deos colunt; ita ut neget Maimonides alio sensu id loquendi genus
reperiri. Grotius in explicat. decalogi.
visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and
fourth generation of them that hate me. that is, of them that manifest their
hatred of me by committing spiritual adultery with Idols, which, as some affirm
is the most proper and only notion of that phrase throughout the Scripture.

Thirdly, That it is seldom done, but where children tread in their fathers
steps, and are guilty of the same sins with their progenitors. Then no wonder
if what we find in Isaiahs prophecy be accomplished to the full, Behold, it
is written before me; I will not keep Isa. 65. 6, 7.
silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom your
iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says the Lord, which
have burnt incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills:
therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.

Fourthly, that it is never done but with merciful intentions; namely to
restrain men from sin upon this ground, because their children, whom they
affect so dearly are like to smart for it. He is a truly miserable heir that
inheriteth his fathers sins with his lands: the one will quickly eat out all,
and more then all the comfort he can expect from the other. Now there is scarce
any penalty more grievous in Chrysostomes opinion, then for a man to see misery
brought upon his offspring, (...). Chrysostom. homil. 29. ad Genesis 9.
and that for his sake.

. 6. Rulers should imitate God herein, by not dealing against malefactors to
the utmost of rigor, but exercising clemency in their corrections: not writing
all their laws in blood, as Draco of old is said to have done; not dismembring
where a plaster will suffice, nor applying scorpions where a rod will serve
the turn. Humanity is a manlike, cruelty a diabolical principle. In wrath God
always remembereth mercy, so should they of whom it is written, I have said ye
are Gods. The sword of his justice is always furbished with the oil of loving
kindness; so should theirs. Our Queen Elizabeth is reported to have professed,
That next to the Scriptures Dr Hackwel on Psalm. 101. p. 28.
she knew no book, which had done her so much good, as the often reading of
Seneca's treatise De clementia.

. 7. To shut up this so long discourse with a review of Moses his example
touched upon before in the third paragraph; Look as some kind of artificers
after long poring upon a piece of black work, finding a dimness in their sight,
are wont to take an emerald, or some other green thing, by the verdure whereof
their eyes may be refreshed and their spirits cheered: so believers, when
puzzled and dulled with the consideration of sad events, should for their
spiritual relief make use of this glorious proclamation made by God himself
concerning his goodness and the several branches thereof; which are all
cheering to faith. Moses did so in the fourteenth of Numbers. The spies were
then newly returned with their dismal report; the people fallen into their two
epidemical diseases, rebelling and murmuring, excepting only Caleb and Joshua.
Hereupon God being highly provoked threatens to disinherit them, verse. 12. to
kill them all as one man, verse. 15. It was now time for Moses, who loved them
as his own soul to bestir himself, to become their advocate, and beg pardon on
their behalf, as he does in the 17, 18 and 19 verses, grounding his plea upon
two topics: the former Gods power in these words, I beseech thee let the power
of my Lord be great. Let it be, that is, be manifested, and appear to be great.
But what has power to do with pardon? Much every way. Forgiveness is an act of
potency as well as of clemency. We know that in all Civil states pardoning such
as the law has sentenced is a prerogative belonging to the Supreme Power. His
second topic is Gods truth engaging him to make good what had formerly been
proclaimed by himself concerning his goodness in Moses his hearing. To an
active believer, such as Moses approved himself in his whole course, every
revelation of God is like a clear and distinct voice uttered in an arched
vault, which resoundeth again and again. God has Psalm. 62. 11.
spoken once, says David, twice have I heard this, that power belongs unto
God. Accordingly Moses, as he heard this admirable discovery of divine
goodness, when the Lord first uttered it on mount Sinai: so now he hears it
over again, and upon this signal occasion makes a due improvement of it, by
founding his plea for Israel upon it. According as thou have spoken saying, The
Lord is long-suffering and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and
transgression, etc.

EXERCITATION 6. Job 11. 7, 8, 9. expounded of divine Greatness. Three reasons
of that Exposition, with the resolution of a question about it. The height of
Gods universal, unaccountable, omnipotent Sovereignty proved and improved.
. 1. ZOphar in Job, being about (as I now am) to set forth the greatness of
God, premiseth this interrogation, Can thou by searching find out God? Job.
11. 7.
to implie the truth of what is elsewhere clearly expressed by the Prophet
Exerc. 6.
David, Great is the Lord, and greatly Psalm. 145. 3.
to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable. It could not otherwise be
His. For as one says well, Non esset Deus magnus, si non esset major captu
nostro. Such is the shallowness of man's understanding, that God should not be
really great if he were not greater then our capacities. The description he
makes thereof follows in these words. It is as high as Job. 11. 8, 9.
heaen, what can thou do? deeper then hell, what can thou know? The measure
thereof is longer then the earth, and broader then the Jea. Where by height
Zophar seems to understand the Omnipotent Sovereignty, by depth the
omniscient wisdom, by length the everlasting duration, by breadth the
omnipresent immensitie of God. The grounds of this interpretation are chiefly
three.

First the dimensions here enumerated are those whereby we are wont to estimate
the greatness of things: and I find all the forementioned Attributes spoken of
as branches of divine greatness in other places. Omnipotent Sovereignty; Great
is the Lord, and of Psalm. 147. 5.
great power. Omniscient understanding. God is greater then our heart, and
knows 1 John 3. 20.
all things. Everlasting duration; Behold, Job 36. 26.
God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be
searched out. Omnipresent immensity; Great is our 2 Chr. 2. 5, 6.
God above all gods. Who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and
heaven of heavens cannot contain him?

Secondly, each particular dimension is elsewhere applied to these very
attributes, though some with more clearness then others. Height to Gods
Sovereignty. He that is higher then the Eccles. 6. 8.
highest regards, and there be higher then they. Depth to his Omniscience. O
the Romans 11. 33.
depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! Length to his
Eternity. He asked life, and thou gave it to him; even length of days for
ever and ever. Psalm. 21. 4.
Which Calvin and the Chaldee paraphrase, apply to Christ, understanding
thereby the eternal duration of his kingdom. Lastly breadth to his
Omnipresence, but covertly in that of Isaiah, The glorious Lord will be unto us
a Isa. 33. 21.
place of broad rivers and streams; to signify that protection and safety,
which his presence with his Church in every place affords to all the members
thereof, like a broad river encompassing a fenced town on every side.

Thirdly, Me thinks there is somewhat expressed in Zophars speech which as to the
two former particulars, tends to this interpretation. For having said, It is as
high as heaven, he presently adds, What can thou do? meaning perhaps what are
thy weak abilities to his omnipotence? He in regard of his Sovereign power can
do all things; but thou, alas! what can thou do? And after affirming, It is
deeper then hell, he subjoyneth, what can thou know? as if he had said, what
are thy shallow apprehensions to the depth of his thoughts? He in regard of his
omniscient understanding knows all things, but thou, poor man, What can
thou know?

. 2. If it be asked, why I expound all these clauses of God, seeing the
particles It and Thereof (It is high as heaven, The measure thereof) seem to
relate unto somewhat else. My answer is, that Expositours differ much about
this very thing, and according to their several apprehensions translate the
words after a different manner. The vulgar Latin and our old English
translations carry all to Almighty God, who was mentioned in the verse before,
Can thou find out the Almighty? reading it thus, He is higher then heaven,
what art thou able to do? His length exceeds the length of the earth etc.
Others considering that diverse words in the original text being feminine will
not agree in construction with Eloah and Saddai, whereby God is there expressed,
have therefore looked back to the sixth verse for an antecedent, where they meet
with (...) Wisdom, and expound all of it, inserting the word Sapientia into
their Latin translations, as Oecolampadius and Junius do. But for my part,
there is I conceive a word nearer hand, which will serve the turn better, and
that is (...) Perfection. Can thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
It, that is, the Perfection of God is as high as heaven etc. And herein I join
with Castellio, whose translation is fully squared to this sense; for so he
reads the place, Tune Dei intima pervestiges, aut ipsam adeo perfectionem
Omnipotentis invenias? Quae cum coelum altitudine adaequet, quid ages? etc. Now
I interpret the words, as before, because however they be read, whether God, or
wisdom, or Perfection be taken for the antecedent, it comes to one and the
same issue, for the Wisdom of God is himself; and his Perfection comprehends
not Wisdom only, but all his other excellencies whatsoever; insomuch as
Lessius intitleth his book concerning the Attributes, De perfectionibus
divinis. The way thus cleared, I now proceed without further interruption to
single out the particular dimensions, and discourse of them in their order.

. 3. Seeing all divine perfections far transcend humane capacities, the safest
way, as I humbly conceive, for us to make a due estimate concerning the height
of Gods sovereignty is to compare it with that of earthly potentates, which is
within the compass and reach of our understandings. Verily it is not without
cause that S. Paul styles him the 1 Timothy 6. 15.
blessed and only potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords; that Moses,
Melchisedech and Abram, entitle him the most high God Genesis 14. v. 18, 19, 20,
22.
four times in one chapter. For upon search it will appear that his Sovereignty
excels that of the high and mighty ones upon earth in point of Extensiveness,
of Unaccountableness, and of Almightiness.

I. In point of extensiveness His kingdom Psalm 103. 19.
rules over all. The whole earth and sea, which make but one globe, is to the
Universe but as a little central point; the mightiest potentate has no more
but his share in that little. Whereupon Seneca brings in his wise and
virtuous man with this censure and sarcasme in his mouth. Is this that Point,
Hoc est illud punctum quod inter tot gentes ferro and i^ni dividitur? O quam
cidiculi sunt mortalium termini! Punctum est istud in quo navigatis, in quo
bellatis, in quo Regna disponitis minima etc. Senec. Natural. quaest lib. 1. in
Praefatione.
which so many Nations of the world do so strive to divide among themselves by
fire and sword? O how ridiculous are the bounds of mortal men! All that in
which they sail to and fro, manage their wars, and set up their petty kingdoms
is but a Point. Whereas the Sovereignty of God extends it self to the whole
earth and sea, yea to heaven; and the heaven of heavens, giving laws not only
to the visible host of sun, moon, and stars, but also to the invisible host of
Angels, who are said to Psalm 103. 20.
excel in strength, and to do his commandments, harkening unto the voice of
his word. Yea there is not a Devil in hell that can go beyond the length of his
chain, for even those legions of darkness are, though much against their wills,
subjected to the empire of the father of lights.

Yea whereas the dominion of worldly Potentates reaches but to the outward
man, and their laws cannot directly oblige the conscience, so as to bring upon
it a guilt binding over the soul to death; his do. And in this respect St James
tells us that there is one James 4. 12.
lawgiver, one and but one, who is able to save and to destroy. The style
which Paul gives earthly governors is masters Ephesians. 6. 5.
according to the flesh; but Moses calls Numb. 17. 16.
God, the God of the spirits of all flesh; to imply that however there be many,
who lord it sufficiently over the flesh and outward man, there is no Lord of
our spirits but God alone, who only is greater then our hearts, as St John
speaks. 1 John 3. 20.
This made the good Emperor History of the Bohemian persecutions English in 8o
chap. 39. 2.
Maximilian the second say, That whosoever assumed to himself a power over the
consciences of men, set himself down in the throne of God. His son Rodolphus
who succeeded him in the Empire resolved to walk in his fathers steps, yet was
once unhappily wrought upon by the subtlety Ibid. chap. 40. 1.
of the Jesuits to give way to the passing of an Edict for shutting up the
Protestants Churches during some time. But that very day news was brought him
that Alba Regia the chief city he had in Hungary was taken by the Turks.
Whereupon in great astonishment he is reported to have said, I Expectabam tale
quid postquam hodie Dei regimen, quod est conscient arum usurpa^e coeperam.
Joh. Laet. compend. hist. page 666.
expected that some such mischief as this should befall me; seeing this day I
began to usurp the government belonging to God, which is of consciences.

. 4. II. In point of unaccountableness. The greatest Princes upon earth do, or
should govern by laws, to the making whereof others concur as well as they. But
our God is a law to himself. He only can write upon his imperial Edicts, My
reason for it is my will. Yet because Stat pro ratione voluntas.
of the holiness of his nature his will is always most just; so as he never
enacted any thing, but what is in it self equal and reasonable, although
perhaps to our shallow understandings it may appear otherwise: as to our eyes
turrets and steeples how upright soever, if their height be exceeding great, do
often seem crooked, and look as if they stood awry; which should deter us from
censuring any of his Decrees, or Dispensations, as some great but unhallowed
wits are wont to do; of whom Luther makes this sober and sad complaint, They
require that God act jure humano, according Luther de servo arbitrio. cap. 173.
to what the sons of men do commonly account right and just, or otherwise that
he would cease to be God. Tell not them of the secrets of his Sovereign
Majesty; let him render a reason of his being God, if he speak, do, or will any
thing, but what appears equal to men. Proud flesh cannot vouchsafe the God of
heaven so much honor as to believe any thing to be good or right, which is
spoken or acted above what the Codex of Justinian, or the fifth book of
Aristotle's Ethics defines to be just.

I confess indeed that God often condescendeth in his holy word to give men a
reason of some proceedings, and to clear them up to our understandings: but it
is more then he needs to do, more then we ought to expect in all cases. It
will therefore be our wisdom to forbear playing the Critics upon his decrees
and administrations; considering that he alone is (...), unaccountable, not to
be called in question for any of his doings: and always remembering that of
Paul, Nay but, O man, who art thou that Romans 9. 20, 21.
reply against God? Has not the potter power over the clay? Together with
that of Job, God is greater then man: why do Job 33. 12, 13.
thou strive against him? for he gives not account of any of his matters.

. 5. Thirdly, In point of Almightiness. In the Princes of this world (...) and
(...), Authority and Power are often severed: their authority may be great,
when their power to manage it is but small. David was King, yet could not act
as he desired, for the sons of Zerviah were too strong for him. But in God they
always go hand in hand for the accomplishing of what his wisdom has designed.
Therefore I called it Omnipotent Sovereignty. I know, Job 42. 2.
says Job, that thou can do every thing, and that no thought can be
withholden from thee, meaning that God cannot be hindered in the execution, or
bringing to pass of whatsoever he has in the thoughts and purposes of his
heart. The Angel to Mary, With God nothing Luke 1. 37.
shall be impossible, Paul to the Ephesians, He is able to do exceeding
abundantly Ephesians. 3. 20.
above all that we ask or think. Other Scriptures may seem opposite to these,
but are not. God that cannot lie. Tit. 1. 2.
He cannot deny himself, says St Paul. For 2 Timothy 2. 1^.
answer to these and the like instances, we must distinguish of Impossibles.
They are of two sorts, Impossibilia naturae, Voetius Disp. Theol. part. 1.
(...) 109.
and Impossibilia natura. First there are diverse things impossible indeed to
nature, such as in the ordinary course of secondary causes cannot be done,
which yet to God are most feaseable; for example, working of miracles, giving
sight to such as were born blind, raising up children to Abraham out of the
very stones in the street. Secondly, Some other things are impossible not to
nature only, but in nature; and that either in reference to the nature of God,
when they are such as argue imperfection in the doer, as to sin, and to die: or
in respect to the nature of the things themselves, when they are such as implie
contradiction, as for a creature to be made independent. The former Si ista
passet Deus, non esset omnipotens. Magna in Deo potentia est non posse mentiri.
August. lib. 1. de Symbol. cap. 1.
of these God himself cannot do; not through want, but through height and
abundance of power. He cannot sin, lie or deny himself, and that because he is
Omnipotent: it is for impotent creatures to be liable unto such kind of
imperfections as these are. Neither can he do the latter: yet is it not through
any defect of power in God, that such things cannot be done, but through want
of capacity in the things, which are simply impossible. So then, when we
ascribe Almightiness to God, the meaning is, that wherever divine
Understanding can be a principle of direction, and divine will a principle of
injunction, there divine power can show it self an able principle of execution.
Or in plainer terms, That God can do whatsoever he will: and the only reason
why things that do either argue imperfection, or imply contradiction fall not
within the compass of his power, is because they are such, as for want of
goodness or entity cannot become objects of his will.

. 6. Now if the perfection of God be so very high in regard of his Omnipotent
sovereignty, think of thine own lowness, (O man, or rather, O worm, and no man)
and be confounded within thy self, upon comparing thy servile condition by
nature with his Sovereignty; thy imbecility with his Omnipotence. Adam indeed,
so long as he stood, was an universal Monarch, having dominion both over
himself, and over the creatures: But every man since the fall is a slave born,
a servant to diverse lusts and pleasures: Neither is there any way for getting
out of this estate, but getting into Christ, who restores all such as close
with him to a spiritual Sovereignty, Making them kings to God and his father;
Rev. 1. 6.
and upholding them with his royal Spirit, as some read that in the Psalm.
Till then Psalm. 51. 12.
what are whole Nations of men, but, to speak in the Prophets language, as the
drops of a bucket, which in their fall Isa. 40. 15.
are so licked up by the dust of the earth as they are no more discernable; or
as the small dust of the balance, which is of no moment at all toward turning
of the beam one way or other? And if Nations be so inconsiderable, what shall
we say of particular persons? I will suppose a mighty Prince, but an unbeleever
styled your Highness, or your Majesty at every word; and be bold to present him
upon this occasion with Zophars interrogatory, What can thou do? When God
leaves thee to thy self, how impotent are thy best abilities, as to the things
of a better world? Seeing they are such as no natural man can either receive,
for they are foolishness to him, and must be spiritually 1 Cor. 2. 14.
discerned; or close with when they are discovered: for the carnal mind is
Romans 8. 7.
enmity against God, it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be.

May these and the like considerations work so kindly upon us, as Canutus his
not being able to set bounds to the ocean did upon him. It is an history worth
the remembering. This Canutus Cambden Britannia out of H. Huntington.
was one of the ancient kings of England, who really to refute the flatterers
by whom he was told that all things were at his command, caused his royal
Pavilion to be set upon the sands, when the tide was coming in, then said to
the sea, Thou belongest to my dominion, and this earth which my throne stands
upon is mine. I charge thee therefore not to flow in upon my ground, nor to wet
the feet of thy Sovereign Lord. But in vain, for the tide kept its course, and
came up to his feet, without doing him any reverence. Whereupon he removed
further off, and said, Be it known to all men in the world that the power of
Princes is but a vain empty thing, and that none fully deserves the name of a
Sovereign Lord, but he at whose beck heaven and earth yield their obedience,
who can say to the sea, hitherto shall thou come, but no further; and here
shall thy proud waves be staid. It is also reported that after this he never
put on his crown more.

O that all the sons of men would accordingly learn from this branch of divine
greatness never to boast more of their own abilities! but to throw down all
their crowns at the feet of Christ, who, though omnipotence be incommunicable,
leaves upon such as receive him by faith some impressions and footsteps of it.
For whereas divine Almightiness stands in two things especially, to wit, in
Gods being able to do all things that are regularly possible, and his not being
able to do any sinful thing; there are some prints of both upon Christians, I
can do all things, says Philip. 4. 13.
St Paul, through Christ that strengthens me. And whosoever is born of God, 1
John 3. 9.
says St John, cannot sin, because he is born of God.

EXERCITATION 7. Exerc. 7.
The depth of divine Omniscience seen in discerning the deep things of man, yea
of Satan, yea of God. Our Nescience discovered and acknowledged. The longitude
of Gods perfection stated. Eternity proper to him. Not assumed by, or ascribed
to men without blasphemy.
. 1. THe second dimension is the depth of Gods Omniscience, which appears in
that he is able to found and fadome the deepest things, whether of man, or of
Satan, or of the Divine essence and will.

First, There are deep things of men. Their words are deep: and again, The
Prove. 18. 4.
words of a man's mouth are as deep waters. Their hearts and counsels much more.
Both the inward thoughts of every one of them, and the heart is deep. So David
of Psalm. 64. 6.
the churches enemies. Counsel in the Prove. 20. 5.
heart of man is like a deep water. So Solomon of wise sages. who are therefore
compared by a learned writer to coffers with double bottoms, which when others
look into, being opened, they see not all they hold on the sudden Sr. Walter
Ralegh's hist. book 5. p. 359.
and at once. But these are no depths to God, to whom David said, There is not
a word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord, Psalm. 139. 4.
thou know it altogether. And elsewhere, The Lord searches all hearts, and
understands Chron. 28. 9.
all the imaginations of the thoughts. Neither is it the least act of Gods
goodness to mankind, that he is pleased to reserve the searching of hearts to
himself, as part of his own prerogative royal, because if men were able to dive
into one another thoughts, there would be no quiet in the world; no peaceable
living one by another, in regard of that hidden hypocrisy and malice which
lurks in the most.

. 2. Secondly, Deep things of Satan, spoken of in the Revelation; As many as
have not this doctrine, and which have not Revel. 2. 24.
known the depths of Satan, as they speak. Seducers are wont to boast of their
mysterious tenants, and to speak of them as great depths, not to be fadomed by
common christians. Christ in that Epistle of his to the church of Thyatira,
makes use of their own term, Depths as they speak; but so as to brand them for
Depths of Satan fetched from hell, whereas they perhaps held them forth as new
truths, glorious lights and revelations from above. Thus popery is a mystery,
but a mystery of iniquity, as Paul styleth it, and Socinianisme a depth, but a
Depth of Satan. There is not a serpentine winding or turning in any of those
corrupt opinions, which pester and poison the Church of Christ at this day, but
God sees and knows it, how hard soever it be for his servants to discover
and refute. To these may be added all those other hellish designs which go
under other names in the Scripture, as The wiles of the devil, and his devices;
Ephesians. 6. 11. 2 Cor. 2. 11.
all which dark secrets are not in the dark to divine understanding. And he
that now sees them all will one day reckon with Satan for them, yea, and sink
him so much the deeper into hell, by how much his depths have done more
mischief upon earth. I say into hell, where he shall have those agents and
factours by whom he now carries on his cursed work, for his cursed companions
to eternity, according to that in the Apocalypse, The devil that deceived Rev.
20. 10.
them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast, and the
false prophet are; and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

. 3. Thirdly, Deep things of God, of the divine Essence and Will, concerning
which the Apostle says, The 1 Cor. 2. 10.
Spirit searches all things, yea the deep things of God. Things which the
clearest understandings of men and Angels entertain with amazement: we cannot
but bewray our balbutiencie when we treat of One in Three, and Three in one;
such a mysterious gulf is the Trinity: so when we discourse either of the
Personal Union, or the Theandrical acts of Christ. And no wonder, seeing we
meet with such secrets and depths even in Gods revealed Will, The greatest
divines have acknowledged many (...), Things hard to be understood; yea,
diverse (...), knots that cannot be untied, till there either come further
light into this world, or we be translated into a better. Such as every modest
christian will be ready to say of, as the learned Cajetan did concerning the
reason of that difference, which in the Hebrew Text is observable betwixt the
title of Psalm 121. and those other Psalms of Degrees, Reservo Spiritui Sancto,
I reserve the solution of this and that doubt to the holy Spirit. For to him
and the other Divine Persons such things are no riddles; though to us they be
dark and Enigmatical, yea, perhaps unsearchable. Although we ever and anon meet
with cause of crying out as Saint Paul once did, How unsearchable Romans 11. 33.
are his judgments, and his ways past finding out? Let us always remember
and believe that of St. James, known unto God are all his works from the
beginning of the Act. 15. 18.
world.

. 4. Well may the prudent consideration of what has been said concerning the
depth of Divine Omniscience put the wisest of men in mind of their Nescience;
keep them from leaning to their own understandings; and give them just occasion
to think of an answer to Zophars question, What can thou know? If the secrets
of nature do so puzzle thee, what can thou know concerning those much greater
secrets of grace and glory? of which Luther Quid si philosophia haec non capit?
fides tamen capit. major est verbi Dei authoritas, quam nostri ingenii
capacitas. major Sp. Sanctus quam Aristoteles. Luther de captivit. Babylonic^.
Psalm. 147. 5.
very excellently, Philosophy receives them not, faith does. The authority of
Scripture is greater by far then the capacity of our wit; and the Holy Ghost
then Aristotle. Well may the depth of Divine understanding, which the Psalmist
says is infinite, Great is the Lord, and of great power; his understanding is
infinite, cause us to reflect upon the shallowness, the finiteness, yea, the
folly of our own. For if the foolishness of God be wiser then men, as the
Apostle tells us it is, 1 Cor. 1. 25.
what is his wisdom? Add if the wisdom of this world be foolishness with God,
1 Cor. 3. 19.
what is its folly? No wonder if one learned man wrote a book of the vanity
Cornel. Agrip.
of Sciences, others of the Nullity, Anton. Verderius. Franc. Zanch. M. D. Hoc
unum scio quod nihil scio. Socrates. Quo magis studiis incumbimus eo magis nos
videre quam nihil scimus, Ap. Jo. Bevoricium. Epist. quaest. p. 86.
Quod nihil scitur. If the wise heathen professed, the only thing he knew was
this that he knew not any thing at all. If Friar Paul of Venice the judicious
author of that excellent history of the Council of Trent was wont to say. The
more we study, the more we see how little or nothing we understand; yea, if
more knowing men then any of these abounded in acknowledgements of their own
ignorance. Asaph, So foolish was I and ignorant; Psalm. 73. 22, Prove. 30. 23.
I was as a beast before thee. Agur, Surely I am more brutish then any man, and
have not the understanding of a man. I neither learned wisdom, nor have the
knowledge of the holy. So true is that of our great Apostle, If any man think
that he knows any thing, he 1 Cor. 8. 2.
knows nothing yet as he ought to know.

. 5. Next follows the third dimension, which is Longitude, in this
expression, The measure thereof is longer then the earth. For the better
stating whereof let it be considered, that whereas the word here translated
Measure relates not to extension only, but also to duration; and the earth
has a double longitude, one of space, the other of continuance; which the
Scripture takes special notice of in other texts, as in that of Ecclesiastes,
One generation Eccles 1. 4.
passes away, and another generation comes: but the earth abides for ever. I
conceive the latter may here be alluded to, viz. the earths long continuance,
as in some low proportion fit to resemble that everlasting duration of God,
which cannot be adequately represented by any creature. Sure I am by the
Ancient of days in Daniel the eternal Dan. 7. 9, 13.
Jehovah is described; by length of Prove. 3. 16.
days in wisdoms right hand, of which in the Proverbs, many Interpreters
understand the blessings of Eternity: And this very place of Job is expounded
by Gregory in this sense. His words are, Terra longior, quia creaturae modum
perennitate Greg. Moral. lib. 10. cap. 7.
suae Aeternitatis excedit.

All creatures had an original, all but some few shall have a dissolution. Of
the Creator, and of him only is that of the Psalmist verified, From
everlasting Psalm. 90. 2.
to everlasting thou art God. He gave beginning Principium sine p^incipio,
finis sine sine.
to all things, but was himself without a beginning; is the end for which all
things were made, but himself without end. The best of men, alas! are but of
yesterday, and know not where they shall be to morrow, according to that of
Bildad, We are but Job 8. 9.
of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow. His
being God from everlasting to everlasting should encourage us to walk in the
way everlasting, having this everlasting consolation Psalm. 139. last. 2 Thessalonians.
2. 16.
and good hope through grace, that he will save us with an everlasting
salvation; because he wants neither power to Isa. 45. 17.
effect it, for his strength is everlasting; Isa. 26. 4.
nor will, for his mercy is so too, as David testifies, The mercy of the Lord
is Psalm. 103. 17.
from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him.

. 6. The more to blame were some overweening sons of Adam for daring to assume
unto themselves, and ascribe to other persons and things this incommunicable
perfection of God. Of old the heathenish people of Rome were wont to style
their Emperors, yea and their city Eternal. Concerning which Rev. 13. 1, 5.
Infronte purpuratae merelricis scriptum est nomen blasphemiae, id est, Romae
Aeternae. Hierom. ad Algusiam quaest. Aeterna cum dicitur quae temporalis est,
utique nomen est blasphemiae. -- cum supplices dicunt, Altaribus vestris,
Perennitati vestrae etc. Prosp. de praedic. and promiss. in Dimid. temp. cap. 7.
practice of theirs, two ancient writers, Hierome and Prosper interpret those
names of blasphemy mentioned in the Revelation. They accounted such no less
then blasphemers as called Rome the Eternal city, and saluted the Emperor
thereof by the title of your Eternity. A thing usually done among them. Yea
this Calenture had taken the brains of some even amongst the Christian
Emperors: so exceedingly contagious are words and examples that contain
blasphemy in them. Ammianus Marcellinus reports of Constantius an Arrian
Exerc. 8.
Prince, that being puffed up by the ostentation Ammian. Marcell. initio lib. 5.
of his flatterers, and the prosperous success of his affairs, he was come to
that height of insolence as to presume he should never die, and in his writings
to style himself Our Eternity. His words are these, Immunem se deinde fore ab
omni mortalitatis incommodo fidenter existimans, confestim a justitia
declinavit ita intemperanter, ut Aeternitatem meam aliquoties subjeceret ipse
dictando. Yea Justinian himself feared not to say concerning some of his
Edicts, Nostra sanxit Aeternitas. Vid. Contem. politic. lib. 7. cap. 4. 3.


EXERCITATION 8. Divine Immensity shadowed out by the breadth of the Sea.
Divine Omnipresence cleared and vindicated. The proposal hereof as an antidote
against sinning in secret. Five practical Corollaries from the greatness of
God in general.
. 1. THe fourth dimension is still behind in that clause, Broader then the
Sea. It may be thought to relate unto divine Omnipresence and Immensity; which
is, though not set forth to the life, yet some way shadowed out by the breadth
of the Sea: In that the vast ocean stretches its arms far and near (so we call
them arms of the Sea) to the embracing of certain shores, very much distant
each from other; and is in that respect in a manner omnipresent with the
several parts of the earth, which it is united to in one Globe. So, and much
more then so, the Immensity of Gods essence is such as to render him actually,
and at all times present with every creature in the upper and lower world; for
which cause he is said to fill the heaven Jerem. 23. 24.
and the earth. To a certain Philosopher, who asked one of our profession,
Where is God? the Christian answered, Apud Jo. Gerhard. in Exeges. page 797. in
4o.
Let me first understand from thee where he is not, to intimate his being
present every where. Which he is, not only by his power and providence, as
some would confine it, but also by his essence; according to the true meaning
of that which Paul said at Athens concerning God, He is not far from every one
Acts 17. 27, 28. (...). Chrysostom. homil. 38. in Act. Apost.
of us. For in him we live and move, and have our being. He said not (as
Chrysostom observed) By him we live and move, but in him; to note the intimacy
of his presence, and that with all sorts of things, whether they be such as
have life, or motion without life, or barely Being without motion. Yea
wherever they be, whether in heaven, or earth, or hell, as the Psalmist
expressly, If I ascend up into heaven, thou Psalm. 139. 8, 9.
art there; if I make my bed in hell, behold thou art there; If I take the
wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the Sea; even there
shall thy hand lead me. To which accords that of Seneca, Turn Quocunque te
slexeris, ibi illum videbis occurrentem tibi. Nihil ab illo vacat. Opus suum
ipse implet. Senec. de Benefic. li^. 4. cap. 8.
thy self which way thou will, thou shall there see him meeting thee. There is
not any thing void of him, He fills whatsoever he has made.

. 2. This truth having been so fully acknowledged by a wise heathen, it will
argue but too much weakness in any Christian to stumble (as some
notwithstanding have done) at this sorry cavil against it. It seems unworthy of
God, say they, to afford his presence with all things, even the least and
filthiest. Neither do we see how he can possibly do it without receiving some
defilement from them. For if God were not lessned by creating the meanest
things, then surely he is not by affording his presence to them after they were
made. As for defliement, there can be no fear of that. Can the sun shine upon
dunghils and worse places without being thereby defiled? and shall not Gods
essence, which is infinitely purer then the light, preserve it self from
contracting filth from any thing it comes near unto! The soul of man united to
a sickly and leprous body, does notwithstanding retain its purity. Much more
God in the forementioned case. Be we therefore careful, in spite of all
heretical cavils firmly to believe the truth of divine Omnipresence and
Immensity; for the clearing up whereof to our understandings, Divines have
invented sundry comparisons; two whereof I shall instance in. One out of
Austin, The whole world, Augustine. Confess. lib. 7. cap. 5.
says he, is so in God, as a little sponge in a vast ocean. The Sea besides
its encompassing the sponge on every side, does also thoroughly penetrate,
moisten, and sustain the whole substance within, and every part of it. Another
out of Lessius. He compares Lessius de Perfectionibus divinis lib. 1. cap. 3.
20.
the world to a crystal Ball hanging in the light of the Sun. In which case the
light would intimately pierce the whole Ball, and also extend it self far and
near, round about it. Such and so intimate is Gods presence with every creature
in every place.

. 3. The contemplation whereof should be effectual for the preventing of all
sins, especially such as are usually committed in secret, upon this grand
presumption, which the Prophet denounces a curse against the subjects of,
saying, Woe unto them that Isai 29. 15.
seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord. and their works are in the
dark, and they say, Who sees us? and who knows us? a presumption that there
is none by to take notice of them. Suppose it were so; yet men are bound to
reverence themselves: That of Ausonius is excellent advise, When thou art about
to act any thing unseemly, be afraid of thy Turpe quid ausurus te sine test
time.
self, although there be no other witness. But so it is not; for conscience is
by; concerning which Lactantius produces an admirable speech out of Seneca, O
thou mad man! what will it profit thee to Demens, quid prodest non habere
conscium habenti conscientiam?
have none conscious of thy crime, so long as thou have a conscience that is?
But that thou will say is part of thy self. True: wherefore I add, God is by;
of whom the Apostle emphatically says, If our 1 John 3. 20.
heart condemn us, God is greater then our heart, and knows all things.
Conscience we are wont to say, is a thousand witnesses; and let it be withal
considered, that God is as a thousand consciences; both for intimacy of
presence, and perspicacity in discerning. It is worth observing how the mention
of Gods immensity is brought in by the Prophet in that forecited place of
Jeremy, where the whole verse runs thus; Can any hide himself in secret places,
Jerem. 23. 24.
that I shall not see him, says the Lord? Do not I fill heaven and earth,
says the Lord? Our most secret sins are, in reference to God, no more secret,
in regard of his Omnipresence, then if committed in the most open light.
Witness that in Moses his prayer, Thou have set our iniquities before thee, our
secret Psalm. 90. 8.
sins in the light of thy countenance. Jacob once said of Bethel, God was once
in this Genes. 28. 16.
place, and I knew it not; How fearful is it? Let every place be a Bethel to
thee, O watchful Christian, a place of fear, and in some sense an house of
God, be it market, or shop, or field; be sure the Lord is in that place, not
present only, but looking on; nor only looking, but weighing and pondering,
whatsoever thou do there in all the circumstances and aggravations thereof,
as Solomon testifies, The ways of man Prove. 5. 21.
are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings.

. 4. Having already made improvement of the several branches, let me now for a
conclusion draw certain Corollaries from the greatness of God in general; in
number five.

First, Let him be greatly praised for this by all mankind. It Is the Psalmists
inference, Great is the Lord, and greatly Psalm. 145. 3.
to be praised. The world is wont to commend greatness both in persons and
things. Great Princes have had Panegyrical Orations made in their praise, as
Trajan by Pliny; great cities, as Grand Cair; great monuments, as the Colossus
are greatly extolled by writers and travelers. How much more should the great
God? whom the Prophet accordingly magnifies, saying, Behold, the nations are as
a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: Isai.
40. 14, 15, 16, 17.
behold he takes up the isles, as a very little thing. And Lebanon is not
sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt-offering. All
nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him less then
nothing and vanity. The drop of a bucket is nothing to the whole ocean, nor the
dust of the balance to the whole earth: no more is the whole earth with all
the inhabitants of it to God. In so much as if he were to be sacrificed to,
proportionably to his greatness, all the beasts in Lebanon would not suffice
for a burntoffering, nor all the wood thereof for a fire, nor all men in the
world for a priest to offer it.

. 5. Secondly, Let him be greatly confided in by all his people. That of St.
John, 1 John 4 4.
Ye are of God, little children; and greater is he that is in you, then he that
is in the world, should be made use of by the Saints as a precious receipt
against the most deadly poison that can at any time be administered to them. The
Church indeed is very often put upon renewing Jehosaphats complaint, and crying
out, We have no might against this great company (perhaps both of 2 Chro. 20.
12.
wicked men, and wicked spirits) that comes against us; neither know we what to
do. But so long as she can add, as he there does, Our eyes are upon thee; Tit.
2. 13.
this contemplation of her great God and Savior may support her against the
fear of them all. The devil is mighty, I confess it, said Luther, but he will
never be Almighty, as my God and Savior Esto diabolus magnipotens, nunquam
erit omnipotens.
is. upon these grounds a believing Christian, living up to his principles, may
well say, Show me a danger greater then my God, a Destroyer, greater then my
Savior, I will then fear it and him. Till then pardon me if I do not let my
confidence go. what though Jacob be small, as the Prophet speaks, By whom shall
Jacob arise? Amos 7. 5.
for he is small. Yet arise he shall in spite of opposition, and that because
Jacobs God is great.

Thirdly, Let the world learn to seek after interest in him. Many, says
Solomon, Many seek the rulers favor. And Prove. 29. 26.
reason good; because he is able to protect the persons, and reward the
services of his followers. Behold here a Ruler indeed, whose favor was never
sought in vain, if sought in time; Dulcis inexpertis cultura potentis amici;
expertus metuit. Horat.
one that can protect from hell, and bestow heaven; yea that which is the
heaven of heaven, the fruition of himself. Being great with great men is a
thing much affected by some, although in experience it often becomes not a
burden only, but a mischief: whereas the love and favor of the great God, and
our Savior, always proves, (shall I say, beneficial? that is too little) it
proves, and that always beatificall.

Fourthly, Let such as have obtained interest from him look for great things
from him. To Baruch it was once said, Seek Jerem. 45. 5.
thou great things for thy self? seek them not: because he sought them in the
creatures; but if we seek them from and in the great Creator, we may lawfully
seek great things, neither shall our doing so be attended with disappointment.
For open thy mouth wide, says Psalm. 81. 10.
the Lord, and I will fill it. We are wont either not to open our mouths at
all, or not wide enough; and therefore it is that most of us continue so empty.
Ye have not, because ye ask not; James 4. (...).
so the Apostle: let me say, ye ask perhaps, and yet have but little, because
ye do not expect much. O Consider, as Samuel once bespake the men of Israel,
how great things God has already done for 1 Samuel 12. 24.
you, that so your experiments may be your encouragement, to expect yet
greater: remembering that of our blessed Savior to Nathaniel, Believe thou?
thou shall see greater things then these. John 1. 50.


He in whom ye trust, O believers, is a great God, and loves to do all things
like himself. Wherefore look for great things from him, great assistances,
great enlargements, great deliverances: yea the forgiving of great sins, and
the obtaining of great salvation.

. 7. Fifthly, Let such as have received great things from God, maintain a
certain greatness of spirit suitable to their interest in him. I do not mean an
haughty spirit, swelled with pride, for that is altogether unsuitable to a
saving interest in God, who beholds the proud afar off; but Psalm 138. 6.
an humble spirit greatned by continual converse with the great God; who by
raising up his servants hearts to the contemplation and fruition of higher
objects, makes them too big for this world. It is reported of Moses, that when
he was come to years, or according to the original, when he was waxed great,
Hebr. 11. 24, 25, 26, 27.
(in spirit perhaps, as well as in stature) he did overlook the preferments,
pleasures, and riches of the world, which are all there intimated, yea the
menaces of it too: for it is there also said, He feared not the wrath of the
king, but endured, as seeing him who is invisible. His conversing with the
great God, had made all these to appear to him as petty things. To a soul truly
great no Animo magno nil magnum.
worldly matter has any true greatness in it: As if one could take a station
in heaven, whatsoever is here below would appear but small in his sight by
reason of its distance. It is accounted by some a great matter to have the
frowns and ill word of a great man: But St John, whose conversation was in
heaven, made nothing of it. Speaking of Diotrophes his malignancy and
reproachful speeches he phraseth it thus, prating against us with malicious
John 2 epistle v. 10. (...).
words. The term properly signifies trifling. Though Diotrephes were a great
prelate, and his words very malicious; yet the Apostles spirit was raised so
far above them, that with him all were but trifles, and by him contemned as
such.

APHORISM V. The Goodness and Greatness of God are both abundantly manifested
by his decrees of Election and Preterition, together with his works of Creation
and Providence.
EXERCITATION 1. Exerc. 1.

. 1. I Durst not wholly wave the doctrine of Predestination, (no not in this
Treatise of Principles) after I had duly Aph. 5.
pondered that grave admonition of Ambrose, or according to others of Prosper,
Quae Deus occulta esse voluit, non sunt scrutanda; quae autem monifesta fecit
non sunt neganda: ne in illis illicite curiosi, in istis damnabiliter
inveniamur in grati. De vocar. Gent. cap. 7.
Such things as God would have kept secret must not be pried into by us; nor
such denied as he has openly declared: lest we be found in the former attempt
unlawfully curious, in the latter damnably unthankful. And also laid to heart
the endeavors, not of foreiners only, but of certain late English writers to
possess their readers with vehement and strong prejudices against the
long-received truth in those points. One of them tells us, It is sacrilegious
to grant that God has I. G. Red. Redeem. page 243. lin. 7. Ibid. page 278.

he purposes to bring thereunto infallibly etc. Elsewhere styling it, That

not written in that book. Of some whom the Lord knows for 2 Timothy 2. 19.

John 10. 26, 28, 29.
to him by the father, and of such persons as were not his sheep, nor
accordingly so given to him. This, I hope, is no canting; there is neither
Error nor Trick in all this, but to proceed.

. 2. Election (as to our purpose which concerns the choice of men only, not of
Angels) is that secret unsearchable decree of God, wherein he did from
everlasting single out of the rest of mankind a definite number of particular
persons, ordaining them infallibly unto the attainment of holiness here, and
happiness hereafter, according to the counsel and good pleasure of his Will.
Which description offers to the readers consideration as things material, and
not unfit to be treated of, provided it be soberly done, the Nature, Antiquity,
Object, Products and Cause of Election.

First, The Nature of it. It is a secret unsearchable decree of God. The two
principal emanations of God's Will respecting intellectual creatures, are his
Decrees, and his Commands. They differ, as in sundry other things, so, in point
of perspicuitie. The Commands are plain; he that runs may read his duty in
them; the Decrees abstruse: Our destinies cannot be so easily read, as our
duties may. And whereas diverse secret things may yet be discovered upon
diligent search, according to that Proverb of Solomon, Counsel in the heart of
man is like deep water: Prove. 20. 5.
but a man of understanding will draw it out. The Decrees of God are so secret,
as to be withal unsearchable. Whence the Apostle, O the depth of the riches
both of the wisdom and knowledge of Romans 11. 13.
God! How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out! where
by Judgments it is, as I conceive, most proper to understand the Decrees of
(...), from (...), whence cerno, decerno, and decretum.
his Will; by Ways, the Administrations of his Providence in order to the
execution of those Decrees. Some innovatours there are indeed, who have so
modelled the mysterious Doctrine of Predestination, as to leave little or
nothing of mystery in it. Our Remonstrants think themselves able to wade,
where our Apostle was past his depth, and forced to cry out, (...)! Their way
pretends to give a clear reason why one is elected, another reprobated, one
converted, another not, but for my part I had much rather with St. Paul be
ignorant still then over-learned, (that I say not oversawcie) with Arminius and
his followers.

. 3. Secondly the Antiquity. It Is from everlasting: An eternal Decree. So
Paul, According as he has chosen us in Ephesians. 1. 4.
him before the foundation of the world. This expression notes eternity. The
kingdom we are elected to, is said to have been prepared (...), from the
foundation. Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared Math.
25. 34.
for you from the foundation of the world; in reference to the third heavens,
that place where the kingdom is to be set up and inherited, which was in the
beginning of time created by the builder and maker of it, as God is styled. But
the Decree whereby we were Hebr. 11. 10.
designed thereunto, to have been (...), before the foundation of the world.
That is, from everlasting; as may be further gathered from other phrases in the
writings of our Apostle; this by name, Who has saved us, and called us with an
holy calling, not according to our 2 Timothy 1. 9.
works. but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in
Christ Jesus, before the world began. This both Erasmus and Calvin interpret of
predestination. Compare we it with another speech of the same Apostle to Titus,
In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot Tit. 1. 2.
lie, promised before the world began. The meaning whereof will no longer be
obscure, if it be considered that the firstborn of election was Christ himself
(who applied to himself that which God said of old by the Prophet Isaiah;
Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul is
wellpleased.) Matthew. 12. 18.
That certain persons were from eternity given to Christ, whom the Father had
constituted Head of all his elect, to be his members, and by him brought to
eternal blessedness, according to what we read in St. John's Gospel, Thou have
given him power over all flesh, John 17. (...).
that he should give eternal life to as many as thou have given him. That in
this transaction there passed promises from the Father to the Son in the behalf
of himself and all his members. And that this is the grace which was given us
in Christ Jesus, these the Promises of eternal life before the world began,
spoken Promisit vitam aeternam, non tantum initio mundi praedicando e^m primis
parentibus in paradiso, sed etiam paciscendo de ea ante conditum mundum cum
Filio designato mediatore nastro in soedere redemptionis. David Dicson Exp sit.
Analytic. in Tit. 1. 2. August. l. de Praedestin. and great. cap. 5.
of in the forecited places to Timothy and Titus: upon the latter whereof I
meet with the same Gloss from a Reverend Scottish writer, whose name and words
are here presented in the Margin. I shall add no more concerning the
antiquity of this Decree, save only a brief saying of Austin, Intra mundum
facti sumus, and ante mundum electi sumus. We were made within the world but
chosen before it.

. 4. Thirdly, the object of election is a definite number of particular persons
singled out of the rest of mankind. We learn from St Luke that the Luke 18. 7.
Elect cry unto God day and night: And St John in his Apocalypse tells us
what one of their principal cries is, They Rev. 6. 10, 11.
cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do thou
not judge and avenge our blood? As also what answer they had from heaven, It
was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their
fellow servants and their brethren that should be killed as they were, should
be fulfilled. From the collation of which texts it may be inferred that their
number is set, and shall in due time be completed; for that is the thing
related to in the word (...) shall be fulfilled. It is then a definite number,
and that of particular persons, whose names are elsewhere said to be Luke 10.
20. Phil. 4. 3.
written in the book of life, Names in Scripture being often put for persons;
as in the Acts, The number of names together Acts 1. 15.
were about one hundred and twenty. and in the Revelation, In the earthquake
were Apocal. 11. 13. (...).
slain of men seven thousand; it is in the original, Names of men. They do
certainly shoot beside the mark, who so confidently teach that predestination
is terminated not upon persons, but qualifications; and that not this or that
man in particular is elected or reprobated, but only in general, whosoever
believes and persevereth belongs to election, whosoever continues in
unbelief, to reprobation; and that so as the same person may be to day under
the one, and to morrow under the other decree, according to the change of his
qualifications. But if so, it would not in likelihood have been said, The
foundation of God stands sure, 2 Timothy 2. 19. (...). Novit Deus qui sint sui;
Non quales sed qui. Romans 9. 15, 18.
having this seal, The Lord knows who are his, but rather, what kind of men
are his. Nor to the Romans, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy. And
again, He has mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens
(which does clearly relate to persons) but rather, what sort he will.

. 5. Against what has been said in this and the former paragraph there are two
principal objections; whereof neither is to be waved, lest it should be thought
unanswerable. The first is borrowed from philosophy, and runs thus. Acts
suppose the being of their objects; The decrees of God are divine acts, and
therefore could not pass upon men's particular persons before the world was,
because there were then none in being. I answer that whereas the Acts of God
are either Immanent abiding within, or Transient passing from him, and
terminated upon somewhat without himself; His transient Acts do either suppose,
or produce the being of their objects; suppose it as his Rewarding and
Punishing, produce it, as his creating acts. But those that are immanent (of
which rank his Decrees are) do not necessarily require the preexistence of
their objects in esse reali in a way of reality; for it suffices that they
have it in esse cognito, in the forekowledge of God. Jesus Christ our Mediator
is styled a Lamb foreordained before the foundation of 1 Pet. 1. 19, 20.
the world; yet had he no existence as such till after his incarnation. God who
had designed Josiah to special services, 1 Kings 13. 3. vid. Junium and Piscat.
in locum.
called him by his name, and foretold what should be done by him, full three
hundred and thirty years before he did it. So elsewhere ( Cyrus is See
Scultetus on Esai. 45. page 623. fin.
named, and has a service allotted him in the foreknowledge of God one hundred
and forty years before he was born. It is reported by Procopius Procopius.
that when Misdates king of Persia was dead without issue, but had left his
wife with child; the Persian nobility set the crown on the Queens belly before
she quickened, thereby acknowledging her issue that should be for their lawful
Sovereign. So as Sapores (which was afterward the childs name) began his
reign before his life. If such acts when done by men seem not irrational, why
should any think it strange for the onely-wise God to set the crown of election
upon the head of certain persons, while as yet they have no being, save only
in the womb of his decree?

. 6. The other objection is taken from such places of Scripture as deny God to
be an accepter of persons, which they say he must needs be, if considering
mankind in an equal condition he chose some to life, and passed by others.

In order to the solution hereof, I shall first Distinguish between Acceptance
and Acception of persons. We find them both mentioned by St Peter as it were
with one breath, in that short saying of his, ( Of a truth I perceive Acts 10.
34, 35.
that God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that fears him
and works righteousness is accepted with him) the one as attributable to him,
the other as not. Were it not for his acceptance of persons, woe and nothing
but woe to the sons of men. It is the joy of their hearts to consider that there
are certain men of his good will; as some read that (...) Luke 2. 14.
in the Angels song: and to remember that the Church is by her head and husband
styled Hephzibah that is my delight is in her; because the members thereof are,
as Paul speaks, accepted in Ephesians. 1. 6.
the beloved. Next Declare the true notion of Prosopolepsie or acception of
persons in Scripture-dialect.

Besides the prime importance of these words (...) in Greek, and Persona in
Latin for an individual intelligent substance, (so, The gift bestowed 2 Cor.

upon us by the means of many persons is the blessing of recovery granted upon
the prayers of sundry men and women) They have a secondary importance, and are
sometimes put to signify a vizard, property or counterfeit resemblance assumed
by any such individual. So in Seneca, Nemo potest personam diu far, that is,
None can play the hypocrite long: and in the Epigrammatist a gray-haired man
having put on a black periwig to conceal his age, is told of it thus, --
Inveniet Proserpina canum,
Personam capiti detrahet illa tuo.
Now because these vizards and properties are things external, not at all
belonging to the Essence of the party assuming them, hence it comes to pass
that these words at the next remove signify such relations, accommodations

and and accomplishments as being external to the essence of a man, as also to
the merit of his cause, ought not to incline a Judge to pronounce a sentence on
his behalf, or in the distribution of justice to regard him above others to
whom such helps are wanting. He who is swayed in judicial proceedings by such
outward things is in the Scripture said to be an accepter of persons. So in
Leviticus, Ye shall do no Levit. 18. 15.
unrighteousness in judgment: thou shall not respect the person of the poor,
nor honor the person of the mighty; but in righteousness thou shall judge thy
neighbor. And in the New Testament these two terms (...) righteous judgment,
and (...) Romans 2. 5. compared with v. 11.
accepting of persons are directly opposed. Divines have received it for a

maxim. That acceptance of persons is not found in gratuitis, in acts of
bounty, wherein the doner is at liberty to dispose his free gifts as pleases
himself, but in debitis in acts of justice and right, wherein there lies an
obligation upon him that distributeth to give every man his due. Hereupon they
conclude that in divine praedestination Almighty God, who is no debtour to any
of his creatures, and who acts therein not as a Judge, but as a Sovereign
Lord and liberal benefactour, chooses some and passes by others, as without
injustice or wrong to any, so without any show of that which the Scripture
properly calls Acception of persons, because he was not moved by any external
thing in doing so.

If any Reader think it not safe to credit this upon my single testimony,
behold in the margin further security, Potest Deus absque vitiosa personarum
acceptione non modo ex duobus hominibus prorsus aequalibus unum eligere ad
vitam aeternam alio praeterito; sed etiam illum eligere quem praescivit
pluribus and gravionibus peccatis implicandum, illo relicto quom praevidit
pauciora and leviora admissurum. Bannes in 1am. Thomae quaest. 23. artic. 51.
Injusta personarum acceptio locum non habet ubi quis ex mera liberalitate de
suo dat inaequaliter aequalibus; sed ubi in dispensatione rerum debitarum quis
uni savcat prae altero ex respectu ad aliquam personae circumstantiam quae est

agit ex debito justiti^e, sed ex dono munificentiae; neque respicit
nobilitatem. divilias, ingenium, aut aliam qualitatem quamcunque, (unde (...)
nomen invenit) sed liberalitatem and bonitatem suam juxta illud Matthaei 20.

to which it were easy to add. much more, if need were.

. 7. Fourthly, The products of Divine Election are chiefly two. First, Holiness
here. God is said to have Ephesians. 1. 3, 4.
blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Christ, according as he has chosen
us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy. Where
spiritual blessings are pointed at as the streams, and election as the fountain
from whence they flow. It as the root, and holiness as the fruit. So elsewhere,
We are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, beloved of the
Lord, because God 2 These. 2. 13.
has from the beginning chosen you to Salvation, through Sanctification of the
Spirit, and belief of the truth. Here we find not only Sanctification in
general, but faith, which is the flower of holiness, derived from Election. The
same Apostle styles it, The faith of Gods elect. Tit. 1. 1.
And St. Luke in the Acts, speaking of the success which St. Paul's preaching
had among the Gentiles, says expressly, As many as were ordained to eternal
life, believed. Acts 13. 48.


A Text which the soundest divines look at, as a most pregnant place to prove a
causal influence of Divine Predestination upon the work of saving faith.
Others, I know, there are, (and they not a few, nor inconsiderable) who have
strongly endeavored to turn the edge and strength of this place another way,
by rendering the word (...), not (as we do) Ordained, but Disposed, or
well-affected to eternal life. Unto whose corrupt Gloss, I oppose the following
considerations.

First, If it were to be so read, then all that heard the Apostles Sermon there
recorded, even all and every one without exception should have believed, seeing
there is not a man in the world, and therefore none in that congregation who
was not disposed, and well-affected to the reward of eternal life (the will of
man being necessarily carried to the desire of blessedness, which none are so
brutish as not to affect) for that unto which these are said to be (...), is
not conversion, but life eternal.

Secondly, Disposedness in their sense does not always precede faith, nor
faith always follow it. When Saul was in the full career of his persecuting
madness against the Saints, what disposedness was there in him unto conversion,
unless fury be a disposition to faith? yet then did he first believe. In that
young man who came to our Savior, of whom it is testified, That he was not far
from the kingdom of God, which of their dispositions was wanting? yet he went
away sorrowful, and believed not.

Thirdly, Faith it self is the first saving disposition that any man has,
because it first lays hold upon Christ, and of life by him; in so much as none
is formally disposed to eternal life till he have believed.

Fourthly, St. Luke does no where use (...). and (...), either in his Gospel,
or in the Acts for disposedness, but for ordination and constitution diverse
times, therefore our reading here, As many as were ordained to eternal life, is
to be retained.

. 8. But learned Grotius will by no means allow of this interpretation. They
(says he) who apply this Text to Predestination, Nihil vident, see nothing at
all. Yet by his favor, a man that saw as far into the Mysteries of Divinity,
as also into the idioms of the Greek tongue, as Grotius himself (be it spoken
without disparagement to his great learning) Chrysostom I mean, applys it so in
his Commentary (...) Chrysostom. Hom. 30. in Act. Apost.
upon the place. And his (...), by which (...) is expounded Erasmus translates
Praefiniti a Deo, Predestined of God. Three things are alleged by Grotius,
for overthrowing of this sense; but all in vain. His first plea is, that it is
not usual for all of a city, a congregation that are predestined, to believe
at one and the same time, therefore that which we assert is not like to be the
meaning here. For answer, I acknowledge it is not usual; no more is it to have
three thousand inhabitants of one city brought in to God on one day. But what
if God willing to glorify his Gospel, and the power of converting Grace, as he
called three thousand Jews in one day, by Peter's Ministry, Acts the second; so
here by St. Paul's, at his first solemn undertaking to preach unto the Gentiles,
Acts the 13. were pleased to work upon as many in that congregation as did
belong to the election of grace? shall any man dare to prescribe, and plead
custom to the contrary? His second Argument runs thus. All that truly believe
are not Predestined unto life. Therefore that for which we contend is not to
be thought a proper sense. Answer. This reason is founded upon a grand mistake,
viz. That faith is common to all, whether elect, or non-elect, although Paul
style it, the Faith of Gods elect, as before; and Christ tells the Jews, Ye
believe not, because ye are not of my sheep. John 10. 26.
He argues in the third place, from St. Lukes unacquaintedness with the secrets
of God. It was not in his power to tell who of that company were elected, who
not; therefore by his (...), he must not be conceived to have understood such
as were in that sense ordained to eternal life. I answer, Although the penman
did not, the inditer, viz. the Holy Ghost did exactly know whose names were
written in the book of life, and whose were not. Now he it was that in the
history of the Acts suggested and dedicated to his secretary both matter and
words.

. 9. The second product of election is happiness hereafter. Accordingly the
objects of this Decree are those whom God has not appointed unto wrath, but to
obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus 1 These. 5. 9.
Christ. Salvation is that which they are said to be chosen to; and that
wherein their names are written, called, The 2 These. 2. 13.
book of life. For as in military affairs, Phil. 4. 3.
Commanders have their Muster-rolls, wherein are contained the names of all the
soldiers whom they have listed, whence the phrase of Conscribere milites; and
in Commonwealths there are Registries kept wherein are recorded the names of
such as are chosen to offices of trust and other preferments, whence the title
of Patres conscripti ascribed to the Senators of Rome. So the Scripture
condescending to our capacities and speaking of God after the manner of men,
attributes to him a book of life, wherein it supposes a legible writing and
Registring the names of all those persons whom he has irreversibly
predestined to life everlasting. I say, irreversibly, for if that of Stoics
be true, In sapientum decretis nulla est litura, In the decrees of wise men
there will be no blotting and blurring; how much more may it be asserted
concerning those eternal Decrees of the only wise God? If it became Pilate to
say, What I have written I have written, it would certainly mis-become the
great John 19. 22.
God to blot so much as one name out of the Lambs book of life written by
himself before the world was. We may take it for granted that this book will
not admit of any Deleatur, or of any See my Tactica Sacra. lib. 3. cap. 2.. 9,
10, 11. and sequent.
Expurgatorie Index, whatever some pretend to the contrary, whose arguments
have been elsewhere sufficiently answered. I shall only here propound, and
endeavor to satisfy another objection, whereof no mention is there made. Paul
knew himself to be a chosen vessel, for Ananias had told him Acts 9. 15.
so from Christ's own mouth: yet speaks of himself as of one in some danger, at
least in some possibility of becoming a Reprobate, in these words, I keep
under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any 1 Cor. 9. 27.
means, when I have preached to others, I my self should be a castaway, or, as
other translations have it, a Reprobate. Ergo, the decree of Election is not
irreversible.

Resp. To prepare the way for a full answer, let it be considered, 1. That the
places cited in the objection are not fitly opposed; because the former is not
necessarily to be understood of election to salvation, but may probably be
limited to Paul's being chosen an Apostle: Neither is the latter infallibly
meant of that reprobation, which is contradistinct to the said election, but of
somewhat else. Yea although it be true, and may strongly be inferred from other
texts, that Paul knew his own election to life eternal, the reprobation spoken
of in the end of the verse is not to be taken in the most rigid sense, but in a
milder. 2. That our Apostle, (according to his custom in sundry epistles) was
in the end of this chapter fallen upon the use of terms agonistical, borrowed
from the Olympic and other Grecian games in that age; as appears in the
foregoing verses. Know ye not that they 1 Cor. 9. 24, 25, 26.
who run in a race etc. Every man that striveth for the mastery etc. I so run,
not as uncertainly. So fight I, not as one that beats the air. And that in
the last verse he has no less then four allusions to these exercises. One in
(...) to cuffing, wherein the combatants were wont with their blows to make one
another livid under their eyes; so did he by acts of mortification beat himself
as it were black and blue. A second in (...) to the exercise of wrestling,
wherein the antagonists mutually strove to cast each other to the ground, and
to keep them under. So he, the better to subdue his body of sin, was careful
to keep down his body of flesh, which if pampered, is apt to rebel. A third in
(...). We read in the second to Timothy chapter the second, verse the fifth,
of their striving lawfully, that is, according to the rules and laws prescribed
for that game respectively, in which they were to strive for the mastery. The
officer by whom these laws were propounded to the combatants was called (...),
Paul in allusion thereunto says of himself (...), because in the discharge of
his Apostolical office he had acquainted them with the rules and laws of
Christianity. A fourth in (...) unapproved, a term of disgrace put upon those
whom such as were to judge and pass sentence upon the combatants disallowed.
Whereas those whom the judges rewarded were called (...) approved ones. 3. That
this unapprovedness may either relate to God himself, or to good men. If to God
the supreme judge, then whosoever carries himself amiss in any particular
course of living, offends the Lord, falls under his fatherly displeasure,
and is as to this particular, a person disallowed and rejected, how firm soever
his station may be as to the main. If to good men, who are subordinately to
judge of their preachers doctrine and conversation, a teacher is then said to
be unapproved of them, when upon observation of some unfaithfulness, or
looseness in his demeanor, some sensuality or unlawful indulgence to his
body, they begin to disesteem him, in comparison of what they did before, yea
perhaps to cast him out of their affections, and of their prayers, of which
till then he was a partaker.

These things premised, let it now be observed whether the meaning of the place
contested about be not clearly this, or to this effect. I Paul well remembering
what I am, a member and minister of Jesus Christ, am and shall continue
careful to exercise my self in all the duties of mortification, not making
provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof: lest I who by mine office
am bound to declare unto others the grand rules of Christian practice,
particularly of temperance, which I urged but now, saying, Every man that
striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things, should by any sensual
demeanor of mine own, not only prove a castaway as to the esteem I formerly
had in the hearts and consciences of good people, and to the interest I enjoyed
in their devotion; (which I should account a loss far exceeding that of honor,
or estate) but also fall under the wrath and fatherly displeasure of my God,
and be cast out of fellowship with him, though but for a short space of time;
which to me who have lived in the sense of it, under the constant light of his
countenance, and found his loving kindness better then life, would be worse
then any death. And if this really be the utmost importance of the text, (as
for ought I know it is) without extending it to further or other kind of
reprobation, I hope the objection built upon it will not need any further or
other kind of answer.

. 10. Fifthly, The Cause of divine Electionis tuae causam in te quaere, nec
invenies quod quaeris, and quod invenisse te existimas jam perdidisti quia ibi
quaeris. Heins. homil. in Job. 17. 9. page 38.
election, about which the world is so filled with disputes, is not to be found
in any thing without God himself. the disputers indeed of this world lay out
many thoughts, and put out many books concerning such contrivements as our
corrupt reason would perhaps better allow, and our corrupt wills better affect:
but holy Scripture resolves all into the sole will of God; the good pleasure
and Counsel whereof the Apostle celebrateth as the causes of our
predestination. Having predestined us Ephesians. 1. 5, 11.
unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good
pleasure of his will. And again, Being predestined according to the purpose
of him, who works all things after the counsel of his own will. Words so very
plain and full as would certainly have put an end to altercations, and silenced
disputes in these points; but that corrupt reason is extremely talkative, and
the wisdom of flesh direct enmity against God, Romans 8. 7.
and therefore such as will never yield, till its corruption be removed; for
enmity cannot be reconciled, the enemies may. Whence that excellent speech of
Melancthon, worthy to be had in everlasting remembrance, Dulcescet nostra de
predestinatione sententia, ubi impiae rationis judicium Spiritus Dei
stultificaverit. Then and there only will our doctrine of predestination have
a sweet relish, when and where the Spirit of God shall have befooled the
conceits of wicked reason. That which Paul celebrateth as the true cause of our
election is,

1. The good pleasure of Gods will, according (...).
to which he disposes both of persons and things arbitrarily, as himself
likes best. And in this our reason would better acquiesce were it thoroughly
defecated by grace: That of Christ, which never had any corruption in it, fully
did: as appears by that famous address of his to God the father; I thank
thee, O father, Matthew. 11. 55. 26. (...).
Lord of heaven and earth, because thou have hid these things from the wise and
prudent, and have revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed
good in thy sight.

2. The counsel of his will. Although (...).
God may be truly said to act arbitrarily, yet he never does any thing
unadvisedly, but according to the counsel of his will, which is always
rational, though our shallow reason in this state of degeneracy and mortality
be not able to fathom the depth of its contrivements, and thereupon ready to
cavil at, and call in question the equity of them. Such as do so; (if any such
shall cast an eye upon these papers) must give me leave to say unto them, as
one of our ancient writers did to their forefathers. The Apostle (says he)
having discoursed of these mysteries acknowledges Hieron. in epistola ad
Ctesiphontem.
their depth and adoreeth the wisdom of God in them. Dignare and tu ista
nescire. Concede Deo potentiam sui Nequaquam te indiget defensore. Be thou also
willing to be ignorant of such things. Leave God himself in the modelling of
his decrees and dispensations. He will be sure to do it so, as not to stand in
need of any apology or defense of thine. To which let me add a saying of
Luther, and with it conclude Tu, Ratio, stulta es, non sapis quae sunt Dei.
Itaque ne obstrepas mihi, sed ta^e, non judica, sed audi verbum Dei and (...).
this Exercitation. Reason (says he) thou art a fool, and do not understand
the matters of God. Wherefore be not obstreperous, but hold thy prating; make
not thy self a judge of these things, but attend to the word of God and believe.

EXERCITATION 2. Preterition described. The term defended. Ephesians. 1. 4.

three consequents of negative reprobation. Dr Davenants Animadversions against

most free, peculiar, ancient, leading, and standing favor.
. 1. HAving so fully discoursed of Election, (by which the Decree of
preterition is to be measured) there will be less need of enlarging much upon
that. Take only this description of it; after a brief explication whereof, I
intend, if God will, to proceed unto other concernments. Preterition or
negative Reprobation is an eternal decree of God purposing within himself to
deny unto the Non-elect Exerc. 2.
that peculiar love of his, wherewith election is accompanied, as also that
special grace which infallibly brings to glory: Of which negations,
permission of sin, obduration in sin, and damnation for sin, are direct
consequents. This description carries in the face of it a clear reason, why the
thing described goes under the name of Negative reprobation, because it
stands mainly in the denial of those free favors which it pleases God to
bestow upon his elect. As for the term of preterition, we neither are, nor
ought to be ashamed thereof, however some bold writers have jeered it, because
it is very significant, and has been made use of by their betters. Prosper by
name, and that both in verse and in prose. For in one of his Poems he records
this as a Pelagian tenent -- Quod gratia Christi
Nullum omnino hominem de cunctis qui
generantur
Praetereat. --
That of all mankind the Grace of Christ passes by none. And in his Treatise
de Vocatione Gentium he begins the thirteenth chapter of his first book with
this saying, Quod si aliquos Salvantis gratia praeterierit etc. If saving grace
have passed by any, it is to be referred to the unsearchable judgments of God,
and those ways of his which are past finding out by us in this life. This
premised, let us take a transient view of the chief particulars in the
description.

. 2. It is First an eternal decree, coeternal with that of election; for the
very choosing of some to salvation implies a passing by of such as were not
chosen. Let the Reader compare that passage in Ephesians. 1. 4. He has chosen
Agnoscendum est secreti hujus profunditatem nobis in hac vita patere non posse.
us before the foundation of the world, with that parenthesis Rev. 17. 8. whose
names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world.

Secondly a decree which God purposed in himself. We read in one place of the
purpose of God according to Election, and in another of Gods good pleasure,
Romans 9. 11. Ephesians. 1. 9. Deus in negatio praedest nationis non egreditur extra
s^ipsum. Institut. l. 3. cap. 22.
which he has purposed in himself. The like may be said of preterition. His
good pleasure is the sole fountain of both. The root of both is within himself
and not in any thing without him; as has been well observed by Calvin.

Thirdly, the eternal purpose of God was to deny the Non-elect that peculiar
love, wherewith his election is accompanied; in which respect he is said to
hate them. Jacob have I loved, but Esau Romans 9. 13.
have I hated. A term by which some Divines are willing to understand no more,
then his not being willing to bestow everlasting happiness upon them: because
Hatred in Scripture is often put to signify a less degree of Love. We may not
believe that Leah was odious to her husband; yet the text says, God saw that
Leah was hated, which is certainly to be expounded out of the verse foregoing,
where it is said of Jacob that he loved Rachel more Genesis 29. 30, 31.
then Leah. He loved Leah perhaps less then he ought, surely less then he did
her sister, and in that respect is said to have hated her. That to the Romans
concerning Esau, some interpret in proportion to what is there said concerning
Leah, and among the rest Aquinas. God (says he) loves all men In quantum
quibusdam non vult hoc bonum, quod est vita aterna dicitur eos habere odio vel
reprobare. Tho. part. 1. qu. 23. art. 3. ad ^um.
in as much as he wills some good to all; but in as much as he does not will
to all men the chief good, viz. eternal life, he is said to hate and to
reprobate them.

. 3. Fourthly, His purpose was to deny unto the non-elect that special grace,
which brings infallibly to glory those whom God bestows it upon. No creature
can challenge effectual grace at the hands of God, as a due debt either to his
nature, or to his labor. There be many that speak and write of God sawcily, as
if he were bound to give this and that and the other grace, even where they can
produce no promise by which he has made himself a debtour. I cannot but
commend the zeal of Peter Lombard against such men. To me (says he) this word
Vt mihi videtur hoc verbum Debet venenum habet -- nec Deo proprie competit qui
non est debito^, nobis nisi forte ex promisso. Lib. 1. sententiarum, Did. 43.
He ought, or he is bound seems to have much poison in it; and cannot be
properly applied to God, who is no debtour to us, save only in those cases
wherein he has passed some promise. Sure I am, our Savior tells his
Disciples plainly, It is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
heaven, but to them it is not given, Matthew. 13. 11. And the householder in the
Parable stops the mouths of those murmurers that repined, as expecting more
from him then it was his pleasure to give, with the sole consideration of its
being his will to have it so. Friend, I do thee no wrong. Take what is Matthew.
20. v. 10, 13, 14, 15.
thine, I will give to this last even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to
do what I will with mine own?

Fifthly, The consequents of the forementioned denials, are, 1. Permission of
sin, particularly of unbelief. John 10. 46. Ye believe not, because ye are not
of my sheep. 2. Obduration in sin. Romans 9. 18. He has mercy on whom he will
have mercy, and whom he will, he hardens. 3. Condemnation for sin, Revel. 20.
15. Whosoever was not found written in the book of life, was cast into the lake
of fire. This last is that which by Divines is usually styled Positive
Reprobation, and is clearly distinguishable from the Negative, in that the one
is an act of punitive justice respecting sin committed and continued in. But
the other an absolute decree of Gods most free and Sovereign Will, without
respect to any disposition in the creature. I call them consequents, not
effects; because, though Negative Reprobation be antecedent to them all, it is
not the proper cause of them. This difference between the decrees Aquinas long
since took notice of. Election (says he) Thom. part. 1. quaest. 23. Artic. 3.
ad ^um.
is a proper cause both of that glory which the Elect look for hereafter, and
of that grace, which here they enjoy. Whereas Reprobation is not the cause of
the present sins of the non-elect, though it be of Gods forsaking them; but
their sin proceeds from the parties themselves so passed by and forsaken. But I
am under a promise of brevity, and therefore shall add no more but only advise
the English Reader, who is desirous of further information in these deep
points, to procure and peruse that excellent piece of the profound Doctor
Davenant printed at Cambridge, Ann. 1641. under this Title, Animadversions
written by the right Reverend John Bishop of Salisbury upon a Treatise
entitled, Gods love to mankind: where he will not only meet with the
doctrine of Predestination modestly handled, but also with ample satisfaction
to most of those wicked cavils which flesh and blood have been wont to suggest
against it.

. 4. Having thus finished that preamble, which the daring Heterodoxie of some
modern writers put me upon a necessity of, I proceed to the making good of two
Assertions, tending to clear the former part of our present Aphorism, viz.
That the Goodness of God is abundantly manifested in his Decree of our
Election; and his Greatness no less in that of Preterition. In order to a
demonstration of the former, I desire to have it considered, how free, how
peculiar, how ancient, how leading, how lasting a favor Election is.

First, A free favor. It is therefore called Election of Grace; and spoken of
Roman. 11. 5.
as tending to the praise of the glory of free grace. The Lambs book of life
Ephesians. 1. 6.
(so named, because the Lamb Jesus stands there enrolled in the head of it, as
the head of all the Elect, and the Captain of that salvation whereunto they are
chosen) is a book of love. Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,
Man. 12. 18.
in whom my soul is well pleased. It was so said of Christ, and may be applied
to all the Elect in their measure. Hence Paul styles his Thessalonians,
Brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God had chosen 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13.
them to salvation: and God expresses the Election of Jacob, by Jacob have I
loved, to show that free love on Gods part is the fountain of this favor. We
love persons or things, because they are lovely. God loves them first, after
makes them lovely, then loves them more for being so. The cause of our love is
in the objects; of Gods, in himself: we are predestined aster the Ephesians. 1.
11.
counsel of his own will, not after the good inclinations of ours.

Secondly, A peculiar favor. Rarity much enhaunceth a benefit. Immunities and
privileges are therefore (...). Plato. Privilegium gaudet paucitate
much valued and stood upon, because they are not common to many, and are
therefore more rejoiced in, because but few partake of them. There were but
eight persons saved from the Deluge of waters in Noah's time, who is accordingly
said to have fround grace in Genesis 6. 8.
the eyes of the Lord, in that he and his were preserved when all the world
beside perished. And in regard the Deluge of fire that came upon Sodom and
Gomorrah swept away all the other inhabitants, but Lot only, and his nearest
relations were exempted from it: God is said to have magnified his mercy toward
them, as Lot acknowledged, saying, Behold thy servant has found Genesis 19. 19.
grace in thy sight, and thou have magnified thy mercy which thou have showed
unto me. We should all have perished in the Deluge of fiery indignation, had
not God elected some few whom he has not appointed to wrath, but to obtain
salvation by 1 Thessalonians. 5. 9.
our Lord Jesus Christ. They are but few, as Scripture tells us again and again,
Many are called, but few chosen. Mat 20. 16. and 22. 14.
The goodness of God is therefore to be more acknowledged in so peculiar a
favor.

. 5. 3ly. An ancient favor. Old things, if evil, are so much the worse for
that; Old leaven is to be purged out, and the 1 Cor. 5. 7. Ephesians. 4. 21.
old man to be put off. But every good thing is commended by its antiquity. One
said well that Old wood is best to burn, old friends best to trust, and old Sir
Fr. Bacon.
books best to read. What price do Scholars put upon an ancient Manuscript?
Doubtless the oldest of all Manuscripts, is the book of life: and the writing
of our names therein the firstborn of all Gods favors. If God so value the
first fruits of our services, as he does; how careful should we be to magnify
the first fruits of his goodness? If old charters be of so great esteem as they
are in the world, how great an estimate should we set upon the most ancient
Magna Charta of our Election, having this seal, The Lord knows who are his. 2 Timothy 2. 19.


Fourthly, A leading favor. Those are the most valuable blessings that have
influence upon sundry others, which they draw infallibly after them. Such is
Election. Paul makes it the first linck of his golden chain, and shows how
introductive it is of all the rest. whom God did predestinate, them he also
called; and whom he called, them he also Romans 8. 30.
justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified. Here is a chain
which God Quatuor annuli sunt unius catenae, qua e coelo demissa Pater in
coelum trahit electos. Primus est Pr^destinatio ad vitam in Christo. Secundus,
Vocatio efficax ad Christum; Tertius, Justificatio per Christum; Quartus,
Glorificatio cum Christo. Zanch. Tom. 7. col. 177.
lets down from heaven that by it he may draw up his Elect thither. The first
linck of it is Predestination, taken in a restrained sense for the Election of
grace. The next Effectual Vocation; into this the former has a causal
influence according to what the Lord once said by his Prophet Jeremy, chap. 31.
3. I have loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore with loving kindenes,
have I drawn thee. Election having once pitched upon a man, it will find him
out, and call him home, where ever he be. Zacheus out of cursed Jericho;
Abraham out of idolotrous Ur of the Chaldeans; Nicodemus and Paul out of the
College of the Pharisees, Christ's sworn enemies; Dionysius and Damaris, out of
superstitious Athens. In what dunghill soever Gods jewels be hid, Election will
both find them out there, and fetch them out from thence. The third linck is
Justification; the dependence thereof upon Election may be gathered from that
passage in the same chapter to the Romans, Who shall lay Romans 8. 33.
any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that justifies. As also from
the vision in Zechary, where Joshuah the high priest representing the people,
appeared clothed with filthy garments in sign of guilt by them contracted,
Zechar. 3. 34.
till God had commanded, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. Ib. v.
5.
Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee. Whereupon there was a
fair Miter put upon his head, and he clothed with change of garments, in
reference to their change of condition from guilt to free justification; the
spring whereof is hinted to in that speech, The Lord said unto Satan, The Lord
rebuke Ib. v. 2.
thee, O Satan, even the Lord that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee. The
Fourth and last is Glorification, That takes in both the beginnings of glory in
sanctification (of which Paul in his second to the Corinthians the third
chapter and last verse, We all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory
of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by
the Spirit of the Lord: and of which he tells us elsewhere, that all the
graces of which it consists proceed from this prime grace of Election, (saying,
God has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Christ, according Ephesians. 1.
3. 4.
as he has chosen us in him) and the consummation of glory in heaven; the
foundation whereof is by our Savior clearly laid in the Fathers giving us to
him by Election at first, This, says he, is the Fathers will which has sent
me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise
John 6. 39.
it up again at the last day. So true is that of a Modern writer, Election
depends Caetera pendent ab Electione, Electio a Deo. Heins. Hom. in Job. 17. 9.
p. 46.
upon God alone, all other blessings upon Election.

Fifthly, A standing favor. The favors of men may be suddenly changed into
frowns; as those of King Ahashuerus toward Hamon were: who but he over night
in the Kings esteem? next day he will not endure the sight of him. But God's
are immutable. All the blessings of the Covenant of grace are sure mercies,
according to that by the Prophet Isaiah, I will make an everlasting covenant
with Jsai 55. 3.
you, even the sure mercies of David; Election in a special manner. Our Apostle
accordingly intimates in one place, that the purpose of God according Romans 9.
11.
to election must stand: and affirms in another, that this foundation of God
stands 2 Timothy 2. 19.
sure, having this seal, The Lord knows who are his. In which few words, we
have no fewer then three grounds of its stability; a Foundation, a Seal, and a
Science. Election is the Foundation of God; a firm Foundation that stands sure.
With us things founded upon a rock, have great stability; the rock of ages, as
he is called, even God himself, his good pleasure and counsel Isal. 26. 4.
is that upon which our Election is founded. With us, writings once sealed
receive a confirmation thereby, and become unrepealable. God has set his seal
to this Decree. With us, knowledge or science is of things certain and
unalterable, not as opinion, which being of things only probable may be
changed; The seal here is, The Lord knows who are his. No wonder then if the
Lord be for ever found to make good that which he said by his Apostle, God has
not cast away his people whom he foreknew. If having named Election in the
foregoing verse, he presently subjoyns, The gifts and calling of God are
without repentance. Romans 11. 2. Romans 11. 29.


EXERCITATION 3. Exerc. 3.

An Introduction to Romans 9. Most part of that chapter expounded, together
with sundry passages in chapter 10, and 11. for proof of these two conclusions.
1. That Paul in Romans 9. does upon occasion propound and prosecute the doctrine
of Predestination. 2. That he derives the Decree of preterition from the
Sovereign greatness of God. A Consectary showing how useful the said doctrine
is to sober minds.

. 1. FOr a full proof of our second Assertion, That the greatness of God is
abundantly manifested by his decree of Preterition, we must of necessity have
recourse to the ninth chapter of Paul's Epistle to the Romans, as unto the
proper seat of that argument; although diverse from abroad, and some at home by
foreign interpretations, forced Glosses and strained Paraphrases, have
endeavored to carry the sense quite another way; against the poison of whose
endeavors our people may perhaps stand in need of an Antidote.

It shall be my care, by Divine assistance, (which is always needful,
especially in the debating of such mysteries) to present them with one: and in
as calm a way as may be, without provoking, however without reproching such as
are contrary minded, to demonstrate these two Conclusions, viz. That Paul in
the ninth to the Romans does upon occasion propound, and prosecute the doctrine
of Predestination. And that he plainly derives the Decree of Preterition from
the Sovereign greatness of God. But before we enter upon so great a depth
(which I do with fear and trembling) let it be observed that our Apostle from
the end of the eight, to the beginning of his twelfth chapter, continues a
profound complicate discourse wholly about the main concernments of his
countrymen the Jews; and that the best help we have for enlightening certain
clauses in the ninth, ought to be fe^ched from passages in the tenth and
eleventh Chapters: the neglect whereof, I verily think, has occasioned the
miscarriages of so many in their interpretations of that Scripture. I shall
hope to improve the Observation to good purpose.

. 2. Concerning the former of our Conclusions, there will be no need of going
far to seek the occasion of Paul's falling upon this Doctrine. He had carefully
and continually preached faith in Christ, as the only way of salvation, in
opposition to all others. This, however embraced by diverse Gentiles, could by
no means find entertainment with the Jews. Be pleased to compare Chapter 9.
31, 32, 33. Israel which followed after the Law of righteousness, has not
obtained to the Law of righteousness. Wherefore? because they sought it not by
faith, but as it were by the works of the law: for they stumbled at that
stumbling stone. As it is written, Behold I lay in S^on a stumbling-stone, and
rock of offense: and whosoever believes on him, shall not be ashamed, with
Chapter tenth, verse 2, 3, 4. I bear them record that they have a zeal of God,
but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of Gods righteousness,
and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submited
themselves to the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the law for
righteousness to every one that believes. This their stumbling at Christ, as
they generally did, caused a great stumble in the thoughts of considering men,
who could not but stand amazed to see, that whereas God had set up but one
only way to be laid hold upon, for the attainment of blessedness, his own
only people in the eye of the world, should almost universally decline that,
and venture their souls upon another. Yet this they did, even they who are here
so magnificently described, Chapter 9. verse 4, 5. Who were Israelites; to whom
pertained the Adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of
the law, and the service of God, and the promises: Whose were the fathers, and
of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for
evermore, Amen. Hereupon some were apt to cry out, All is undone, The word of
God it self has taken no effect. The Promise to Abraham is fallen to the
ground. All Sermons and other Ordinances have been but a sso much rain upon
rocks that glides off and leaves no impression. Our Apostle to recover them out
of these dumps, leads them by degrees into the knowledge of Divine
Predestination, as the root of all this: giving them first to understand, that
all who bore the name of Israelites, and enjoyed the Ordinances, were not
indeed such children of God, as belonged to the Election of grace, and
therefore did not close with Christ in the use of them* as some few did, upon
whom the word of grace weas effectual, and in whom (as few as they were) Gods
promise to Abraham was preserved. As for those unto whom his Gospel was hid,
they were as he elsewhere tells the Corinthians, a sort of lost men and women. 2
Cor. 4. (...).
For this see Chapter 9. verse 6, 7, 8. Not as though the word of God has
taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel. Neither
because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children. But in Isaac shall
thy seed be called. That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these
are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted for
the seed. Where the Elect people of God (who only are accounted the spiritual
seed, and who only in the conclusion will concur to constitute Christ
Mystical) are styled children of the Promise, perhaps in reference to that
grace and Promise of eternal life, given to them in Christ Jesus before the
world began, to which I have spoken before in this Aphorism, Exercitation the
first, Paragraph the third: however in allusion to the birth of Isaac, who was
produced above the power of nature, by virtue of a promise declaring Gods will
and pleasure to have it so; for the Elect in the respective hours of their
conversion, are all of them born again John 1. 13.
not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God
Who of his James 1. 18.
own will begets them with the word of truth, that they should be a kind of
firstfruits of his creatures.

. 3. Having thus given a more obscure intimation of some few elect ones
complying with the Gospel, although most part of the Jews were recusants as to
that interest; he goes on to profess it more openly in the beginning of the
eleventh chapter, God has not cast away his people which ^e foreknew verse the
second, the infallible meaning whereof may be gathered from that in Peter,
Elect according to the 1 Pet. 1. 2.
foreknowledge of God the Father. And more plainly yet in verse the seventh and
eighth of the same chapter, The Election has obtained, and the rest were
blinded; According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber,
eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear unto this
day. But to return to our ninth chapter. Who can advisedly read that passage
in his discourse about Jacob and Esau, That the purpose of God according to
Election might stand, and consult the circumstances of of it (viz. the
childrens not yet being born, nor having done good or evil; as also a choice no
way founded upon him that wills, or upon him that runs, but upon God alone
who shows mercy) and not reflect upon that election by me described in the
first Exercitation under this Aphorism. 2.? Add hereunto those Apostolical
distributions of men into those on whom the Lord will have mercy, and those
whom he will harden in verse the eighteenth, that is in other terms, Elect and
Reprobate. Also into vessels of mercy, and vessels of wrath verses 22, 23. What
if God willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with
much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction. And that he
might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had
before prepared unto glory? Where I desire to have it punctually observed that
the vessels of wrath are only said to be fitted to destruction, without naming
by whom, God, Satan, or themselves; whereas on the other side God himself
Electio non est caus^ tantum salutis, sed and o^nium little quae causae rationem
habent ad salute^. R^probatio v^ro neque damnationis, ^eque pe^^ati quod
meretur dann ationem est prop^ie causa sed antecedens tantum. Ames. medu^. l.
1. c. 25. these. 40.
is expressly said to have prepared his chosen vessels of mercy unto glory.
Which was purposely done (as I humbly conceive) to intimate a remarkable
difference between election and preterition; in that Election is a proper cause
not only of salvation it self, but of all the graces which have any causal
tendency thereunto; and therefore God is said to prepare his elect to glory:
Whereas negative reprobation is no proper cause, either of damnation it self,
or of the sin that brings it, but an antecedent only; wherefore the
Non-elect are indeed said to be fitted to that destruction which their sins in
the conclusion bring upon them, but not by God. I call it a remarkable
difference, because where it is once rightly apprehended and truly believed, it
suffices to stop the mouth of one of those greatest calumnies and odiums which
are usually cast upon our doctrine of predestination, viz. that God made sundry
of his creatures on purpose to damn them: a thing which the rhetoric of our
adversaries is wont to blow up to the highest pitch of aggravation. But is as
soon blown away by such as can tell them in the words of the Excellent Dr
Davenant, B. Daven. Ani^adve^s. on Gods l^ve to mankind. page 89.
It is true that the elect are severally created to the end and intent that
they may be glorified together with their head Christ Jesus: But for the
Nonelect we cannot truly say that they are created to the end they may be
tormented with the Devil and his Angels. For we may then say, God makes such a
thing for such an end, when he gives the thing a nature and qualities fitted
for such an end. (e. gr. that he made the sun to enlighten the world, because
he filled it with lightsomeness.) Now no man is created by God with a nature
and quality fitting him to damnation. Yea neither in the state of his
innocence, nor in the state of the fall and his corruption does he receive any
thing from God which is a proper and fit means of bringing him to his
damnation. And therefore damnation is not the end of any man's creation.

. 4. We have seen our Apostle propounding the doctrine of predestination in
this his discourse; see how he prosecutes the same more ways then one.

I. By producing certain instances. The persons he instanceth in, if not as
solemn examples, yet, as types and figures are at least, of election Isaac and
Jacob; of reprobation, Ismael and Esau. It is the grand privilege of Gods
elect to have his covenant established with them in special manner. The
Messiah, says the Angel in Daniel, was cut off, Dan. 9. 26, 27.
but not for himself; And he shall confirm the Covenant with many. The word is
Larabbim with those excellent ones, by whom Piscator understands the elect,
those Many whom God's righteous servant is said to justify, Isaiah 53. 11.
where we meet with the same word. If so, who more fit to figure out them then
our father Isaac? concerning whom the Lord said to Abraham, I will establish
Genesis 17. 19.
my Covenant with him for an everlasting Covenant, and with his seed after him.
Again, the style of all those who are written in heaven, that is, of the Elect,
is Hebr. 12. 23.
the general Assembly, and Church of the (...) stborn. If so, who more fit to
typifie them then Jacob, a man of all others most famous for procuring a
primogeniture in an extraordinary way? As for reprobation, the objects whereof
are castaways, well might Ismael stand for a figure of them, because of him
Sarah said unto her husband, Cast out Genesis 21. 10, 12.
this bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir
with my son, even with Isaac. And her word was ratified by God himself, saying
to Abraham, In all that Sarah has said unto thee, hearken unto her voice, for
in Isaac shall thy ^eed be called. As also Esau, who here falls under two sad
characters; One of Gods hatred, then which nothing more dreadful, Jacob have I
loved, but Esau have I hated, verse 13. the other of servitude, verse 12. The
elder shall serve the younger. Concerning which, Mr Ainsworth has these words,
Servitude came in with a curse and figureth reprobation, Ainsworth on Genesis 25.
23.
Genesis 9. 25. John 8. 34, 35. Gal. 4. 30, 31. Therefore from hence the Prophet
teaches that God loved Jacob, and hated Esau, and the Apostle gathers the
doctrine of election and reprobation, Romans 9. 10, 11, 12, 13. So he.

. 5. The main exception, which our adversaries hitherto have been wont to take
at this and the like expositions, arises thus. Jacob and Esau are considerable
in a double capacity, the one Personal, as they were this and that individual
member of mankind; the other Patriarchal, as they were heads of several
Nations, Jacob of the Israelites, Esau of the Edomites or Idumeans. They
suppose we cannot safely apply the oracle delivered to Rebecca unto their
persons, seeing Malachy long since expounded it of their posterity in these
words, Was not Esau Jacobs brother? says Malach. 1. 2. 3.
the Lord? yet I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his
heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness etc.

My conceptions concerning this matter (which as I would not impose upon any,
far be such presumption from me, so I would have no Reader contemn, till he
have considered them) are as follows. According to their double capacity, the
answer of God to Rebecca about them seems to have had a double aspect: One to
their posterity regarding temporal things especially, of which Malachy
speaks, another to their persons eying chiefly their spiritual concernments;
and of that Paul treats in Romans 9. as the context imports. Nor can this be
wondered at by such as consider how usual it has been with God, as to
discover himself by degrees (witness that in Deuteronomy, The Lord came from
Sinai, Deuteronomy. 33. 2.
and rose up from Seir unto them, he shined forth from mount Paran) so to
reserve more spiritual discoveries for Gospeltimes.

. 6. Whereas it is further objected that the Elders serving the Younger was
never verified in the person of Esau, who did never servilely submit to Jacob;
I answer. 1. He that should go about to prove that negative, would find an
hard task; but suppose it proved, yet in point of right Esau as having sold his
birthright became servant to him that bought it. For in this respect it is
said to Cain the elder brother concerning Abel, Unto thee shall Genesis 4. 7.
be his desire, and thou shall rule over him. 2. In point of fact, time was
when Esau became a very humble suppliant to Jacob for a mess of pottage. Feed
me* I pray thee, with that same red pottage, for Genesis 25. 30.
I am faint. Now The borrower, says Solomon, is a servant to the lender. How
Prove. 22. 7.
much more he that craves to him that gives? Besides if the word serve be
taken in a large sense, Esau served Jacob wel-nigh all his life long, and
brought him much nearer to God by vexing him. Non obsequendo, sed persequendo,
as one says, not by obeying, but by opposing. Which put me in mind of that
story in Bromiardus concerning an apprentice that had served an hard master, by
whom he had been often sore beaten. These blows the Lord had made a means of
the man's conversion; whereupon, lying upon his death*bed, and his master
standing by, catched fast hold on his hands and kissed them, saying, Hae manus
perduxerunt me ad paradisum, These hands have helped to bring me to heaven. 3.
The Patriarchal capacity does not exclude, but comprehend the Personal; for
Jacob and his Israeli^es, Esau and his Edomites make a Nation. In which
respect, when David put garrisons in Edom; 2 S^m. (...). 14.
throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's
servants; Esau himself in his offspring might not unfitly be said to have
served Jacob in his. Lastly, If no more can be had then this bare
acknowledgement that our exposition must be confined to their posterity, even
that will go nigh to serve our turn, and to suit with the Apostles scope, if it
be considered, how exceeding fit the Israelites were to typify election, of
whom God said, Thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God, and the Deuteronomy. 14.
2.
Lord has chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the
nations that are on the earth. The Edomites to figure out reprobates, seeing of
them it is said by the Prophet, They shall call them Malac* 1. 4.
the border of wickedness, and the people against whom the Lord has indignation
for ever.

. 7. 11. By resolving certain queries. The first whereof is that in verse 14.
What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. Had the
doctrine of predestination which Paul taught been the same with that of our
modern Remonstrants, viz. God's electing upon foresight of men's being in Christ
by faith, and reprobating upon foresight of their final unbelief and
impenitencie, there would then have been no occasion for the quere; for reason
how corrupt soever would soon have closed with the equity of such decrees to
render par pari, like to like. It is God's awarding paribus imparia unlike
destinies to men of like conditions considered in the same lump, and doing this
arbitrarily, according to the good pleasure and counsel of his own will, that
sets it on crying out of iniquity in Gods proceedings. But what does Paul
answer? He abhors the thoughts of such a thing. God forbid, it is as if he
had said, far be it from every one that pretends to a rational being, much more
then every Christian to entertain the least thought of a possibility of
injustice in any decree of God, whose will is the supreme rule of
righteousness. The judgments of God (as Austin has said truly of them) can
neither be fully Dei judicia nemo plene comprechendit, nemo just reprehendit.
August, de Civi^. D^i. lib. (...). cap. 2^. Isaaci Junii Antapologia in
paraenes. ad Remonstrant^s. page ^1, and 2* Freti axiomatib^s rationis obliqu^
and distort^e. -- Revocatis omn^^ Dei consilia sub humanam incudem etc.
comprehended, nor justly reprehended of any. Let me desire such as are so very
apt to be cavilling at them, to swallow and digest by a serious consideration,
those admonitions and reproofs which a late Belgic Contra-remonstrant has
handed to their fellows. Calceati Deum aditis etc. You draw near (says he)
with shoes on your feet to him that dwells in an unaccessible light, and
presuming upon certain Axioms of crooked and distorted reason, pass sentence
upon the decrees of God. -- we blame you in this regard especially, for
intruding your selves into things which ye have not seen, and giving answers
about the secrets of heaven with so much confidence, as if ye sat at Gods
counsel-table. You examine his counsels by the rules of humane proceedings; and
if any thing concur that suits not with your preconceived opinions about
free will expunge it quite out of the number of Gods designs as unworthy of him.

Yea, Our Apostle not content with a bare expression of abhorrency, goes on to
free the decrees of God from all iniquity, each by it self. Election, because
it is an act of mear bounty and free grace, in performing whereof God cannot
possibly be unjust, as being under no law, but at absolute liberty to dispose
of his free undeserved favors according to the good pleasure and counsel of
his own will, to which purpose that is cited out of Exodus 15. For he says to
Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion
upon whom I will have compassion and that inferred v. 16. So then it, that is
the the purpose of God according to election, of which before v. 11. is not of
him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy. As
for reprobation rightly stated, no iniquity will be found therein, if the grand
laws of the universe be duly heeded, which is that all creatures be subservient
to their makers glory according to the proverb. The Lord has P^ov. 16. 4.
made all things for himself, yea even the wicked for the day of evil: Seeing
the end of reprobating any is mainly this, that God may thereby be exalted, as
Paul tel's us here v. 17. in the instance of Pharaoh. For the Scripture says
unto Pharaoh, even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might
show my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the
earth.

. 8. The nex Querie is that in v. 19. Thou will say then unto me, Why does ^e
yet find ^ault? for who has resisted his will? He had said concerning God in
the words immediately foregoing, He has mercy on whom he will have mercy, and
whom he will he hardens. Corrupt nature catching at the latter clause, is
ready to impute unto God himself, (as injustice before, so from hence) rigor
and cruelty, for that notwithstanding his own willing in a sense the
hard-heartednesse of Reprobates, he yet finds fault with them for it. yea, and
damns them in the conclusion, although his will be irresistible. The substance
of this cavil, namely what influence the Will and Providence of God has into
men's induration, and how guilty themselves are of it, shall hereafter be made
to appear (if the Lord will) in explication of the following Aphorism.
Meanwhile, it is carefully to be observed how Se. Paul, as provoked by the
malapartness of men, who though conscious to themselves of their own hardening
themselves, will be laying the blame upon God, strikes in with his Apostolical
authority, and gives them this severe check, Nay, but O man, who art thou that
reply against God? Qui ex adverso respon^as Deo, as it is well rendered by
Beza in reference to the continual and manifold bublings up of carnal reason
against divine dispensations N^lo a me quaera^, etc. Audiat hon^o, ne pereat

and decrees, that which our English Proverb calls chopping Logic with god. A
vice which our very being men should suffice to wean us from. So as the word, O
man here seems to carry an emphasis in it, which Austin long ago observed in
sundry passages of one and the same set of his Sermons. Ask me not an account
(says he) of Divine dispensations, why things are carried so and so, toward
this and that person. I am a man of whom thou ask; thou that inquire art a
man. Let us both attentd to the man that said, O man! Who art thou that
reply against God? Let man hear, lest man perish, for whose sake God himself
became man. And again: mind it well who he is against whom thou reply, and
who thou thy self art that reply against him. He is God, thou art but a man.
And yet again most fully. Thou ask a reason of this and that, I will tremble
at the depth; thou arguest, let me wonder. Do thou dispute, I resolve to
believe. I see the depth, but the bottom I cannot reach.

. 9. His third way of prosecution is, by alleging certain testimonies out of
Moses and the Prophets. I shall only fix upon one, namely that in Romans 9.
27. Esaias also cries concerning Israel; Though the number of the children of
Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved. Who so list, may
see this and the following verses expounded to our purpose by the learned
Ludovic. de Dieu of Gods, Decrees, yea which (is more) Paul himself
interpreting the remnant of Gods Elect in Romans 11. 2, 3, 4, 5. where the
conclusion is, Even so then at this present time also, there is a remnant
according to the Election of grace.

And now, Reader, judge I pray thee between us; and tell me after all this,
that has been produced, whether a vehement agitatour in these points, had J.
G. Exposit. of Romans 9. in his epistle to the Reader. (...). 3.
any just cause to say as one did, That to him who shall narrowly and
attentively weigh and consider the tenor, and process of the Apostles
discourse, Romans 9. from verse 6. to the end, it will be found as clear as the
light at noon day, that there is nec vola nec vestigium, neither print nor
footstep, neither little nor much of any such thing, as either Election or
Reprobation in it. Meaning (as he there expresses himself) a peremptory
Election and Reprobation from eternity of a determinate number of men, under a
mere personal consideration.

. 10. As for the proof of our second Assertion, those words in verse 20. 21,
22. Shall the thing formed, say to him that formed it, Why have thou made me
thus? Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one
vessel unto houour, and another unto dishonor? What if God willing to show his
wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the
vessels of wrath fitted to destruction? clearly hold forth to my apprehension
the Sovereign greatness and power of God, as the fountain of Negative
Reprobation; and contain a direct allusion to that in Isaiah, 45. 9. Woe unto
him that striveth with his maker. Let the potsheard strive with the potsheards
of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What mak^st thou?
or thy work, He has no hands? Now if the Prophet and Apostle, or rather the
Holy Ghost by them, do rightly infer the silence and submission of the clay
from its relation to the Potter; much more may the quiet submission of
Non-Elect persons to the disposing will of God, be from hence concluded; (as
Lessius demonstrates) seeing mankind has much more dependence See L^ssius de
perfection. divinis l. 10. c. 3.. 19.
upon the Sovereign Lord of all, then a Potter can challenge over any vessel
whatsoever: and this notwithstanding they are not yet fully convinced of the
reason of all Gods proceedings with them. Such as still expect that, and
therefore fly in the face of God for want of satisfaction in this and that
particular, must give me leave to send them to the Morals of Gregory Semetipsum
homo considerans tacet, and divina judicia discutere metuit, qui esse se
pulverem agnoscit. -- Rationem de occul^o Dei consilio quaerere, nihil est
aliud quam contra e^us consilium superbire. Cum ergo factorum causa non
depr^henditur, restat ut sub factis illius cum humilitate taccatur: quia
nequaquam sufficit sensus carnis, ut secreta penetret majestatis. Qui in factis
'Dei rationem non videt, infirmitatem suam considerans, cur non videat,
rationem videt. Gregor. Exposi^. moral. in Job. 9. cap. 8.
for the learning of better manners. Man (says he) considering himself, holds
his peace, and he that acknowledges himself but dust, is afraid to discuss the
judgments of God. For him to seek a reason of Gods secret Decrees, is nothing
else but to rise up proudly against the counsel of his Will. Wherefore when the
cause of any fact of his is not discerned, it calls for our silence and
humility; for the sense of flesh suffices not to pierce into the secrets of
Majesty. So as he that sees not a reason of that or that Divine dispensation,
by considering his own infirmity, sees a clear reason why he sees it not.

. 11. But, say Gregory what he can, yea and Paul himself what he will, the
fault is not like to be mended so long as carnal minds have to do with these
points. We are all by nature Enemies in our minds, as our Apostle Coloss. 1.
21.
tells the Colossians: yea, the carnal mind, or the wisdom of the flesh (as he
speaks to the Romans) is enmity against Roman. 8. 7.
God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be: whence it
is that one or other of the great Masters of Reason (as they would be
accounted) although they be not unwilling to yield an independent Sovereignty
and Arbitrary working to some men, as in the Eastern parts of the world most do
to their absolute Monarchs as at this day, and the Roman Senate did of old to
Augustus Caesar, witness Dion (...). Dion Cass. Roman. hist. lib. 53. p. 516. in
ant. edit. Graec. Lat.
Cassius in his history; The Senate, says he, freed him from all the necessity
of law, so as he might do or not do what he list, as having both himself and
the law at his disposal: yet out of their deep enmity and malignity against
God, deny him the like prerogative, and will therefore be always found opposing
his Decrees, and those most, that are most Arbitrary. This has been the root
of that notorious piece of opposition in laboring that the decrees of God
should be wholly silenced, and either not studied, or if studied, not disputed,
or if disputed, not preached of. Some such there were in Austins time, against
whom he bends his discourse in the 14, 15, and 16. Chapters of his book, De
Bono Perseverantiae. And some there are at this day that rank the points of
Predestination among Fruitless and Sapless Speculations.

Holy Bucer was of a far different judgment. He in one of his first Lectures
S^^h^^jus Electionis memoria and meditatio nobis auferretur, Bone Deus! quomode
resisteremus Diabole. Quoties enim Diabolus tentat fidem nostram, (nunquam
autem non tentat) tunc sempe^ ad Electionem est nobis recurreadum.
at Cambridge upon the epistle to the Ephesians, after published by Tremellius.
Si hujus electionis etc. If the memory and meditation of Gods election were
taken from us, good Lord, how should we resist the Devil! For so often as Satan
tempts my faith, which he is ever tempting of, then do I always betake my self
to free election etc. A little after he asserts the doctrine of election as a
principle ground not of solid comfort only, but of solid piety, and of true
love to God; in which regards he would by^ all means have it preached in coetu
fidelium, in the open congregation. Verily this famous University is likely to
continue famous, so long as it continues orthodox. We may expect to share in
the Apostles benediction, and hope that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit will be with us, so long as we
teach, to the praise of the glory of free grace, the love of God in electing
freely what persons he will; the grace of Christ in dying freely, and with a
special intention for those whom the Father had elected; and the communication
of the Spirit in freely converting and finally preserving those whom the father
had so chosen, and the Son so died for. Sure I am our blessed Savior once said
to his Disciples, In this Luke 10. 20.
rejoice that your names are written in heaven; and that nothing does more
inflame a Christians love then a firm belief of his personal election from
eternity, after he has been able to evidence the writing of his name in
heaven, by the experience he has had of an heavenly calling, and an heavenly
conversation. When the Spirit of God (whose proper work it is to assure, as it
was the Fathers to elect, and the Sons to redeem) has written the law of life
in a Christians heart, and therewith enabled him to know assuredly that his
name is written in the book of life; he cannot then but melt with flames of
holy affection, according to that most emphatical speech of Bernard, Amat ille
non immerito, qui amat^^ est sine merito. Amat sine ^ine, qui sine principio se
cognoscit amatum. Bern. epist. 107.
God deserves love from such as he has loved long before they could deserve
it. And his love to God will be without end, who knows that Gods love to him
was without any beginning. I confess indeed that the book of life, like the
tree of life in paradise, has a tree of knowledge growing hard by which cannot
with safety be tasted of. There are some nice and needless questions started
about it that might be spared, and should be forborne. But these high walls and
sons of Anak should by no means prevail with us to play the unworthy spies, and
bring up a bad report, or give way to any brought up by others upon a land that
flows with so much milk and honey as the doctrine of predestination does.
Surely for men to silence it, were to stop up those wels, which the Prophets
and Apostles, especially Paul, Exerc. 4.
have dug in their writings for the refreshing of thirsty souls; yea to
endeavor the cancelling of that first and great charter of our salvation.

. 1. THe word Creation has diverse acceptions. It is taken either largely, for
the production of any thing remarkably good or evil; so magistrates in a
Commonwealth, and Graduates in an Universitie are said to be created, God is
said to create a clean Psalm. 51. 52. Eph^^ 2. 20.

and for evil, Moses in Numbers speaking of the remarkable judgment inflicted
on Kora^ and his accomplices uses this expression, Si creationem creaverit Deus,
if God created a creature: the radix is (...) Or limitedly, with some
restraint; and that either strictly, for the generation of living creatures in
a natural way, so in Horace, Fortes creantur ^ortibus and bonis, and in Virgil,
Sulmone creatos quatuor h^c juvenes. Whence also, procreare, or more strictly,
for the making of a thing out of some praeexistent matter, but such as is
naturally indisposed and unapt for that production, whereas in generation there
is always materia habilis and disposita; as when God created man of the dust of
the earth, and woman of man's rib, or most strictly, for the production of a
thing without any praeexistent matter at all out of mere nothing; we are to
speak of it in the two latter senses, for so it belongs to God alone. Thus
Is^. 44. 24.
says the Lord thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the
Lord that makes all things, that stretches sorth the heavens alone, that
spreads abroad the earth by my self. Yea so necessary was the confession of
this truth with the utmost hazard to distinguish God from Idols, that to the
end the Jews, who were then captives in Babylon, might not be wholly to seek
for a profession of their faith, they had this verse in the Hebrew Bible
written then, and so still in Chaldee letters, Thus shall ye say unto them, The
Gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from
the earth, and from under these heavens. Jerem. 10. 11. 'E^ (...). Just. Mart.
de Monarthia Dei. (...). Trismegistus.
Not unsuitable whereunto is that of Pythagoras long since cited by Justin
Martyr, Whosoever would from hence^orth challenge any Diety to himself, must be
able to show such a world as this, and to say in truth, This is of my making.
and that of Trismegist (an heathen too) in one of his books; There are mainly
three to be considered; God, the World, and Man: the world made for man, and
man for God.

. 2. But we have a more sure word of Prophecy, and to that let us take heed:
It will show us, First, How we Christians by faith understand that the Hebr.

late writer conclude his Discourse of Creation with this Epiphonema, Quantum
est quod nescimus! The truth is it is but little that we can learn from
Philosophers, even concerning Creation it self, (the only Article of the Creed
which they speak fully too) unacquainted with Scripture. Which made Maximilian
the first to say, that the Audi^ndi sunt Eth^ici, non ^anquam Philome^e, sed
tanquam Ranae. Apud Voetium ibid. page 680.
Ethnicks were to be heard not as singing Nightingales, but as croaking frogs:
And two great Physicians betake themselves to the study of Scripture for
understanding the secrets of Nature. One Sennertus, who finds much fault with
those who perverted the text of Moses, and interpreted him out of heathen
writers, ausu infelici, (says he) and non tolerando by an unhappy and
intolerable undertaking. The other Vallesius, Huic lectioni consecrari
senectutem. -- statui in his philosophari etc. Vallosius.
who in the Preface to his Sacra Philosophia tells us that whereas he had in
the former part of his life commented upon all Aristotle's Acromasticks, and
many pieces both of Hippocrates and Galen, he was resolved to devote the
remainder of his days to the study of the holy Scriptures, and to seek his
Philosophy out of them for time to come. By faith we understand. A Christian
firmly believes those truths concerning the time and manner of the worlds
creation, because he has Scripture testimony for them. That the worlds were
framed, speaking after the Jewish mode, though there be indeed but one world,
in the plural number; for the Hebrews then were wont to mention a three^old,
viz. an inferior, a middle, and a superior world, as Camero Cameron.
Myrothec. page 288.
tells us. Framed by the word of God, says this place. When Solomon was to
build a magnificent Temple, he needed many workmen, and they many tools. Not so
God, who did all without any coadjutour, any instrument, by the sole word of
his command. By the word of Psa^. 33. 6.
the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his
mouth. Let Psalm. 148. 5.
them prai^e the name of the Lord, for he commanded, and they were created. Art
can work, if Nature first afford it some complete matter: Let an artificer have
a stone, he can make a statue, otherwise not. Nature can work if there be a
principle to work upon, though incomplete; Let there be seed, it can produce a
plant, let there be spawn, a fish. But to work without praeexistent matter, Dr
Jacksons Commentary on the Creed 2d part. chap. 6. 4. page 64.
so as to bring forth the first plant without seed, the first fish without a
spawn, yea the first principles of these and all things else out of nothing, by
his sole word, is proper to God. So that things which are seen (as it follows
here) were not made of things which do appear. That Rule, Ex nihilo nihil fit,
holds in natura constituta, now that God has set nature in a course of working
by secondary causes enabled to produce effects like themselves; but in natura
constituenda: it was otherwise, when God wrought by his word of command, and is
therefore called Elohim by Moses two and thirty times in his history of
creation, as Mercer observes.

The Schoolmen for the most part express that which is here called, Things that
do not appear, by the term Nothing, either simply Nothing, or No such thing, as
it appeared to be at first: yet when they speak of Non-ens, they take not the
word materially, as if mear Nothing were the matter of which any Being were
framed; but Terminatively, as the term from which the Creator moved. For
example, the Angels, they say, and the souls of men, together with the
Essential forms of natural bodies were not then educed ex potentia materiae,
(as they are since in the ordinary course of generation by V^ssii These, p. 12.
particular agents;) but induced in materiam by God himself the universal
cause, and had an immediate Production by the Creator: whereas some other
things, as the Sun and Man's body, had a mediate creation, as being produced ex
non-ente tali from such things as of themselves could not have caused such
effects, but by virtue of Gods creative word. B. Hall contemplat. of creation.
Doctor Hall has given us the true notion of this in a compendious saying of
his, God made something out of nothing, and of that something, all things. So
as if all things be run to their first Original, they will be found to come up
out of the womb of Nothing, from whence nothing but Almightiness could have
fetched them.

. 3. That although the creatures be now subject to vanity, yet the goodness of
God did shine forth in their first production, and is still abundantly
manifested in them. The creature, says Paul, speaking of its present state,
Romans 9. 21.
was made subject to vanity. Whatsoever thing had any being of it self, and was
not for ever, but did receive a being in time, and that from God, is a
creature, says Daneus well: thereby excluding the Divinity of Christ which was
Creatura est res omnis quae neque a sci^sa est neque semper fuit; sed ut
aliquando and a Deo producta est. Daneus Physic. Christ. in p. 59.
from everlasting, as the Angels were not, but produced by God in time; and
sins of all sorts, because though God be someway an actor about, yet he is no
author of them; as also works of art, for which God enables men, but produces
them not. The vanity which all such things are subject to, is partly Negative,
a non-ability to serve man as they did before the fall; after it the Lord said
to Adam, Cursed is the Genesis 3. 17.
ground for thy sake; in sorrow shall thou eat of it all the days of thy life.
Partly Positive; whence that of Solomon, Behold, all is vanity and vexation of
spirit. Eccles. 1. 14.
Yet if any shall hereupon conclude, that it was so from the beginning, Moses
will expressly confute him, by whom we are told, that when God at the very end
of his creation Saw every Genesis 1. 31.
thing that he had made, and behold it was very good; which to me is a
demonstration that the Angels were not then fallen. Yea if any shall deny that
the goodness of God is still visible in them, let that saying of the Psalmist
stop his mouth, The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord. What he
predicates Psalm. 35. 5.
of the earth, I am not afraid to extend to the sea, and to all other parts of
the Universe, They are all at this day full of the goodness of the Lord: the
sea especially, which we Islanders are especially bound to take notice of by
way of rejoicing, and to glorify God for, according to these direct places,
Glorify ye the Lord, even the name of the Isaiah. 24. 15.
Lord God of Israel, in the isles of the sea. And in the Psalms, The Lord
reigns, let the earth rejoice, let the multitude of the Psalm. 97. 1.
isles be glad thereof. Well may the earth rejoice herein, because if the Lord
did not so reign as to set bounds to that (whose natural place is above the
earth, as Psalm 104. informs us) it would all quickly be overflown. Well may
the multitude of the isles be glad thereof: for what are they in regard of the
Ocean that surrounds them, but as so many nutshels in a great vessel of water;
how suddenly drowned, if God did not reign so as to restrain that element?

. 4. But I must not allow my self too much scope, I shall therefore restrain my
future discourse upon this head to the sole creation of man, and show how
goodness appeared in it. It is reported as the speech of Favorinus; Nihil est
in macrocosmo magnum praeter microcosmum.
That in the vast world of creatures, there is nothing truly great except the
little world of man. Surely, next to the knowledge of God, there is nothing of
more concernment to us; and therefore let none wonder at me, who cannot go over
all, for singling out his creation to be insisted upon: concerning which I
intend to show out of certain texts in Genesis, the consultation upon which,
the pattern after which, and the parts of which he was made at first.

For the first, It is the manner of Artificers to deliberate much, and to put
themselves to more then ordinary pains about their Masterpieces. Man was to
be the Masterpiece of this visible world, and accordingly Moses speaking of
God according to the manner of men, brings him in consulting about so prime a
piece. God said, Let us make man: whereas most other Genesis 1. 26.
things were made with a word speaking, Let there be light, and there was Genesis
1. 3, 24.
light. Let the earth bring forth, and it was so. Here the Creator calls as it
were a solemn Council of the sacred persons in Trinity, when he is about to
proceed to the making of man. Which is to be taken notice of, both because
other Scriptures use the plural number where man's creation is spoken of (as in
Eccles. 12. 1. Remember thy creator: according to the Original, Creatours; and
Job. 35. 10. Where is God my maker? Hebrew, Makers: and because it should
restrain us from deriding any man's deformity, for fear of our reproching his
Maker. To which purpose that history is very remarkable. An Emperor Fitz Herb.
of policy and religion. Part. 1. page 54. out of Guil. Malms. l. 2. c. 10.
of Germany came upon a Lordsday morning unattended to a poor country Church,
where, pretending himself a soldier, he was present at Mass, which was said by
the parish Priest, a man so deformed, that he was says mine Author, Poene
portentum naturae, almost a monster in nature. And as the Emperor wondered with
in himself, that God, (whose beauty and Majesty is infinite) would be served by
so deformed a creature, it came to pass that the Priest reading the hundred
Psalm, which was in the course of his Liturgy to be rehearsed upon that day,
pronounced the second verse thereof, Know ye that the Lord he is God, it is he
that has made us and not we our selves, in such a different tone and voice
from that which he before used, that the Emperor apprehended it as a thing
ordained by Almighty God to meet with and answer his present cogitation, and
began to entertain so reverent an opinion of the Priest, that having informed
himself after Mass of his great virtue, he made him Archbishop of Colen, much
against the good man's will: who notwithstanding behaved himself in that great
charge with singular commendation, and left a most sweet savor behind him.

. 5. For the second. The pattern after which man was made, is sometimes called
Image alone. So, God Genesis 1. 27.
created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; sometimes
likeness Genesis 5. 1. Genesis 1. 26. Mos est Hebraeis duo substantiva ita conjungere
ut diuersae res esse videantur, cum tamen alterum adjectivi and epitheti
significationem habeat. Andr. River. in Genesis Exercit. 4.
alone, In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him.
Sometimes both, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: which makes a
wise interpreter think that when they are joined, it is by Hendiadys, and that
the Holy Ghost means an Image most like his own, ad imaginem and
similitudinem suam, that is, ad quam simillimam sui imaginem. It is exceeding
much for man's honor, that he is an Epitomie of the world, an abridgement of
other creatures, partaking with the stones in being, with the stars in motion,
with the plants in growing, with beasts in sense, and with Angels in science.
But his being made after Gods Image is far more. As great men are wont, they
often erect a stately building, then cause their own picture to be hung up in
it that spectatours may know who was the chief Founder of it: so when God had
created the Fabric of this world, the last thing he did was the setting up his
own Picture in it, creating man after his own image. Now there is a threefold
sense of this phrase: for the image of God is taken, first, in a large sense,
and so it is appliable unto all men in regard of the substance of their souls,
which are invisible, incorporeal. and intelligent, as God is. Whosoever sheddeth
man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed, for in the image of God made he
man. And Genesis 9. 6.
again in James, Therewith curse we men James 3, 9.
which are made after the similitude of God. We read of the Emperor
Theodosius, that having exacted a new tribute from the people of Antioch, there
arose See Theodor. hist. lib. 5. c. 21.
a commotion, in which the people broke down the Statue of the Empress Placilla
his late wife. He in a rage sent his Forces against the city to sack it. One
Macedonius a Monk interceded thus. If the Emperor be so much, and so justly
offended that the image of his wife was so defaced, shall not the king of
heaven (said the Monk) be angry at him if he shall deliberately deface and
break the image of God in so many men as are like to perish in this Massacre.
What a vast difference is there betwixt reasonable creatures, and that brazen
image? we for that image are easily able to set up one hundred, but the
Emperor with all his power is not able to restore so much as an hair of these
men, if once he kill them. upon which admonition Theodosius, it is said,
forbore his design. Secondly, in a strict sense. So it is appliable only to
Christ, who is the image of the invisible God; the brightness Colos. 1. 15.
of his glory, and express image of his Heb. 1. 3.
person. For all the three things that go to make a perfect image, viz.
Likeness, Derivation, and Agreement in nature are concurrent here. The kings
image is in his coin, and in his son, but after a different manner. In his coin
there may be likeness and derivation, but not identity of Nature, which is also
added in his son. In Saints there are the former; they are like to God in their
qualities derived from him; but in Christ all three. Thirdly in a middle sense,
neither so largely as to extend to all men, nor so strictly as to be restrained
unto Christ alone, but between both. So taken, it is nothing else but that
conformity to God from which all men fell in the first Adam, and unto which
none but Saints are restored by the second.

. 6. For the third, The parts of which man consists, are body and soul; Moses
at first speaks to both, The Genesis (...). 7.
Lord God (says he) formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into
his nostrils the breath of life: and man became a living soul. God had before
made Spirits by themselves, and bodies by themselves, some celestial, others
terrestrial; now on the sixth day for a conclusion of his works, he frames a
creature consisting of a spirit and a body joined together, in whom he includes
the choice perfections of all the former. One observes that God Weemse
Portracture. p. 41.
has joined all things in the world by certain Media. The earth and water are
coupled by slime; the air and water by vapors; Exhalations are a middle
between air and fire; Quick silver a middle between water and metals; coral
between roots and stones, so man between beasts and Angels. Manilius has
comprehended much in Manil. lib. 4. apud Lip^. Physiolog. l. 3. dissert. 2.
few verses, -- Quid mirum noscere mundum
Si possint homines, quibus est and mundus in ipsis,
Exemplumque Dei quisque est in imagine parva?
In English thus, -- What wonder if men know the world
Since they themselves the world epitomize,
Yea every one a medal of God is?
Where he does in effect call his body (...) a little world, and his soul (...)
a little God. In the pursuance Charron of wisdom page 16.
of the former, the Stoics were wont to say, That it was better being a fool
in an humane shape, then being wise in the form of a beast. Yea Solomon himself
in the twelfth of Ecclesiastes finds in his head both Sun, Moon, and Stars.
Well therefore may his head resemble the heavens where these lights are (as our
eyes also are in our upper parts) without which the world would be a dungeon;
his heart the fire, it being kept hot by continual motion, and conveying
natural heat to the whole body; his blood and other humors the water; his
spirits the air; and his flesh and bones the earth. In prosecution of the
latter, Tully a Platonist Scito te Deum esse etc. Lib. de somn. Scip.
goes so far as to bid a man take notice that he is a God, and some Divines
Bonaventurae Amatorium. page 601. col. 2.
find a resemblance of the Trinity in man's soul. The understanding, will and
conscience, three faculties, but one soul; as Father, Son, and holy Ghost,
three persons but one God: Let us all mean while, taste and see how good the
Lord is in preparing us such bodies, and infusing such souls into us: but
withal so as to consider and improve the Original of both.

. 7. Seeing Adams body had its original from the dust of the earth, the
consideration hereof should be an antidote against pride in all his posterity.
Art not thou the son of Adam? was not he the son of dust? was not that the son
of nothing? when the Lord would humble Adam after the fall he put him in mind
of his being dust. In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat Genesis 3 19. Genesis 18.
27.
thy bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken:
for dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou return. And when Abraham would be
low before God, he styleth himself dust and ashes, Behold now I have taken upon
me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes. Ecclus 10. 9.
Why art thou proud O dust and ashes? says Siracides, and Bernard, Cum sis
humi limus, cur non es humilimus? Why art not thou most humble, O man, seeing
thou art but the dust of the earth. As for the soul, that was purely from God,
Divinae particula aurae as an ancient Poet calls it, for God says Moses,
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
This should render us restless till that Image after which Adam was made be
renewed in us by regeneration. The relics of it found in men unconverted what
are they but magni nominis umbra, the mere shadow of a great and glorious name.
How unlike are natural men to God for all them? Our Queen Elizabeth once in her
progress observing some pictures of hers hung up for signs to be very unlike
her, caused them to be taken down and burnt. Burning must be the end of those
that continue unlike to God; whereas such as are by converting grace changed
into the same 2 Cor. 3. 18.
image (as Paul speaks) from glory to glory shall at length arrive at that
perfection of glory, which is also the image of God, as David has it, As for
me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake
with thy likeness.

EXERCITATION 5. Exerc. 5.
The same and other attributes of God declared from his providentiall

be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also has set the one
over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him. It
is most clear from hence, that there is an intermixture of dispensations,
adverse and prosperous, in the course of divine Providence, and that we may see
much of God therein. It will appear in six particulars.

There are times. I. Wherein things go very ill with a man in reference to his
private affairs, yet well with the public, which keeps him from sinking into
despondency. Mephibosheth was cheated by Ziba of half his lands; yet Let him
take all, said he, 2 Samuel 19. 29, 30.
for as much as my Lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house. The
woman of Sparta, whom we read of And. Camerar. cent. 3. page 174.
in Plutarch, being told that all her five sons were slain in the battle, but
withal that the enemies were worsted, and her countrymen victours, uttered
this Heroic speech. Lugeant ergo miserae; Ego victrice patria beatam me esse
judico. Let such as are miserable lament; I cannot but account my self happy
now that my country has had the better.

II. Wherein a man's personal comforts are multiplied, but the Churches misery
damps his mirth. Nehemiah was much in favor at the king of Persia's Court, yet
his countenance could not but be sad when he heard that the city Nehem. 2. 3.
the place of his fathers sepulchers lay waste, and the gates thereof were
consumed with fire. We read of Terentius an orthodox captain under Valens an
Arrian Emperor, who having done some eminent Theodoret. lib. 4. cap. 2. 8.
service was willed by the Emperor, who intended him a just recompense, to ask
of him what he would. He preferred a petition in behalf of the orthodox
Christians, that they might have a Church allowed them by themselves to worship
God in. Valens displeased, tore the petition and threw it away. He gathered up
the scattered pieces, and professed that seeing he could not be heard in the
cause of Christ, he would make no suit for his own advantage. That of Esaias,
Rejoice ye with Isa. 66. 10, 11.
Jerusalem etc. that ye may suck and be satisfied, is both preceptive and
argumentative. Jerusalem is compared to a nursing mother, believers to her
sucking children; If the Nurse be in health, the Child has cause to rejoice
in that, and shall fare the better for it: If she be distempered, the child
will go near to suck the disease from her.

. 2. III. Wherein long prosperity follows after much adversity, as in Joseph's
case. He had been envyed, sold, imprisoned; His feet were hurt in Psalm. 105. 18.

ring, arrayeth him in vestures of fine linen, puts a gold chain about his
neck, makes him ride in the second chariot he had, caused the people to cry
before him. Bow the knee, and appointed him Ruler over all the land of Egypt,
in which height of honor he lived and died.

IV. Wherein adversity treads upon the heels of long prosperity, as in Jobs
case. The candle of God had long shined upon his head, and the secret of God
been upon his tabernacle. His children then were about him, he had washed his
steps with butter, and the rock poured him out rivers of oil. His Verse. 3, 4,
5, 6, 19, 20.
root was spread by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon his branch. His
glory was fresh in him, and his bow renowned in his hand, which are his own
expressions Job 29. But ere long, his servants are slain with the edge of the
sword, his castle taken away by the enemy, all his children killed at once
with the fall of an house in which they were feasting, he himself afflicted
in body, vexed in spirit, grieved by his comforters, in a word brought from
the throne to the dunghill, so as to give just occasion to the proverb, As poor
as Job.

Fifthly, Wherein crosses and comforts take it by turns, so as a man goes out
of one into another, in a succession of vicissitudes. Thus it fared with
Ezechiah. After his coming to the Crown for diverse years the Lord was with
him, and he prospered whithersoever he went forth. But in the fourteenth year
of his reign, the tide of prosperity begins to turn. Sennacharib comes up
against him with a most formidable host, and took his fenced cities. He betakes
himself to prayer, and the Lord delivers him by a miracle, sending an Angel to
destroy one hundred eighty five thousand of his enemies in Chap. 20. 1. etc
a night. But the next news we hear, is that Ezechiah was sick unto death; yet
he dies not, but had fifteen years added to his life, and was assured by a sign
from heaven of his recovery. Yet presently after all this he receives a sad
message from thence concerning the loss of all his treasure, and the woeful
condition of all his posterity. See what a strange succession is here; after
glorious victories, comes the loss of his fenced cities, and an alarm given to
Jerusalem it self. After that a miraculous deliverance, then a mortal sickness,
then a cheering sign, but e're long a Message of very sad concernment.

. 3. VI. Wherein pleasure and sorrow, joy and grief are so interwoven one with
another, as a man may seem happy and miserable both at once. Jacob is at once
scared with hearing of Esau's four hundred men, and cheered with the sight of
an host of Angels sent to gaurd him. He does at once receive an hurt in the
hollow of his thigh, and a blessing from the Angel that wrestled with him.
David at once is hated by Saul, and loved by Jonathan. Ahashuerus at once
enjoys the glory of an absolute Monarch, and is slighted by his own wife.
Haman at once swims in an ocean of Courtdelights, and is tormented for the want
of Mordechai's knee. As one the one side, Out of the strong comes sweetness;
(...) Pet. 4. 14.
when the spirit of glory and of God rest upon a suffering Saint, because he is
a Saint and a sufferer: so on the other, Even in laughter the heart is
sorrowful. Prove. 14. 13.


-- Medio de font leporum Lucret. l. 4.

Surgit amari aliquid, quod in ipsis floribus angat.
That is, Some bitter thing from midst of sweetness breeds;
And that which vexes from the flowers proceeds.


. 4. This God does for diverse good ends and purposes. As first to manifest his
wisdom in compounding passages of Providence, so as one shall qualify
another: prosperity allay the sowreness of adversity; and this assuage the
swellings of that. As the painters skill appears in tempering bright colors,
and dark shadows; the cooks in mingling sweet and tart ingredients; the
musicians in raising harmony out of discords; Orators in making up curious
Librat in Antithetis.
sentences by a fit opposition of contrarieties.

II. To magnify his goodness. The frame of our spirits is such, that if
prosperity were continued without interruption, we should be apt to swell and
presume; if adversity without intermission, to sinck and despair. Our weakness
such, that we should never give a due estimate to blessings, were we not
sometimes taught by experience what it is to be under pressures. We learn by
sickness to prize health, and by restraint to value liberty. A calm is much
more pleasing to us after a tempest; and the shining forth of the Sun after an
elipse. It is therefore an act of much mercy in God thus to intermingle favors
and crosses, lest by a constant course of the former, we should grow wanton and
effeminate, or by continuance of the latter, sottish and stupid.

III. To keep up and maintain his respect in the world. God will be known to be
the Sovereign Lord of all persons and things; the great disposer of all affairs
in such a way as seems best to himfelf, and therefore gives out blessings and
crosses interchangeably, so as man shall be at no certainty what to expect, but
live in a constant dependence on him, who keeps the disposal of prosperity and
adversity in his own hands, to the end that man should find nothing certain
but this, that there is a great uncertainty of future events. Wherefore,

. 5. First, take notice from hence what we are to look for in our pilgrimage
here. viz. vicissitudes and changes from one condition into another. If Solomon
had no where said, There is a time to weep, and a time to laugh, experience
Eccles. 3. 4.
would soon have forced us to acknowledge that our whole course is chequered
with prosperity and adversity; that most of a Christians drink in this life is
Oxymel, most of his food, Bitter-sweets. Whilst Israel marched throughout the
wilderness, the blackest night had a pillar of fire, and brightest day a pillar
of cloud: so in this world, things never go so well with the Israel of God, but
that they groan under some affliction; never so ill, but that they have some
comfort afforded them.

Secondly, Learn to maintain in our selves a mixture of affections suitable to
this mixture of Divine dispensations. Rejoice with trembling. Leaven and Honey
were both excluded under the Psalm. 2. 11. Levit. 2. 11.
Law from offering by fire: Leaven for its excessive soureness; Honey for its
excessive sweetness; To show (says Ainsworth) that in Saints there should
neither be extremity of grief, nor of pleasure, but a mediocrity. We should be
careful in time of prosperity to fear affliction with a fear of expectation,
though not of amazement; with such a fear as may cause preparation, but no
discouragement. Look at a very fair day, as that which may prove a
weather-breeder, and usher in storms. On the other side, in time of adversity
hope for refreshment. The Psalmist did so, Psalm. 42. 7. 8. Nemo considat nimium
secundis; Nemo desperet meliora lapsus. Sen. Trag.
All thy waves are gone over me, yet the Lord will command his loving-kindeness.

Thirdly, Observe the difference that is between this present, and that other
world. Dying Aristotle is reported to have said, I rejoice that I am now going
out of a world of contraries. This indeed is so. But that which dying men go
into is without such mixture. All tears shall be wiped from the Saints eyes;
and impenitent sinners shall have judgment without mercy. Briefly, in this
militant Church, as in the Ark of old, There is a rod, and a pot of manna Here
upon earth we have little Manna without some rods, little welfare without some
sharp affliction; few Rods without some Manna, not many afflictions without
some measure of consolation: whereas in Heaven there is nothing but Manna, in
Hell nothing but Rods, or Scorpions rather.

. 6. IV. Keep we our selves in a frame of cheerfulness, that we may be always
prepared in the day of prosperity to rejoice. This will appear a duty which we
are bound to,

I. Because God does not only approve and like it. (He loves a cheerful
giver, so a cheerful thanks-giver 2 Cor. 9. 7.
and worshipper. Nehemiah was afraid Nehem. 2. 2.
to be seen sad in the kings presence. Mordechai durst not go into the court
gates with his sackcloth on: dejected Esther. 4. 2.
looks, and the sackcloth of an uncheerfull carriage do ill become the servant
of the king, the followers of the court of heaven:) But also require and
command it, Serve the Lord with gladness. Psalm. 10^. 2.
The Jews of old were commanded to rejoice in their solemn feasts: Deuteronomy. 16.
14. 15.
which were accordingly to be kept in the most cheerful seasons. The Passover
at the first ripening of corn, Pentecost at the first reaping, and the Feast of
Tabernacles at the end of Harvest.

II. Because Jesus Christ was anointed to give us the oil of joy for mourning,
Isa. 61. 3.
and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. He himself indeed was
anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows, but such as are received
into fellowship with him should, and shall, if the fault be not in themselves,
partake with him in some degree of the same unction.

III. Because the Spirit of Christ is a spirit of cheerfulness. His two first
fruits mentioned Galat. 5. 22. are Love and Joy. Yea when it is said, Grieve
not Ephesians. 4. 30. Sanctam hilaritatem admit. Ne quis nimio moerore magnum
illum hospitem ossendat. Heins. in locum.
the holy spirit of God, Heinsius thinks this to be part of the meaning. Be
cheerful after an holy manner. Let none offend that great guest, the spirit of
God by overmuch sadness. And Drusius tells us in the Preface to his
Praeterita of an usual saying among the Hebrews, Spiritum sanctum non residere
super hominem moestum, that the holy Ghost is not wont to reside upon a
sad-spirited man.

IV. Because our adversary the Devil, being a melancholy spirit himself,
delights in our sadness. The prince of darkness loves to see the servants of
God in a dark condition. He is gratified and gets advantage by our
uncheerfulness. Therefore Paul writes to his Corinthians concerning the
incestuous person, that upon his repentance they would comfort him and prevent
his being swallowed up with overmuch sorrow, lest Satan, says he, should get
an advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his devices. 2 Cor. 2. 7, 11.


V. Because if we look to our selves, cheerfulness is advantageous both to our
bodies, therefore compared to the best food, such as men use to have at feasts.
He that is of a merry heart has a Prove. 15. 15.
continual feast. and the best physic too. A merry heart does good like a
medicine: Prove. 17. 22.
but a broken spirit dries the bones. And also our spirits. Uncheerfulness
makes the soul of a man drive heavily, as the chariots of Pharaoh did in the
red sea; but the joy of the Lord oyleth the wheels. Cheerfulness supples the
joints of our hearts, and so rendereth them nimble and active in holy
performances. See Nehemiah 8. 10.

VI. Because if we cast our eyes upon others, the uncheerfulness of professors
often brings a bad report upon the profession; and makes the world ready to
believe that Christians serve a bad master, or have but an hard service of it,
whereas their rejoicing in the ways of the Lord would help to bring others in
love with religion, See Acts 9. 31. and Esther 8. the two last verses.

. 7. Fifthly, Endure afflictions so as in the day of adversity duly to consider
the Nature, Author and Ends of Crosses.

I. The Nature of those afflictions that befall men in Christ. They are not
Inter vincula carnisicis and Chirurgi. Chamier. Panstrat.
from vindicative justice, which is wholly removed from such by the mediation
of him in whom they have believed, and so not formally punishments: but from
fatherly discipline, whereby it comes to pass that although the matter be the
same, there is as much difference between the sufferings of believers, and of
ungodly persons out of Christ, as there is between the cords wherewith an
executioner pinioneth his condemned malefactor, and those wherewith the
indulgent Surgeon binds his patient; the ones design being to kill, the
others to cure. They are crosses indeed which believers undergo, but no curses,
and have no such malignity in them as the world imagines.

II. The Author, Well might Eliphaz Job 5 6.
say, Trouble springs not out of the ground, for it comes from heaven, and
that out of love. As many as I love, Rev. 3. 19.
says Christ, I rebuke and chasten. How bitter soever the cup be, which I am
to drink, and by whomsoever it is handed to me, the comfort is, it was of my
heavenly fathers mixing, who I am sure would not put any poysonfull, although
he do put some displeasing ingredients into it. I will therefore say, Christ
enabling, as Christ himself did; The cup which my father has given me, shall
John 18. 11.
I not drink it?

III. The Ends, Which are specially three. 1. The mortifying of our
corruptions. By this shall the iniquity of Jacob Isa. 27. 9.
be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his sin. All the harm which
the fiery furnace did the young men in Daniel was to burn off their cords; our
lusts are cords, cords of vanity in Scripture Phrase; the fiery trial is sent
on purpose to burn and consume them. Afflictions help to scour off this kind
of rust. Adversity like winter-weather is of use to kill the vermin; which the
the summer of prosperity is wont to breed. 2. For the enlivening and quickening
of our graces. I spoke unto Jerem. 22. 21.
unto thee in thy prosperity and thou said, I will not hear. But elsewhere,
Lord in Isa. 26. 16.
trouble have they visited thee; they poured out a prayer when they chastening
was upon them. These two places compared show how apt prosperity is to make men
Gallio's, adversity to render them Zelots. As bruising makes aromatical spices
to send out their savor; and collision fetches fire out of the flint, which
was hid before; so pressures excite devotion. The cold water of persecution is
often cast in the Churches face to fetch her again when she is in a swoon. 3.
For the furthering of our glory. Christ went from the Cross to Paradise; so do
Christians. He was made perfect through Heb. 2. 10.
sufferings; so are they. It became him to Luke 24. 26.
suffer, and to enter into his glory: It becomes them to tread in their masters
steps. When the founder has cast his bell, he does not presently hang it up in
the steeple, but first try it with his hammer, and beat upon it on every side,
to see if any flaw be in it. Christ does not presently after he has converted
a man, convey him to heaven, but suffers him first to be beaten upon by
manifold temptations, and after advances him to the crown spoken of Jam. 1.
12. Blessed is the man that endures temptations, for when he is tried he shall
receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to them that love him.
this crown the cross makes way for; although no cross can merit it but that of
Christ. Yet as law is said to work wrath occasionally. So Our light afflictions
which are but for a moment work 2 Cor. 1. 17.
for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.

APHORISM VI. Aph. 6.
Providence extends it self, not only to all created beings, and to all humane
affairs, especially those that concern the Church: but even to the sins of
Angels and men.
EXERCITATION 1. Introduction concerning the contents of this Aphorism.
Providence over all created beings. Preservation of men to be ascribed to God
himself, not to good men, yea not to good Angels, in whom heart-searching and
patience wanting. Providence reaching to humane affairs: Oeconomical, Civil,
Military, Moral and Ecclesiastical. Anastasius his design frustrate. Rome and
our nation instanced in. I. G. castigated.
. 1. THis Aporisme requires a clear demonstration of these propositions. 1.
That divine providence extends it self to all created beings. 2. That it
reaches to Exerc. 1.
all humane affairs. 3. That it is especially seen in such affairs as concern
the Church. And 4. That although God be not the author of sin, yet his
providence is an actour in it. Unto these when I shall have added an answer to
objections, and from each proposition an inference, the whole will be
completely handled.

The first proposition, which I am to begin with, is, Divine providence extends
it self to all created Beings. Well may we strike in with the Levites in that
form of acknowledging God, wherein they went before the people, saying, Thou
even thou art Lord alone. Nehem. 9. 6.
Thou have made heaven, the heaven of heavens with all their host, the earth,
and all things that are therein, the seas and all that is therein; and thou
preservest them all. David brings it down a little lower, Thy judgments are
a great deep, O Lord, Psalm. 36. 6.
thou preservest man and beast. Job lower yet, What shall I do unto thee, O
thou preserver Job 7. 20.
of men. As God made all things by the word of his command, He commanded and
they were created, so he upholds them all in being by the word of his Psalm.
148. 5. Heb. 1. 3.
power. Heaven, earth, sea, man and beast, especially man. It is not with God,
as with carpenters and shipwrights, who make houses for other men to dwell in,
vessels for others to sail in, and therefore after they are made look after
them no more; God who made all things for himself, looks to the preservation of
all. It is accordingly said of Christ, All things were created by him and for
him, and by him all Col. 1. 16, 17.
things consist. The creatures are all as vessels, which if unhooped by
withdrawing of Gods manutenency, all the liquor that is in them their several
virtues, yea their several Beings would run out, and they return to their first
nothing. Schoolmen compare God to the sun, creatures to the air. The sun shines
by its own nature, the air only by participation of light from the Sun. So
whatever good the creatures have, is by derivation from Jehovah, the fountain
of Being. Take away the light of the Sun, the air cease to shine, and so it
is here. As things Artificial are preserved in their being by the duration of
such natural things as they consist of v. g. an house by the lasting of stones
and timber: so things natural which depend upon God by the continuance of that
Divine influence by which they were at first made.

. 2. It is not in good men to preserve themselves or others. They derogate from
God exceedingly that ascribe too much in this kind to any man, as some
luxuriant French wits did to Cardinal Richelieu: of whom they said, That God
Almighty might Howels Lustra Ludovici, p. 166.
put the Government of the world into his hands. That France in Gods and the
Cardinals hands was too strong; that what Idem in the proem to ^is h^st^ry of
Lewis 13. fol. 2.
the soul was to the body, the same was he to France. Si foret his nullus,
Gallia nulla foret. Yea one frivilous pamphleter profanely and ridiculously
called him, The fourth person in the Trinity. Yea, not in good Angels
themselves; Who Hebr. 1. 14.
though they be all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who
shall be heirs of salvation? yet are none of them governing spirits, appointed
to provide for mankind the utmost rewards and punishments. They are wanting in
two qualifications which should enable them hereunto; one is the knowledge of
men's hearts where the truth of grace, or venom of sin lies: the other
patience, whereof no Angel has enough to bear with men without destroying them
for their continual provocations. Whereas in God there is a meeting of both
these. See for the former, Jerem. 15. 9, 10. The heart is deceitful above all
things, and desperately wicked, who can know it? I the Lord search the heart; I
try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to
the fruit of his doing: And for the latter, Hosea 11. 9. I will not execute the
fierceness of mine anger: I will not return to destroy Ephraim, for I am God
and not man: we may add and say, God, and not Angel.

. 3. The second proposition follows, viz. That Divine Providence reaches to
all humane affairs: which we may for methods sake subdivide into Oeconomical,
Civil, Military, Moral, and Ecclesiastical. Humane affairs are,

I. Oeconomical, such as do belong to a Family. For example, Riches and
Poverty, Preferment and Debasement, which in Hannah's song are ascribed 1 Samuel
2. 7, 8.
to the sole Providence of God. The Lord (said she) makes poor, and makes
rich: he brings low, and lifts up. He raises up the poor out of the dust,
and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill, etc. yea, to instance in blessings
highly prized by Christian Families, Grace and Peace, which are the things
prayed for by the Apostles in most of their benedictions. We read of Saints in
Cesar's household, Quisquis Cristianum se esse coa. fitetur, is tanquam generis
humani hostis, sine ulteriore sui defensione capite plectatur. Camerar. Orat.
1. cap. 39. p. 135.
Phil. 4. 22. Nero, that monster of men, was Caesar then; he that had published
a bloody law, That whosoever professed himself Christian, should be apprehended
as an enemy to mankind, and put to death without any further defense. Yet even
in his house the Providence of God has so wrought, as to convert and preserve
such men as were men of grace; Saints indeed, not only in his Empire, and
under his Government, but in his Family, and under his Roof. As for Peace, that
of the Rabbis, although it be somewhat a quaint, yet, may be Take ^the first
letter of (...) out of (...) Vir, and (...) out of (...) Foe-mina, there
remains (...) Ignis. M. Ga^akers Sermon. on Eleazars prayer Genesis 24. 12, 13, 14.
p. 8.
an useful observation. Take the first letter (say they) of Gods name, out of
the name of the man, and the last out of the woman's name, and there remains
nothing but fire; implying, that there is like to be nothing but the fire of
contention and strife, jealousy and heart-burnings between man and wife, where
they come not together in Gods name. Whereas if wisdom make the match, as it
does when people marry in the Lord, happy are they who are so met, For her
ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are Prove. 3. 17.
peace.

II. Civil, such as belongs to Kingdoms, Republics, Corporations, or to men
as combined in such Societies. Many are the contrivements of men to work
themselves and others into places of Government: but when all this is done,
that of the Psalmist is most true, Promotion comes neither Psalm. 15. 6, 7.
from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. But God is the judge: he
pulls down one, and sets up another. And that of Daniel, He changes the
times Dan. 2. 21.
and the seasons; he removes kings, and sets up kings. Witness this
history: Anastasius a Grecian Emperor having no Male issue to succeed him, was
desirous to transfer the Throne to one of his three Nephews, whom he had bred
up; and not being able to resolve which of them he should take, put the thing
to lot thus. He caused to be prepared three beds in the Royal-Chamber, and made
his Crown to be hanged within the tester of one of these beds, called the
Realm, being resolved to give it to him, who by lot should place himself under
it. This done, he sent for his Nephews, and Causinus his Holy Court. part. 2.
page 239
after he had Magnificently entertained them, commanded them to repose
themselves, each one choosing one of the beds prepared for them. The eldest
accomodated himself according to his fancy, and hit upon nothing; the second
did the same. He then expected the youngest should go directly to the Crowned
bed; but he prayed the Emperor that he might be permitted to lie with one of
his brothers, and by this means not any of the three took the way of the
Empire, which was so easy to be had, that it was not above a pace distant.
Anastasius, much amazed, well saw God would transfer the Diadem from his race,
as he did afterward to Justine. Who can read and consider such examples without
saying as he did, Ludit in humanis Divina potentia rebus.
That is, Divine power often dares
Desport it self in men's affairs.


Remember Daniels four beasts, and the seven heads of that beast in the
Apocalypse, conceived by interpreters to resemble the seven forms of Government
which Rome was to undergo sucsessively; from a Commonwealth to Kings; from
Kings to Consuls; from Consuls to Dictatours; thence to Decemvirs; thence to
Tribunes of the people; thence to Emperors; thence to Popes. Reflect upon this
Nation of ours, which has been governed at first by Britains, then Saxons,
then Danes, then Normanes: one while in the way of an Heptarchy, another while
of a Monarchy, and now of a Republic; and, if thou can, refuse to cry out,
O the depth!

. 4. III. Military, such as belong to the managing of Wars. It is not for
nothing that God is so often styled, Lord of hosts in the Old Testament. We
find him so called no less then one hundred and thirty times in two of the
Prophets, Esaias and Jeremy. Because in ordering of Martial affairs, he in a
manner does all. Captains, and superior Officers may, and do consult, but God
determines. They throw the dice, he appoints the chance; they set their men as
it pleases them, he in the issue plays the game as it pleases him. Hear David
in that Psalm of his which he made in the day that the Lord delivered him from
the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul, speaking of his own
experiments, and celebrating God as assisting him both in the field, and at
sieges, By thee I have run through a troop, and by my God have I leaped over a
wall: giving him Psalm. 18. 29.
strength, activity, skill. It is God that girdeth me with strength. He makes
my feet like hindes feet. He teaches my hands Verse 32, 33, 34.
to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. Yea, success and
victory. Thou have girded me with strength to the Verse 39. 40.
battle; thou have subdued under me those that rose up against me. Thou have
also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate
me. In the New Testament, we seldom or never meet with that title. That which
comes nearest it is, Lord God Almighty; and this occurs twice in the
Revelation, when mention is made of the victories which it pleases God to give
to the Reformed Churches against Antichrist and his adherents, once in these
words, We give thanks, O Lord Rev. 9. 17.
God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou have taken to
thee thy great power, and have reigned. And again in these, Great and marvelous
and 15, 3.
are thy works, Lord God Almighty, just and true are thy ways, Thou King of
Saints.

IV. Moral, such as belong to good manners. or in more Gospel terms, To living
soberly, righteously, and godly in Tit. (...). 12.
this present world. The two former I well know are pretended to by men
unregenerate, yea, by heathens. Socrates (they say) lived so soberly, as not to
be discomposed by any outward emergency, to show himself always the same man.
Fabritius so righteously, as that it was commonly said of him, To turn the Sun
out of its course would be found more easy, then to turn him from the way of
justice. But for godliness, which is the third, it were hard, if any should
pretend to that without strong impressions from God in Christ, yet the
Pelagians of old did, asserting those virtues which appeared in Moral men, who
had not received Christ Jesus the Lord, nor known what it was to walk in him,
for true graces: for which very fault, as S. Austin tells us, above all others,
the Christian Church August. contr. Julian. Pelag. l 4. ^. 3.
did most detest them: yea, a Christian Minister of late has in print dared to
collect from that saying of Paul, All men have not faith, an implication, J. G.
Preface to the Reader before Red. Redeemed, fol. 6. a fine.
That men who act and quit themselves according to the true principles of that
reason which God has planted in them, cannot but believe, and be partakers in
the precious faith of the Gospel. But we have been taught, and must teach that
it is not in the power of any inferior creature so to improve it is faculties,
as to raise up it self to a superior rank. No tree can make it self a beast,
no beast a man, no man a Saint by the Omnis insidelium vita peccatum est, and
nihil est bonum, sine summo bono. ubi enim deest agnitio aeternae and
incommutabilis voluntatis, falsa virtus est and in optimis moribus. Prosper.
sent. 106.
bare improvement of his reason, whence he comes to be a man. Moral principles
prove to such as rely upon them, and seek no further, Mortal principles. We
believe that of Prosper The whole life of an unbeliever is sin. Neither is
there any thing good, where the chief good is wanting -- but false virtue in
the midst of the best manners.

V. Ecclesiastical, such as belong to the Church, and the legitimate members of
it. In that Song of Loves, Psalm. 45. 9. Upon thy right hand did stand the Queen
in gold of Ophir, is meant the Church. Look as an indulgent Prince, besides the
common affection he bears, and protection he gives to all his subjects, has a
peculiar respect to, and converse with his Princess: so there is a peculiar
providence of God toward his Church; the handling whereof at large I refer to
the next Exercitation.

EXERCITATION 2. Exerc. 2.
Deuteron. 11. 12. opened. Gods care over the Church proved from the provision
he makes for inferior creatures. From Isreal's conduct. From the experiments
and acknowledgements of saints in all ages. Experiments of the Virgin Mary,
Rochellers, Musculus, acknowledgements of Jacob, David, Psalmist, Austin and
Ursin. From Gods causing things and acts of all sorts to cooperate unto the
good of the saints. Isaiah 27. 2, 3. explained. The Church preserved from, in,
and by dangers.
. 1. OUr third proposition is, That divine Providence is seen more especially
in such affairs as concern the Church, and the members thereof. In order to the
clearing whereof, I intend to insist upon two places of Scripture. The first is
that in Deuteronomy, 11. 12. Where Moses describing the land of Canaan, says
of it thus, A land which the Lord thy God cares for: The (...). LXX. hic.
eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year,
even unto the end of the year. That land was then the only habitation of Gods
Church, and besides, a lively type of the Catholic Church which was afterward
to be spread over the whole face of the earth, whence it is that believers in
all places were styled inward Jews, and the Circumcision. Romans 2. end. Philip.
3. 3.


This continual care of God over his Church and the members thereof appears,

I. From the provision made by him for inferior creatures. So our Savior
argues. Behold the fowls of the air: for they Matthew. 6. 26.
sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly father
feeds them. Are ye not much better then they? They have no caterers to bring
in provision from them; no barns to fetch provision out of; yet want it not,
but go cheerfully on, chirping continually, because God feeds them: and that
sometimes in a way little less then miraculous, if that be true which is
reported by some good writers, namely, that when the young ravens are forsaken
of their dams and left bare, out B. Andrews pattern of Catechistical doctrine
page 60.
of their own dung there arises a worm which creeps to their mouths, and
becomes nourishment to them.

. 2. II. From the conduct of Israel after the flesh in former times. A breviate
of that Nations story will presently let us understand how they were brought
into that land, (whereof this place in Deuteronomy speaks) and cared for
there by a thousand providence. Time was when Joseph was raised up to be a
nursing father to them, and that by a most remarkable dispensation. He had been
formerly sold into Egypt, was imprisoned without cause, cast as Junius
thinks, into that prison whereunto such were put as had most highly offended
the king, to be sure into one where his feet were burt Psalm. 105. 17, 18.
in the stocks, and he laid in irons. Had not his prisonhouse been so bad it
is like he should not have had opportunity to make himself known to butler and
baker of Pharaoh, who were his fellow prisoners. The butler being restored to
his place according to Joseph's interpretation of his dream, forgets to acquaint
Pharaoh with him till all other means had been used to quiet the kings mind,
and none found effectual: then he speaks, and then is Joseph speedily
advanced. Being so he becomes a preserver of the Church in his father,
brethren and their families. Afterward when there was risen another generation
that knew not Joseph; and the king of Egypt had set himself by force and art to
extinguish Israel, the bush, although burning was not consumed in the midst of
the fire: their burdens were increased, yet their persons multiplied; and Moses
ere-long raised up to deliver them out of their bondage. A man preserved by the
daughter of that Pharaoh, whom he was called to destroy, and by that means
brought up at court, yea instructed there both in the Art and Government, and
in all the learning of the Egyptians. Under his conduct God did for them (as
one Prophet speaks) terrible things which they looked not for. Pulls them out
of Pharaohs bosom in spite Isa. 64. 3.
of his heart, at their departure sends them laden away with the jewels and
treasures of Egypt; makes a passage for them through the sea, and accompanies
their hosts into the wilderness. There providence fetches them water out of a
rock, then which nothing drier; and bread from heaven, which is wont to grow
out of the earth. There their food is Manna and Quails; a cloud and pillar of
fire their guides, when this servant of God was dead, up steps Joshua in his
room, brings them into and settleth them in the promised land; which proved
to them after their settlemement by lot, an habitation of righteousness and
mountain of holiness. A land flowing not only with temporal, but also with
spiritual milk and honey, after Solomon had erected a magnificent Temple for
them, which was the wardrobe of those ceremonies wherewith God was then to be
served. Then were they (as the Psalmist has it) abundantly satisfied with the
fatness of Gods house, and made to drink of the river of his pleasures.

But their sins having at length cast them out of that good land, and
occasioned the burning of their Temple, God left them not destitute of his
help, but ordained for them sundry refreshments in the time of their captivity.
This among others in Esthers time. King Ahasuerus under whom they then were in
a state of captivity had his sleep taken from him, would spend the time not in
this or that exercise but in reading; of all books, calls for that of the
Chronicles; of all places has that read to him which concerned a good service
done by Mordechai a Jew; does not only take notice of it, but enquire what
reward had been given him; understanding he had received none causes Haman his
favorite to be called; puts him upon doing singular honor in the view of
all men to this Mordechai, gives his wife Queen Esther occasion of impleading
this Haman, discovering his plot against all the Jews, and preventing that
massacre of them, which should speedily have been executed. Yea providence went
on to work so happily in the hearts of those Monarchs, who then held them
captives, as not long after to proclaim their deliverance, and liberty for them
to rebuild both Jerusalem and the Temple; which they also attempted.

Whilst the second Temple was building by Herod, not so magnificent as the
former, yet in some respect more glorious: if Josephus misinform us Nunquam
interdiu ne interrumperetur aedificatio pluisse. Joseph. Antio. Judaic. lib.
15. cap. 14.
not, for the space of almost ten years it never rained all that while in the
day time, the providence of God so ordering it, lest the work should be
interrupted. Yea so remarkable was the power and greatness of God in assisting
the builders then, that we find him in Haggai and Zechary, their Prophesies,
which were both written about that time, frequently styled by that name, The
Lord of hosts, particularly five times in four verses of Haggai. Thus says the
Lord of hosts, yet once Hagg. 2, 6, 7, 8, 9.
it is a little while, and I will strike the heavens, and the earth, and the
sea, and the dry land; And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all
nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, says the Lord of
hosts. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the Lord of hosts. The
glory of this latter house shall be greater then of the former, says the Lord
of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, says the Lord of hosts. That
which raised the glory of this second above that of the first Temple was the
personal presence of Jesus Christ in it. His coming, preaching, suffering, so
ripened the sins of this people (who began again to degenerate after their
return) as hot weather does the corn, that ere long they and their Temple
became a prey to the Roman Eagle.

. 3. III. From the experiments and acknowledgements of godly persons in several
ages. The Blessed virgin Mary after her journey to Bethlehem, and lying in of
her child there, may be probably thought to have been straightened in her means,
as being but poor, and not to have sufficient for the maintenance of her
child, her self and Joseph in the journey they were to take presently after
into Egypt. See Chemnit. harmon.
how God provideth; hard before that, he sends the wise men from the east,
and they bring costly presents with them, gold among others, which was
certainly of no small use for defraying their ensuing charges. In the year 1573
when the Protestants were besieged in Rochel by the French kings forces, God
Collection of French massacres p. 288.
sent them in daily with the tide an infinite number of small fishes: such as
before that time were never seen within that haven, and presently upon the end
of the siege retired again. We read of Wolfangus Musculus, a late Germane
Divine, that having received by Luthers books, the light and sense of the
Gospel, he forsook his Monastery and married: that after this he was so poor,
as to let his wife go out to service, and betake himself to work with a weaver,
who proved an Anabaptist. That during his abode there, he solaced himself with
this distich, Est Deus in coelo, qui providus omnia curat:
Credentes nusquam deseruisse potest. Melch. Adam. in vit. Theol. Germ. p. 373.

That is, There is a God in heaven, who such as cleave
TO his providence on earth, can never leave.


That the Anabaptist within a while turned him off, and he being then to seek
for maintenance, was hired to work at Strasborough about the town ditch, which
was then to be new cast and enlarged, and to have begun the next morning. That
Bucer having notice hereof, and of his parts, prevailed over night with the
Consul to give him a call to the work of the Ministry, which he gladly embraced.

Suitable to these and the like experiments are the following acknowledgements.
Jacob, I am not worthy of the Ge^. 32. 10.
least of all thy mereies, and of all the truth which thou have showed unto thy
servant: for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two
bands. David, Thou have been my help, leave me not, neither Psalm. 27. 9, 10.
forsake me, O God of my salvation. When my father and my mother forsake me,
then the Lord will take me up. Another Psalmist, Psalm, 71. 5, 6, 7. Thou art
my hope, O Lord God: thou art my trust from my youth. By thee have I been
holden up from the womb. Thou art he that took me out of my mothers womb: my
praise shall be continually of thee. I am a wonder unto many; but thou art my
strong refuge. Sic gressus meos considerans, etc. veluti si totius creaturae
oblitus, tantum me solum consideres. August. solilo^. c. 14.
Austin again and again to this purpose. The Lord has so looked after me, as
if he had in a manner forgot the whole creation, to consider me and my ways. He
so cares for every Saint, as if he cared for none besides; Deus ita curat
unumquemque nostrum tanquam solum curaret; and ita universos ut singulo. Id.
confess. l. 3. c. 11.
so for all, as if he had but one to care for. And Piscator in Ursins life
reports, that he, to wit, Zacharius Ursinus was wont to say, I had often lain
in the streets, had not the Providence of God been mine hostess, and afforded
me a lodging. Nisi hospita fuisset divina providentia.

. 4. IV. From the effects of care ascribed to God, when Scripture speaks of him
after the manner of men. For example, we men are by our cares made sollicitous
and thoughtfull about the person or the thing cared for. So the Psalmist says
of God, I Psalm. 40. ult.
am poor and needy, and the Lord thinks upon me. Thou art my help and my
deliverer, make no tarrying, O my God. We are rendered inquisitive what to do
for them. So the Scripture brings in God, saying, How shall I do for the
daughter Jerem. 9. 7.
of my people? O Ephraim, What shall I do Hosea 6. 4.
unto thee. We are grieved if they miscarry. Of God it is said, His soul was
Judges 10. 16.
grieved for the misery of Israel. We are not content till we have taken a
particular survey of whatever concerns them. So of God it is said, That he
Matt. 10. 30.
numbreth their hairs, bottleth their tears; Psalm. 56. 8.
has a book of life for their names, Luke 10. 20. Psalm. 139. 16.
a book of providence for their members, and a book of remembrance for Mal. 3.
16.
their discourses. Lastly, as men endeavor the good of such as they receive
into their special care, and do what they can to make things operate to that
end; so we know (says S. Paul) that all things work together for good to them
that love God; to them who are the called according Romans 8. 28.
to his purpose. Make me this assertion good, and the abundance of his care
will be presently visible to any man. Now this may be done by showing how God
makes use of things, and of acts of all sorts to this end.

. 5. I. Of all sorts of things, whether Natural, or Artificial, Necessary, or
Contingent, Real, or Imaginary. The reflection of the Sunbeams upon water is a
natural thing; If Providence orders so, as the Moabites taking 2 Kings 3. 22,
23, 24.
it for blood, conjecture a mutiny in the armies of the king of Israel and
Judah, come up disorderly, and perish. So this deceptio visus in them, wrought
for the Churches deliverance. Those Trumpets, Pitchers and Lamps in the seventh
of Judges were things artificial, no way able of themselves to produce such an
effect, as the defeat of an huge host: yet the Lord so disposes of the sound
of the Trumpets, breaking of the Pitchers, and burning of the Lamps, as by them
to strike a terror into the great army of Midian, and make them fly. That the
fire should burn, and the sea keep it is channel according to the order of
nature, were necessary things: yet did providence so overruled in the case of
those three Worthies in Daniel, that the fire, though it burnt up their
accusers, should not so much as scortch them; and semblably in the Israelites
case, that the sea, though it swallowed up the Egyptians, their enemies, should
afford a safe passage to the Hebrews. What more contingent then that Pharoah's
daughter should go with her maids to wash in the river at that very place where
Moses was exposed? that seeing an infant, she should imagine it an Hebrew, be
moved into pity toward it, adopt it for her own son, and light upon the
childs own Mother to be it is nurse? yet upon this did Isreal's redemption much
depend. There were such real alterations in the heavens, that the stars are
said to have fought against Sisera in their Judges 5. 20. 2 Kings 7. 6, 7, etc.
orders. Elsewhere an imaginary noise was so apprehended by the Syrians, as to
make them fly, and leave their tents, whereupon followed great plenty after a
famine.

II. Acts of all sorts, whether voluntary, or involuntary, gracious or sinful.
Augustus his taxing the Roman Empire, and requiring every one to repair to his
own city, was a voluntary act on his part to enrich himself: but ordered by
Providence to further ends: for hereby the virgin Mary comes to Bethleem, and
Christ was there born in the place so long before prophesied of. Austin was
once out in his Sermon much against his will; but providence disposed it to the
conversion of a soul. The story is this. That holy man fell one day in the
pulpit upon a large discourse against the Manichees, contrary to his purpose
and intention when he came thither. At his return home spoke of it, asked
Possidonius and others whether they did not observe it. Credo quod aliquem
errantem in populo Dominus per nostram oblivionem curari voluit. Possidonius in
vita August.
Their answer was, they did, and wondered. Whereupon he said, God I believe
has made use of my oblivion and error to cure some one or other of the
people. Some two days after one Firmus a merchant comes to him, and falling
down at his feet with tears, confesses he had been nursed up for many years
together in the heresy of the Manichees, but was that day by his Sermon
rightly informed, truly converted, and made a Catholic: which Austin and
others then hearing, glorified and Profundum consilium Dei admirantes ac
stupentes glorificaverunt ejus nomen, qui eum voluerit, and unde veluerit, and
quom^do voluerit, per scientes, and per nescicntes an marum operatur salutem.
Idem. Ibid.
admired the profound counsel of God in converting souls when he will, and by
whom he will, whether the Preacher know of it or not. How gracious acts, such
as Obadiah's hiding and feeding the Prophets, Ebed-melech's helping Jeremy in
and out of prison, are subservient to Providence in procuring the Churches
good, is easy to discern. It is so even in sinful acts themselves. Such was
the Philistines invading the land of Palestina, yet there was a time when their
doing it was so disposed of, as to be a means of preserving David and his men.
Saul was then ready to seize upon his prey, but was diverted by this news,
coming in that very nick of time. Saul went on this side the mountain, and
David and his men on that side of the mountain: 1 Samuel 23. 26, 27, 28.
and David made have to get away for fear of Saul, for Saul and his men
compassed David and his men round about to take them. But there came a
messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come, for the Philistines have
invaded the land: wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, etc.

. 6. The second Text I have made choice of to insist upon, is in the Prophecy
of Esaias, Chapter 27. verse 2, 3. In that day sing ye unto her; A vineyard of
red wine. I the Lord do keep it, I will water it every moment: lest any hurt
it, I will keep it night and day. The Prophet had said before of this vineyard,
that God looking it should bring forth grapes, it brought forth wild grapes.
But it being Esal. 5. 2.
since purged, here he calls it a vineyard of red wine, that is of the best,
according to that in Solomon's Proverbs, Look not thou upon the wine when it is
red, Prove. 23. 31.
when it gives his color in the cup, when it moves it self aright. So as we
are here by it to understand a reformed Church. Such at this day are the
Protestant Churches come out of Popery: For we may distinguish a fourfold face
of the Christian visible Church spoken of by Divines. The first fair, in the
Apostles time, she was then a virgin undefiled: the second Spotted, in the
succeeding age of Fathers and Heretics, wherein traditions began to prevail,
she was then a Wanton: the third Deformed, when Popery overspread all; she was
then an Whore: the fourth Reformed, since Luthers time: she is now a Matrone,
and may exspect, so far as it shall be for her good, and her keepers glory,
that continual irrigation, and constant custody, which is here spoken of. Such
as wish and project (as some have done the total and final ruin of the visible
Church) must effect it in a time that neither belongs to day nor night: for the
Lord has here promised to keep it, lest any hurt it, yea, to keep it night and
day.

There is a threefold preservation, which it, and the members of it may look
for from Divine Providence. One from, another in, and a third by dangers.
First, from dangers, according to the promise in one of the Psalms, Because
thou have made the Lord which is Psalm. 91. 9, 10.
my refuge, even the most high, thy habitation: There shall no evil befall
thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. Austin had appointed to
go to a certain town to visit the Christians Agnoscunt omnes miram Dei
providentiam, cui ut liberatori gratias merito egerunt. Possidonius in vita
August. cap. 12.
there, and to give them a Sermon or more. The day and place were known to his
enemies, who set armed men to lie in wait for him by the way which he was to
pass, and kill him. As God would have it, the guide whom the people had sent
with him to prevent his going out of the right way mistook, and led him into a
by-path, yet brought him at length to his journeys end. Which when the people
understood, as also the adversaries disappointment, they adored the Providence
of God, and gave him thanks for that great deliverance.

II. In dangers. So in Job 5. 19, 20. He shall deliver thee in six troubles,
yea in seven, there shall no evil touch thee. In famine he shall redeem thee
from death; and in war from the power of the sword. In time of famine the
widow of Sarepta's store was made to hold out. The Providence of God was with
Daniel in the lions den, shutting up the mouths of those furious beasts; and
with the men in the fiery furnace, giving a prohibition to the fire that it
should not burn, when they were in the jaws of danger, yea of death. The Church
has always been a Lilly among thorns, yet flourishes still. This bush is yet
far from a consumption, although it have seldom or never been out of the fire.

III. By danger. there is a preservation from greater evils by less. No poison,
but providence knows how to make an antidote; so Jonah was swallowed by a
whale, and by that danger kept alive. Joseph thrown into a pit, and afterward
sold into Egypt, and by these hazards brought to be a nursing father to the
Church. Chrysostom excellently, Fides in periculis secura est, in securitate
Homil. 26. operis imperf. in Matt.
periclitatur. Faith is endangered by security, but secure in the midst of
danger, as Esthers was, when she said, If I perish, I perish. God preserves
us, not as we do fruits that are to last but for a year, in sugar; but as flesh
for a long voyage in salt, we must expect in this life much brine and pickle,
because our heavenly father preserves us as those whom he resolves to keep
for ever, in and by dangers themselves. Paul's thorn in the flesh which had much
of danger and trouble in it was given him on purpose to prevent pride, which
was a greater evil. Lest I, said he, should be exalted above measure through
abundance of the revelations, there was given 2 Cor. 12. 7.
me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be
exalted above measure. Elsewhere, having commemorated Alexander the
copper-smith 2 Timothy 4. 14, 15, 17, 18.
his withstanding and doing him much evil, yea Nero's opening his mouth as a
lion against him, and the Lords delivering of him thence, he concludes as more
then a conqueror. And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will
preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom; to whom be glory for ever and ever,
Amen.

EXERCITATION 3. Hard-heartedness made up of unteachableness in the
understanding, untractableness in the will, unfaithfulness in the memory,
unsensibleness in the conscience, and unmoveableness in the affections.
metaphors to express it from the parts of man's body, stones and metals. A soft
heart. Mischief, searedness, and virulency attendants of hardness. God
concurring thereunto by way of privation, Negation, permission, presentation.
Tradition to Satan. Delivering up to lusts, and infliction.
. 1. OUr fourth proposition is still behind, viz. Divine providence is an
actour even in sin it self. I shall single out hardness of heart, a sin common
to all sorts of men, though in different degrees, intending to declare, I. What
hard-heartedness is. II. That it is a sin. III. That God is an actour in it.

For the first, This word Heart is of various acceptions in the Scripture.
Sometime it signifies the understanding, as when it is said, God gave Solomon
1 Kings 4. 29.
largeness of heart, as the sand. that is, He had an understanding full of
notions, Exerc. 3.
as the seashore is full of grains of sand. Sometimes put for the will, as
when Barnabas exhorts the Christians of Antioch to cleave to the Lord with
purpose Acts 11. 23.
of heart. that is, with the full bent and inclination of their wills. For as
to know is an act of the understanding, so to cleave is an act of the will.
Sometimes for the memory, as when the blessed Virgin is said to have laid up
all Luke 2. 51.
our Saviors sayings in her heart. that is, kept them under lock and key, like
a choice treasure in her remembrance. Sometimes for conscience. So the Apostle
speaks of a condemning and not 1 John 3. 20, 21.
condemning heart. Now Gods deputy in point of judicature is conscience; which
Nazianzen therefore calls (...), a domestical tribunal, or a judge within
doors. Lastly, Sometimes for the affections. So the Prophet Ezekiel says of
people, that when they sat hearing the word, their heart went after their
covetousmess. Ezekiel. 33. 31.
that is, their fears, and hopes, their desires, love and other affections were
upon shops, ships, land and other commodities even while they were busied in
the worship of God. Each of these faculties called Heart in the book of God is
liable to its peculiar indisposition and distemper. All put together make up
the hard-heartedness, of which we are treating; the particular ingredients
whereof are these that follow.

I. Unteachableness in the understanding. Scripture joyneth blinding of eyes
and hardening of hearts as near a kin. He has John 12. 40.
blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they should not see with
their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted. It is
proverbially said, Lapidi loqueris; One had as good speak to a stone as to an
unteachable man: and we are all so by nature. Whence that of Paul, The natural
man receives not the 1 Cor. 2. 14.
things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he
know them because they are spiritually discerned. Such are often present at
Sermon, so are the pillars of stone in the Church, and they understand both
alike.

. 2. II. Untractableness in the will. There was reason enough spoken to Sihon
by Moses his messengers; but all would not incline him to yield a passage to
the army of Israel in an amicable way, because he was hardened. Sihon king of
Heshbon, says Moses, would not let us pass by him, for the Lord thy God Deuteronomy.
2. v. 27, 28, 30.
hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, etc. So was there enough
said and done to Pharaoh but still the burden of his story is this, He hardened
his heart and would not let Israel go. Steep a stone in oil, it continues hard
still. Pharaoh had sundry mercies showen him, being delivered from one plague
after another upon Moses his prayers; but the oil of mercy could not soften
him. Beat upon a stone with an hammer, it is a difficult thing, and in some
cases impossible to make an impression. The hammer of Gods word in the mouth of
Moses and Aaron, held as it were by the handle of ten notable miracles, gave
ten mighty blows at Pharaohs will; yet could make so little impression, that
after the ten plagues his heart was ten times harder then before.

III. Unfaithfulness in the memory. Pertinent hereunto is that upbraiding
passage of our Savior to his Disciples, Have ye your heart yet hardened? do ye
not Mark 8. 17, 18.
remember? they seemed to have at present forgotten two of Christ's miracles,
and are therefore charged with hardheartedness. Let water fall upon flesh it
moisteneth it, upon earth it soaketh in and rendereth it fruitful: let it fall
upon a rock it runs presently off and leaves no footsteps behind it. Where
hardness of heart prevails (as Verse. 19, 20.
here it did not, and therefore the disciples a little awakened by Christ's
interrogations were able to give an account of his miracles) there is commonly
no more of a chapter, sermon or pious discourse remaining in the hearers
memory, then there is moisture upon a rock after a good shower of rain.

IV. Unsensibleness in the conscience. St Paul speaks of some past feeling,
Ephesians. 4. 19. 1 Timothy 4. 2.
and of others that had their consciences seared with an hot iron, without all
sense as a member once cauterized. Smite a stone as long as you will, beat it
while you can stand over it, it complains not; lay a mountain upon it it
groaneth not. Such are some men's consciences. Let God beat upon them with
sermon after sermon, cross after cross; let them have worlds of oaths, lies,
cheats, and other sins to answer for, they feel not the load of these
mountains, complain not of them, but perhaps with Judas go out from the
Sacrament to play the traitor, and with king Ahaz sin yet more in their
distress. Although temperance, modesty, and the like dispositions be in some
measure quite extinguished, yet if conscience, like Jobs messenger be still
left to report the story of this desolation, there is some hope; but if, as
David sometime dealt with the Philistines, all be slain, and none left alive to
bring the tidings, if not only al ingenuity be banished, but the very mouth of
conscience also stopped, the case is desperate.

V. Unmoveableness in the affections. See an instance thereof in king Zedekiah,
of whom it is said, He did that which was 2 Chronicles. 36. 12, 13.
evil in the sight of the Lord his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah
the prophet, speaking from the mouth of the Lord. And he also rebelled against
king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck
and hardened his heart from turning unto the Lord God of Israel. Zedekiah's
heart was so obdurate, as not to have his affections Non magis incepto vultus
sermon movetur, Quam si dura silex aut Marpesia caut. Virg.
moved with any thing that Jeremiah could say or do. Let a man go about to make
an oration to a stone, be it never so eloquent and pathetical, the stone is not
affected with it; No more are many hard hearts with the voice of Gods word or
rod. Tell them of the beauty of Christ, they are not persuaded to love him; of
the ugliness of sin they are not induced to hate it; of the torments of hell,
they are not moved to fear and shun it. Such is the nature and composition of
hardheartedness, which was the first thing to be spoken to.

. 3. The second particular is, the sinfulness of that frame, which appears
from the expressions, the opposites, and the attendants of it mentioned in holy
Scriptures.

I. From the expressions, which are borrowed some from the bodies of men liable
to a double (...), others from metals, and others from stones. (...)
signifies not only the thick brawny skin that grows over the laborers
hand, and travellours foot, rendering that part insensible: but also among
Physicians that knottiness which grows upon the joints in some diseases as in
a long-continued gout, by them called nodosa podagra, and pronounced (...)
durities in artubas. Budae. commentar.
incurable by physic, Tollere nodosam nescit medicina podagram. Hardness of
heart is expressed by this, Mark 3. 5. John 12. 40. Elsewhere from metals, as
in that of Isaiah, Thou art obstinate, Isa. 484.
thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass. When men will no more stoop to
the precepts of Christ, then a beast would to the yoke, if his neck were of
iron: sinews are instruments of motion, they all go down from the head to the
body by the neck; if the neck should be stiff and the sinews of iron it would
not be possible for the head to bow down. Such is the state of obstinate
persons. Yea and further, the Prophet here ascribes to them a brow of brass.
The brow is that place where shame is wont to discover it self; this is said to
be of brass to note their impudency. An hard heart is frequently accompanied
with a brazen face. And in other places from stones. (An hard heart is usually
called an heart of stone) Ezekiel. 11. 19. and chap. 36. 26. Zechar. 7. 12.
Yea the hardest of all stones, the Adamant. They made their heart as an
adamant stone lest they should hear the law etc. stones are drier, and more
inflexible then metals themselves. Chymicks can distill metals, and alter the
shape of them to serve their turns. But Moses could not, O duriora sanis
Judaeorum pectora! finduntur petrae, sed horum corda durantur! -- Horum
immobilis duritia manet orb concusso. Ambros.
without a miracle, fetch water out of a rock, nor can men by the help of fire,
change the shape of a stone and render it flexible. Well might one of the
Fathers cry out by occasion of what befell at our Saviors passion, O the
hearts of the Jews harder then rocks! the rocks rent, but their hearts were
further from rending then before. The earth quaked, but their hardness
continued unremoved, almost unmoved. As in Jeroboams time when the Prophet
cried, O altar, altar, thus says the Lord, It heard and rent; Jeroboams heart
was harder then the very stones and rent not.

. 4. II. From the opposites of hard-heartedness; the chief whereof is spiritual

will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within Ezekiel. 11. 19.
you: and will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an
heart of flesh: that is a soft and tender heart. I do not mean that natural
tenderness, caused by constitution or education, of both which it is true, that
it softens the manners, and keeps them from Emollit mores, nec sinit esse seros.
fierceness, ascribed to Rehoboam, of whom it was said, He was young and 2
Chro. 1^. 7.
tenderhearted and could not withstand the children of Belial. Such men are
fitly compared to ripe plumbs and apricocks, which however soft and smooth on
the outside, yet have an hard stone within: like a brick, at first soft when
the clay is fashioned, and continues so till the Sun have hardened it, yea, by
pouring on of water, softened again; but if once baked in the brick-kill, no
fire will melt it, an whole sea will not moisten it afterward. So it fares
with sundry men formerly tenderhearted, when once hardened by conversing in
the world, and baked, as it were, in the kill of custom. That which I intend,
is Spiritual tenderness, ascribed to Josiah, Because thine heart was tender,
and thou did humble thy self before God: 2 Chr. 34. 27.
and did rend thy clothes, and weep before me, I have even heard thee also,
says the Lord God. As metals are melted with the fire before they be cast in
a new mold, so must every heart be melted and softened, before it come to be
molded anew. The new creature is always a tame and tender creature. This is
that temper which hardness of heart is opposite to, and therefore sinful.

III. From the attendants thereof. Diverse have been already mentioned. I shall
instance in some few more. He Prove. 28. 14, Job. 9. 4.
that hardens his heart shall fall into mischief. Who has hardened himself
against God and prospered.? Crying sins are commonly answered with the Echo of
roaring judgments. Hardness being in genere culpae one of the greatest evils,
there must needs be mischief due unto it in genere penae. Hereunto may be added
stubbornness; for when hardness is risen to an high degree, both senses of
discipline are obstructed; the ear, They resisted to hearken, Zech. 7. 12.
and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears that they should not
hear; yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone. The eye, He has blinded
their eyes, and hardened their hearts; that they should not John 12. 40.
see with their eyes, and understand with their hearts. Also searedness with an
hot iron, which is the next door to hanging; 1 Timothy 4. 2.
such as are formerly burnt in the hand, if they fall again into the hands of
justice, are commonly denied their book, and sent to the gallows. Notorious
malefactors are stigmatized, so are hard-hearted sinners.

Lastly, virulency or bitterness of spirit against the ways and people of God.
When diverse were hardened, and believed Act. 19. 9.
not, but spoke evil of that way before Omnis apostata est osor sui ordinis.
the multitude. No such bitter enemies to religion as those that after some
relentings return to their former frame of hard-heartedness: as the worst
traveling is when it has freezed after a thaw: so the worst conversing is
with men of that spirit.

. 5. I am now to show in the third place, that the providence of God is an
actor even in this sin, and that both in partial hardness, which often befalls
the elect of God, according to that, O Lord, why have thou made us to err from
thy ways? and hardened our Isa. 63. 17.
heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants sake, the tribes of thine
inheritance. And from that which is total and final, found in Reprobates of
whom Paul therefore says, Whom he will he Romans 9. 18.
hardens; and again, The election has Romans 11. 7.
obtained, but the rest were blinded or hardened. Now this is done diverse ways.

I. By way of Privation. As when the sun departs, darkness follows; yet the
Sun is no cause of darkness, but the absence thereof: so when God departs in
that, be it never so little, Matthew. 13. 12.
suppose but restraining grace, hardness follows, yet God is not the
efficient of it. Time was when Pharaoh had restraining grace, while it lasted
there were no violent hands laid upon Moses and Aaron, by whose ministry all
the plagues were brought upon him. He is no sooner deprived of that, but his
cruelty is let out to the full; Moses threatened with death the last time he saw
his face, and all pursued with a bloody intent. Pharaohs heart had somewhat of
softness, and malliableness in it all the while this fire remained, upon the
removal whereof, it returned to it is own hardness and coldness, as metal
would. As when a man holds a staff in his hand, let him but take away his
manutenencie, the staff falls immediately to the ground by its own poyse.

II. By way of Negation. As when God either refuses to give a people softning
means, or denies his blessing upon them. So when Moses called to all Israel,
and said unto them. Ye have seen Deuteronomy. 29. 2, 3, 4
all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, unto Pharaoh, and
unto all his servants, and unto all his land. The great temptations which thine
eyes have seen, the signs and those great miracles: yet the Lord has not
given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear unto this
day. In so doing, God himself is said to harden (as S. Austin has it) when
Dicitur Deus indurare quando non en oll^t; excoecare quando non illuminat. De
Praed. c. (...). Non indurat Deus impertiendo mal^tiam, sed non impertiendo
gratiam, Aug. Epist. 105.
he softens not, and to blind when he enlightneth not. As the Sun freezeth and
congealeth the water, not by imparting coldness to it, but by not imparting
heat, and shining upon it with fervent beams. So it is (says the same Father)
in Gods hardening, who does not do it by imparting malice, but by not imparting
grace. Neither does this denial affix any unlawfulness upon him; as the like
would do upon a good man that had to give, and to spare what his neighbor
stood in absolute need of; for it is not the same cause throughout, betwixt God
and man: there is a mutual tie of the creatures one to another. All men are
made of one blood, (as in the Acts) they are therefore bound by the law of
nature to mutual helpfulness. Not so between God and the creature: for the
dependence, and consequently the tie is not mutual. We depend upon God, not he
upon us; therefore for us not to do what he requires, is absolutely sinful,
but no law binds him to give whatsoever is needful for us; therefore not to
give, it is no sin. If he please to indulge it, it is grace, and not debt; if
not, the clay must not contend and find fault with the potter.

. 6. III. By way of Permission. Hard-heartedness is one of those evils, which
God permits, but approves not, and accordingly included in that speech, God
in times past suffered all nations Act. 14. 16.
to walk in their own ways. Therefore the Schoolmen upon those Texts, Deus non
volens iniquitatem, tu es, and Psalm. 5. 5. Esai. 66. 4.
Quod non volui elegerunt, have founded a notable distinction between Velle,
Nolle, and Non velle, which is not inconsiderable here. God is said to Will a
thing, when he so approves it, as to effect it. To Nill a thing, when he so
dislikes it, as to prohibit it; Non velle, not to will it; when he so dislikes,
as not to prohibit, yea, and not to effect it, yet permits it to be for good
ends. Of the Lord, it is truly said, That he wills an heart of flesh, and that
he nills a heart of stone; as for hardheartedness, although he frequently
permit it, yet we must say he is not altogether willing to have it, however
willing to suffer it. Our temper must be that of Austin, In a wonderful and
unspeakable manner even that which is Miro and inessabili modo non sit praeter
ejus voluntatem quod etiam sit contra ejus voluntatem. Quia non fieret nisi
sineret, nec utique nolens sinit, sed volens. Aug. Enchir. l. 160. Non sineret
bonus fieri male nisi omnipotens etiam de malo posset sacere been. Id. Ibid.
done against his will, is not done without his will; for it would not be done,
if it were not permitted; neither does he permit it without, but with his will.
And again, He is so good as that he would never suffer evil, if he were not so
Omnipotent, as to bring good out of evil.

IV. By way of presenting objects of which our corruptions make a bad use.
Esaias his Evangelical Ministry made the heart of that people fat, and made
their Isal. 6. 10.
ears heavy, and shut their eyes. The hotter the Sun is wont to shine, the more
the dunghill is wont to sent. Men grow hardest under the most Gospel ministry.
So under mercies of all sorts. He that observes the passages of Pharaohs
story, shall find that his corruptions took many occasions from the carriage
of things to harden him yet more and more. After he had been freed from two or
three several plagues by Moses his prayer upon his hypocritical relentings, he
might perhaps begin to think that the God of Israel was such an one as might be
deceived with fair shows, and so fear him less. It pleased God not to strike
Pharaoh himself with any plague by Twiss. Vind. part. 2. p. 94.
the hand of Moses; nor to suffer his people to rise up against him and free
themselves by main force. This might happily tend to his further hardening, and
put him upon saying, If he be so great a God, why does he not smite me in mine
own person, or carry out his people without me? Besides, the same plague was
never twice inflicted: he saw that, and might think when one plague was over,
that would not come again, and there could not come a worse then that: the God
of Israel had surely done his worst already. Come we to the last scene of his
Tragedy after Israel was departed, things were so carried as to cram his
corruption, and to make his heart fatter then before. The Hebrews are all found
in a place with the sea before them, and great mountains on each side. Their
being so pent, encourages Pharaoh and his host. The sea is ere long divided
for Israel; the waves stand as walls on either side, the people pass through
as on dry land. Why should not the sea, might he think, make way for me as well
as for them? The prey is now in view, let go this one opportuty, they are gone
for ever. If the waves stand up but a while longer (as they have done a good
while already) the day is ours. They pass on, and perish.

. 7. V. By way of tradition to Satan. Who although he have not any power of
enforcing, yet has a notable slight of persuading, and by this means of Non
babet potentiam cogendi, sed ast utiam suadendi.
hardening. No doubt but Pharaoh being deluded by the Magicians, who were
suffered to counterfeit the same miracles which Moses did, was thereby hardened
through the operation of Satan. We read of an evil Spirit from 1 Samuel 16. 15.
God troubling Saul, and after that of many hard-hearted prancks by him played,
such as never before: and of John 13. 2.
the devils having put into Judas his heart to betray Christ, after which he
was restless till he had done it; As they must needs go, our Proverb says,
whom the devil drives. It Is strange how that man's spirit declined into further,
and yet further degrees of hardness; but less strange if we consider that the
devil was entered into him. Judas was first a cunning dissembler; the disciples
suspected themselves as soon as him, and therefore said, Master, is it I?
Afterward a secret thief; for he bare the bag and filched: then a bold
traitor, What will ye give? and Hail Master. In the conclusion, a desperate
self-murderer, as the most interpreters judge, in making away himself.

VI. By way of delivering men up to their own lusts. Hear God of his own
people. My people would not hearken to my voice: and Israel would none of me.
So I gave them Psalm. 81. 11, ^2.
up unto their own hearts lusts; and they walked in their own counsels: how
much more is this true of God's enemies? Pharaoh by name. See how these three
lusts of his, Idolatry, Ambition, and Covetousness concurred to the making of
him so hard-hearted toward God; so hard to be prevailed with by Moses. As an
Idolater, he was loath to receive a message from the God of Israel, whom he
knew not. Vid. Twiss. vindici. part. 2. page 94, etc.
Who is the Lord, said he, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I
know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go. As an Ambitious Prince it went
to his heart to have Moses control him in his own dominions, and to admit the
commands of any superior Lord, Thus says the Lord, Let my people go, was as
fire to his bones, and enraged him, who would not hear of any lord over that
people but himself. As a Covetous man, he was loath to have so fat a collop cut
off his flank, to hear of parting with a people by whose pains in making bricks
he had such daily comings in.

VII. By way of infliction and penalty. One sin is often made the punishment of
another, and hardness the punishment of many sins often reiterated. When Exodus 9.
34.
Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail, and the thunders were ceased, he
sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. The harder they
were the more they sinned, and the more they sinned, the harder they were.
Affected hardness is frequently followed with inflicted hardness. Men by
customary sinning make their hearts as an adamant stone (so Zech. 7. 12.
the phrase is in Zechary) of which it is said, Incidit gemmas, sed non
inciditur ipse;
Hircino tantum sanguine mollis erit.
That is, It cuts all stones: It self is cut of none;
It softened is by blood of goats alone.
Unregenerate persons of hard hearts usually grieve their godly friends, who
are cut at the heart to see their obstinacy, as Christ grieved for the
Pharisees hardness. Mark 5. (...).
At non inciditur ipse. But such an one cannot heartily grieve for himself. His
heart till it come to be steeped in the blood of Christ, who is that Scapegoat
in Leviticus, relenteth not, or not to purpose. It were easy to add much more:
but I shall now shut up all concerning this proposition God hardens, Grave
est auditu, and non facile recipit hoc pia men's: non quia quod dicitur non been
dicitur, sed quia quod been dicitur non been intelligitur. Hugo de S. Victor.
lib. 1. de sacram. part. 4. cap. 12.
with the saying of Hugo de sancto Victore concerning that, God wills evil.
This is irksome to the ear, and a pious mind does not easily receive it; but
the reason is not because what is said is not well said, but because what is
well enough said is not half well understood.

. 1. TWo things are still remaining, viz. Objections against, and Corollaries
from the formentioned propositions: to which in their order.

Objection against the first. Some think Ex hoc Deus beatus est quia nihil
curat, neque habet ipse negotium, neque alteri exhibel. Lactant. de ira Dei
cap. 4. -- Credat Judaeus Apello. Non ego, namque Deos didici securum agere
aevum. Hor.
the extending of divine Providence to all created beings, how mean soever,
unsuitable to the perfection of God, whom, they say, it does not become to stoop
so low. Epicurus is cited by Lactantius, as speaking to this purpose, and after
him Horace.

Answ. They speak like heathens, not knowing the Scripture, nor the power of
God. The Psalmist otherwise, Who is like unto the Lord our God, Psalm. 113. v.
5, 6, 7, 8.
who dwells on high? Who humbles himself to behold the things that are in
heaven, and in earth. He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts the
needy out of the dunghill. He makes the barren woman to keep house, to be a
joyful mother of children. Of his care and providence it is believed
Providentia Dei nec fallitar, nec fatigatur. Eam nec magna onerant, nec parva
effugiunt. Molin. Enod. quaest. p. 23.
and asserted by divines, that it is neither deceived nor tired, and that as
the greatest things do not overburden it, so least things do not escape it.
That of our Savior to his Disciples is a most express assertion. Are not five
Luke 12. 6, 7.
sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?
But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

Wherefore, by way of Corollary from hence, let God himself alone be
acknowledged the Preserver and Governor of all things. Let no man think by his
strength of parts, or extremity of pains to take the work out of his hands.
Melancthon was beyond Monendus est per vos Philippus ut desinat esse Rector
mundi. Wolf. memorabil.
measure solicitous about Church Affairs in that age wherein he lived: insomuch
as Luther once wrote to his neighbour-ministers that they should do well to
give him a serious admonition not to attempt the government of this world any
longer. That of Maximilian the Emperor in the time of Pope Julius the second,
was an honest acknowledgement. Deus aeterne nisi vigilares, Historia Pontificum
Romanorum contract. per Jacobum Revium. page 259.
quam male esset mundo! quem regimus nos; Ego miser venator, and ebriosus ille
ac^sceleratus Julius! O eternal Lord God if thou thy self should not be
watchful, how ill it would be with this world, which is now governed by me, a
miserable hunter, and by this drunken and wicked Pope Julius!

. 2. Against the second proposition it has been objected that there is no such
thing as the providence of God superintending humane affairs, especially
considering the great prosperity which is enjoyed by wicked men. Pliny the
great Naturalist speaks of Irridendum est, si quis putet illud, quicquid est
summum, agere curam rerum human^rum. Nature. hist. l. 6. c. 7. Psalm 73. v. 2, 3.
it, as a thing to be entertained with laughter rather then belief. And the
Psalmists words are these, As for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had
well nigh slipped. For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of
the wicked. Behold, V. 12, 13.
these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.
Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence.

Answ. That which then satisfied him, should now suffice to answer us. He went
into the sanctuary of God, then understood V. 17, 18.
he their end. Surely thou did set them in slippery places, thou castedst
them down into destruction. Their prosperity was not full, was not to be final.
I. Was not full. The places wherein they stood were slippery: their felicity
varnished over, but rotten within. That in S. John and only that is perfect
prosperity, when the inward and outward man thrive together, I wish 3 John 2.
above all things (says he to Gaius) that thou may prosper, and be in
health, even as thy soul prospers. With them it is quite otherwise. They
have, it may be, fat bodies, but lean souls; full purses, but empty heads and
hearts; blessed in their estates, but cursed in their spirits. Have Lament. 3. 65.
houses and lands worth many thousands, but hearts little worth, according to
that The tongue of the just is as Prove. 10. 20. Nulla verior miseria quam falsa

choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth. Call you this
prosperity? It is in truth nothing less. It is unhappiness rather, and there
are those who have not stuck to name it so. II. Was not to be final. Thou
castedst them down into destruction. The world came in fast upon them one way;
and the wrath of God came as fast another. This fair day of theirs is but a
weather-breeder; as a calm before an earthquake. To Deuteronomy. 32. 35.
me belongs vengeance and recompense, says the Lord, their foot shall slide
in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that
shall come upon them make haste. David expresses it most emphatically, I have
seen the wicked in great Psalm 37. 35, 36.
power: and spreading himself like a green bay tree. (A tree that retains its
viridity and freshness even in winter when fruit-bearing trees have cast their
leaves) yet he passed away, and lo, he was not: yea I sought him, but he could
not be found. Let such an one be sought in his counting house, which was wont
to be the temple, wherein he worshipped his God Mammon; he is not there. At
Court where he was so magnified, and almost adored; he is not to be found in
the lodgings there. He that would find him, must seek him in hell. For there
he is. This is the end of such worldly prosperity as comes from God, and yet
defieth him.

. 3. The Corollary from hence is, let the superintendency of divine providence
over all humane affairs, in particular over Military and Civil be humbly
acknowledged. I. Over military. Those Frenchmen were undoubtedly to blame, who
in their flattering applauses of Richelieu, did ascribe Howels lustra Ludov. p.
166.
the reduction of Rochel solely to him, insomuch, as one of their Chroniclers
writes, That in the taking of that town, neither the king, nor God Almighty
had a share in the action, but the Cardinal himself. How much safer is it for
us to follow the tract of Scripture? which to show how effectual the influence
of divine providence is upon actions of that nature, is wont to compare God
unto whatsoever is necessary to secure a city besieged, for example, unto
weapons, walls, fortifications, watchmen and soldiers. To weapons both
offensive and defensive. Happy art thou, O Israel, who is like unto Deuteronomy. 33.
29.
thee, O people, saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the
sword of thy excellency. To walls, I says the Lord, will be unto her Zech. 2.
5.
a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her. To
fortifications, We have a strong city, salvation will God appoint for walls and
bulwarks. If besides Isa. 26. 1.
bulwarks a city be compassed about with a river, chiefly if with the sea it
self we account it strongly fortified. Hear the same Prophet, The glorious Isa.
33. 21.
Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams. To watchmen, Except
Psalm 127. 1.
the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. Lastly to soldiers,
The Lord is a man of war: yea the Lord Exodus 15. 3.
is a whole army of men, both Van and Rear, The Lord will go before you, and
Isa. 52. 12.
the God of Israel will be your rere-ward.

II. Over civil affairs. I have been told that during the late treaty of a
match between the Prince of Wales that then was, and the Infanta of Spain, the
Earl of Bristol, then Ambassador at Madrid, when things went exceeding
Reported by Mr Stephen Marshall.
cross to his designs, fell into a deep perplexity, could not rest for diverse
nights, till a Gentleman that lay in his chamber took the boldness to speak to
him and said, My Lord, I have observed much perplexity, and thereupon much
restlesness in you. I humbly beseech your Lordship to consider that the world
was well governed five thousand years and more before you were born, and will
be so when you are dead. I pray you therefore be not troubled at any thing, but
refer the issue to God. Whereupon he is said to have fallen to rest. Our way to
be quiet is to do the like upon all occasions; to drive up things to divine
Providence, and there to rest. Time was when Daniels head and heart was filled
with the visions of God; by which the great changes that were to happen in the
government of the world had been newly made known to him: viz. the wheeling
about of Monarchy from the Babylonians (who then were in the highest of their
power) to the Persians, thence to the Grecians, and thence to the Romans; from
an head of gold, to a breast and arms of silver, from them to a belly and
thighs of brass, and from them to legs of iron, and to feet part of iron, part
of clay; yea in the end to a little stone cut out without hands, which brake
the whole image in pieces. He notwithstanding quarrelleth not with Providence
for intending so notable, so destructive changes to the government then in
being; goes not about to demand any account thereof from God of such
alterations, but betaketh himself quietly to the praise and admiration of him,
by whose wisdom and power they were all in their seasons to be accomplished.
Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the
name of Dan. 2. 19, 20, 21.
God for ever and ever. For wisdom and might are his: And he changes the
times and seasons; he removes kings, and sets up kings. We should do well,
however things go, to make Austins resolution Felix sit mund^s, evertatur
mundus: benedicam Domino, qui fecil mundum. August.
ours; Let the world sink or swim, be ruined or prosper, I will still bless the
Lord who made the world. As for the late wheelings of Providence here in this
Isalnd, and alterations thereupon. I for my part say with Anselm once Si quis
potest intelligere, Deo gratias agat: si non potest, non immittat cornua ad
ventilandum, sed submittat caput. ad venerandum Anselmus Epistola de fide ad
Vrbanum Pap. cap. 2.
Archbishop of Canterbury. If any be able to understand them, let him give
thanks to God: if any be not, let him however bow down his head to worship
God; not lift up his horn by way of debate and ventilation.

. 4. An objection against the third proposition, concerning Gods special care
and providence over the Church, and the members thereof, may be formed thus.
The Church of all Societies, the Saints of all men, are the most in sufferings.
Yea some Churches, by name those seven in Asia, which we read of in the
Revelation, have been extinguished. From whence some are apt to infer want of
care, and providence rather.

Answ. Be it granted that the militant Church is for the most part in a Non
oportet membra deliciari sub capite spinis coronato.
suffering condition, and that Christ our head, being a man of sorrows,
typified by the brazen altar upon which the fire was continually burning, a
wife of pleasures did not become him, nor members used to overmuch delicacie.
That every vessel of mercy must expect scouring in order to brightness; and
hovvever trees in the wilderness grow without culture, trees in the orchard
must be pruned in order to fruitfulness, and corn-bearing fields broken up,
when barren heaths are left untouched; yea that in some particular instances
the candlestick has been removed and the place unchurched, yet the inference
is not solid, because first, All afflictions are advantageous to the godly.
They often help to make bad men good, always to make good men better. David
could say, It is good for me that I have been afflicted. Psalm. 119. 71.
Of the godly captives of Judah the Lord says, He had sent them out of Jer.
24. 5.
that place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good. Secondly, because
the promises made concerning the Churches preservation (such as I insisted upon
above in the second Exercitation of this Aphorism) are for the most part
misunderstood, and consequently misinproved. Learn we for the future to
embrace them with these three cautions.

. 5. I. That they do in especial manner concern the Church Catholic, not this
or that particular Nation or Congretion. If that in the beginning of Esaias the
twenty seventh were to be considered as a National Church, we all know it
has been ruined long since notvvithstanding the promise there made, which
must therefore be understood of it as a type of the Church universal; that is
so watered and kept as to be inexpugnable. Look as by virtue of the Covenant
made with Noah that the whole earth should never be again overflovvn with a
general deluge, we may be sure it never shall: yet there have since, and may
still be diverse inundations, whereby some parts of the earth have been, and may
be laid waste: so by virtue of Gods promises, we may be confident that the
gates of hell shall never prevail against the whole Church of Christ; yet may
diverse particular Churches be ruined (as those in Asia have been). No man knows
how many more may have the same line of Desolation drawn over them. Mean while
the Catholic Church, still, not only continues, but thrives, because like the
sea, it wins in one place, what it loses in another; like the Sun, it rises
to the Antipodes, when it sets to our Hemisphere.

II. That a particular Church in case it degenerate, cannot challenge such
interest in them, as it might, if it had continued pure. There was to be a time
when the vineyard in Esaias should affoard red wine; then it Isa. 5. 4, 5, 6.
might look for watering every moment, and being kept from all hurt. But there
was also a-time when it degenerated, and instead of red wine, brought forth
wild grapes; when instead of keeping it, the Lord threatened to take away the
hedge, and pull down the wall thereof: instead of preserving it from hurt, to
let it be eaten up, broken down, and laid waste; instead of watering, to
command the clouds that they rain not upon it. Who knows but the Lord has
said of us in this Nation, as concerning the old Jewish Church? Their vine is

of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter. Their
wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps. Sure I am, he has
already begun to cut our Vine till it bleed; and if repentance step not in to
turn away wrath, may be provoked to say of England as he once did of Palestina.

plant of a strange vine, unto me? May the spirit of Reformation pass through
us all! So shall not iniquity be our ruin, as it otherwise may and will.

III. That they use not to be fulfilled all at once, but by certain periods, so
as to have their gradual accomplishments. I shall instance in that of Esaias
formerly mentioned. Piscator and Scultetus upon the place interpret it of that
preservation which God vouchsafed the Jewish Church under Ezra, Zerubbabel, and
Nehemiah in a state of peace and purity, notwithstanding the opposition made
against it. Others expect a further accomplishment thereof, when the Jews shall
be called in a glorious manner, and when the deliverer shall come out of Sion,
and turn away ungodliness Romans 11. 26.
from Jacob. So Justus Heurnius in his Evangelical Embassy to the Indians Page
139, etc,
toward the beginning of the fourth Chapter. And the Author of an English
Treatise concerning the calling of the Jews, published by Dr. Gouge, in the
year 1621. But the fullest accomplishment of it, is reserved for that period,
after which, time shall be no more; when all the Israel of God shall be watered
with that pure river of life, clear as Crystal, proceeding out of the throne
of God, and of the Lamb, spoken of in the last of the Revelation. Of this
period, I find the place expounded by popish Commentatours, by name Sanctius,
Haec ad dien^ judicit pertinent. Gladius quo tunc occidetur Diabolus est
sententia Judicis etc.
Cornelius a Lapide, and Tirinus, the last whereof understands by the vineyard
of red wine, Ecclesiam beatorum, the Church Triumphant: yea, and by some also
of our own writers, Oecolampadius in particular, who says, The things there
spoken of, have respect to the day of judgment.

. 6. The Corollary from hence should be that of S. Peter, a serious lesson of
casting all our care upon God, 1 Pet. 5. 7.
for he cares for us. This has been by experience found the only best way of
obtaining Christian tranquillity of mind: witness that of Wenceslaus, King of
Bohemiah, who after the rooting and flight of his Army, being himself taken
captive by the enemy, and asked how he did, answered, Never better; for
heretofore when I had B^yerlinck. Apotheg. p. 20. Ex Aenea Sylvio. Nunquam
melius, etc.
all my men about me, I could find but little time to think of God. Now being
stripped of all them, I think only of him, and betake my self wholly to his
Providence, who I am sure will hear me when I call upon him. That of Bishop
Hooper (in a consolatory letter to certain Mr Fox, Acts and Mon. Vol. 3.
godly Christians) taken in Bow-Church-yard at prayer, and laid in the Counter.
Let us (says he) now we be called, commit all other things to him that calls
us. He will help the husband, he will comfort the wife, he will guide the
servants, he will keep the house, he will preserve the goods. Above all, that
of our Father Abraham, who when Isaac had said, Behold the fire and Genesis 22. 7,
8. and 13, 14.
wood, but where is the sacrifice for a burnt-offering? readily answered, My
son, God will provide himself a burnt-offering: and when he beheld a Ram
unexpectedly provided, to be offered up in lieu of Isaac, called the name of
the place Jehovah-jireh, That is, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
See we imitate him who is the father of the faithful, in casting all our care
upon God, both for our selves, and our posterity.

I. For our selves. Behold a sure warrant for that from the pen of David, Cast
thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall Psalm. 55. 22.
sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved: Yea, from the
mouth of Christ himself; The very hairs of your Matthew. 10. 30, 31.
head are all numbered; fear ye not. Thou (says Austin) that shall not lose one
Times ne animam perdas qui capillum non perdes? Aug. in Psalm. 96.
hair, how comes it to pass that thou art afraid of losing thy soul?

II. For our posterity. There be many that seem to rest upon Providence for
themselves, who do yet macerate their hearts with carking and caring for their
children, with thoughts what will become of them when they are gone. As Philip
once said, Two hundred peniworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that
every one of John 6. 7, 9.
them may take a little. And Andrew, There is a lad here which has five barley
loaves and two small fishes, but what are they among so many? So do these men
say in their hearts, What is my small estate divided among so many children? I
am not like to leave enough for every one to take a little. O fools, and flow
of heart to believe! have ye forgotten what God said to your father Abraham?
Read, and recall. I am the Almighty God: walk before me, and be thou Genesis 17.
1, 7.
perfect. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed
after thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto
thee, and unto thy seed after thee. Why may not this God be trusted with thy
children too? Sure I am he should. Tell me, Who provided for them before they
were born? Who put care and tender affections into their mothers heart, milk
into their nurses breasts? Did not God? Is not he that made provision for them
all before they came into this world, and has comfortably maintained them ever
since, fit to be trusted with them still, though thou be gathered to thy
fathers, and see Corruption? Doubtless he is.

. 7. The better to help us in the performance of so important a duty as this,
take along with us the following directions.

I. Get and keep assurance of a peculiar interest in the love and favor of God
in Christ. We neither trust known enemies nor doubtful friends with what we
account precious. They that know God to be their enemy, they that doubt whether
he be their friend or no, cannot with confidence cast their whole care upon
him. But he that can groundedly say with David, I am thine, may go on as he
does, Lord, save me. He that Psalm. 119. 94.
can say with assurance of faith, The Lord is my shephard, may confidently
Psalm. 23. 1.
add, I shall not want. The spouse may go leaning upon her beloved with all her
Cant. 6. 3. 7. 10. 8. 5.
weight, when she has first been enabled to say, My beloved is mine, and I am
his. I am my beloveds, and his desire is toward me.

II. Continue in well-doing. Let them that suffer according to the will of God
(says S. Peter) commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as
unto a faithful Creator. Look how much care a man has to please God, so much
confidence may he have to cast all his care upon him. Whilst the people of
Israel went up to the place of Gods public worship, all the males that were of
age, thrice in a year, leaving none but women and children at home, so giving
the enemy fair opportunity for invasion: God undertakes they shall not so much
as desire or think of such a thing. Neither shall any man desire thy land, when
thou shall go up to appear before Exodus 34. 23, 24.
the Lord thy God, thrice in the year.

III. Treasure up the promises, chiefly such as are made on purpose to assure
us of Gods caring for us: that in particular, Let your conversation be without
covetousness, and be content with Heb. 13. 5. (...).
such things as ye have, for he has said, I will never leave thee nor forsake
thee. Where there is in the Original an accumulation of many negatives to make
the assertion as strong as may be, it is as much as if he had said, I will
never, in no wise, in no case forsake thee. We are wont to call the bills and
bonds of able men, good security. The promises of God all-sufficient are
certainly so.

IV. Reflect upon former experiments, and let them be encouragements for time
to come. The Psalmist did so when he said, I have considered Psalm. 77. 5, 10.
the days of old, the years of ancient times -- I will remember the years of
the right hand of the most high, I will remember the works of the Lord; surely
I will remember thy wonders of old. Some enquire why David when he asked for a
sword, and Abimelech told him there was none at hand but that of Goliath, called
for it, and said, There is none like to that: it is 1 Samuel 21. 9.
probable he might have found some of better metal, or as good: and some
perhaps fitter for his strength, but yet prefers this above all because of his
experiment. God had formerly blessed him in the use of that.

. 8. Against the fourth and last proposition of Providence her activity even in
sin; it may be objected, and usually is, that this tenet cannot be maintained
without making God the Author of sin, which opinion is an abhorrencie to the
minds of all sound Divines.

I answer, so it is, and ought to be; neither does that assertion want the
attestation of this State. Witness a modern, but pregnant occurrence, yet not
generally known, and therefore inserted here in perpetuam rei memoriam. In the
year of our Lord, 1645. there was published in London an English book, wherein
God was expressly made the Author of his peoples sins, though not without some
limitations. The Assembly of Divines then sitting at Westminster, took offense
at this, (though some of them, being acquainted with the man, whose name it
bore, were ready to say of him, as Bucholcerus Habuit cor bonum, sed non caput
regulatum, Sculter. Annal. D^c.
did of Swenckfeldius, He had a good heart, yet without a well regulated head)
made complaint of it to both houses of Parliament. They both censured the said
book to be burnt by the hand of the common hangman; and the Assembly of Divines
agreed upon a short Declaration, Nemine contradicente, by way of detestation of
that abominable and blasphemous opinion, which was also published under that
Title, July 17. 1645. and in which we meet with these among other expressions;
That the most vile and blasphemous Assertion, whereby God is avowed to be the
Author of sin, has hitherto by the general consent of Christian Teachers and
Writers, both ancient and modern, and those as well Papists as Protestants,
been not disclaimed only, but even detested and abhorred. -- Our Common
adversaries, the Papists, have hitherto only calumniously charged the Doctrine
of the Reformed Churches with so odious a crime (in the mean time confessing
that we do in words deny it, as well as they themselves) now should this book
be tolerated, might insult over us, and publish to the world, that in the
Church of England it was openly, and impudently maintained, That God is the
Author of sin, then which there is not any one point, whereby they labor in
their Sermons and popular Orations, to cast a greater Odium (though most
injuriously) upon the Reformed Churches. -- We are not, for the Reverence or
estimation of any man's person, to entertain any such opinions as do in the very
words of them asperse the honor and holiness of God, and are by all the
Churches of Christ rejected.

This premised, I now assert positively and considerately (yet without obliging
my self to make good every phrase that has fallen unadvisedly from the pen of
every w^ter) that what Protestant Churches say in their public Confessions,
and allowed Protestant writers in their books, concerning Gods having a natural
influence into the sinful acts of creatures, but without a moral influence
into the sinfulness of their acts; his inflicting hardness of heart as a
punishment to former sins; his directing and ordering great sins to great good,
as Joseph's vendition to the Churches preservation, yea, the crucifixion of
Christ, to the salvation of the Elect, do neither really, nor in due
construction amount to the making of God the Author of sin. To what has been
elsewhere further said of this copious argument, I refer the capable reader to
my Tactica Sacra, Lib. 1. Cap. 1.. 5. and ibidem cap. 6.. 4.

FINIS.
