A Brief TRACT ON THE FOURTH Commandment. Wherein is Discovered.

The CAUSE of all our CONTROVERSIES. ABOUT THE Sabbath Day, And the means of
reconciling them.

More particularly is showed; 1. That the seventh day from the Creation, which
was the day of Gods Rest, was not the seventh day which God in this Law
commanded his People to keep Holy; neither was it such a kind of day as was the
Jews Sabbath Day. 2. That the seventh day in this Law commanded to be kept
holy, is the seventh day of the week, viz. the day following the six days of
labor with all People. 3. That Sunday is with Christians as truly the
Sabbath Day, as was Saturday with the Jews.

TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader,
I Believe thou art not ignorant of the many dissensions and contentions that
have been among the People of God about the Sabbath Day. Some stood for the old
Sabbath (so called by some) meaning the Jews Sabbath Day. Some for a new
Sabbath (so called by some) meaning the day of Christ's Resurrection. And some
for no Sabbath but what Magistrates do appoint. No small Controversies have
been between all these about the Sabbath Day, as I believe thou know. But
the ground and cause of all such their Controversies; and how for Peace and
Agreement sake it may be removed and taken away, I suppose thou do not know:
both which I will discover unto thee.

The ground of such their differences is a misunderstanding of these words of
the Commandment, Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work, but the
seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou shall do no manner
of work. By the six days must be meant, either the six days of Gods work, or
the six days of work with men: either the six first days at the Creation, in
which God wrought, and made all things; or else the six work-days of the week
in use with men where they live. So also the seventh day must relate to the six
days of Gods work, or else to the six days of men's labor: it must be the
seventh day from the beginning of the Creation, or the seventh day from men's
beginning their six weekdays of labor; It must either be the day of Gods
Rest, which immediately followed the six days of his work, or the day of rest
with men, which immediately follows their six days of work where they live.

They, between whom the said dissensions have been and are, have and do hold
generally, that the seventh day must and does relate to the six days of Gods
labor, and not of man's: It must be, they all think, the very day of Gods Rest,
the seventh day from the Creation. Thus they all thought that the Jews
Sabbath Day, which was from Fridays Sunsetting to Saturdays Sunsetting, was
the precise day of Gods Rest: and every of their other six days of the week, to
be the very same with the six days of the Creation, whether they lived in
Judea, in Babylon, in Spain, in Ophyr, or in any other place, it makes no
matter, think they. Though Sunday with Christians be the day immediately
following their six days of labor; and on which they having labored six days,
do then rest from their labor according unto Gods example; Yet at no hand will
they yield Sunday to be the seventh day and Sabbath of the Lord: Sunday they
hold to be the first day of the week, and the very same with the first day of
the Creation with Christians wherever they live. From this common error
sprouted out various opinions, which set them all at Variance.

1. The Jews, and such as adhere to their superstition, do and will still plead
for the Saturday-Sabbath: the Saturday they believe to be the day of Gods Rest,
the day he Blessed and Sanctified: they cannot conceit well of a new Sabbath,
they know not whence it is. Though an Angel should come from Heaven and tell
them, that Christ the Son of God came into the World, and has taken away their
Sabbath and has established another contrary to what God the Father
Instituted; So that whereas before they had the seventh day for a day of rest,
Christ Instituted that seventh day to be a work day: That whereas God the
Father Blessed and Sanctified the seventh day, Christ took off the ^lessing
from it, and gave it to the first day: That whereas God the Father appointed
his People to work before they did rest, Christ appointed them to rest before
they did work: That whereas before they were to work, and do all that they had
to do in six days, and rest on the seventh day, according to Gods example; Now
they must rest on the first day, and work the six days after, which is contrary
to Gods example. I say, if an Angel from Heaven should come and teach them
thus, they would not believe him.

2. Some there be, and they not a few, Godly, Precious, and tenderhearted
Christians; who knowing that the Church of God has ever since our Saviors
Ascension observed the Sunday for their Sabbath, and that not against, but with
the Approbation of the Apostles of Christ, do slight the Seventh-day Sabbath,
and are tooth and nail for the first day of the week (so they count Sunday to
be, neither can they count it otherwise, as long as they hold the Jews Sabbath
to be the seventh day from the Creation) believing that the Apostles of Christ
by the appointment of our Savior, changed the old Sabbath (so they call the
Seventh-day Sabbath,) to the Sabbath of the first day of the week; so that now
the Church of God is to rest before they labor, and unto, not from their
labor.

3. Some again, knowing that the Jews Saturday Sabbath was Ceremonial and
abrogated, do thence hold and maintain the Seventh day Sabbath to be abrogated
also; and for that they know not any other Sabbath day appointed by Divine
Authority instead thereof, do infer, that Christians now in time of the Gospel
are to have and keep no Sabbath Day at all.

Thus kind Reader, I have showed thee the ground and cause of these various and
different Opinions about the Sabbath Day. Whence have issued most, if not all
the Controversies which are now on foot between them.

The only mean to stop all future Controversies, and bring all sides to accord
in one truth about the Sabbath day, is to take away, and wipe off from their
minds the aforesaid error, which occasioned all their differences. For as long
as they or any side of them hold, that the seventh day which God Blessed and
Sanctified, and commanded to be observed by all his People, does relate to the
six days of Gods work, and not of man's; that is, as long as they hold the
seventh day here commanded to be the very day of Gods Rest, the seventh day
from the first beginning of the Creation, they will never come to agree in the
Truth, but more and more differences will still rise. Whereas if they all
consent in the true understanding of the aforesaid words of the Commandment,
that the seventh day relates to the six days of work with men, and so must be
the day after the six weekdays of labor with People wherever they dwell;
Agreement then of all sides will be had. That great stumbling block given the
Jews of our not keeping the seventh day, according to Gods Precept and Example,
which does so stave them off from affecting our Religion, will be wholly taken
away; they cannot then but acknowledge that we keep the seventh day of the
week, the day following our six days of labor, the very Sabbath Day pointed
out unto us here in this Law. They also who now stand for a new Sabbath Day,
who say the Sabbath Day is changed, and the first day of the week to have been
Instituted instead of the seventh, will have no ground for such their
assertion. And lastly, they who say the Church of Christ never observed the
Sabbath since Christ's Ascension, and would from the practice of the Apostles,
and the Church of Christ argue the Abrogation of the Seventh-day Sabbath, will
quickly be of another mind, and acknowledge, that as the Jews observed that day
for their Sabbath, which in this Law was commanded by the Lord God, so
Christians also have ever done; They have observed the same day, the last day
of the week, the day following their six days of labor according to Gods
example.

But Courteous Reader, happily thou doubtest here, and would be satisfied,
that whereas God commands by this Law all his Obedient Children to keep the
seventh day of the week, which is the Sabbath day holy unto his Honor: If the
Jews then keep the Sabbath Day on the seventh day of the week, according to
Gods command; How can Christians who keep their Sabbath a whole day after, be
said to keep their Sabbath on the seventh day of the week too, according to
Gods Commandment?

For thy satisfaction herein, let me now ask thee one Question like unto thine?
thine answer to mine will satisfy thine own.

Suppose the Pope made a Decree that all his obedient Children should keep the
25. day of December, which is Christmas Day holy to the honor of Christ: If
the French then keep Christmas Day on the 25th. of December, according to the
Popes decree; How can the English Papists, who kept their Christmas Day full
ten days after, be said to keep their Christmas Day on the 25th. day of
December too, according to the Popes Decree?

Thou will answer me, that the French and English Papists, did all of them keep
their Christmas Day on the same day of the month, on the 25th. day of December
according to the Popes Decree: and that the reason why the 25th day of December
with the French came to be ten days sooner than with the English, was for that
they began their months sooner by ten days than the English did, ever since
Pope Gregory altered their year. The like answer I give thee: the Jews and
Christians all of them keep their Sabbath on the same day of the week, on the
seventh day of the week; and that the reason why the seventh day of the week
with the Jews, came to be a day sooner then it did with Christians, was because
they began their week a day sooner than they did before, and sooner than the
Gentiles did, and Christians now do, and that did they ever since the Lord
caused them, after their coming out of Egypt, to alter their year and their
months, as I have showed, in the third and tenth Chapters more fully.

So that if we could agree in the true understanding of the aforesaid words of
the Commandment; that by the seventh day is not meant the day following Gods
six days of work, but the day following men's six days of labor, all our
controversies about the Sabbath Day will soon end.

Wherefore to clear, and make apparent unto all men, that this is the true
meaning and that the said words of the Commandment are so to be understood, I
have in this ensuing Tract,

First, discovered that old, and rotten root from whence this error of holding
the day of Gods Rest to be the same with the Jews Sabbath, wherever they
lived, had its first spring: and that was from a mere supposal of the Earths
superficies to be plain as a Champion field, as is showed fully in the 11.
Chap. Indeed if the Earth be pla n, every day must be the same day with all
People. Every of the six days at the Creation must be every where the same day
of the week, and so the seventh day from the first beginning of the Creation,
the day of Gods Rest, must be the seventh day of the week with the Jews in
Judea, in Ophir, in Spain, and in all other places: the which cannot be if the
Earth be round, as thou may see more at large in Chap. 11.

Object. But the days of the week begin sooner in some places than in other;
Then so may the day of Gods rest also.

Answ. One and the same weekday does not begin sooner in some places than in
other. The day which men call Sunday at Jerusalem begins sooner than the day we
call Sunday here: But they be not both one and the same day. One and the same
day is for one and the same place only. If one and the same day should begin
sooner in some places than in other, then it must needs be that either it must
begin in some one place or other first before it began in any place else,
either East or West thereto; or else that it was infinite without any first
beginning at all. Either of which no understanding man will affirm; much less
that the day of Gods Rest begins sooner in one place than in another.

Secondly, I have proved sufficiently that the day of Gods Rest could not be
the same with the Jews Sabbath Day, nor the same kind of day; and that all, and
every of the days of the Creation were far different from weekdays that were
in use with the Jews, or are, or at any time have been in use with men. To this
purpose I have showed what kind of days our week days be; and what the Jews
weekdays be; and what the days of the Creation were: and how they all differ
in kind from each other, in Chap, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And then what kind of day the
Sabbath Day must be in Chap. 7.

Thirdly, I have showed, what day the Sabbath Day is to be in respect of order
and tale. That it is to be the seventh day: Not the seventh day from the first
beginning of the Creation, nor the seventh day from any set Era, or Epoche, but
the seventh day from the time we begin the week for labor where we live, in
Chap. 8. Concerning which I have showed, why the Lord set the Israelites a time
when they, after they came out of Egypt, must begin their week; whereby in
count of their weekdays, and so also of their seventh Sacred day, they
differed from all other Nations, in Chap. 8, 9, 10. and what weeks be; and the
difference between a week, and the week: and between a seventh day of the week,
and the seventh day of the week; which last is the Lords day, or Sabbath of the
Lord, in Chap. 11, 12. And also the Antiquity of weeks, and the answer unto the
main Objection thereto in Chapters 13, 14.

Fourthly, I have showed that Sunday was of Old the seventh day of the week
with the Gentiles, and most probably was the seventh day of the week also with
the Patriarchs before the Flood; and has continued with Christians their
seventh day of the week even unto this present day; and doubtless ever will to
the Worlds end, in Chap. 15.

Christian Reader, my hearty desire is that thou, and all other the Obedient
Servants of Jesus Christ be rightly informed concerning our observation of the
Sabbath Day. Happily thou did before the reading hereof hold, that this fourth
Commandment is a branch of the Moral Law; that it is agreeable to the Law of
nature to have a day in seven to be for Gods Worship; that Sunday is our
Christian Sabbath; as Saturday was the Jews Sabbath; and that as God wrought
six days, and rested the seventh, and Consecrated the seventh day unto Holiness
and Rest, even so all Gods Obedient People should not be slothful, but diligent
in their callings on the six work-days, and rest on the Sunday according to
Gods example, and keep it Holy. If this was thine Opinion, thou were in the
right, and did hold nothing in all these but what Godly and Learned men, and
the Servants of Jesus Christ did generally teach in former time the People of
God here in England, as may plainly appear to thee, if thou read only that
Homily, which is for the time and place of Gods Worship. But since that,
subtle heads have been employed to the subverting hereof, and bringing in a
dangerous error, opening a flood-gate to all licentiousness on the Lords
Sabbath, they have publicly Taught and Published to the World, that the
seventh day commanded to bept holy, is none other but the day of Gods rest.
They would bring People in hand, that the Jews Sabbath was the very seventh day
from the Creation, and none other but that to be the seventh day of the week
with any People; and so Sunday to be with us the first day of the week. To this
end (I suppose) they would have the name of our Sabbath Day, which the Jews
called in their Tongue, The first day of the Sabbath, to be Translated (as it
is in our Bibles) not The Lords day, or Sunday, by which names Christians
(whose Ancestors were Gentiles,) ever called it, but The first day of the week;
that so People may conceive hereby (though a new name does not alter the nature
of the thing) that Sunday with us is not in order the seventh day of the week,
viz. the day following the six days of labor, but the day going before the six
days of labor with us, and therefore not the Sabbath Day here commanded; for
the rooting out of which error, and confirming all in the Truth concerning the
Lords day, I have sent abroad this little Tract. If now by thy serious perusal
hereof thou art the more encouraged to render the Lord his due Honor in the
heedful observation of the Lords day, which with us is Sunday, not for customs
sake, because thy forefathers and the Church of God ever observed the same
since theti me of the Apostles: nor for that the Magistrates have commanded us
to keep this day Holy: Nor for that the Seventh-day Sabbath is abolished, and
this to be a new Sabbath instituted: but for that God in this his Law which is
perpetual and unalterable, has commanded thee and all People, expressly to keep
holy the seventh day; give God the glory, and lift up a Prayer unto him for me
a poor sinner.

T. C.

The Synopsis or Abridgment of the whole Tract.
In this fourth Commandment there be two parts. viz. 1. The duty commanded, in
which we be to know What day the Sabbath of the Lord is, concerning which know
1. What kind of day the Sabbath Day is; and therein note There be four kinds of
days which we shall meet with in the Holy Scripture, which are these, -- viz.
the Artificial day. -- 1. Universal day. -- 2. Horizontal day. -- 3. Meridional
day. -- 4.
They differ every one from the other. The Artificial day differs from all
other 5. The Universal day differs from all other. 5. Horizontal and
Meridional days differ one from the other. 6. Which of these four kinds of days
is the Lords Sabbath. -- 7.

2. What day the Sabbath Day is to be in respect of order and tale, wherein
note 1. The Sabbath Day is the seventh day of the week, that is, the day
following the six known days of labor. 8. 2. The cause why the Jews had
Saturday for their Sabbath, was to take them off from the Assyrian Idolatries,
concerning which note that 1. The Assyrian Idolatries were their Worshipping
the Sun, and the other Planets all called the Host of Heaven: And also their
Worshipping Belus called Baal. 9. 2. From their example, all nations as well as
Israel worshipped the Sun. 9. 3. Among many means God used to take the Jews off
from Worshipping the Sun one was, that instead of Sunday, they must have
Saturday their seventh day Sacred. 10.
3. The vain opinion of some, who think that the Sabbath that is, the seventh
day of the week, must be the day of Gods Rest. 11. 4. What a week is, and what
the week is: and that the seventh day of the week is the Sabbath. Also why many
of the Ancient Writers called the Jews Sabbath the day of Gods Rest: since they
knew that it could not be that very day. 12. 5. Weeks proved to be from all
Antiquity. -- 13. 6. Weekdays had their names from the Planets, as they were
the Heathen Gods, and not from their supposed hourly Government. 14. 7. Sunday
was the Gentiles seventh day of the week sacred to the Sun; and most probably
was the seventh day sacred with the Patriarchs before Noah's flood. Also that
Christians did not, neither ought to have chosen any other than the Sunday for
their seventh Sacred day, although it had been much abused before to Idolatry.
15.

What it is to keep Holy and Sanctify the Sabbath Day. -- 16.
2. The Lords special provision to bring all People to a heedful keeping the
duty commanded, set out in sundry particulars. 17.

Christian Reader,
THis following Treatise published forty years ago, by the Reverend Author, Mr.
Thomas Chafie then Minister of Nutshelling, being now become rare, as not easy
to be met with; as indeed it was before, for the peculiarity of the notion
pursued in it, these Booksellers have, by a new Impression, recovered it out
of the obscurity wherein time had almost buried it. And we reckon their
performance herein very Commendable, and capable of turning to public good.
The discourse it self aptly serving a twofold design, partly to show the
continuing Obligation upon Christians, from the fourth Commandment, to keep a
weekly seventh day, Holy to God, partly to show their no-Obligation to keep the
same day which the Jews kept, and do keep.

The former, how much it tends to preserve and propagate serious Religion
experience has shown; and has impressed upon England a laudable Character,
compared with the greater Latitude, in this respect, of diverse Foreign
Countries, both in principle and practice, even where the Reformed Religion
has obtained.

And for the latter, it is of no little concernment to exempt some pious minds
from scruple, that seem sollicitous, whether they ought not to return to the
observation of the Jewish Sabbath.

For which there can be no pretense till it can be clearly shown that the
particular seventh day which the Jews were enjoined to observe, Exodus 16. was
(as to it is beginning and ending) the very same day, on which God himself
rested from his Work of the Creation. And that the fourth Commandment was
intended to confine them, and Christians in all places whatsoever to those same
limits of time, as Hallowed, and Sacred, which are things simply impossible
ever to be shown, or indeed that any day can by just computation for all
People, and parts of the World be found to come nearer those first limits than
the day which Christians do now keep.

Unto which purposes, we reckon what is very considerable is said in this Book.

And that the publishing of it anew is, in this enquiring Age; very seasonable,
as it may occasion not only a further search into the grounds here laid, but
also a further improvement of them.

THE Seventh-Day SABBATH.
EXODUS XX. 8, 9, 10, 11. Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it holy. Six days
shall thou labor, and, etc.


CHAP. I. The Division of the Text. The Artificial Day.
THE Lord God, who made Heaven and Earth, and all for the good of man, made man
for his own Honor, in his own Image, and to bear his Image in the World to his
Glory, done by the due observation of the Moral Law, whereof this fourth
Commandment is a part; in which God makes known unto man the special time and
day which he has destinated unto his Worship, commanding man to sanctify the
same, and keep it Holy to the Lord.

In this Text are these two parts.

First, The duty commanded, which is to keep holy the Sabbath Day.

Secondly, The care and provision had by the Lord, for man's heedful keeping and
observing the same, in all the other words and branches of this Commandment.

I will first treat of the duty commanded, and in it for our better observing
the Sabbath Day, we are to know,

First, What the Sabbath Day is that is here commanded to be sanctified.

Secondly, What it is to sanctify the same or to keep it holy.

Touching the former of these we are to know First, What kind of day the
Sabbath is to be. Secondly, What day it is to be in order or tale.


Concerning the former of these: There be four kinds of days which we shall
meet with in Holy Scripture.

1. The Artificial day. 2. The Universal day. 3. The Horizontal day. 4. The
Meridional day.
These terms or appellations, I confess, are not common; but the use of them is
needful, for the better distinguishing them one from the other; whereby it may
the better appear which of these kinds of days the Sabbath Day ought to be. And
now I will, 1. Show what every of them is. 2. How they differ the one from the
other. 3. Which of these kinds of days man is to observe and keep for his
Sabbath.


Of the Artificial day.
The Artificial day, as it is generally taken, is the whole time between
Sunrising and Sunsetting with any People.

This kind of day was especially in use with the Jews.

They divided this day always into twelve equal parts, which they called hours,
which hours were ever proportionable to the day: In Summertime the longer
their day was, the longer were their hours: and at VVinter, when their day was
not ten of our hours, yet was it twelve of theirs. Of this kind of day mention
is made in diverse places of Sacred Scripture, John. 11.9. Psalm. 104.23. Mat.
20.2, 3, 6. And the hours thereof are now called Jews hours Horae Judaicae.
; And Antique hours Horae Anquae.
, for that not only the Jews, but other Nations also did anciently so divide
the day into twelve such hours. Thus was their Dial divided into twelve hour
lines, whereof the fifth Persius Pers. Sat. 3. Quinta dum linea tangitur umbra.
will have to note out the fifth hour with them, which is about ten of the
Clock with us. Martial Mart. li. 4. Epigr. 8. Prima solutantes atque aloera
continet hora, etc.
also in twelve verses distinguishes the twelve hours of the day then in use in
the like manner.

CHAP. II. The Universal day. The days of the Creation. Why Moses set the
Evening before the Morning.
THE Universal day is, that which is one, and the same day in all places
through the whole Universe; as well in respect of its beginning, as of its
duration and ending. It is not one day at one part of the Earth, and another
day at another part; but when it begins or ends any where, it begins or
ends every where at the same time.

This kind of Day cannot properly be said to begin either in the East, or in
the West, or at Sunrising, or at Sunsetting, or at Midnight, or at Noon, as
other kind of days do. For there is neither East nor West, nor Sunrising nor
Sunsetting; or at Midnight nor Noon in respect of the World; though in
respect of the parts of the World, all and every of these may be said to be;
yet so as what is East or morning to one part, is West or Sunsetting to
another part; and midnight to one part is midday to another part; but neither
of them properly can be so said to be the whole World. Such kind of days were
those which Moses spoke of in the first of Genesis, Genesis 1.5, 8, 13, 19, 23,
31. And of which mention is made in this text and elsewhere, Exodus 20.11. and
31.17. Acts 2.20. Rev. 6.17. 2 Pet. 2.9. and 3.7, 10. Joel 2.31. In six days
the Lord made Heaven and Earth, etc. and rested the seventh day.

That these days (which some do term, and fitly enough may be called, The days
of the Creation) were such Universal days, I will endeavor to clear, by giving
instances in every of them which Moses spoke of, in rehearsing the Works of the
Creation.

The first of those seven days was such an Universal day, when it began any
where, it began every where; no where then was it no day, nor any other than
the first day.

The first things God made were day and night: or light and darkness. They were
neither of them in time before the other, but were both Coetaneous.

There was in nature before, though not in time, a mixed or confused darkness,
which Moses called (...), Genesis 1.2. which Arias Montanus, correcting Pagnin,
translateth and calls it Caligo; it was neither perfect day nor perfect night.

But when God had thence formed the light, and made it to shine out of the
darkness, 2 Cor. 4.6. and had divided the light from the darkness, so as that
they should never be both in one Hemisphere, but succeed in order each other,
which is called Gods Covenant of the day, and of the night, Jer. 33.20. God
then called that light so divided Day, and that darkness so divided, called by
Moses Emphatically (...), God called night, Genesis 1.4, 5. the full Revolution of
both which was the first day; in this division of the light and darkness, or
day and night, though the night was before the day in one Hemisphere, and the
day before the night in the other; yet in respect of the whole Universe,
neither of them was before the other in time. When the first day began
somewhere, when it was night at the same time that first day began some
otherwhere, when it was daylight; every where did the first day begin at the
same time.

The second day and the third day in like manner were Universal days. When God
stretched out the firmament on the second day, it was every where then the
second day. On the next day also, wheresoever God the Universal Worker did his
work, throughout the whole round, in gathering together the Waters, making the
Seas and dry Land, there every where was it the third day. And after that every
where was it the same third day, where God made the Earth to bring forth Grass,
and Herbs, and fruit trees, Genesis 1.11, 12, 13. no where was it then either the
second or fourth day.

The fourth day in which the Sun, Moon and Stars were made, was an Universal
day. When it was the fourth day any where, it was the fourth every where. It is
not revealed in what part of the fourth day those lights of Heaven were made;
but most certain is it, that when the Sun first appeared to the World on that
day, it was over some part of the Earth at that time, making it to be noon
there, and in all places in that Hemisphere, which were in the same Meridian
with the Sun. And that in many places ninety degrees East from thence it was
Sunsetting; and in as many places ninety degrees West from thence, it was then
at the same time Sunrising. Also that in the other Hemisphere to which the
Moon or Stars appeared, it was then night, and midnight there in those places
that were in the same Meridian with the Sun. So that although on that fourth
day Sunsetting was before Sunrising in some places, and Sunrising before
Sunsetting in some other places; and in some places noon was before either of
the other; and in some other places midnight was before them all; yet in
respect of the whole Earth, not one of them was on that fourth day before the
other: But at the Suns first appearing, and shining over half the Earth, it was
at that very instant the fourth day, as well where it was Sun setting, or
Sunrising, as where it was noon: and likewise it was then the fourth day also
in the other part of the Earth to which the Moon, or Stars first appeared; For
neither the Sun, Moon or Stars appeared to any place on the third day, which
was the day before they were made, and the fifth day was not then begun.

The like I say for the fifth day, and for the sixth day; when God made Fish
and Foul on the fifth day; or when he made Adam the last of his Creatures on
the sixth day, it was then after Sunsetting in some places, and before
Sunrising in some other places; and it was then noon in some places, and
midnight in some other places, yet all on the same day.

The like I say also for the seventh day: the day of Gods rest: When God rested
from all his Works that he had made, it was no where then the sixth day, but
every where the seventh day. The day of Gods rest began in some places at
Sunrising, in some places at Sunsetting, and in some at noon, and in other
some at midnight in the same day. For so was it on the fourth day when the Sun
first appeared, and so when it was half ended; and so likewise when it was
fully ended; and therefore so was it when the fifth, sixth or seventh day
began, or ended. It is not revealed, and therefore no man can know, what, or
where in the Earth those places are where it was Sunrising, or Sunsetting, or
noon, or midnight, either when the Sun first shined forth to the World, or
when half of that fourth day was ended, or when it was fully ended; and
therefore no man can tell, nor possibly can any find out, whether here in
England (or in any other particular place or Country) it was Sunsetting or
Sunrising, noon or midnight, daylight or night, when the fifth, sixth, or
seventh day, the day of Gods Rest began, and yet at the beginning of that
seventh day, it was either of these somewhere or other.

Quest. But some may say, why then did Moses, rehearsing every of the six days
Works of the Creation, set the evening before the morning, so if the evening
was not before the morning?

Answ. I answer Moses naming the evening in order before the morning in the
first of Genesis, Genesis 1.5.8, 13, 19, 23, 31. does not thereby make either of
them to be in time before the other; one he was to name first; and the reasons
why he named the evening before the morning, may be these.

First, For that after the Israelites deliverance out of Egypt, (and I suppose
this History to be written after that) their Year, their Months, and the days
of their Week were all changed in respect of their beginnings and endings; so
that whereas they began their days with the morning; thenceforth they
constantly began their Weekdays with the evening; See chap. 3. as I shall show
more at large in the next Chapter. If Moses now should have set the morning
before the evening, he might have seemed to dislike this their new custom of
beginning their days of the Week with the evening, for which he had direction
from the Lord God.

Secondly, Or else it may be for that they, (who were best skilled in dividing,
and distinguishing of time, as were Astronomers; such as doubtless Moses was,
who was Learned in all the Wisdom of the Egyptians,) Acts 7.22. began the day
at noon, making the evening, that is, all the time from noon to midnight to be
the former part of the day; and the evening, that is all the time from
midnight to noon to be the latter part; as I will more fully show in the
fourth Chapter, See chap. 4.

CHAP. III. The Horizontal day. What the parts of the Horizontal day are: And
which part is the former.
THE Horizontal day with any Nation, is that space of time in which the Sun is
in going from their Horizon at its rising, until it comes again into their
Horizon at its next rising: or from their Horizon at its setting, until it come
unto their Horizon again at its next setting; or more briefly thus.

The Horizontal day is the time between Sunrising and Sunrising, or between
Sunsetting and Sunsetting.

The parts of the Horizontal day are two; the one is the Artificial day, or
daylight, of which we may read in Genesis, Genesis 1.5, 14, 16. and 8.22. and 31,
39. the other part is the night or darkness, called by Clav. de Spho^r.
Clavius the Artificial night; and which in Ancient tim^e was divided with the
Jews into three watches: the evening watch, the middle watch, and the morning
watch; but after that when they were subdued by the Romans, they divided the
night as the Romans did, into four watches.

The Artificial day, or daylight was Anciently counted to be the former part
of this day, and the night the latter part, and so not only before the
Israelites coming out of Egypt, but after their deliverance did they count this
day so to begin in respect of their civil affairs, as may appear.

First, For that when the parts of this day were mentioned, the morning was set
before the night, before the Israelites coming out of Egypt, Genesis 1.16, 18. and
8.22. and 7.4.12.38, 39, 40. yea and commonly afterward too, Lev. 8.35. Ex.
13.21, 22. Numb. 9.21. though they had the beginning of their days altered.

Secondly, because at what time soever of the daylight they spoke of the night
following they expressed the same thus, To night, this night the same night,
Genesis 19.34. and 26.24. 1 Chronicles. 17.3. Numb. 11.32. Jos. 4.3. Judge. 6.25. and
7.9. as belonging to the same day, and not to the day after that. And whenever
they at any time of the daylight, spoke of the night past, they never used
such expressions, whereby it may seem to belong as a part of the day following,
but contrariwise, showing it to be a part of the day before-going; as
yesternight, Genesis 31.42. and 19.33, 34. the night of yesterday. Also at night
when they spoke of the day following, they used not to say To day, or this day,
as they did of the day before-going; but To morrow, or the morrow after, Numb.
33.3. 1 Samuel 19.11. and to morrow signifies another day. Mat. 6.34. Jam. 4.13,
14.

When the Israelites came out of Egypt, the night was made the former part of
the day, even from that night in which they had their deliverance. It was a
night to be much observed unto the Lord, for bringing them out from the Land of
Egypt. This is that night of the Lord, to be observed of all the Children of
Israel in their generations, Exodus 12.42. They were commanded after that time,
to Celebrate their Sabbath from Even to Even, Lev. 23.32. And therefore so did
they begin their weekdays also, whereby their Sabbathday was measured out to
be unto them their seventh day; otherwise their seventh day would not have been
proportionable to their six days of labor. Their year also had thenceforth a
new beginning. They must not begin their year in Tisri as they did before, but
with that Month in which they had their freedom. This month shall be unto you
the beginning of months. Exodus 12.2. This month called by the Hebrews Abib,
Exodus 13.4. and 23.15. Deuteronomy. 16.1. and by the Chaldeans Nisan, Esth. 4.7.
(which consisted partly of our March, and partly of April, being with them the
month after the Vernal Equinoctial,) was their first month thenceforth; so that
whereas before they began their year after their Harvest, and after all their
in-gathering of the fruits of the Earth was ended, Exodus 23.16. and 34.22.
which was partly in our September; after this they were to begin their year
farthest off from that time. They had then a new-year, and a new month, and a
new day, to begin the year withal. No otherwise than if the day of their
deliverance had been their birth day; for their deliverance was a kind of a new
birth unto them: The beginning of the year was then changed, for the greater
luster unto the birth of the Church, says Calvin. And the new time of the day
had they to begin their first day of the year, (for their Caput anni, or New
years-day was a sacred day with them) they began it at even at the going down
of the Sun, at the season they came forth out of the land of Egypt; Deuteronomy. 16.6.
then was their deliverance made and Sealed up unto them in the Passover. So
that although in respect of their Civil affairs they begun their year, their
months and their days as they did before, yet in this their New,
Ecclesiastical, or Sacred year, or Computation of time, they began their day at
Even. All their Sabbath Days, and all other their sacred days, and so all their
week days, for measuring out unto them their Sacred days began at the Even;
they had the evening to be the former part of the day. And this may be one
reason why Moses in rehearsing the works of Creation, sets the evening
before the morning, as I said before. See chap. 2.

CHAP. IV. Meridional day, what it is. The parts thereof, and which the former
part.
THE Meridional day is the time from midnight to midnight, or from noon to
noon with any People, or more largely thus. The Meridional day with any People,
is that space of time in which the Sun is in going from their Meridian at
midnight until it come into that of their Meridian again at their next
midnight; Or else from their Meridian at noon, until it come into that part
of their Meridian again at noon.

The parts of the Meridional day are these two, the Morning and the Evening.

The Morning is all the time in which the Sun is in its rising, until it come
unto its greatest height: that is, all the time between midnight and noon is
the Morning.

And the Evening is all the time the Sun is in its descending, that is, all the
time between noon and midnight.

Thus Christians generally now do, and formerly have counted and called these
parts of this day. If common service unto God has been done in Churches or
Colleges, at any time in the forenoon, either at three, four, six, nine or
eleven of the Clock, it was commonly called by the name of Mattius,
Morning-Service, or Morning-Prayer, and if it had been done at any time in the
afternoon, it was then commonly called Evening-Song, Evening-Prayer,
Evening-Service, or such like, though it had been done by daylight, or by
Candlelight. So also the People of God did in Ancient times, divide the day
into such parts; one whereof they called the Morning, and the other the
Evening, Genesis 29.23. Eccles. 11.6. 1 Samuel 17.16. Jer. 6.4. though an act was
done before day, yet did they count it to be done in the morning. Genesis 31.55.
Laban rose early in the night according to the Vulgar Translation, which in
ours is early in the morning. The like is said of Moses, Exodus 34.4. Mary
Magdalen, coming to the Sepulcher was before day, (...), that is, the darkness
or night yet in being, John 20.1. notwithstanding that time was counted to be
in the morning, and the time of our Saviors Resurrection was before that, yet
was it in the morning.

This kind of day, that is, the Meridional day is, and ever has been in common
use with all Christians, who do and have counted the day as their Heathen
Ancestors did before them: after midnight reckoning one, two, three, (and so
to twelve of the Clock) in the morning; and the like in the afternoon for the
evening. So we at this time do begin the day from midnight, making the morning
to be the former part of the day; and the evening the latter part. So did the
Egyptians, who were for dividing and observing of time excellent; and so did
the Romans, and accordingly so did Christians begin the day from midnight.
Aegyptii and Sacerdotes Romani a media nocte in alteram mediam noctem
numerabant diem, qua consuetudo adhuc in Ecclesia Romana permansit, says
Clavius. Clav. in Sphaerae Jo. de sacro Bos. ubi de officiis Meridian.
In like manner did the Jews begin the day with them in their ordinary and
common account of time, making the morning to be the former part of the day;
though the Jews from their coming out of Egypt began all their sacred days or
Sabbaths from the time of the setting of the Sun, See chap. 3. and also the
days serving to meet out to them their sacred days, Exodus 13.6, 7. Lev. 23.5,
6. Ex. 12.18, 19. Deuteronomy. 16.4. all which were Sabbatical days, and called by the
Jews, The first day of the Sabbath, the second day of the Sabbath, etc. for
thus they called the days of their Week or Sabbath. Yet otherwise commonly and
generally, they continued to count their day to begin with the morning as
before. Never did they begin any day of their Month, but with the morning,
making the evening to be the latter part of the day. As for instance, the day
before their coming out of Rameses, was the fourteenth day of Abib, Number. 33.3.
Ex. 12.6.18. In that night, that is, in the night of that fourteenth day, they
did eat the Passover, Exodus 12.8. and in that night before the morrow, they
burned what of the Passover they eat not, Exodus 12.10. and not one after that
till midnight was past, and the morrow come, was to go out of the door of his
house, Exodus 12.22. At midnight all the first born in Egypt were slain, Exodus
2.29. But the next day, that is, after midnight, Pharaoh and the Egyptians
urged them while it was night, to rise and haste away. Insomuch that the
Israelites took their dough before it was leavened, and so in haste went from
Rameses. Exodus 12.30.31, 32, 33, 34, 37. Whence it is evident that the evening
in which they ate the Passover, and were not to stir out of doors till the
morning, was part of the fourteenth day, and that the time after midnight, in
which they were urged to haste away, and in which they went abroad out of doors
to provide their Cattle, to consult about their Journey, and their going from
Rameses, was on the fifteenth day. They ate the Passover on the fourteenth, and
took their journey on the fifteenth day, Numb. 33.3.

Secondly, The flesh of the Peace Offering was to be eaten on the same day it
was offered, and might not be eaten after the whole evening was fully past. The
same may appear also if the offering had been a vow. Lev, 7.15, 16, 17, 18.

Thirdly, The day in which Jesus Christ ate the Passover with his Disciples,
was the fourteenth day of the month: on the same day Christ's Disciples asked
him, where they should provide and prepare for him to eat the Passover, and on
the same day Peter denied his Master, and the Cock crew, Mar. 14.30. Luke
22.34. I say, the Question demanded of Christ by his Disciples, the killing the
Paschal Lamb, the eating the Passover, Peter's denying his Master, and the Cocks
crowing, were all done on one and the same day of the month; though the eating
the Passover, Peter's denial, and the Cocks crowing, were done in the evening,
in the latter part of that fourteenth day.

The Astronomers especially, and some others in Ancient times, began the
Meridional day at noon. John of Holifax tells us, that the Arabians began
their day at noon, and gives this reason for it; Because when the Sun was made
and appeared to the World, it was then in a Meridian. Jo de sacr. Bosc. in
libello de Computo Ecclesiastico.
In the day so beginning at noon, they had the same parts of the day, viz.
morning and evening, only they made the evening to be the former part. And it
is more probable than otherwise, that when the Sun was made, and first appeared
to the World, it was then in the same Meridian that Paradise was of, making it
then to be noon there: At that time does the Sun show it self with the greatest
light, Deuteronomy. 28, 29. Job 11.17.5.14. Psalm. 37. Isa. 59.10. Amos 8.9. luster
strength and glory: making it to be Sunrising, ninety degrees from it
Westward; and Sunsetting, ninety degrees from it Eastward: and daylight in
all places in either side. Now I see no reason, and I think no man can give any
to the contrary, but that the Sun should rather thus appear in its glory to
Paradise first, than unto Spain, Judea, America, or to any other place
whatsoever. And then if so, Moses had good reason even from hence to set the
evening before the morning. See chapter 2. And then it is likely that God made the
living Creature after his kind, and Adam also in the afternoon, and that in the
night following, (I mean when it was night in Paradise, though it was then day
in some other places,) the deep sleep fell on Adam, when God made the Woman,
and that she was brought unto him in the morning. The naming of the Creatures
may be after this, for ought we know to the contrary, yet all before the next
evening, that is, before the next day, beginning at noon there.

But if any will contend, that unless there be better proofs given than
probabilities, we should not conceive the days of the Creation, either the
fourth, sixth or seventh to begin in Paradise rather at noon than at midnight,
Sunrising, or at Sunsetting. Yet sure it is more than probable, th^^ Moses
would have the evening to begin at noon. What else could he mean by the two
Evenings, which he in diverse places mentions, Exodus 29.39. Numb. 28.4.8. if
he meant not thereby the time between noon and Sunsetting, viz. the time
between the evening of the day in common use with the Jews which began at noon,
and the evening of the day in their Sacred account, which began at Sunsetting,
as I showed before. See chap. 2. On the fourteenth day of Abib, they were
commanded, even the whole Assembly, to kill the Paschal Lamb between the two
Evenings, Exodus 12.6. as it is according to the Hebrew Text; and to eat the
same at the beginning of their Sacred day of the Passover, which began at
Sunsetting, Deuteronomy. 16.6. Luke 22.14. Their taking the Lamb, killing, skinning,
and making it cool and fit for roasting; yea the roasting it, and preparing it
with herbs for the Table, all was to be done between the two evenings before
the setting of the Sun. The killing their Passover (very likely) was about that
very time of the day when Christ our Passover was slain, which was between the
two evenings; The former of the two evenings mentioned by Moses, Exodus 12.6.
began at noon, at the beginning of the seventh hour of the day with the Jews.

So Lyranus, According to the Hebrew Doctors, the Evening here mentioned,
begins from the seventh hour, for at that time the Sun begins to incline
toward the West. Lyra. on Ex. 12.6.
The seventh hour with the Jews ever began at noon, as their first hour began
at Sunrising. Masius Masius on Jos. 5.
on Joshua confirms the same also. But if any doubt hereof, let him look only
in Buxtorfius Buxtor. lex edit. Basil. An 1645.
his Lexicon, at the word (...), where he makes it clear that (...), Between
the two evenings, which was the time for killing the Paschal Lamb, mentioned in
the 12. of Exodus, had its beginning from noon at the end of the sixth hour, or
beginning of the seventh, proving the same also out of Learned Authors, as well
Rabbis as others.

CHAP. V. Of the difference between those four kinds of days.
HAving showed what all and every of those four kinds of days are, I will now
show they differ from each other.

First, The Artificial day differs from all the other three, in that it has
only day light and no night, but ends at Sunsetting, whereas the other have
night as well as daylight.

Secondly, The Universal day differs from Horizontal days, and Meridional
days in two respects.

1. The Universal day is constant and unalterable; it cannot be made longer or
shorter by all the Wit and Industry man can use, much less may a day thereof be
gotten or lost by man's endeavor. But weekdays with all People whether they be
Horizontal or Meridional days, may be either lengthned by traveling Westward,
or shortened by traveling East, yea a whole day may thereby be either gotten or
lost, and so he that was the first born may become the younger brother; as in
the Law-Case between John and Johannes: I will not affirm the story to be true,
but it will serve to illustrate the truth of what I before said, and let it be
taken as I had it.

William Douse of Portingh had by his Wife Hellen two Sons at one birth,
within one hour, and either of them was named John, but for distinctions sake,
the Father and others called the younger Johannes. When they came to be five
and twenty years of age, John the Elder obtained moneys and leave of his Father
to Travel with Sir Francis Drake, when he made his Voyage round the World.
Johannes lived at home with his Aged Father, his mother being dead; but did so
mis-behave himself toward his Father, that the Old man, by his continual
vexation became so weak and faint, that he despaired of Life; yet before he
died he heard that his Son John was returned into England safe with Sir Francis
Drake: Whereupon he caused his Will to be altered and new Written, wherein he
gave all his goods and Chattels to John his elder Son; saving only ten pounds,
which he gave to John his Younger Son, and shortly after died. When John had
heard of his Fathers death, he hasted home; but before his coming, Johannes had
in possession, and disposed of all his Fathers Goods and Chattels left. Of all
which John at his coming home demanded the possession, to whom Johannes tendered
only ten pounds, telling him that was all which his Father gave him, and
therewithal gave him a Copy of his Fathers Will; telling him also that he by
his Travel had lost a day of his Age, and that he himself was John the Elder,
when his Father made his last Will, and being possessed of the Goods he meant
to keep them. John seeing his Brothers resolution would not finger the ten
pounds, but took the Copy of the Will, and hasted to Plowden, commonly called
Ployden, the Lawyer; to him he opened his Case, and showed the Copy of the
Will, craving his Counsel, Ployden having perused the Will, demanded of John
who was firstborn, that was I, quoth John, and my Brother does and will
acknowledge that. Why then your Case is good and sure, and the Goods are all
undoubtedly yours, quoth Ployden, but yet tell me under what pretense does your
Brother claim and detain them? Why quoth John, he says, that by my Voyage that
I made with Sir Francis Drake round about the World I lost a day of my Age, and
so he at the making of the Will was the Elder, and so lays claim to all. Sir
Francis Drake, quoth Ployden, did take such a Voyage indeed, but did you travel
the whole Circuit with him? It is true, quoth John, I did. Nay then the case is
altered, quoth Ployden, and you have lost a day of your age indeed. You be John
Primogenitus, but your Brother is John Senior. This is strange, quoth John, we
kept a most exact account of every days Journey till we came home. Can you show
when or where we should lose a day? you lost not your day, quoth Ployden, at
any one Longitude, nor at one time, but by little and little. Answer me one
question, quoth Ployden, and thereby you shall make this clear your self. It is
a Problem that Plutarch has, and now is common in use. The ship Argos, in
which Jason sailed for the Golden fleece, when the Voyage was ended, was laid
up in the Road for a Monument: where decaying by little and little, they always
pieced it anew where it wore away; till in the end the whole substance of the
Old Vessel was gone, and nothing remained thereof, but only the figure, which
every where was answerable to that of the Old. Now tell me whether this ship
was the very same in which Jason sailed, or another diverse from it? And if
another, when it was changed? Sure, quoth John, it could not be the same ship,
and it was altered by little and little, and at no time wholly altered till at
the last. Just so, quoth Ployden, may I say for the day you have lost, you lost
it not all at one time, but by little and little every degree that you went
Westward, you pieced your day, and made it the three hundred and sixtieth part
of a day longer than it was, but therewithal you losed the three hundred and
sixtieth part of your day in tale; you must look to lose one way if you gain
another way. In your travel of the whole round, which is three hundred and
sixty degrees, you gained a whole day in the length of your days, but you have
lost thereby a whole day in tale. For tell me, when it was Sunday at your
coming home, what day was it then with you? Indeed, quoth John, it was but
Saturday with us, and I wondered much, why we in the count of the days of our
Week came still to a day short of what they counted here. But I pray tell me
what counsel you will give me in the Case between me and my Brother? Why, quoth
Ployden, be ruled by me and fear not: make one Voyage more, and go back the
same way that you came, and you shall certainly find again the day which you
lost, and then come to me and I will warrant your Case. Though now I approve
not Ploydens Judgment in every point, yet I say, what he told John of the
lengthning of his days, and losing a day in tale at his return, whereby he had
not lived so many Weekdays as his brother Johannes had by a day, is very true,
whether he counted the Week by Horizontal or by Meridional days. But yet John
lived as many Universal days as did his Brother and losed not one hour, or
minute of an hour in the Universal day; it could neither be lengthned or
shortened by continual travel. When the Sun came to that Meridian, in which it
was, when it began the fifth, sixth or seventh day, at the first Creation, then
did the Universal day end, and the next began both with John and with his
Brother, though they were half the Compass of the Earth distant from each other.

2. Weekdays, whether they be Horizontal or Meridional, cannot be the same in
all places; much less can their parts or hours be the same. But the Universal
day is not only the same day in all places, but every part or hour of that day
is without any variation, the same every where.

The last day in which Christ shall come to judge the World, which must needs
be on two week days with People, if it be on Sunday with some, it will be on
Saturday or Monday with some others; and on different times also of the
weekday, if it shall be at midnight with some, (not only midnight of
security, Mat. 25.6, 13, 24, 39, 50. but in respect of the weekday) it will be
at noon with some others, etc. Yet will it be one and the same Universal day,
therefore every where in Holy Scripture that time is called a day, John 6.39,
40, 54.11.24. Acts 2.20. Mat. 10.15. not days. It shall not be on one day here,
and on another day elsewhere, but on one and the same day. It will be a general
day of Judgment; not only in respect of all conditions of men, but also of all
places, they shall be gathered from the four Winds, Mar. 13.27. from all
quarters of the World. Yea his coming shall then be not only on one and the
same Universal or general day, but on one and the same hour of that day in
respect of all People. In an hour of that day the Trumpet shall sound, Mat.
24.31. 1 These. 4.16. then all in all places shall hear the Voice thereof at
that same moment, even at the twinkling of an eye. 1 Cor. 15.52. In vain shall
the Plea of any be, alleging that it is Tuesday then with some People, and it
is but Monday with us: O let us tarry till Tuseday too: or that it is but one
of the Clock with us, and it is three or more with others, and therefore too
soon for them. No, for their account of the day will not serve the turn. All
shall find that hour to be a general hour, of a general or Universal day, that
is, not sooner in one place than in another.

CHAP. VI. The difference between Horizontal and Meridional days.
THere is not a little difference between the Meridional and the Horizontal
day, as may appear by what has been before said.

First, They differ in length and duration, for the Meridional day, whereby the
Jews counted the days of their Months, and we the days of our Weeks and Months,
is in time four and twenty hours without any sensible difference. But the
Horizontal day, by which the Jews count the days of their weeks, from
Sunsetting to Sunsetting, (or from Sunrising to Sunrising, by which some
other have counted the days of their week) is sometimes in some places near
five and twenty hours; and at some other time in the same places, it will be
but about three and twenty hours in length.

When I say the Horizontal day is the time between Sunsetting and Sunsetting;
or between Sunrising and Sunrising; I mean so in all places in and between
the temperate Zones; and not in places near either of the Poles, where it is
continual daylight for many days together. From Sunsetting to Sunsetting, in
those places cannot properly be termed a day, having in it many revolutions of
the Sun, never was it in use with any People, to mete out unto them their Week,
Month, Year or Age. Men living in such places measure out their weeks and
months by Meridional days as we do. Neither is there any mention made of such
days any where in Sacred Scripture, and it is of such kind of days as are there
mentioned, which I promised to speak of. See chap. 1.

Secondly, they differ much in respect of their beginning and ending. Here in
York and other places of England, there is sometimes five, sometimes eight, and
never so little as three hours difference between their beginnings; and the
like between their endings. Whence it must follow, that every of the weekdays
with the Jews, consisted partly of two days of their month: and that every day
of the month with them, consisted partly of two of their weekdays; the days of
their month being Meridional, and their days of the week Horizontal days, as I
said before.

The knowledge hereof is very useful for the reconciling diverse places, and
resolving diverse doubts in the Sacred Scripture, about the Jews customs in
observing their feasts, as for instance, if it be demanded;

1. Whether the Israelites ate the Passover in Egypt, and came out of Egypt,
from Rameses on one and the same day; Since it is said, that on the fourteenth
day at Even they ate the Passover, Exodus 12.8. but it was the next day, being
the morrow after, viz. the fifteenth day when they came from Rameses. Numb.
33.3.

Or whether our Savior Christ ate the Passover with his Disciples, and after
that suffered Death on the Cross on one and the same day; Since it was the
fourteenth day at Even when he eat the Passover, and gave then his Body and
Blood Sacramentally, when he instituted the Lords Supper, but it was the
fifteenth day when he wrought our full Redemption, and actually and really gave
his Body and Blood for us on the Cross?

The answer to both these are the same. It was on one and the same day of their
Week, but not of their month: for it was on the fourteenth day of Abib on which
the Israelites ate the Passover in Egypt, but their going out of Egypt from
Rameses was on the fifteenth day. So also Christ ate the Passover with his
Disciples on the fourteenth day of the first month, according to the Law of the
Passover; but he was Crucified on the next day, which was the fifteenth day. In
the fourteenth day of the first month at Even is the Lords Passover, and on the
fifteenth day of the same month is the Feast. Number. 28.16, 17. Lev. 23.15, 6.
Yet both in one and the same day of their week, for the days of their week,
ever after their freedom from slavery, were, as I showed before, Horizontal
days; every of which began at the Sunsetting of the former day, at the time
they ate the Passover in Egypt, so they were commanded to begin their Sabbath
days, Lev. 23.32. and therefore so also did they begin the days of their week
called the Sabbath, for meting out to them their Sabbath Days. And herein the
Romanists do not a little Judaize, who continued the like custom of beginning
all their Sacred days, as Lyranus tells us, In diem seriam, viz. decimam
quartam, etc. On the fourteenth day of the month, in the Even whereof the Lamb
was sacrificed, and the Solemnity of the Passover began, which was celebrated
on the fifteenth day of the month. According to which custom the Solemnities of
our Church do begin with the evening of the day before going Lyra. Postil. in
Joan. 13.
Christ with the Disciples ate the Passover, and was Crucified also on one and
the same week day, which was the sixth day of the week with the Jews: which
consisted partly of our Thursday, and partly of our Friday: as their
Sabbath Day consisted partly of our Friday, and partly of our Saturday.

2. If it be demanded, whether the demand made by the Disciples, where they
should prepare the Passover, and their killing the Paschal Lamb, and their
eating the Passover, and Peter's denial, and the Cocks Crowing were all done in
the same day? The answer hereto is like the former. They were done in the same
day of the month, but not in the same day of their week. The Disciples demand
the killing and preparing the Passover was all in the fifth day of their week,
but their eating it, and Peter's denial, and the Cocks Crowing were done on the
sixth day of their week: Yet all on the fourteenth day of the month, and all
done on our day of the week which we call Thursday.

3. If it be demanded, How we may conceive it to be on the first day of
unleavened bread, in which the Disciples asked of Christ where they should
prepare for him to eat the Passover; Since the Evangelists Mark and Luke do
affirm it to be on that day: Mar. 14.12. Luke 22.7. yet the first of the seven
days of unleavened bread began not till the time of eating the Passover?

The answer is as before: The first day of the week of unleavened bread was not
then begun, but the first day of the month of unleavened bread was begun long
before. Though there was just one week or seven days of unleavened bread: yet
were there eight days of the month of unleavened bread: On the fourteenth day
of the first month, they were commanded to eat unleavened bread, and so to the
one and twentieth day at even, Exodus 12.18. From the Even of one to the Even of
the other, was just a week or seven days: but since they began to eat unleavened
bread on the fourteenth day, according to the Commandment, that fourteenth day
of the month was properly their first day of unleavened bread: and the one and
twentieth was the eighth or last. Thus St. Matthew calls the first of those
eight days in which they ate unleavened bread, the first day of the Feast of
unleavened Bread. Mat. 26.17.

The like answer is made unto those who object out of John 13.1. that Christ
ate not the Passover on the Feast Day of the Passover, but one day foregoing.
And many more such like questions and doubts may hereby be resolved.

CHAP. VII. What kind of day the Sabbath Day is. Not known when the day of Gods
rest begins.
THe Sabbath Day of the Lord is not an Artificial day, which has no night, nor
is but a part of the Horizontal day. See chap. 1. For the Sabbath Day is
proportionable unto the other six days of the week allowed for labor* every of
which has a night or darkness as well as daylight: and in which night men may
as lawfully labor as in the daylight. Joseph and Mary fled by night, Mat. 2
14. The Disciples of Christ rowed by night, and in the fourth watch of the
night Jesus went to them, Mat. 14.25. Some Countries are so hot, that their
chiefest work is in the night, and so dangerous by reason of Wild Beasts, that
their chiefest care over their flocks is by night. Jacobs special care over
Labans flock was such, Genesis 31.40. And when Christ was born, an Angel brought
the glad tidings thereof to the Shepherds by night as they were watching their
flocks, Luke 2.8. If the six days of labor which God allows Man be such as
have nights as well as day-lights, then such ought the Sabbath Day of the Lord
to be also.

Neither is the Sabbath Day here commanded an Universal day, such as was the
very day of Gods rest. For then there would have been an impossibility in
respect of the thing it self, for men to keep the same, and that for these two
reasons.

First, It is impossible for any man to know within half a year, what time of
the year it is with us when the first year of the World began. Some have
presumed to tell the same to a day: and in the Calendar prefixed to our
Church-Bibles and Common Prayer Books, suppose it to be the five and twentieth
day of March, and there the same day is supposed to be that in which Christ was
Conceived in the Womb of the Virgin- Mary; which if granted, the thirtieth day
of the same month of March, must be yearly the day of Gods Rest. For if one be
the first day of the Creation, the other must be the seventh.

Again, Let it be, as supposed so granted, that the 25th. day of March yearly
is truly the first day of the Creation; yet not a man living is there, that can
tell within three days what day of our week that five and twentieth day of
March was, which was the first day of the Creation. All the Art and endeavor
of man is not sufficient to find out whether the first day of Creation was
Sunday or Saturday, or Monday, etc. and therefore not whether the day of Gods
Rest was Thursday, Friday, or Saturday.

Let it yet be further granted that it was Sunday on which the first day of the
Creation began, and therefore the day of Gods Rest must then have its beginning
on Saturday; No man can for all that tell within eleven hours at what time of
the Sunday the first day of the Creation, or at what time of the Saturday the
day of Gods Rest began either here, or in Virginia, or in Rome, Jerusalem,
Paradise, or in any other place whatsoever, whether it was at Sunrising,
Sunsetting, noon, or at the hour of one or two, etc. in the forenoon or
afternoon. Wherefore, if by the seventh here commanded, had been meant an
Universal day; it must be then that seventh Universal day on which God Rested;
the which cannot be observed by men, because they cannot tell on what day of
their week, nor about what time of their day, they should begin the observation
thereof.

Secondly, an Universal day, such as was the day of Gods Rest cannot be
observed of all the People of God. Though it should be granted, what is of some
believed, that the day of God's Rest began in Paradise on Saturday, and at the
rising of the Sun there; yet all Gods People cannot observe that very day. For,

1. The earth being Global, and the true longitude of the place where Paradise
was, being unknown, no man can tell when to begin that day in the place where
he lives. We know when it is Saturday in some places, it is then Sunday or
Friday in some other places. We know that when Christ Rose from the Grave, it
was then Sunday at Jerusalem in the fore-noon, and we know that it was then
Saturday in Virginia in the afternoon, but no man can knowingly say that the
day of Gods Rest begins on the Saturday, in the forenoon with him, though it
be granted that it so began in Paradise.

2. Though the day of Gods Rest, (or any other Universal day) be made known
unto men, at what time, and on what day it began in Paradise; and the very
place where Paradise was made known also: Yet all Gods People could not
possibly keep that very day of Gods Rest; By reason of the diversity of
Longitudes of the Places wherein they may Live, they cannot keep all of them
one and the same day.

This has been proved unto us fully and plainly, even by the opposers of the
Sabbath. Dr. Heylin has even demonstrated the same, that men could not
possibly have kept one and the same day for their Sabbath had it been
commanded. Heyl part. 1. page 45, 46, 47, 48.
And further shows, that the Jews themselves kept not the very day of Gods
Rest, Page 125.
though they had one day in seven set apart for Holy Rest and meditation. Mr.
Ironside also Irons. chap. 18. page 164.
from the diversity of Meridians, proves that one and the same day cannot be
Universally kept, and therefore never commanded the whole Church. One and the
same day could not possibly be observed a Sabbath by all the Jews, in the
East-parts and West-parts too of Judea, and in Babylon, and in Rome, by reason
of their diversity of Longitudes. And if it be supposed to be but two or three
degrees difference of Longitude; yet will that difference make the days as
truly to differ from being the same, as will an hundred and three, though it
will not make them so much to differ. The like argument has Doctor Francis
White late Bishop of Ely Dr. Francis White, in his Treat. of the Sabb. page 175.
, and diverse others. Wherefore since the Universal day, such as was the day of
Gods Rest, cannot be possibly kept by all Gods People, no more than any other
set particular day can, it is not the day here commanded by the Lord.

The Sabbath Day here commanded to be kept Holy, is such a kind of day, as may
be known, kept, and observed by men, wheresoever they inhabit; though in many
and diverse Longitudes of the Earth. Such as might have been kept in the
Wilderness where the Law was delivered; and in the East and West-parts of
Canaan, and in Babylon, Rome, Spain, and in all other habitable places, and
therefore ought to be either an Horizontal, or else a Meridional day. In all
places of the World, none other but Horizontal or Meridional days are now, or
at any other time heretofore have been in use with men, for measuring out unto
them their seven days or week: and such as are their six days of the week for
Labor, such ought the seventh day, even the day for Holy Rest to be also. The
Sabbath Day with the Jews was an Horizontal day, but then such were the other
days of their week also: and what Nation soever have their week to consist of
Horizontal days, ought to have their Sabbath Day to be so also. In the North of
Russia, and of the King of Denmarks and Queen of Swedens Countries, where the
Sun makes many Revolutions at some seasons of the year between his rising and
setting, men cannot count their week by Horizontal days, but they do and have
counted their weeks by Meridional days. And so do all Christians generally of
what Longitude or Latitude of the Earth soever they are, mete out their weeks
by Meridional days, then such ought their seventh day of their week to be also.

CHAP. VIII. What day the Sabbath is to be in order or tale.
NOw is to be shown what day in tale is to be the Lords day, or Sabbath of the
Lord, and this the Lawgiver himself has plainly pointed out unto us in this
Law, to be the day following the six days of labor, so that none need to say
the knowledge hereof is hidden from us; Who shall ascend for us into Heaven,
and bring the knowledge thereof to us, that we may know it and observe it? But
it is clearly demonstrated unto us by the Lord God, so that he that works
with the Spade, may know the same as well as he that handles the Pen. Six days
shall thou labor, and, etc. but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God. The seventh day, that is, the day following the six known days of labor,
is none of ours, it is the Lords day.

We may not make the Sabbath Day to be the sixth day, for then we should show
our selves unthankful, in not receiving the Lords own bountiful allowance: nor
the eighth day, for then we should encroach on the Lords right, and not be
contented with his Liberal allowance of six days for our selves, reserving only
the seventh for himself, much less ought we to make it the fifth, or the ninth
or tenth, or any other than the seventh day. Our weeks are not to consist of
more or less than seven days, the last day whereof is the Lords day.

Some call this day the standing day of the week for Gods Worship, some the
Lords day, some the Sabbath of the Lord, some the seventh day of the week, and
in this Law it is set out to be the day after our six days of labor. Though
these appellations do much differ in Letter, Sound and Phrase, yet they all
signify the same thing; it cannot be the seventh day of the week, but it will
also be the day after our six known days of labor, and the standing day of the
week for Gods Worship: this is the Lords day, or the Sabbath of the Lord, or to
the Lord: and this is not only a seventh day of the week, as all and every
other of the weekdays are, but it is the seventh day of the week (...).

There is not appointed from the Lord by this Law any set time, whence men
should begin their week or sevening, for to find the Lords day: so that no
People, Jew or Gentile are tied by this Commandment, directly to keep their
Sabbath precisely on such or such a day; or to begin their Sabbath, at any set
particular time; as from midnight, or from Sunrising, noon or Sunsetting.

God separated the tenth of Grapes, of Lambs, of Corn, etc. to the use of the
Priests and Levites. As the seventh day is in this Commandment said to be the
Lords, and sanctified by the Lord, so were those tenths said to be the Lords,
and Sanctified or Holy to the Lord: But it cannot there be meant of the very
tenth Lamb that fell in order from the Damm, or of the tenth ear of Corn, or of
the tenth cluster of Grapes, first appearing or grown ripe; this was too too
difficult for to find out; but of the tenth in proportion successively,
according to the customary manner of their Tithing in the places where they
lived. No more can it be meant here of the seventh day from the first beginning
of the Creation, which cannot be found out, nor from any particular time set by
the Lord, but the seventh day in proportion successively, according as any
Nation or People do customarily begin their week, in what Longitude of the
Earth soever they do inhabit: that seventh day by the express words of this Law
is the Lords day, or Sabbath Day to or for the Lord, not of the Lord in that
sense which some take it, as if it were the very day of Gods Rest, but the
seventh day unto the Lord, that is, Sacred or Holy to or for the Lord: so do
the very words of the Text import, (...), On the seventh day is the Sabbath to
the Lord, so also in the Septuagint, (...), hereto does the Chaldee Paraphrase
accord; Die autem septimo Sabbatum est coram Domino; And on the seventh day is
the Sabbath before the Lord. Also Jun. and Tremel. Dies vero septimus Sabbatum
est Jehovae. But the seventh day is the Sabbath to the Lord. The sense then and
meaning of these words of this Commandment, The seventh day is the Sabbath of
the Lord, is this: The seventh day of the week, or the day following the six
days here allowed man for labor, is the Lords day, or is Sacred to the Lord
thy God. As we say in Tithing of Corn, wheresoever men by agreement do begin
the Tithe, that nine Cocks or Stacks of Corn are the Farmers, but the tenth is
the Parsons, or is due to the Parson: So in sevening out our days, at what time
soever, according to men's custom they begin their week or sevening; six days
are ours, but the seventh day is the Lords, it is his due, and not our own. God
has not bound men by this Law to any set time, when to begin their week,
either at the Sunsetting, as the Jews begin their week, or at midnight, as
Christians begin theirs, or at any other set time, but in every Nation, however
they begin their week, the seventh day thereof is the Lords.

It is true, that the Jews had a set time when they should begin their week or
sevening; and so had a set and peculiar time or day on which they were to keep
their Sabbath: but this they were not bound unto by this Law. That Saturday was
their seventh or Sacred day, and that it began at Sunsetting, rather than at
another time, was not by any express out of this Commandment, but accidentally:
that thereby they might be the better taken off from the Assyrians idolatry,
wherewith they and generally most Nations, were deeply infected; of which I
will speak more particularly in the next Chapter.

CHAP. IX. The Assyrians Idolatry. All Nations Worshipped the Sun.
THE Assyrians Idolatry, wherewith Egypt, the Israelites, and generally other
Nations were infected, was both the worshipping of Baal, and the adoring of the
Host of Heaven. The one was a man deified and Worshipped; the other were the
Stars, viz. the Sun, Moon, and the rest of the Planets The other stars were
honored but as subservient unto those.
whom they magnified and adored as Gods and Governors of the World.

Concerning Baal, and how he came to be Worshipped, we shall thus find in
Histories and Ancient Chronnologies.

Nimrod that mighty Hunter before the Lord, being a great and strong Giant,
began to Suppress and Tyrannize over others, bringing others in Shinar under
him, and he ruled as King over them. The beginning of his Kingdom was Babel,
wherefore he was called Saturnus Babylonicus. For the most Ancient Kings, and
first founders of a Realm or People they called by the name of Saturn, and his
eldest Son or Heir by the name of Jupiter: and his Daughter were called Juno's
Guevar. Ep.
. Thus they called his Father Cush, Cush, Saturnus Ethiops; for that Aethiopia
was Peopled by him: And his Grandfather Cham they called Saturnus Aegyptius;
for that he and his Son Jupiter Mizraim Peopled Egypt. Beside Babel, this
Nimrod had Erech, and Acad, and Calneb in the Land of Shinar. Genesis 10.9, 10,
11, 12. In Process of time Nimrod left the Kingdom of Babel unto his Son Belus,
whom they called Jupiter Belus, not driven out of his Kingdom by his Son, but
Nimrod left the same unto him, and went into Ashur, and there he Tyrannized
over the Children of Ashur, and there he built Cities also, Niniveh and
Rohoboth, and Calah and Reze^. Ninus succeeded his Father Belus and his
Grandfather Nimrod in their Kingdoms, and enlarged Niniveh, calling it by his
own name Niniveh, and much enlarged his Dominions, and became a Monarch. This
Ninus so condoled and took such grief for the Death of his Father Belus, that
for his own comfort and his Fathers Honor, he had a goodly Image and
representation of his Father made, which he had in much Honor. Others seeing
it pleased Ninus, reverenced this Image, by degrees more and more, and had
faults often pardoned for the Image sake, insomuch that at length Bell or Belus
his Image was held to be the Protector of Assyria, and so adored as their
Protector. Yet was he not Worshipped in a Temple till after Ninus was dead.
Semiramis the Empress, and the Relict of Ninus, amplifying yet more the
Dominions of her late Husband, built for Belus a Sumptuous Temple, and in it a
Costly Pillar for this Idol, in which Pillar was Engraven these words or
Epitaph.

Mihi Pater Jupiter Belus: Avus, Saturnus Babylonicus: Proavus, Cbush Saturnus
Aethiops: Abavus, Saturnus Aegyptius: Atavus, Caelius Phoenix Ogyges. Ab Ogyge
ad meum Avum Solo^bem suum circumlustravit semel, tricies, and centies. Ab Avo
ad Patrem sexies and quinquagies. A Patre ad me, bis and sexagies. Columnam,
Templum, Statuam, Jovi Belo Socero, and Matri Rheae, in Olympo Semiramis dicavi
Guevara ep. to Don. Fra. V^llo.
Guevara, that great Antiquary, makes no mention who first Transl^ted this
Epitaph, or in what language it was engraven, but thus is it from his words
Engl shed.

My Father was Jupiter Belus: my Grandfather was Satu^nus B^bylonicus: my great
Grandfather was Chush Saturnus Ae^hiops: my great Grandfathers Father was
Saturnus Aegyptiacus my great Grandfathers Grandfather was Caelius Phoenix
Ogyges, (so she called Noah.) From Noah unto my Grandfather Nimrod were one,
thirty, and an hundred years, ( note that the Chaldees and Assyrians read and
count their numbers from their right hand, as we do from the left) From my
Grandfather Nimrod unto my father Belus were six and fifty, ( so long Nimrod
reigned) My Father Belus reigned two and sixty years. I Semiramis have
dedicated this Pillar, Temple and Image unto Belus my Father in Law, and Rhea
his Mother in Law in Olympia, in the name of my late Husband Ninus. This was
the first Idol that ever we could read of to be Worshipped in a Temple. Assyria
becoming a great Monarchy, other Nations either for fear or favor had this
Belus also for their Protector too, calling it according to their several
Languages, Fascicul. tempor.
Bell, Baal, Baalim Beelphegor, Beelzebub, etc. with this Idolatry, as were the
Egyptians so were the Israelites much infected.

The other main Idolatry set up by the Power of the Assyrians, through the help
of their Chaldees was the Worshipping of the Host of Heaven, that is, the Sun
and moon and the rest of the Planets.

The skilful in Astronomy and Astrology do unanimously testify of the Fathers
and Patriarchs before the Flood, that they were the first Founders and
excellently skilful in Astrology and Astronomy; and this may witness the two
Columns which they built, the one of Brick, the other of Stone, in which were
Eng^^^en the principles thereof; that Posterities after the Flood may be
skilled also in the knowledge of the Heavens and motion of the Stars as well as
they: one whereof remained in Syria in the time of Josephus as he himself
relates Josephus Antiq. Jud l. 1. c. 4, 8. Clav. de Sphae. in Jo. de Sacro. c.
1. Snel. in Ram.
. Yea it is not altogether unlikely that the Idolatry of Worshipping the Host
of Heaven* was long before the Flood, and that men called then the weekdays by
the names of the Planets, as now men do. Dr. Hammond in his Tract of Idolatry
commends Maimonides for the soberest of the Jewish Writers: he tells us, that
from the days of Enosh the Stars were Worshipped as Gods, to whom were built
Temples; and Sacrifices were offered; After which in time the great God was
generally forgotten; no man knew the true God, save Henoch, Methusalah, Nab,
Sem and Heber, and so continued till Abraham was born. Thus much Maimon Maimon.
de idol. primo.
. How he could come to the knowledge hereof I cannot conjecture. But be it
granted, that before the Flood, when Astrology principally flourished, men were
not so wicked then to be carried away to the Adoration of any of the Planets,
yet sure enough Sem, who lived a long time before the Flood, did also live unto
the time, or near the time when the Planets were held to be the Universal
Governors of the World. Though he lived not unto Moses days, yet did he live
till Abraham was an Old Man, if so he lived not after Abraham was buried: and
this Idolatry of Worshipping the Host of Heaven, was before that set up by the
Assyrians and their Chaldees.

After the Flood Astrology continued to flourish in and about the Countries of
Shinar, but especially in Chaldea, and such as excelled others there in
Astrology, were advanced by the Assyrian and Chaldean Monarchs; However
Nebuchadnezzar would in his wrath had them to be killed for not telling his
dreams. Dan. 2.12. They were called the wise men. Dan. 2.12, 13, 14. and 4.6.
And by those who had their Plantations Westward, they and such Astrologers as
they were, were styled the Wise men of the East. These Chaldees or Magi were
held in that Honor and esteem with the Assyrians, as were the Sophi with the
Persians, or Priests with the Egyptians Boomus ubi de Assyria.
Boemus certifieth us further of them, that the Planets were their proper and
peculiar Gods, and that as Scholars now study Divinity, so did they Astrology:
and as we Catechize and teach our Children in the knowledge of God, so did they
theirs in the knowledge of the Stars; Children were taught Astrology of their
Parents; they sucked it (according to him) even from their Mothers Breasts
Boemus ib.
.

They who went down from thence into remote places, to find new Plantations,
could not apply their time unto such studies; Building, and Fencing, and
Planting, gave not them the leisure. Egypt had small knowledge hereof when
Abraham came out of Chaldea, and after that came into Egypt, and there (as
Josephus Josephus de Antiq. Jud l. 1. cap. 15.10.
and others write) instructed their Priests more fully in the knowledge of the
Stars, for which he was of the King rewarded with rich Gifts Rodolph. Snel. in
P. Rami. Geom. in prooemio.
. The Grecians were far more ignorant thereof, till near about six hundred
years before Christ his Incarnation: when Anaximander, Melisius, Thales
Melisius, Pythagoras; and in Platoes time Eudoxus Cnidius brought the knowledge
of Astrology into Greece, having learned the same of the Egyptian Priests and
Chalde^s Clavius in Sphaer. Jo. Sacr.
. The Romans grew more Ignorant, then the Grecians; the farther off Shinar they
went, the more Ignorant, Rude and Base they grew; even to Worship Beasts and
base Creatures for their Gods; which we find not that ever the Assyrians and
Chaldeans did before they were subdued and mixed with other Nations; but the
Host of Heaven, that is, the Planets were their Gods. These their Gods they
Worshipped by course Jo. Gregory in his Assyrian Monarchy. Page 203.
; every one on his day had some peculiar Worship done unto it; and the day on
which any of the Planets had his Worship according to their order, that day was
called by the name of that Planet so Worshipped. As Saint-Worshippers do call
the days of the month, on which they gave special Worship to St. Peter, St.
John, St. James; St. Peter's day, St. John's day, and St. James day: So did those
Sun-Worshippers; on what days of the week they gave special Wo^ship to the Sun,
or Moon, or Saturn; those days were called by the names of the day of the Sun,
the day of the Moon, the day of Saturn. The time of the day for their Worship
was ever the forenoon, not the whole forenoon for them all, but at the rising
of the Sun, when the first hour of their day for such Worship began. And that
Planet which came to be Worshipped by course the first hour of the day, was
counted Trump or Lord of that day.

They gave not equal Honor unto the Planets, neither were the days of their
week alike Sacred; but they had the Sun in the greatest Honor, and for their
most high God; next to him was the Moon, and the next Saturn, so accordingly
were their days Sacred, their chiefest day of the week being then the day of
the Sun, of which I will speak more when I come to speak of their seventh day
Sacred. Boemus tells us, Writing of Assyria and their Customs, that four of
the Planets they had in less esteem than the rest; His words are these, Martem,
Venerem, Mercurium and Jovem prae caeteris observari: quoniam velut proprium
cursum sortiti futura ostenderent, tanquam Deorum interpretes: Boeus ubi de
Assyria.
quod ipsum ad^o persuasum habuerunt, ut quatuor ista astra uno nomine
Mercurios appell^rent (b). That they diligently observed Mars, Venus, Mercury
and Jupiter, for these by their proper course would foreshew things to come, as
being Interpreters of the Gods, out of confidence whereof they called all these
four Stars Mercuries. And my opinion is that as Boemus does here orderly recite
their names, in the same order did the Idolaters place them aloft in their
Temples; Mars on the right hand, and Venus on the left hand of the other three
chief, then Mercury on the right hand next to Mars, and Jupiter last, on the
left hand.

The reasons moving me to think these Idols to be thus placed aloft in their
Temples, are especially two.

First, For that the Romish Church when they had got some power into their
hands, and did in Pope Boniface the fourth his days suppress the Idolatries of
the Heathen, who Worshipped their Idols in the Temple at Rome, which was
Dedicated to all the Gods, and then called Pantheon; and having instead thereof
set up another kind of Worship like unto that, even of the Virgin- Mary and all
Sa^nts; Whereupon that day was by that Pope Boniface made an Holy day, called
by the name of All Saints day, and the Temple also Dedicated to the Virgin-
Mary and All Saints, called thenceforth Ecclesia Beatae Mariae rotunda Too Val.
and Nic. Triveth. Com. in Aug. de Civit. Dei l. 2. c. 4.
. I will deliver the words of an Old Chronologer hereof. Iste Bonifacius
(scilicet Quartus) consecravit Pantheon, (id est) Templum omnium Deorum, ubi
Christiani periclitabantur a Daemonibus. Et est pulchra similitudo, quomodo
Spiritus Sanctus, ex malis institutis Paganorum scit eligere Sanctum exercitium
devotionis, quasi medicina fiat ex veneno. Vbi enim impii colebant Daemones,
ibi Christiani colunt omnes Sanctos: sic ars deluditur art Fascicul. temporum.
. And a little after; Festum omnium Sanctorum instituitur a Bonifacio quarto.
Then at that time I suppose were the Images of the Saints placed up on high in
their Rood, which common People here with us call their Roodloft, in imitation
of the Heathen. For commonly when the Romish Church put down any Idolatrous
custom of the Heathen, then they set up another resembling that which they put
down; and this did they either for avoiding the greater scandal of the Heathen,
which were then potent; or to win them the better by degrees to Christian
Religion or for some other by respect.

As the Heathen had some one or other particular Planet or Idol, to be the
Patron and Protector of some one People or other, an^ so many Protectors as
there were nations: Belus for Assyria; Diana for Ephesus; Jupiter for Rome;
Juno for Samos; Bacchus for Thebes, etc. So when that Idolatry was suppressed,
instead of these Idols, the Roman Church had Holy Saints to be invocated; and
had for Protectors in like manner. Thus was St. James for Spain, St. Dionysius
for France, St. Andrew for Scotland, etc. As the Heathen Idolaters had for
several occasions, several Gods and Goddesses on whom they called for help;
Bellona in time of War; Cunina for Infants; Segetia for standing Corn; Forculus
to keep the doors Aug, de Civ. Dei l. 4. c. 1.
, etc. So the Roman Church to win the Heathens by degrees, suffered them to
continue in Idolatry still: but instead of their Demigods, they should
invocate Saints: St. Rumbal for the Toothache; St. Petronel for the Ague; St.
Loye for Horses; St. Anthony for Pigs: St. Gregory for Scholars; St. George
for Soldiers, etc.

What were the Monks and Friars, the Chaste Shavelings and Holy Nuns, but the
Natural successors of Berecynthia's and Vesta's Priests and Virgins? Rome
Heathen had two Goddesses in special reverence, Berecynthia and Vesta;
Berecynthia they held to be the Mother of the Gods Aug. de Civ. Dei. l. 2. c. 4.
. Her Priests where Chaste un-married men; and if it happened that any one of
them could not Live Chastely, yet he lived Warily; until that Atys Tho. Vallois
and Nic. Triveth. in Aug. de Civ. Dei l. 2. c. 4, 7. and l. 7. c. 25.
, one of her dearest Priests, lived neither Chastely nor Warily, wherefore he
was caused to be Gelded Ovid. de fast. l 4.
; after which time the Priests of Berecynthia (otherwise called Cybel) were
Gelded also, and (as some Commentators on Augustine say) were called Galli, id
est, Castrati Tho* Val. and Nic. Triveth. locis praedic.
. When these were put down by Christians; Popish Priests and Friars succeeded
in their room until this time. It has been wished by not a few, that these
had been Gelded also, as were the former; for though these have lived caute,
warily; yet is it notoriously known that they lived not cast, Chastely, no more
than Atys did, witness the many Bones and Sculls of Infants, that have been
credibly reported to have been found in their Motes and Ponds Nic. Fox his
Mart. p. 1155. Andr. Willet. Synops. Pap. Controv. 5. Quest. 5.
. As for the other Goddess Vesta, Ovid and Augustine witness, and none denies
that her Priests were Virgins; that Idolatrous custom being put down also, this
of Nuns and Votaries of Chastity unto the Honor of the Virgin- Mary much like
unto that, was set up.

Now I say, these and other the like practices of the Roman Church, in putting
down the Idolatrous Customs of the Heathen Idolaters, and setting up such of
their own near alike, and resembling them, make me to conceive, that the Idols
which the Heathen Worshipped in their Temple Pantheon, and in other their
Temples, were placed aloft in a row or rank, for that the Images of the Saints,
which the Roman Church erected to be Worshipped instead of the other were so
set.

Secondly, For that, as Lyranus tells us, the Learned Doctors expound these
words of Ezechiel, And lo they put the branch to their Nose Lyra in Ezekiel. c. 17.
; thus their Idols were lifted up aloft, therefore the Idolaters reached up
Rods or branches to touch them; and after that, they put their Rods or Branches
to their mouths or noses, in reverence to their Idols. Had not their Idols been
placed aloft in manner as the Images of the Saints afterward were, I suppose
those Doctors would not have given such an Interpretation of that Text. The
placing of the Idols of the Heathen then in such manner as is before said, I
confess is my Opinion, and for the reasons before given, which if they seem
weak to any, I leave the same to his better judgment, not willing to contest
against any herein, being not a matter of great concernment. But that the
Planets were the proper Gods of the Chaldeans and Assyrians of Old time, and
that the days of the week were first so called by the Chaldeans, according to
the names of the Planets, which they Worshipped and had for their Gods, as I
before said, is not mine Opinion only, but Learned men have testified as much.
And People as they multiplied and Planted themselves the nearer to Chaldea and
Assyria, the more did they either for fear or favor, imitate them in their
Idolatries; insomuch that among the Persians none were to be Honored as Kings
unless they were Astronomers Clav. in Sohaer. Jo. de Sacr. Bosc. 1.
; neither were any to be Priests with the Egyptians but such. They all were
Worshippers of the Host of Heaven generally: and called the days of the week by
the names of the Planets, as the Chaldees did.

And as the Chaldees had the Sun and Moon in more special Honor than the other
Planets, so had other Nations also. Concerning the Egyptians, thus says
Eusebius of them. Priscos Aegyptios, cum oculos in hujus mundi contemplationem
defixissent, cumque rerum omnium, etc. That when the Egyptians in Old time had
fixed their eyes in the contemplation of this World, and with the greater
admiration wondered at the Nature of all things, concluded that the Sun and
Moon were everlasting Gods and Governors of all things Eusebius. de Praep. Evan.
l. 1. c. 9.
. So did many other Nations also count the Sun and Moon to be chief, him to be
King, and her to be Queen; Worshipping them in the form of Men and Women, and
called the Sun Phoebus, and the Moon Phoebe; him Delius, her Delia; him
Cynthius, her Cynthia; him Titan, her Titania; him Janus, her Jana (or Diana,
by prefixing the letter D. according to Nigidius quae litera saepe ante I
decoris causa apponitur, (of which see Macrobius Eusebius. de Praep. Evan. l. 1.
c. 9.
him they called Jupiter, Macro. Saturn. l. 1. c. 23.
her Juno: him Dux and Princeps luminum, the King of Heaven; her Astroarche,
the Queen of Heaven. Yet gave they not equal Honor and Worship to the Moon, or
to any other of the Planets as they did to the Sun: him they held to produce
and order all things: and all the others to be as Rulers and Governors under
the Sun, acting no further than they had Power and Commission from the Sun,
from whom they received their light, influence and power of Working. Wherefore,
as Papists say, that in Worshipping Peter, James, Magdalene, and the rest of
the Saints on their days, they Worship Christ in them, Christ in his Saints: So
the Sun-worshippers thought, that in honoring the Commissioners and Chiefest
Officers of the Sun, they Honored the Sun, who was the Lord of them all; and
therefore when they Worshipped any one of these Planets on his day, they
regarded not whether the Planet was before them or behind their backs, or over
them, or under them, or in what Meridian soever it was, but always Worshipped
Eastward toward the Sunrising, Ezekiel. 8.16. and that at the rising of the Sun
only. And such as were more devout than others, would have their places for
Worship on the tops of Hills, or at least on the roofs of their Houses, 2 King
17.10, 11. and 16.4. Ezekiel. 6.13. Esa. 65.7.57, 7. Zeph. 1.5. Jer. 19.13.32.29.
where they may adore the Sun at his first approach into their Horizon. And the
Images of the other Planets, were all called the Images of the house of the
Sun. Jer. 43.13. The Gentiles had a multitude of Gods, by which they honored
the Sun; and which they Honored as Gods from some Virtue or excellency of the
Sun. Diversa virtutes solis nomina Diis dederunt, as Macrob. shows fully
Macrob. Saturn. l. 1. c. 9.17, 18, 19, 20. 21, 22, 23.
, and that Jupiter, Mars, and all the Rabble of the Heathens chiefest Gods, had
their God-ship from the Sun.

As the Chaldees had the Sun for their Supreme God, everlastingly governing,
not only all the rest of the Planets, but all other things in the World;
whereby the World was by them held to be eternal, without either beginning or
ending; and the memory of the Creation, and of the Creator himself vanished
from among them: Even so had other Nations also the Sun for their chiefest
Governor of the World, and thus they reasoned the Case. Si Sol ut veteribus
placuit, Dux est and moderator luminum reliquorum, and solus stellis errantibus
praestat, ipsarum vero stellarum cursus ordinem rerum humanarum pro potestate
disponunt, (vel ut Plotino constat, placuisse significant) necesse est ut
Solemn, qui moderatur nostra moderantes, omnium quae circa nos geruntur,
fateamur auctorem, Macrob. Saturn. l. 1. c. 17.
, etc. If the Sun, according to the Opinion of men in ancient times, be the
Chief and Governor of the other Luminaries, and he alone Surmounting in
excellency the other Planets, according to the Virtue of whose motions the
order of all Humane affairs is disposed; (or as Plotine would, is signified) it
necessarily follows that we should acknowledge the Sun, who governs those
that govern our affairs, to be the Author of all things that are brought to
pass amongst us.

Men by the glimmering light of Nature knew that there was a God, but what God
is, natural reason could not dictate unto them. Plato when he was to speak of
God, as Macrobius relates Macrob in somn. Scip. l. 1. c. 2.
, Dicere quid sit non ausus est: hoc solum de eo sciens, quod sciri quale sit
ab homine non possit: solum vero ei simillimum de visibilibus Solemn reperit.
Sol ipse de quo vitam omnia mutuantur, etc. and in Timaeo, speaking of the
eight Spheres, he calls the Sun, Dux and moderator, and Princeps luminum
reliquorum, Cor Coeli, Men's Mundi, etc. No creature could men see which might
set out the Glory, Power, and excellency of our God better than the Sun. Apud
Priseas Gentilitatis Nationes, nil prorsus inter creata cuncta, quod mortalium
mentes in sui Venerationem alliceret, pertraheretque magis quam ipse Sol, ob
nimium splendorem eminentiamque sui comperiebatur Glos. Mag. in Genesis c. 1.
Diodor. Sicul. Ant. l. 1. c. 2.
.

Not any Nation of Note under Heaven, but adored the Sun, and had it in Honor
as their great God. For besides the Chaldeans, the first setters up of this
Idolatry, the Persians Worshipped the Sun their God: and this Idolatry
continued in Persia after our Saviors Incarnation. Sozomen shows us at large
the Martyrdom of Simeon the Archbishop of Seleucia Sozim. Eccl. hist. l. 2. c.
8.
, for that he refused to turn from the true God to Worship the Sun. And also of
the Martyrdom of Usthazar, who was the Guardian and bringer up of Saboris then
King of Persia, yet for that he being converted by Simeon aforesaid, refused
any longer to Worship the Sun, he was condemned even by Saboris himself to
die, and so was Martyred.

Secondly, the Sun was the Egyptians God, as I showed before out of Eusebius;
yea and that many years before Joseph or any of Jacobs Posterity came to set
their feet in Egypt. Irshemesh, in the Septuagint (...), was the City of the
Sun, in which was the Temple of the Sun Lyra. in Jer. 43.13.
, wherein the Sun was Worshipped, and wherein were the Images of the Planets,
all called the Images of the house of the Sun. This City was called On, and he
that was Priest of the Sun in that City in the days of Jacob was Potipherah, a
man in great Honor with the Egyptians, else doubtless Pharaoh, when he so
highly advanced Joseph, would not have given him Asenath, that Priests daughter
to Wife, as he did. Genesis 41.45. In the Bishops Translation he is called the
Prince of On. And I suppose the cause thereof to be, for that the Translators
might think him, being the Priest of the Sun, to be the chief Priest above
other Priests, as an Archbishop is above other Bishops, and such were styled
by them for Honors sake Princes: but this Potipherah in the Septuagint is
called (...) the Sacrificer in the City of the Sun.

3. The Phoenicians had the Sun for their God: and the Idol in which they
Worshipped the Sun was called Heliogabalus. In latter times those two
Emperors Aurelius Antonius, and Severus Alexander, were both of them Priests
of the Sun before they were Emperors in Rome; the former was called Bassianus,
the other Alexianus, as Herodian (c), who VVrote this History testifies. Herod
de vita Imper. Romans l. 5.
The former while he was Bassianus. and Priest to Heliogabalus, was highly
beloved and praised for his Virtues; but being Emperor he became altotogether
as Vicious and hated of the People; but most notorious did he become after such
time as he married a Vestal-Virgin; and also had in Rome, made a Marriage
between his God Heliogabalus, and the Moon called Urania, the Idol of Carthage,
but the Phoenicians, (...), says Herodian, they called her Astroarche, the
Queen of Heaven. This Emperor Gloried in this his Marriage made; affirming
(...); that it was a meet Marriage, the Sun to be joined to the Moon. This his
dallying with his God brought infamy on his name, and he is ever since known by
the name of Heliogabalus.

4. The Sun was the Trojans God, they had diverse Gods, but their chiefest were
the Sun and Pallas. As Belus was the Protector of Babylon, so was Pallas of
Troy; her Image in which she was adored, was kept in the strong Temple, or
Tower of the Sun, as the Images of the Planets, with the Egyptians were kept in
their house of the Sun: Jer. 43.13. So the Image of Pallas, called the
Palladium, feigned to be sent them from the Sun, was kept in the Tower or
Temple of Phoebus, as in a place most safe, and there was it Adored; and he
that was the Priest of the Sun, and for that Tower, or Temple, when Troy was
taken, was a very Honorable man of the house of Otreus and Brother to Hecuba,
called by St. Augustine, Pantheus Aug. de Civ. Dei. l. 1. c. 2.
So Virgil also called him.

Ecce autem telis Pantheus elapsus Achivum,
Pantheus, Otriades arcis, Phoebique sacerdos Virg. Aeneid. l. 2.
.
5. The Sun was the Grecians God, and in Athens, once the chief City in Greece,
the Court or place of Judgment was to be open, without any covering, in full
view of the Sun; holding that the Judge would not dare to give wrong Judgment
in the sight of the Sun, who was said by Homer to have (...) a revenging eye,
and who sees all things, and hears all things: according to the said blind
Homer.

(...) Hom. Iliad. l. 3.
, which to do (says Plato) is the power of none but of God Plat. de legib. l.
2.
. The Court of Judgment aforesaid had its name from the Sun, and so had the
Judge also. The one was called (...) and the other (...) and their Philosophers
for the generality of them, held the World to be eternal, like as the Chaldees
before them did.

6. The like I say for Rome, that was built by the Posterity of the Trojan
fugitives; though Pantheus was dead, yet they had their Temple Pantheon, which
continued to be so called till the days of Boniface the fourth, as I showed
before. See chap. 9. Under diverse forms and names did the Romans Worship the
Sun, as Macrobius shows, Romani solemn sub nomine and specie Jani Dydimaei
Apollinis, etc. appellatione venerantur: says he Macrob. Saturn. l. 1. c. 17.
.

7. The Messagethites, that Scythian and unhumane Nation had the Sun for their
God, though they would not acknowledge any other, as Boemus records of them.
Deum quendam, sed non Deos agnoscunt, ex Diis enim Unum Solemn venerantur; cui
equos immolant, ut pernicissimo sideri, e pecoribus omnibus pernicissimum
mactent Boem. ubi de Scythia.
.

8. The, Ethiopians, Cathaines, Tartars, and other Nations Worshipped the Sun
their God, as the said Boemus records, Writing of their manners and customs.

9. Dr. Francis White, late B. of Ely, in his Book against Theophilus Brabourne
White p. 197.
, speaking of the Pagans in general, tells us, that they Worshipped the Sun.

Now to take off the Israelites from this Idolatry, so generally practiced by
the Nations, the Lord used diverse means; of which this was one, that they
should not have the day of the Sun for the day of his Worship, but the day
before that: but of this in the next Chapter.

CHAP. X. The means God used to take the Israelites off from Worshipping the
Sun.
THE Israelites living in Egypt were deeply tainted with the aforesaid Assyrian
Idolatries which the Egyptians from them had learnt and set up. Doctor Heylin
proves out of Cyril that the Jews Worshipped the Sun and Moon, and Host of
Heaven, as in those times the Egyptians did. And to the end they might
acknowledge God alone to be the Creator; their Sabbath day was set unto them,
etc Heyl. hist. part 1.74, 75, 76.
.

It is very true indeed that Doctor Heylin says of them, touching their
Idolatries. Insomuch, that when the Lord brought them out of Egypt to be a
peculiar people to himself, God then used many means to draw them off from
Worshipping the Sun, Moon, and the rest of the Planets, all called the Host of
Heaven, whereof the Sun was the chief.

First, God gave them a special charge that thenceforth not any of them should
serve the Sun, or Moon, etc. And that if any Man or Woman among them should be
known to serve the Sun, or Moon, or any of the Host of Heaven, then the party,
whether Man or Woman was to be stoned to Death without mercy. Deuteronomy. 17.2, 3, 4,
5.

Secondly, God charged them not to speak of those Gods, or to have their names
come out of any of their mouths, Exodus 23.13. They might not call the days of
the week by the names of the Planets, the day of the Sun, the day of the Moon,
etc. as other Nations did, and do for the most part: but they called them
thenceforth the first of the Sabbath, the second of the Sabbath, etc. Insomuch
that all the Evangelists in recording the day and time of our Saviors
Resurrection, say not, In the morning of the day of the Sun, as other Nations
commonly called that time, and we now, In the Sunday morning; but, In the
morning of the first day of the Sabbath: so did they call our Sunday. St. Paul
also, though he wrote to the Church in Corinth, yet writing in the behalf of
some Jews in Judea that were in want, called their weekly meeting day, not the
day of the Sun, as the Gentiles called that day, but the first day of the
Sabbath, 1 Cor. 16.2. being the proper name thereof with the Jews.

It is true that St. John (though he was a Jew, yet writing not to the Jews,
but to the Gentiles lately converted Diod. in loc.
, that is, to the seven Churches of Asia, Rev. 1.4.) called our Sunday, not by
the name of the day of the Sun as the Gentiles called it, nor by the name of
the first day of the Sabbath, as he and the Jews commonly called it, but he
called it The Lords day. John called it not the day of the Sun, for he was a
Jew; nor did he call it the first day of the Sabbath, for that he wrote to the
Gentiles, to whom the name of the Sabbath was odious, as was the name of the
day of the Sun to the Jews; and we find not that Christians who descended of
the Gentiles, did in many years after this use the name of Sabbath in their
Writings: nor did the Jews use the name of the day of the Sun in theirs. But
John called it the Lords day, being as truly the Lords day with the Churches of
the Gentiles, as was the Saturday with the Jews.

Thirdly, the Lord caused them to alter their times which were measured out to
them by the course of the Sun, as years, months, weeks and days. Whereas their
year before began in Tisri, when the Sun was in the Autumnal Equinox; they must
thenceforth begin the same, when the Sun is most remote from it, that is, in
Abib. Abib now must be their first month, and Tisri their seventh, which was
their first before. See chap. 4. Their weeks were then wholly altered: the day
of the Sun, which was the Gentiles seventh Sacred day (as I shall show anon,)
See chap 15. must thenceforth be with them a common or ordinary work-day; and
the day which they must have for their seventh Sacred day, was thenceforth to
be that day, which the Lord pointed out unto them by Moses, that is, the day
following their six days of gathering Quails and Manna, Ex. 16.23.26. when they
were ready to perish through want of Food. Also to draw the People unto an
awful obedience hereto, and that they might not think it to be an innovation
raised by Moses* (as the Heathen generally thought it to be Cornel. Tac. Diurn.
l. 21. Trog. Pom. l. 36.
the Lord confirmed this new order of their weekdays miraculously; insomuch as
on that seventh pointed out unto them for their Sabbath, there was no sign of
Manna to be seen; and the portion thereof gathered the day before, and kept
unto their Sabbath Day, stank not. The miraculous feeding them many years after
this manner bred in them a custom of observing the week according to this new
assignment. The Lord by Moses caused them to alter the beginning of their days
of the week too, for whereas before they began their days, as other Worshippers
of the Sun did, at the first appearance of the Sun in the Horizon, counting the
first hour of their day to begin at Sunrising, thenceforth they must begin
their day for the service of God, when the Sun is furthest off from his rising.
Sunrising was the time when the Gentiles began their Worship to the Sun, but
theirs must begin at Sunsetting. Their evening Sacrifice, was their prime
Sacrifice. Psalm. 141.2. Their Feast of the Passover must be at the setting of
the Sun, Deuteronomy. 16.6. and their Sabbaths must begin with the evening; from
evening to evening were they to celebrate their Sabbaths, Lev. 23.32. that so
they may the better remember and acknowledge the Lord God their Creator and
Governor; that it was he, and not the Sun, Moon or Host of Heaven, that
wrought their great deliverance in bringing them out of Egypt.

Fourthly, To bring the Israelites into the greater dislike and detestation of
Worshipping the Sun toward the East, as the Nations did, the Lord would that
they should turn their breech or back-parts toward the Sunrising when they
Worshipped him. The Idolatrous Nations in those days, when they Worshipped the
Sun, Moon, or any of the Host of Heaven, bowed toward the East, that is,
toward the Sunrising in Honor of the Sun; but now in contempt of that
Idolatry, the Jews were to have their faces toward the West or Sunsetting; and
their breech toward the Sunrising, when they bowed and Worshipped God. The
Holy place therefore in the Tabernacle was toward the West, as D. Willet
proves Willet. Syn. Can. 9.
. And when the Temple of God was built, the house of God was so placed in the
inner Court, as that they who came thither to pray, when they bowed, had their
Posteriours, (as it is in the Hebrew) toward the Sunrising, and their faces
Westward toward the house of God.

5. Lastly, The day of the Sun must no longer be their seventh Sacred day. The
having that day Sacred might have nursed them in, or have drawn them again to
the said Idolatry of Worshipping the Sun; but that they might be taken wholly
off from it, the day of the Sun was to be with them common or profane, and
another day, the day before the day of the Sun, even that which was the seventh
from their first gathering Quails and Manna. Exodus 6.12, 13, 23, 26. The day
which the Ancient Saxons called the day of Seater, and we from them Saturday,
was thenceforth to be their seventh-day Sacred.

Yet all these courses which the most wise God took with them prevailed not,
they would not be reclaimed from their Idolatry, they were resolved to uphold
their wicked custom; not only the meaner sort, but the Kings of Judah, the
Princes, the Priests and wicked Prophets, Loved, Sought, Served, Worshipped,
and Walked after the Sun, Moon, etc. Jer. 8.1, 2. Great charges were their
Kings at, for making Horses and Chariots, which they Dedicated to the Sun; the
which good Josiah afterward in zeal to the Lord of Hosts did burn with fire. 2
Kings 23.11. Yet could he not root out this monstrous abomination of
Worshipping the Sun, but they strengthened themselves therein, insomuch that
even in the Temple of God, in the place where they should Worship the Lord of
Glory, with their faces VVestward toward the house of God, they would in a
most high contempt Worship the Sun; and bow with their breech toward the house
of God, having their faces toward the Sunrising; Of which contempt the Lord
complains to his Prophet Ezekiel, to whom he showed their great aboninations,
and greater, yea and greater than those; at length he showed him this which
outpassed all the other. Turn thee again, says the Lord, and thou shall see
greater abominations than these, and he brought me into the inner Court of the
Lords house, and behold, at the door of the Temple of the Lord, between the
Porch and the Altar, were about five and twenty men, with their Posteriors
toward the Temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the East: and they
Worshipped the Sun toward the East. Ezekiel. 8.15, 16. The Women were resolute
to Worship the Moon too, after the manner of the Heathen. We will certainly do,
said they, Jer. 44.17, 18. whatsoever thing goes out of our own mouth, to burn
incense to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as
we have done, we and our Fathers, our Kings and our Princes, in the Cities of
Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, etc. The Heathenish Women against their
time of Childbearing, sought and implored the Moon for ease and safety; the
like custom the Hebrew Women seemed to have had, who did knead their Dough to
make Cakes to the Queen of Heaven, Jer. 7.18. Of this I will be sparing of my
own, but deliver you the very words of that Learned John Gregory, as he lays
them down in his Assyrian Monarchy thus. The Assyrians Worshipped the Moon
under the name of Mylitta, which word Scaliger has well noted, in their
Language signifies Genetricem, in which sense it may not unaptly be applied to
the Moon. The reason he gives for it, is, for that; If the Moon did nothing
help the second causes in Generation, yet in the bringing forth it is evident,
for this is most certain, though every Midwife has not observed so much, that
the most easy delivery a Woman can have, is always in the increase toward, and
in the full of the Moon, and the hardest labors in the new and silent Noon;
which was the reason that the Mid-wives heretofore, (he means among the Jews
as well as the Heathen) did always in such a Case implore the aid of that
Planet, for the safe and easy delivery of their Infants; an example hereof you
may have, one among many in the Comedy Terent. Andria.
, where the Woman in the extremity of her Travel cries out to the Moon, Juno
Lucina fer opem, and this amongst others must needs be a reason why the
Assyrians Worshipped the Moon, and why they Worshipped her under that name.
The Prophet Jeremy makes mention of this Worship in the seventh Chapter,
where he calls the Moon the Queen of Heaven, as our English Translation has
very well rendered. The reason which he gives why the Women called upon the
Moon at such times, I omit here to relate, being the same which Physicians
commonly do give. The Prophet adds that the Women made Cakes to this Queen.
This Custom of offering Cakes to the Moon, our Ancestors may seem not to have
been ignorant of; to this day our Women make Cakes at such times, yea the
Child it self is no sooner Born, but it is Baptized into the names of these
Cakes, for so the Women call their Babes Cake-Bread. So much John Gregory, and
more.

Though Israel forsook the Covenant of their God, and went a Whoring after the
Gods of the Nations, chiefly after the Sun: yet the Lord was not wanting, in
affording the many means aforesaid for reclaiming them, whereof this was not
the least, in that he took them off from the memory of the day of the Sun, and
assigned unto them the Saturday for their Sabbath. Concerning which we may
truly say, that as their Sabbath Day was their seventh day from their first
gathering Quails and Manna, and as it was to begin at Sunsetting (which Moses
termed the season that they came out of Egypt) Deuteronomy. 16.6. so was it
Ceremonial; a sign and token whereby they were known to be Gods peculiar
People, Exodus 31.13. and distinguished from all Nations that adored the Sun.
Unto the observation of which seventh day, from their first laboring for Manna
were they bound, and none but they; and they no longer than till the coming of
him, of whom Moses their Captain said, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise
up unto you of your Brethren like unto me, him shall ye hear, Acts 7.37. Even
Jesus Christ who is the Captain of our Salvation: Heb. 2.10. who is greater
than Moses, who brought us out of a greater bondage than Moses did the
Israelites, and who gave us not Quails and Manna, but his own flesh; he gave us
the true Bread that came down from Heaven, that we might live through him.
After whose coming, as all other shaddows and Ceremonies, so this of their
Saturday-Sabbath from Sunsetting to Sunsetting did vanish also. The day of
Saturn was thenceforth no more Holy than the day of the Sun. The Jews might as
lawfully, with their general consent, have kept the Sabbath on Sunday as on the
Saturday. St. Paul's practice taught Christians then, that difference of days
was taken away. Unto the Jews, (says he) I became as a Jew, 1 Cor. 9.20. When
he was with the Jews he kept the Saturday-Sabbath as the Jews did, Acts 17.2.
and 18.4. and 13, 14.42. But when he was with the Gentiles that were turned
unto Christ, and embraced the Gospel, he observed and kept the same seventh
Sacred day they did, which with them was called the day of the Sun, on which
day they usually met together, 1 Cor. 16.2. Acts 20.7. There arose no small
difference between the converted Jews, and the converted Gentiles hereabout.
The Jews esteeming the Saturday to be more Holy than the Sunday, condemned the
Gentiles for Prophaners of the Sabbath, because they observed not the Saturday:
and for that they kept the day of the Sun, the Jews held them to be Worshippers
of the Sun as other Gentiles were. The Gentiles on the other side upbraided the
Jews as superstitious, for their observing their set Holy Days, (whereof their
Saturday-Sabbath from evening to evening was one) which were abolished. This
upbraiding and condemning one another in things indifferent, St. Paul speaks
against, and writes to the contrary in his Epistle to the Romans, Romans 14.5.
and to the Colossians. Col. 2.16. The Jews were no more bound thenceforth by
the Law of God, to keep their Sabbath on the Saturday than on the Sunday. The
Sabbath Day by the Lord Commanded to them, and to all in this Law, being not
this or that day, but the seventh, relating to the six days of our labor
before-going, is the seventh day of the week with all People. Now that it may
the better appear what the seventh day of the week is, and that Sunday is the
seventh day of the week with us, and generally with all Christians, I will show,

1. What some have held to be a week, in chap. 11.

2. What a week, and what the week is; and what the seventh day of the week is,
in chap. 12.

3. The Antiquity of weeks, in chap. 13.

4. What has been chiefly objected against the Antiquity of weeks in chap. 14.

5. That Sunday was the seventh day Sacred with the Gentiles, in chap. 15.

6. Why the Gentiles after their Conversion, continued Sunday to be their
standing day of the week for Gods Worship, though it had been before
Idolatrously abused to the Worship of the Sun, in chap 16.

CHAP. XI. The Opinion of some concerning weeks. How it is hatched from the
Earths supposed plainness.
IT has been the general Opinion, not only of the Vulgar, but of the Learned
also, that the seventh day commanded us in this Law, has relation only to the
six work-days of the Lord God, and not to the six work-days with men, as if the
meaning of these words of the Commandment, Six days shall thou labor and do
all thy Work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath to the Lord thy God, (so it
is in the Hebrew) should be thus: The six days in which I wroutgh when I
Created all things, shall be thy six work-days, in them thou shall do all thy
Work, but the seventh day wherein I rested, thou shall rest, and do none of
thy Works on any part of that day; but shall keep that day Holy, it is the day
of my Rest.

From hence they will have a week to be none other with any People, but seven
such days, whereof the six former days be the same with the first six days of
the Creation, and the seventh be the same with the day of Gods Rest. Weeks in
use with the Jews they held to be such; the first six days of their week, to be
the same with the six days on which God wrought; and their seventh day, which
was from Friday at the setting of the Sun to Saturdays Sunsetting, to be the
very day of Gods Rest. Though Sunday be the day following the six days of
labor with us, and on which we rest from our labor, having wrought six days
before, yet we do not rest on the seventh day (as they say) according to Gods
example; but on the first day: from Sunday to Sunday they will not have to be a
week, but from Saturday to Saturday only.

And from hence do they, who deny the Morality of the Seventh-day Sabbath teach
and write, that the boundary or seventh day of the week must be the day of Gods
Rest; and that the day of Gods Rest was the very day which God Blessed and
Sanctified, and in this Law commanded to be kept holy, and that the Jews
Sabbath only was the seventh-day Sabbath, which in this Law is commanded to be
observed Holy; and that the Jews Sabbath Day being Ceremonial, and abolished by
the coming of the Messiah, the Seventh-day Sabbath in this Law expressly
commanded to be Sanctified, is abolished also, and not to be observed by
Christians; and that since no other set day is instituted in stead thereof by
any Divine Authority, it rests in the bosom of the Church or Magistrates, to
appoint what day they please for Gods public Worship.

Though all and every of these be very false, yet are they all by these men
held to be even as true as their Creed; they little considering from how
unsound and rotten a root, these and every of them have had their first spring,
and that is from a supposal that the Earth is plain, and not round.

It is an odd, but an Old conceit of some Philosophers, which afterward was
held and maintained by the Ancient Fathers, that the Earth was not ro^nd, but
plain as a Champaign-field. They thought there could be no dwellers under the
earth which go foot to foot against us: and that if there should be any
Antipodes imagined, yet them not to be Adams Posterity, whom they held to have
all dwelt upon the Earth, and to have been all drowned except eight persons,
when Noah's flood covered all the face of the Earth. So strong did this Opinion
prevail with the said Fathers, as that whoever held the contrary, was counted
near as bad as an Heretic. Witness Vigilius whom some call Virgilius, who was
complained of by Boniface unto Zachary then Pope, and was degraded for holding
that there were Antipodes, and that they had a Sun and Moon to shine unto them
as well as to us. This story may be seen in Aventine Aven. Annal. Bar. l. 3.
, and in Baronius, who sought to cover the fact with fig leaves.

Now that the Adversaries to the Morality of this Law held all those tenants
before-said and that they all sprang from this error of the Earths supposed
plain superficies, I will next show. For the clearing whereof I need not cite
many of them, one may serve for all, being approved by them all. Neither will I
tell here all that he Writes hereabout, but that which chiefly concerns the
point in hand.

Mr. Ironside a Reverend Divine, and of singular gifts and Parts, but
overswayed by the stream of late times, does in his book called the Seven
Questions of the Sabbath, Dedicated to the late Archbishop of Canterbury
William Laud, tell us.

First, That it is necessary, not only for the Learned, but also for the weak
and inferior sort of People, to know to a minute when the Lord's Day or Sabbath
does begin, and when it does end, and that for two special reasons. The one is
for the Peace and quiet of their Consciences, which else would be wounded and
disquieted. The other is, for that unless the very day and the whole day be
kept to a minute, all the duties done on that day are lost. His words words are
these.

It is necessary to inquire of the dimensions of this day, of what duration and
continuance of time it must be Irens. 7. Quest. page 2.
. Amongst those things which disquiet and perplex the Consciences of the weak,
concerning the Lords day, this is not the least, where it is to begin, and how
long it lasts. For God requiring of us perfect and entire obedience, without
diminution or defalcation; unless every minute of time, which the Lord
requires of us as his tribute and homage, be duly tendered to him; our whole
labor bestowed upon the parts and pieces of the day is not regarded Page 126.
. It is also that which concerns the most sort of our inferior People to be
satisfied in, lest the Commandment requiring one thing, their employments
another they many times wound their Consciences, and rob themselves of that
Peace, which otherwise they might enjoy Page 127.
. 2ly, That God might have his due tribute, and the weak (if they will) may
keep their Consciences quiet in observing the true and full time of the
Sabbath, he sets down the precise day of the Sabbath (as he conceives) and
the exact time to a minute when the Sabbath Day is to begin. As for the day, he
tells us that the Sabbath Day, must be precisely the day of Gods Rest; Thus,
As Soon as God had ended his Work, he ordained and appointed, that the seventh
day, the day of his own Rest, (else he will not conceive that it can be the
seventh day) should be that on which the Church should rest Page 21.
Unless we rest that very seventh day in which God Rested, we no more resemble
his Rest, than a man that has a Ladder resembles Jacob that had a Vision of a
Ladder Page 90.
.

As for the exact time when the Sabbath is to begin and end, he tells us, that
the very minute in which the Sun is in the Horizon at his rising, is the true
beginning of the day, and he proves that it must so be, for that when the
fourth day at the Creation began, the Sun was then in the Horizon at his
rising, so that any of the inferior sort of People, he before spoke of, may by
looking in his Almanac, tell to a minute (if Mr. Ironsides rule fail him not)
at any time throughout all the year, and in any place throughout the World,
when the fourth day of the Creation, and the very day of Gods Rest, and so
consequently when the Sabbath begins. These are his words.

If the natural day be measured by the Revolution of the Sun, as all confess,
sure it is that until the Sun begin his course, the day cannot begin. At what
time now did the Sun set forth, upon the fourth day at the Creation? Common
reason will say, when he first appeared in the Horizon. The rising therefore of
the Sun in the Horizon, must needs be the first Period of the Natural day
Irons. 7. Quest. page 12. 3.
.

3ly, He tells us that the Jews Sabbath Day was the day of Gods Rest; and the
same with that which God blessed and sanctified, making no difference between
all these three. His words are these.

That particular Sabbath Day given unto the Jews, even the day of Gods Rest, is
not a Sabbath, but the Sabbath, even that which God sanctified, The Sabbath
must be the same with the seventh, or else there is no tolerable sense or
congruity in that Law. Page 70.
Whereas he says the same with the seventh, he means by the seventh, the
seventh day from the Creation, even the very day of Gods Rest; which he proved
to begin at the rising of the Sun like as the fourth day did. Now whereas some
may, and that not without just cause, doubt how the day of Gods Rest which
began at Sunrising (as he says) and the Jews Sabbath, which ever began at the
setting of the Sun wheresoever they dwelt, could be one and the same day. Since
that they, as well in respect of their beginnings, as also in respect of their
endings are Heavenly wide the one from the other: even as far as the Sunrising
is distant from Sunsetting; between both which there must be half a days
difference. And so the day of Gods Rest must begin either at Sunrising before
the Jews Sabbath day began; or at the Sunrising after. If at the Sunrising
before, that is, on the Friday morning; then the Turks Sabbath (so Doctor
Heylin Heyl. part. 1. page 48.
calls it) may more truly be called the day of Gods Rest, than that of the
Jews: But if at the Sunrising after; then our Christian Sabbath Day ever began
on the day of Gods Rest, the which the Jews Sabbath never did.

For the wiping off this, and all such doubts, Mr. Ironside tells us both at
what time, and also by what means the day of Gods Rest and the Jews Sabbath was
made to be one and the same day; which were always two before. His words are.

When God Commanded the Jews their Sabbaths from evening ot evening, the order
of the Natural day was inverted by him; not so much looking to the number of
four and twenty hours, as to the time of Isreal's deliverance out of Egypt,
which began when the Passover was eaten at Even Iron. p. 138.
, etc. His meaning in these his Words may be conceived to be this: When God
Commanded the Jews, after their coming out of Egypt, to keep their Sabbath on
the Saturday, and to begin the same at the Sunsetting of the day before-going,
that is, on Friday at the setting of the Sun, God miraculously at an instant
turned the East into the West, and so the place of Sunrising came unto the
place of Sunsetting so close, as they kissed each other, as he says, the end
of one contiguum is the beginning of the other Iron. p. 138.
. If such should not be his meaning; it is not to be conceived how he should
make Sunrising, and Sunsetting, or the day of Gods Rest, which he says,
began at Sunrising, and the Jews Sabbath, which began at Sunsetting, to be
one and the same.

Fourthly, and lastly; He tells us that the observation of the Sabbath is
abrogated; this error is strong with him, because the Jews Sabbath Day is
abrogated; he thinking no difference to be made between the Jews Sabbath Day,
and the Sabbath day here in this Law Commanded to be kept Holy; whereas they
differ, as does the species from its Genus. And from hence he infers that it
wholly rests in the power of the Church, and Magistrates to appoint the time
for Gods public Worship. His words are these.

The observation of that Sabbath which is pretended to have been Commanded Adam
in Paradise, is abrogated by Christ, as he is the Messiah, even that day on
which God Rested, and which he Sanctified Iron. pa. 12.
. The Letter of the Law of Moses being wholly Ceremonial, it must be, that the
determinate time of Cessation from Works, together with the manner, in regard
of the strictness thereof is wholly left to the power, and wisdom of the
Church, and Magistrate page 225.
. Now if any reasonable man will weigh these tenets of Mr. Ironside, he may
plainly perceive that they, and every of them do flow from the supposal of the
Earths plainness. If this be true, so must the other: and if false, then so
must all, and every of the other be false also: they all either stand, or fall
together: and so will their contraries also, issuing from the Earths roundness.
For,

Let it be granted that the Earth is plain, all these following will be true
and not otherwise.
1. There is but one Horizon to all Nations and places.

2. The Sun was in the Horizon at his rising, when on the fourth day of the
Creation he first appeared, and began his course for that day.

3 The rising of the Sun in the Horizon, was the first period of the fourth
day, and of the seventh day, the day of Gods Rest.

4. Men who can tell exactly, when it is Sunrising with them, may tell to a
minute when the day of Gods Rest does begin with them in any place.

5. Every weekday is the same day in all places, all having the same
Sunrising.

6. The seventh day, even the day of Gods Rest, is the seventh day of the week
with all People, as well in Dublin, Salisbury, Jerusalem, Virginia, Japan, as
in all other places, all having the same Horizon. Though the day of the coming
of the Son of Man in Glory be unknown, and likewise the hour, whether at
midnight, or at the Cock-crowing, or at the day-dawning; yet if it shall be on
the Saturday with some, it shall be on the Saturday with all; and if it be at
midnight with some, it shall be at midnight with all; or if at the
Cock-crowing or at the day-dawning with some, then so shall it be with all.

7. As the seventh day from the Creation, even the day of Gods Rest, is the
Saturday, that is, the seventh day of the week with all People, so be all the
six days of the Creation, the same with the six days of the week with all
People.

8. The seventh day which God blessed and sanctified, and commanded in this Law
to be kept Holy, was the very day of Gods Rest, which (after God had inverted
the day, turning morning into evening) came to be the same day with the Jews
Sabbath where ever they dwelt; and began at Sunsetting in all places wherever
the Jews abode, as in Arabia Jerusalem, Babylon, Room, Spain, Ophyr, and in all
other places, where the Jews had never any abiding place; for all places having
one and the same Horizon, must have their day to be one and the same, and to
begin at one and the same time.

9. The Jews had not rested on the seventh day according to Gods example, had
they not rested on that very seventh day on which God Rested.

10. The Jews Sabbath day, being the day of Gods Rest, and the day which God
appointed by this Law to be kept Holy, is wholly abolished, and abrogated by
the coming of the Messiah, and no other day is commanded by the Lord instead
thereof, therefore it now rests in the power of the Church and Magistrates to
appoint what day they please for Gods public Worship.

If the Earth be plain, all and every one of the ten before-going are true; but
if round they must be all false.

Let it be granted that the Earth is round, all these following will be true,
and not otherwise.
1. Every Nation and place have a several Horizon differing from other.

2. The Sun when he first appeared, was directly over some part of the Earth or
other, and shone most gloriously on half the Earth; making it to be noon then
in the place under him, and in all places of the same Meridian. The Sun cannot
properly be said to be then in the Horizon, unless it be meant to some
particular place or other; as in the Horizon to London etc.

3. The first period of the fourth day, and so of the day of Gods Rest, was
noon in some places, and one, two, three, etc. of the Clock in the afternoon in
some, and eight, nine, ten, etc. of the Clock in the forenoon in some other
places.

4. The wisest man on Earth cannot tell, either at York, or at Rome, or at any
other place, the just time when the day of Gods rest did or does begin, within
eleven hours of our day.

5. As People are distant in place, so have they different Horizons, and as
their Horizons differ, so do their weekdays from being the very same.

6. The day of Gods Rest, which is the seventh day from the Creation, is the
same Universal day with all People, but it cannot be the same day of the week
with all People. If the day of Gods Rest be Saturday with some, it must needs
be Friday or Sunday with some other People. So likewise the time of Christ's
coming to Judge the World, if it be on the Saturday with some, it will not be
on the Saturday with all, but on the Sunday or Friday with some others, also if
it be at midnight with some, it shall be at Cock-crowing with other some, and
at day dawning with some others, but it will not be at midnight with all: nor
at Cock-crowing, nor at day-dawning with all.

7. As the day of Gods Rest cannot be the Saturday, nor the seventh day of the
week with all People: so cannot the six days of the Creation, be the same with
the six days of the week with all People.

8. The seventh day which God Blessed and Sanctified, and Commanded in this Law
to be kept holy, was not the day of Gods Rest. For this cannot any where be
known when it begins or ends, and if it should be known, yet all Gods
People in all places could not keep the same, though they had never fallen by
Adam. And whether there was or was not an inversion of the day made as
aforesaid, yet the day of Gods Rest could not be the same day with, the Jews
Sabbath: for this they did or might keep from Sunsetting to Sunsetting, in
Arabia, Jerusalem, Babylon Rome, Spain, Ophyr, and in all other places of their
abode: but the day of Gods Rest they did not, nor possibly could they keep the
same from Sunsetting to sunsetting, in all places where any of them had their
abode, unless the surface of the Earth had been played, and not round

9. The Jews neither did, nor could keep that very seventh day on which God
Rested, in all places, as has been showed. But as we according to Gods
example, work six days, and rest the seventh, so did they. As the Sunday with
Christians was ever the day following their six days of labor, so was the
Saturday with the Jews.

10. The Jews Sabbath Day was not the day of Gods Rest, as has been showed.
Neither as it was the Saturday, their seventh from their first gathering Quails
and Manna: Nor as it began at the setting of the Sun, was it directly by this
Law Commanded to any. In these respects it was Ceremonial and abolished. That
which is expressed in this Commandment, they and all else are still bound to;
which is, that having wrought the six days of labor, they rest on the seventh
day according to Gods example, and keep it holy to the Lord. From this neither
they nor any else living is freed. It is Gods Law, it will be great impiety,
and intrenching into the Prerogative of the most high God, for any Persons
whatsoever, and under any pretense soever, to seek the alteration or change
hereof: or to set and appoint any other day for Gods public Worship, in the
stead of that which he himself has set and appointed.

If the Earth be round, all and every one of the ten beforegoing are true; but
if plain, they all must needs be false.

I Having now showed the Opinion of the most concerning weeks, and the ground
from whence that and many other errors sprang, among which this is none of the
least; That the day of Gods rest, the precise seventh day from the beginning of
the Creation, was the seventh day, which God Commanded his Church in this Law
to keep Holy, as if the seventh day which God Blessed and Sanctified, and
commanded us in this Law should not relate to the six days labor of the week
in use with men where they live, but to the six first days of the Creation, and
so should be with People wherever they dwell, the very day of Gods Rest; from
whence all our many and great contentions about the Sabbath have been raised
and fostered: I will in the next show what weeks are.

CHAP. XII. What a Week is. The Seventh day of the Week is the Lords day.
A Week is the space of time made by seven whole days without intermission.

By seven days, I mean seven such days as are all of one and the same kind. If
any of them be Horizontal days, they are all to be Horizontal days, such as
were the seven days of the Week with the Jews. And if any be Meridional, they
are all to be Meridional days, as are the days of the week with Christians. The
Jews Sabbath, or seventh day was from Sunsetting to Sunsetting; therefore so
should the six days of their week be also. The six days of our week are from
midnight to midnight, and therefore the seventh is not to be from Sunsetting
to Sun setting, but from midnight to midnight also. The seventh day must
relate to the six days before-going. The seventh day, which was the day of Gods
Rest, cannot relate to the six days of work with any People: Nor can the
seventh day of the week with any People relate to the six days of Gods Work at
the Creation; these were not of the same kind of days with the weekdays that
now are, or at any time heretofore have been, or can be in use with men, as I
have already fully proved. See Chap. 5.

That seven whole days without intermission from any time, as from Sunday to
Sunday, or from Saturday to Saturday, or from Monday to Monday is a week may
appear. First, From the several names and appellations by which a week is
called with People of several Tongues and Languages. Our Ancient Saxons, and we
from them call it Sennight; and two such weeks fortnight; that is, seven
nights, and fourteen nights. The Romans called it Septimana; that is, seven
mornings, taking the morning for the whole day, as the Saxons did the night.
With the Greeks it was called (...), which is defined to be Intervallum septem
dierum: That is, seven day^. The Hebrews called a week not seven nights, as the
Saxons did, nor seven mornings, as the Romans did, but as the Greeks did (...)
seven days, or (...) that is, a seveny of days.

Secondly, Frequently in Holy Scripture, seven days from any set time is
counted a week. Laban bade Jacob fulfill her her week: Genesis 29.27. meaning the
seven days of Leas Marriage; Such was the usual time for Marriage-feasts in
those days. Judge. 14 10, 12. If a Woman was at any time delivered of a
Man-child she was to be unclean seven days; or a week: but if she was delivered
of a Maid-child, L^v. 12.2, 5, she was to be unclean (...), that is, two weeks:
And so is it in our last Translation. The Lord appointed the Jews to count for
their feast of Pentecost called their feast of Weeks, thus; On the morrow after
the First Day of the Passover (which never fell on the same day of the week two
years together) shall thou number unto thee seven weeks, Levit. 23.11, 15, 16.
Deuteronomy. 16.9. So that it is evident, that these their weeks for meting out unto
them their Feast of Pentecost, began from different times, or days of their
Sabbatical week.

Thirdly, seven days so succeeding each other, as that their boundary be the
seventh day, every indifferent man will grant to be a week. But such may be
from any set time, or day. Such were the seven days of unleavened bread: they
began sometimes on Monday, and sometimes on Tuesday, and sometimes on other
days, and never two years together on one and the same day of the Jews
Sabbatical week. Yet were those seven days a week with them, even their week of
Sweet Bread; the boundary whereof was the seventh day. Lev. 23.8. Deuteronomy. 16.8.
Exodus 12.16. There is no difference made either in respect of Letters, Vowels,
or Accents between the seventh day of the week of sweet Bread before-said, and
the seventh day of their Sabbatical week, which with them was the Sabbath Day
of the Lord. The like is to be said of the weeks appointed to their Priests for
their judgment in the case of Leprosy, Lev. 13.5.27. And of the weeks of
Daniels mourning, Dan. 10.2, 3. By all which it is clear that a week is seven
days succeeding each other from any set time, or day: and that if the first day
thereof be known, the seventh day of the same will be known also.

Next, We are to know what the seventh day of the week is, being the day here
in this Law commanded to be kept Holy.

There is much difference between a seventh day and the seventh day. Every day
of a week is a seventh day; but only the boundary thereof is the seventh day of
that week. In like manner, there is much difference between the seventh day of
a week, and the seventh day of the week. The seventh day from the birth of a
Child is the seventh day of a week, and the boundary thereof; then was the
Child a week Old. The last day of the week of unleavened-bread was the seventh
day of a week; and so was the seventh day appointed to the Priest in the case
of Leprosy, as before was showed; but it was not the seventh day of the week,
of the week whose boundary is Sacred, and Commanded to be kept Holy. This week
is the week (...), it has some excellency in it, which other weeks have not:
and that in respect of its Use, Constancy and Universality.

First, It is more excellent than other weeks, in regard of its excellent use;
which is to measure out to men, what days are common, and what are Sacred:
which are their six days in which they may work, and which is the Lords day in
which they may not work; according to the Lords own standard held out unto us
in this Law. Six days shall thou labor etc. But the seventh day is the Sabbath
of the Lord thy God, etc. God by this Law tyeth no Nation to a set hour, or
time when to begin their week: nor by what names they should call the days of
their week. But he tyeth all Nations that at what time s^ever they begin the
week, they work not on the seventh day, but Sanctify it: It is the Lords. All
other weeks are for use inferior to this. Other weeks may for to show the just
time for payments of moneys, weekly or monthly billeting of Soldiers, taking
of journeys, and for a thousand other reckonings in Civil affairs, but all
inferior in use unto this.

Secondly, Other weeks are more inconstant than this, they vary in one and the
same place, or else continue but a short time. The weeks of Sweet Bread varied
every year with the Jews, like as their Passover did, which never fell on the
same weekday two years together, but were as unconstant as the Moon. Weeks for
payments of moneys, billeting Soldiers, etc. are of short continuance. Of
those that do use them, seldom or never do all of the same City or Town begin
them at the same time; Whereas weeks in use for pointing out the seventh day
Sacred are constant.

Thirdly, Other weeks are not generally in use with all. All do not billet by
the week, nor pay, nor receive wages by the week, neither do men generally make
their reckonings and Accounts by weeks. But weeks for measuring out the six
days of labor, and the seventh day Sacred, have been in use with all People
and Nations of any note and fame, not only with Christians and Jews, but also
with Turks and Heathen Nations. Though the week was not the same with them all,
and therefore their seventh day Sacred could not be the same with all; yet all
had seven days to the week, and all had the seventh day of their week Sacred.
The Turks seventh Sacred day with them called Algama is on our Friday, because
on that day Mahumet fled from Mecha to Jethrib Twiss. page 119.
. The Jews kept their seventh Sacred day on our Saturday, beginning the same on
Friday at the setting of the Sun, because at that time the Israelites first
began their six days of gathering Quails and sustenance; as may appear in Exodus
16. And because at that time of the day their deliverance out of Egypt was
assured and Sealed unto them, Deuteronomy. 6.6. and also for the Lord Commanded them
to do so. Lev. 23.32. And Christians keep their seventh day Sacred on the
Sunday, beginning the same with the morning; chiefly for that our Lord and
Savior at Jerusalem made his glorious Resurrection on the Sunday morning. The
Gentiles also had the Sunday for their seventh Sacred day, though they kept it
Sacred in honor of the Sun, of which I shall say more anon. See chap. 15. In
these respects this week may truly be said to be more excellent than all other,
and the boundary thereof to be not only the seventh day of a week, but the
seventh day of the week.

CHAP. XIII. The Antiquity of Weeks proved.
THE Antiquity of weeks may be gathered.

First, From that it has been the general practice of most Nations, to have
just seven days to the week: and every particular day of the week to bear the
name of the same Heathenish God, or Planet with them all; even with those
Nations between whom there was no commerce or traffic; and were unknown the
one to the other. How can it be conceived, that many Nations should have
neither more nor less than seven days to the week, and to have the day of the
Sun to be Sunday with them all, and the day of the Moon to be Monday with all,
and so every weekday to be the same with them all, (except with the Jews and
Turks, who only as far as I can read of, altered their week, the Jew beginning
the same on the Sunday, and the Turk on the Saturday, for the reasons before
given) had not their Ancestors (before ever they were dispersed, far from the
Land of Shinar and Assyria) under the Assyrian Monarchy, in the time the
Planets were held the Gods of the World, so counted the week, and called every
weekday by the name of the same Planet, as now generally we do.

They who shall be alive in America three hundred years hence, and see there so
many Notions of different Tongues, and all to have just seven days to the week,
and all to have Sunday for their seventh Sacred day and call every of their
other weekdays alike, will they not say or conceive that this could never have
so happened, had not their Ancestors in Europe observed weeks, and had just so
many days to the week, and call every day of the week by the same names before
ever they removed thence, and were dispersed into so many and various
Plantations in America? The like may we well conceive of the Ancient Saxons,
Romans, Egyptians, and other Ancient Nations, that it could never so have
happened, that every of them should have weeks, and just seven days to the
week, and every weekday to be called by the name of the same Planet with them
all, had not their Ancestors under the Assyrian Monarchs, who first set up the
Idolatry of Worshipping the Planets, observed seven days to the week, and
called the weekdays by the same names of the Planets, before they came to be
Planted abroad in several Nations.

Secondly, Adam at first had no other measure to mete out his Age and time, but
days and weeks. These be had from the Lords Standard, who having wrought six
days and rested the seventh, did Sanctify the seventh day. Adam knew all
Creatures at the first sight of them, and gav^ names to the Creatures suitable
to their Natures. He knew them to be not Eternal, nor a year old, and therefore
might as well know their Age to a day. When the Lord brought Eve unto him he
knew her by sight. He knew she was not three days, nor a day Old. He knew that
she was made of him, and on the same sixth day in which he himself was made;
and that the Lord on the next day rested from his Works of Creation. By this
Pattern and Standard of the Lord, he might mete out time by weeks before he
could have any Experimental knowledge of months and years, which were afterward
in time gotten by observation of the course of the Sun and Moon. And we find,
that in Ancient times there was much difference and variation in the count of
years and months with People: Some had but three months, some ten, the Jews had
sometimes twelve, and sometimes thirteen months to the year. Their months did
also much differ for length, but never was the week counted to be more or less
than seven days with any People.

Thirdly, From the Testimony of sundry Learned and Pious Writers. Chrysostom
thus, Jam hinc ab initio doctrinam hanc nobis insinuat Deus, erudiens in
circulo hebdomadae diem unum integrum segregandum, and reponendum ad
spiritualem operationem Christ Homil. 10. in Genesis
.

Aug. Steuchius on Genesis speaking of the seventh day, affirms it to be in omni
aetate inter omnes Gentes, venerabilis and sacer.

Beda in his Hexameron testifies that the rest of the seventh day semper
celebrari solebat.

They who compiled the Book of Homilies, tell us, That it is according to the
Law of Nature to have a time, as one day in the week, wherein we ought to rest
from our Lawful works Hom. for the time of Prayer.
.

Mercer commended by Dr. Heylin for a Learned Protestant Heyl. part. 1. page 5.
, is of opinion, that the first Fathers being taught of God, keep the seventh
day Holy.

Philo Judaeus also makes this challenge, Quis sacrum illum diem per singulas
hebdomadas recurrentem non honorat Phil. de vita Mos. l. 2.

Fourthly, From the Testimony of Ancient Heathen Poets such as Homer, Hesiod,
Callimachus and Linus, who have spoken very Laudably of the Creation of the
seventh day Clem. Alex. Strom. l. 5.
. This knowledge of the Creation, and of the seventh day, and consequently of
the count of days by sevens or weeks, they could not have but by Tradition, or
from the Books of Moses. From the Books of Moses doubtless they had it not, for
they were not Extant in the Greek Tongue, until Ptolomie prevailed to get
seventy two Seniors of the Jews to turn them into Greek, which was many hundred
of years after Homer. While as the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah flourished, the
Gentiles could never get the least parcel of Sacred Scripture. The Jews counted
it to be an high Profanation of the Books of Moses, if they were any ways
Communicated to the Heathen. John Gregory plentifully shows and proves, that
before this interpretation was made by the said 72 Seniors, the Heathen had no
light from the Books of Moses Jo. Greg. discourse of the seventy, etc.
. If it should be supposed that the Poets got the knowledge of the seventh day
from the Books of Moses, then must it be the Jews Satturday-Sabbath which they
spoke so Laudably of; but they knew that to be an Holy day with them no
Antienter than Moses, Septimum diem more Gentis Sabbatum appellatum in omne
aevum jejunio sacravit Moses; The seventh day with that Nation called the
Sabbath Moses made a perpetual Holy day, says Trogius Jo. Greg. discourse of
the seventy, etc.
; Trog. l. 36.
for which supposed Innovation brought in by Moses, the Heathen generally
envied them, and their Poets wrote very disgracefully of them about their
Sabbath Day. It was not then from Moses, but by Tradition, that they had the
knowledge of the Creation and of the seventh day.

Fifthly, Gomarus, who with all his might opposed the Morality of the Sabbath
day, does yet acknowledge, that Adam, Methuselah, Sem and Abraham, had
knowledge of the Creation and of the seventh day Gomar. de Sab. p. 113.
; And why not Moses also, and thousands beside them? Moses indeed had a full
knowledge by Divine Revelation, and infallible Inspiration by the Holy Ghost,
which guided him in the Historical Relation of the Creation of all things and
of the day of Gods Rest, as well as of other things related in his Books, yet
questionless he had some general knowledge by Tradition of most things he wrote
of, as they were delivered from Father to Son unto his days. It would have been
a very wild conceit of Gomarus to think, when he wrote that the knowledge of
the Creation and of the seventh day, came from Adam to Methuselah, and from him
to Sem, and from Sem to Abraham, that the knowledge there of was intailed to
the Heirs Male, or to some Persons in a lineal descent from Noah to Abraham,
and not to others also. Incredible is it, that Noah should teach the knowledge
thereof to Sem only, and not to Cham and Japhet too; and that Sem should reveal
the same to Arphaxad only, keeping it as a secret from all other his Sons and
Daughters: and that Arphaxad should do the like unto Sala, and he to H^ber, and
he to Peleg, and he to Reu, and he to Serug, and he to Nahor, and he to Terah,
and he to Abraham: and that none of them should impart that knowledge to any
other of their Sons and Daughters: and that the remembrance, as well of the
seventh day, as of the Creation, was wholly extinct with Abraham. Without all
peradventure Cham and Japhet, and their Posterities had and retained the
knowledge thereof for many generations; some of them to the days of the
before-named Poets, and long after too. Orpheus, Eschylus, Aratus, Pindarus,
Epicharmus, and others mentioned by Clemens, could else never have spoken so
truly of Jehovah, (whom they called Jove,) as he relates them to have done (d).

Sixthly; Clem. Alex. Strom. l. 5.
From the Testimony of those who have been the chief Writers against the
Sabbath.

1. Mr. Ironside professes that he makes no question, but that the Heathen
who never heard of a seventh-day Sabbath, have weeks as well as months and
years Irons. chapter 4.
. But he thinks they had the knowledge hereof by the subdivision of months, as
if knowing most of our months to consist of one and thirty days, by subdividing
them there must be just seven, rather than eight days to the week. And a little
after, It is true, says he, that Clemens Alexandrinus brings many Authorities
out of Homer, Hesiod and Callimachus, to prove that the very Heathen know that
the seventh day was to be kept holy Irons chapter 9.
; which they could not know or do without the observation of weeks, but herein
he holds them to be Thieves of Holy things, having stolen this light out of
Moses writings, which they had Translated: Whereas the Heathen had not Moses
books Translated, hundreds of years after Homer, as I before showed; concerning
which I referr the Reader to that Learned Discourse of John Gregory of the
seventy Interpreters.

2. Dr. Heylin in his History of the Sabbath, and in the second part, tells us,
That Christians of the first Ages called the days of the week according as they
found the time divided, and that we retain those names amongst us (whereat some
a e become offended) which were commended to us by our Ancestors, and to them
by theirs Heyl. Part. 2. page 61.
He shows out of Polydore Virgil, that Pope Sylvester hating the name and
memory of the Gentile Gods, (by whose names they called the weekdays gave
order that the days should be called by the name of Feriae, and the distinction
to be made by Prima feria, Secunda feria, etc. And out of Honorius
Augustodunensis, that the Hebrews call their days, (he means their weekdays)
the first of the Sabbath, etc. The Pagans thus; The day of the Sun, the day of
the Moon, etc: And Christians thus; The Lords day, Feria Prima, etc. Page 62.
. He says further, That they are more nice than wise, who out of a desire to
have all things new, would have new names for every day (of the week he
means) or call them as sometimes they were, The first day of the week, the
second day of the week, etc. and all for fear lest it be thought that we do
still adore those Gods whom the Gentiles Worshipped. St Augustine as it seems,
had met with some this way affected, and thus disputes the Case with Faustus
Manichaeus. The Gentiles (says the Father) gave unto every day of the week the
name of one or other of their Gods: and so they did also unto every m^neth. If
then we keep the name of March and not think of Mars, why may we not preserve
the day of Saturn and not think of Saturn? Dr. Heylin adds, Why may we then
not keep the name of Sunday, and not think of Phoebus or Apollo, or by what
other name soever the old Poets call him Heyl part 2. Page 63.
.

3. Dr. Francis White, late Bishop of Ely, who has also written against the
Morality of the Sabbath, does yet acknowledge one day in seven for Gods
Worship, to be most agreeaable to reason Dr. White de Sab. page 90. 107, 151.
which presupposes weeks to be from the beginning unless men were then void of
reason.

4. Gomarus also, who has stoutly written against the Sabbath, does confess
that Methuselah, Sem and Abraham, retained the knowledge of the Creation, and
of the seventh day Gomar. de Sab. p. 113.
, though he will at no hand grant that they keep it holy, yet their retaining
the memory and knowledge of the seventh day, proves them to have observation
of weeks.

Seventhly, they who compiled the book of Homilies, tell us, That it is
according to the Law of Nature to have a time, as one day in the week, wherein
we ought to rest from our lawful works Hom. for the time of Prayer.
; but this could never be done without the observation of weeks.

Lastly, Dr. Twisse shows and proves, that the distinction of time by weeks,
was observed by the Gentiles from all Antiquity, and confirms the same out of
many Learned Writers, to whose book of the Moraltty of the fourth Commandment I
referr the Reader, and therein chiefly to these pages, 12, 13, 15, 59, 60, 63,
77, 78, 151, 152, 153, 189, 199, 200, 208. to 214. As also to Rivetus, de
Origin Sabbati, and therein chiefly to the pages, 15, 16, 63, 64. 65, 66. to
81.

CHAP. XIV. Objection against Antiquity of Weeks answered. The hourly
Government of the Planets is feigned.
THere may be many who have published abroad to the World, that there is a
certain hourly Rule or Government which the Planets have given them of the
Creator, by which every of them successively, and in a vicissitude, does govern
his hour according to this common distich, Cynthia, Mercurius, Venus, and Sol,
Mars, Jove, Satur,
Ordine retrogrado sibi quivis vendicat horam.


Hence they say, that until this hourly Government was by skilful Astronomers
found out and known, the Gentiles had no weeks, and having no weeks they could
not have the seventh-day Sacred; supposing none before this to have week but
the Jews only, and therefore none but they to have a Sabbath Day.

Among many other Dr. Heylin was of this opinion, who from hence does argue the
Sabbath Day not to be moral, being not observed or known but by the Jews only.
He would have us take it for granted, that no Nation without the knowledge of
Astrology, (the Jews excepted) whereby men came first to know the Planets
hourly Government, and so consequently what Planet governed the first hour in
every day, could have weeks, or call the weekdays by the names of the Planets.
The Gentiles (says he) following the motion of the Planets, gave to each day
the name of that particular Planet, by which the first hour of the day was
governed as their Astrologers had taught them Heyl par. 2. page 61.
. And he assumeth that Astrologers found out this knowledge of the Planetary
government but in latter times. All the Chaldean Astrologers, all the Magicians
among the Persians he held to be ignorant herein, and therefore during the
Assyrian and Persian Monarchy weeks not to be in use. Yea he tells us farther
that neither the Greeks, nor Romans when they were in their greatest flourish
for Arts and Empire, had weeks, because they had not as then gotten this
supposed excellency of Astrology, to know by the motions of the Planets, what
Planet governed the first hour in every day Heyl. part 1. page 84.
. Though the Planets had (as some say) this orderly and hourly government, even
from the day of their Creation; Yet the Dr. holds that neither Plato, nor
Pythagoras, nor any of the famous Astronomers before Eudoxus, had gotten this
excellency. First, says he, the Greeks learnt the motions of the Planets of
Eudoxus, and therefore could not know the week before. He does grant that they
might have great Astrologers among them, and yet be Ignorant of this hourly
government of the Planets, whereby they constantly point out the week and the
days of the week. For he says of the Romans, that they were well enough
acquainted with the Planets in their later times; Yet they divi^ed not their
Calendar into weeks till near about the time of Dionisius Exiguus, who lived
about the year of Christ 520 Heyl. par. 1. page 84.
. But he holds that they (being ignorant of the Scriptures) could not have
weeks before they had gotten this knowledge by the motions of the Planets. And
from hence concludes, that the Chaldees, Persians, Greeks and Romans, all the
four great Monarchies did observe no Sabbaths, because they did observe no
weeks.

In answer hereunto I say, that if it be true which the Doctor would, that
without the Holy Scripture, weeks could not be known but by the knowledge of
the said hourly government of the Planets; and that this government of the
Planets was not found till the Egyptians of late times, and Eudoxus from them
had gotten the knowledge thereof; it must needs be confessed, not only what the
Doctor thence infers, that all the four great Monarchies did observe no
Sabbath, because they did observe no weeks. But that the Patriarchs before the
Flood, and all Nations, and People whatsoever (the Jews only excepted) were
without a Sabbath Day, and could not have the seventh-day Sacred with any of
them, till about the time of Eudoxus, who was Plato's Scholar, because they
neither had nor could have weeks before.

But for answer in plain terms: It is very untrue what the Dr. alleges. There
was never any such hourly government of the Planets found out, but feigned.
Neither had the weekdays their names first from the Planets governing the
first hour of the day. Both which I will clear and make apparent.

Touching the former; There is no such hourly government found out in deed and
truth; but there has such an one feigned to be; and that upon a new order, or
situation of the Planets made by Astronomers in later times.

For in ancient times the Moon was held to be the lowest Planet, and the Sun to
be next unto her, and all the other five Planets to be above the Sun. This was
the order of the Planets generally in Ancient times by Astronomers Macrob. in
Somn. Scip. l. 1. cap. 19. Plut. brev. de D^^r. Na^. l. 2. Clav. a^ Sphae p. 97.
, excepting very few, as Aristarchus, Samius, and two or three other whom
Copernicus followed making the Sun to be below them all; but afterward, about
Eudoxus time, or not long after, Astronomers partly by the Aspects and
Parallaxes of the Planets, and partly by the difference of the time, in which
they finished their courses, found out a new order and situation of them;
making the Sun to be the middle Planet, three to be above him, and three below
him; according to this common Versicle, Post SIM SUM sequitur ultima Luna
subest.

This newfound order of the Planets set many Wits to the grinding-stone a
sharpening, to bring forth some rare inventions in Laud of the Planets new
situation. Two whereof, that were more remarkable remain yet in memory. The one
was that (...), which (as many say) was the ground of Music (a). Macrob. Clav.
de sph^^era page 84.
Feigning the weekdays to answer the supposed harmony of the Spheres; every
fourth Planet in that order perpetually to sound out the name of the next
succeeding day. The other was this hourly government before-said, first brought
to light in Egypt, as is supposed; by which it will so fall out, that let every
Planet be supposed to govern his hour successively according to this new order,
it will so fall out that the Planet which shall come to rule the first hour of
the next day, will be the very same whose name that day does bear. Both these I
confess, are very witty: but a mere fancy. And they, who urge from hence, that
the Planets have such an hourly rule, and government given them by their
Creator, by which every one in seven days does constantly, and by course, Rule
the first hour of a weekday, and that thereby men came to have seven days to
the week, and to call the days of the week by the names of the Planets orderly,
as they came to govern the first hour of the day, are merely deluded. For had
there been in truth such an hourly government given them, and had they
exercised the same; then sure,

First, Adam should have gotten this knowledge before all men. And then it
would follow hence, that men had weeks from the beginning, even from this
hourly Rule of the Planets: but indeed, Adam had better ground for weeks, than
the Planets could afford; which was Gods working six days and resting the
seventh.

2. If Adam had not known this rarity, or if he had known it, and would reveal
it to none of his Children; Yet the Astrologers before the Flood would
doubtless have found out the same: they were most excellent in the knowledge of
Astrology, as Josephus, and many other in their Writings tell us; they had such
experiments in, and of their observations, which men in future times, living
not the tenth of their days, could never attain unto. Doubtless had there been
such a Rule indeed, they would have known it; and also written this rarity in
those Pillars Josephus mentions Josep. Anti. Jud. l. 1. c. 4, 8.
, that future Ages might not be ignorant thereof. Surely those long-lived
Astrologers deserved not to be of that name and fame, if ignorant of the said
hourly government of the Planets, had there been any such Rule, or Government
then in being.

3. If it be supposed, that none before the Flood were such excellent
Astrologers; yet the Chaldees, whose Religion was in adoring the Host of
Heaven, and in searching after the motions and effects of the Planets, who
bestowed their whole time therein, even from their Childhood: who instructed
their little Children in the knowledge of the Stars Boemus ubi de Assyria.
, as we teach Children the Catechism; these I say of all other since the Flood,
should have been the finders out of this Rule and Government of the Planets had
there been any such among them. A vanity is it to imagine, that such an
excellency should be kept secret from the Creation during thousand of years,
and not found out till late times, by some Egyptians of no Note or Name;
whereas the discoverers thereof (had there been such a thing indeed found out)
deserved to have their names Engraven in Marble for their lasting memory to all
succeeding Ages.

4. If this hourly Government be really true, then there can but one Planet
govern the first hour of one and the same day, at one and the same place; and
which shall give name to that day; if otherwise, then this hourly rule is not
sound, but feigned. Now we know, that one and the same day at one and the same
place, may be Friday, Saturday and Sunday to several persons. I will clear this
in Dr. Heylins own words.

Suppose (says he) that a Turk, a Jew, and a Christian should dwell together
at Jerusalem, whereof the one does keep his Sabbath on the Friday, the other on
the Saturday: and the third Sanctifies the Sunday (a). (he would not call
Sunday our Sabbath, Heyl. part 1. page 48.
as he does Friday the Turks Sabbath) Then, that upon the Saturday the Turk
begins his journey VVestward, and the Christian Eastward: so as both of them
compassing the World, do meet again in the same place: the Jew continuing
where they left him. It will fall out, that the Turk by going VVestward, having
lost a day; and the Christian going Eastward, having got a day; one and the
self same day will be a Friday to the Turk, a Saturday to the Jew, and a Sunday
to the Christian. Since then one and the same day came to be a Friday, a
Saturday, and a Sunday unto these three by their Travel, there must be three
several Planets to govern the first hour of that day; or else the Planets must
by little and little have gotten and lost a whole course of governing, as the
Travelers did by little and little gain and lose a whole day by their Travel;
both which will show this hourly rule of the Planets to be both vain and
feigned.

Touching the latter, that weekdays had not their names from the supposed
hourly rule of the Planets, may from these reasons be gathered.

First, This hourly rule does flow from the names of the weekdays, and not the
weekday names from it. Men must first know by what Planets name the day is
called, before they can tell what Planet must govern the first hour thereof.
For suppose the two Travelers before-said, the Christian and the Turk, had met
at any place before they had ended their journey: it must be as Dr. Heylin has
demonstrated the like (a), Sunday then with the Turk, Heyl par. 1. p. 46, 47,
48.
when it was but Saturday with the Christian then at their meeting. Now let the
most skilful of Astrologer be demanded, what day it should be unto them both,
either Saturday or Sunday? whether the Sun or Saturn ruled the first hour
thereof? He will answer as the Chaldees did Nebuchadnezzar, There is not a man
upon the earth that can show this matter, Dan. 2.10. Yea though the place where
those Travelers met were made known also, yet would the question remain
unresolvable, unless there be some line or other supposed, where the Planets
should begin their Government, and from whence the Calculation is to be made:
But in that supposal there is no certainty. Now if the said Travelers agree
together, to have that day of their meeting to be Sunday, then any Astrologer
will readily tell them, that the Sun was he that ruled the first hour thereof:
or if they make it Saturday, then Saturn was he. First therefore the weekdays
must be known, before men can know the said planetary Rule and Government. I
would not have any conceive, that by the Planetary Rule and Government, I
should mean here that Government and Lordship, which the Planets are of old
said to have in their own Home and Houses; it is the hourly Rule of the
Planets, mentioned in the beginning of this Chapter that I mean. I confess my
self to be but little skilled in the one; but this he that has but the use of
a pair of Globes may demonstrate to be false, and to have no truth in it.

2. The Germans had weeks, and called the weekdays by the names of their Gods
whom they adored, which were the seven Planets, and this long before they came
to have any knowledge of this hourly Rule of the Planets, which Henricus
Hassianus got in Paris, and then after taught the same in Vienna: and that not
yet four hundred years since. The Doctor says, That the Grecians had not weeks
till Eudoxus had taught them this excellency in Astrology, which he brought
from Egypt a little before; he might with as much truth have said, that the
Germans had not weeks, till Henricus Hassianus had taught this knowledge in
Astrology, which he brought from Paris a little before. There is the same
reason in them both, but this is known to be far from truth. If any say that
the Germans had learnt to have weeks, and to call the days of the week by the
names of the Planets, since the said hourly Rule was found out, and that either
from the Romans or Grecians, or from some other Nation with whom they lived,
before they came to inhabit in Germany: as the French, the English, the Dutch,
and other People in America have weeeks, and call the weekdays by the same
names those Nations did, with whom their Ancestors lived before they came into
America. My answer is, they are much mistaken; for Germany was a very Ancient
Kingdom, as Theodore Bibliander, and Verstegan also do acquaint us. Twisco, who
before he died was a King, and the first King of the Germans was born long
before there was a Monarchy of the Romans, Grecians or Persians either. He was
antienter than Abraham's father. Bibliander thus writes of him, Tuisco, quem
aliqui putant, etc. Tuisco, whom some think to be Aschenaz, the Nephew of Noah,
erected the Kingdom of Sarmatia, and from whom the Dutchmen are called
Teutshen. Tacitus holds him to be the Son of Terra or Arezia, Noah's wife
Theod Bibl.
. Mannus who was Twisco his Son, and the second King of the Germans, was born
not twenty years after Abraham. and Wigwoner their third King was born before
Abraham went out of Ur, a Town of the Chaldees, and therefore according to
Bibliander, before the Egyptians had learnt Astrology. For it seems the
Egyptians as well as other Nations, severing themselves from Noah's Posterity,
remaining about Chaldea, Assyria, and other parts of Shinar, busied themselves
so about their new Plantation in Egypt, that they neglected and forgot
Astrology, till Abraham came out of Chaldea, and went down into Egypt, where,
as Josephus says, he taught Astronomy unto them, being ignorant thereof before
Joseph. Antiq. Jud. l. 1. c. 15, 16. See chap. 9.
. The Germans were a Nation and a Kingdom before Eudoxus knew what a Planet
was. Verstegan also tells us, that the Saxons had in Ancient times the seven
Planets for their Gods, whom they called Son, Moan, Tuisco, etc. and also
called the days of the week by the names of those their Gods, before ever they
had any Commerce with the Grecians or Romans either.

3. Weekdays bear the names of the Planets, not from the said late invented
hourly Rule, supposed to be given them by God, when he Created them, but as
they were the Heathens Gods, and were orderly Worshipped and Adored by them.
Thus the day we call Sunday, was by the Heathen anciently called the day of the
Sun, because of all the Planets who were held to be the Lords and Governors of
the World; he was that Lord and Governor which had special Worship done unto
him on that day, and for that his Worship began with that days beginning, even
at the Sunrising (for at that time did the Heathen begin their Worship to the
Sun, and to every of the rest of the Host of Heaven, as I have showed before,)
which was the first hour of the day with them; he has been said and held, to
begin his Lordship or Government on the beginning, or first hour of that day;
and hence is it that that day was by the Ancient Heathen called the day of the
Sun: the like may be said of the other names of the weekdays.

That the weekdays were by the Heathens called by the names of the Planets, as
they were the Heathens Gods adored by them, is evident, not only from the
Testimonies of sundry Learned men, but also from Dr. Heylins own Pen. He
himself does say as much, for ask this question of him, and he will tell you
yea; and says, That they are more Nice than Wise, who out of a desire to have
all things new, would have new names for every day, or call them as sometimes
they were, the first day of the week, the second day of the week, and sic de
caeteris; and all for fear lest it be thought that we do still adore those
Gods, whom the Gentiles Worshipped Heyl part 2. page 63.
. Ask by whose Authority he proves weekdays to have their names from the Gods
of the Heathen? He tells us by St. Augustines, and alleges these his words,
Deorum suorum nomina Gentes imposuerunt diebus istis, etc. The Gentiles (says
the Father) gave to every day of the week the name of one or other of their
Gods, etc. Ask him again why P^pe Sylvester changed the names of the weekdays,
and would have no weekday to be called by the name of any of the Planets, but
all to be called by the names of Feria prima, Feria secunda, etc. Was it, for
that Eudoxus had learned the aforesaid Government of the Planets, and so he,
and other Astrologers after him taught this rarity in their Schools, whereby
many (admit all) Grecians had weeks, and called the weekdays by the names of
the Planets, as their Astronomers taught them; and now the Pope fearing lest
the Romans from the example of the Greeks should in time come to have weeks
(for till that time, and after that too, until the Romans had admitted
Christianity throughout their Empire; Dr. Heylin says they had no weeks Heyl.
part page 84.
and should call the weekdays by the names of the Planets, as the Grecians
did? No sure, it was for that the Gentiles generally, as Romans and Greeks, did
call the days of the week as they were taught from their Ancestors, and they
from theirs, even by the names of their Gods which of Old they adored, who were
the seven Planets; and for that Christians also generally (except Jews) did
call them so in like manner, as their Heathen Ancestors did, even in the time
when this Pope lived: which so displeased the said Pope, that in detestation of
the memory of these Heathen Gods, he changed the names of the weekdays, and
decreed to have them called by the names of Feriae. Dr. Heylin proving this,
cites Polydore Virgil for his authority, Sylvester Romanus Pontifex ejus
nominis primus, vanorum deorum memoriam inabhorrens Pol. Vir. de Inv. rerum, l.
6. c. 5.
, etc. Sylvester the first Pope of that name, hating the name, and memory of
the Gentile Gods; gave order that the days should be called by the name of
Feriae Heyl. part. 2. page 62.
, etc. Had the Planets such Power and Virtue given them of God, so to Govern by
an hourly course, as that thereby every weekday was designed and pointed out,
Sylvester had cause rather to magnify the Creator, who revealed the knowledge
hereof unto some, which was kept secret from all Generations till then; and to
have in Love, and Laud the Parties, though Heathen, to whom the Lord had made
known this Rarity, whereby the Grecians had weeks in his life time; and the
Romans and other Nations might in short time come to have weeks also, than to
bear such spite and hatred to the Planets for such their Virtue given them, or
to the finders out of this Planetary Government, as should move him to take
away the memory, either of the Planets, or of this their Government, or of the
finders out thereof, by changing the names of the weekdays; sure his dislike
and hatred was against the Idolatry of the Heathen, who still continued to
count the Planets as Gods, and to call the weekdays by their names: hence is
it that he made the change, even to take away the remembrance of their names
out of men's, especially out of Christians mouths.

Thus having now been showed, first that there is indeed no such hourly
Government as is pretended; And secondly, that the weekdays had not their
names from thence; Any man may see the weakness of Dr. Heylins principal
argument, to prove thereby, that neither of the four great Monarchies, nor any
People else, the Jews only excepted, had weeks, and therefore no Sabbath.

CHAP. XV. Sunday was the seventh day with the Gentiles. Sunday continued to be
the seventh day of the week with Christians.
HAving declared what weeks are, and the long continuance of them; and also
answered the main objection made against their Antiquity; I will now endeavor
to make apparent, that Sunday was not only a seventh, but the seventh day with
the Gentiles.

Concerning which it has already been proved, 1. That the seven Planets were
of the old Gentiles Gods. 2. That the seven days of the week were deputed to
those their Gods; and as John Gregory does assure us Jo. Greg. in his Assyrian
Monarchy.
in his Assyrians Monarchy, that the days of the week were called of the
Assyrians by the names of the same Planets, unto whom the weekdays were
severally dedicated; and that all Nations did from them call the days of the
week in like manner. 3. That the Sun was of all their Gods held the Chiefest
and Supreme.

Now common sense and reason will tell us, that the day which was by them
Dedicated to their Chiefest God, and bare his Name; the day of the Sun, which
we call Sunday, must be with them the chiefest day of all the seven in their
estimation; and therefore was it with them not only a seventh day of the week,
but the seventh day (...).

Neither was Sunday the seventh day of the week with the Idolatrous Gentiles
only, but was also, as it is most probable, that seventh day which the
Patriarchs before the Flood held to the Honor of the Creator, in remembrance
of the Creation, and of Gods Resting on the seventh day. For when Nimrod
otherwise called Saturnus Babylonicus, Belus his Son, and other Potentates of
Assyria and Chaldea, had Idolatrously set up the whole Host of Heaven, that is,
the Sun, Moon, and the other Planets, with constellations subservient to them;
which of the seven days of the week, will any reasonable man imagine, did they
dedicate to the Honor of their greatest God the Sun, rather than that, which
before was held to the Honor of God the Creator? Surely not any other. And
when the Assyrian and Chaldean Powers had, as much as in them lay, robbed God
(if I may so say) of his Titles, Attributes, Providence, Works of Creation,
Government and Worship; and gave the chief of all their spoils to their
chiefest God the Sun; Nimrod giving him the name Baal Jo. Greg. Assyr. Monar.
, which he afterward assumed to himself Biblian.
, Belus giving him the name Jove, (Jehovah in the Hebrew) the which he assumed
afterward unto himself, and was called Jove Bell. They called the Sun God, and
held him the God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, and Governor of all things: and
that the World was not Created, but was from everlasting governed by the
Planets, the Sun being Chief and Sovereign Ruler: Would they not do the like,
may any one think, with that day which was held to the Honor of the Creator?
All that, was known to be for the Worship and Honor of God the Creator, they
gave to the Honor of the Sun; and therefore doubtless they deputed to the Sun
that day also.

Again, When they assigned to every of those Gods the several days of the week,
no indifferent understanding man but will conceive that they would Dedicate to
their greatest God the Sun, the day held before to the Honor of the great God
of Heaven and Earth, rather than to the Moon, Mercury, or other inferior Gods.
So that most likely, the seventh day with the Patriarks, was none other, but
that which afterward was the Suns day with the Assyrians, and from them was
called the day of the Sun with other Nations also, as the other weekdays were
called by the names of the other Planets: and so by custom have they continued
to be called with all Nations of any note for Civility and Knowledge, except
with the Jews only, who after their coming out of Egypt, had another day
assigned unto them for their seventh Sacred day; and had a special Command
given them, not to make any mention of those Gods of the Nations, nor to have
their names at all in their mouth, as I have showed before.

2. Sunday was the seventh day of the week with the Gentiles, as may be
Collected from the Pens of many Learned Authors, as well Christian as Heathen.

Aug. Steuchius in Genesis 2. Speaking of the seventh day affirmed, that it was in
omni aetate inter omnes gentes venerabilis and sacer. The like do Chrysostom,
Beda, and other more, whose words I have before in the 13. Chapter expressed;
Also amongst the most Ancient Poets, diverse of them do testify the same, as
Linus, Callimachus, Hesiod and Homer, who was above two hundred years before
Eudoxus knew what Astrology was. All of them were Heathen, yet all of them
spoke very laudably of the seventh Sacred day. Their words for brevities sake I
will not here rehearse, since they are to be seen, and are urged by many
Writers, as namely, Clem. Alexand. Strom. l. 5. Eusebius. de Praep. Evang. l. 13.
c. 17. Rivetus in Genesis c. 2. and in his Dissert. de Origin Sabba. Also Dr.
Heylin in his History of the Sabbath, part 1. c. 4. Now the seventh day so
laudably by them spoken of, was the day of the Sun. For, 1. It was not Saturday
the Jews seventh day. The Gentiles liked the Jews Saturday, as (said a Papist)
the Devil does Holy Water. It was counted by them a disdainful novelty; their
Poets commonly would have one lash or other at the Jews for it, and never spoke
in honor thereof. 2. The Adversaries themselves do grant that the day of the
Sun was the seventh day, and Sacred also with the Heathen; but here is their
evasion, The seventh day Sacred to the Sun with the Heathen, say they, was the
seventh day of the Month, and not the seventh day of the week.

Now that the day of the Sun was the seventh day of the week with the Heathen,
and not the seventh day of the month, thus I prove.

1. Clemens and Eusebius, both allege the said Poets, to show that the
Gentiles had the seventh day of the week Sacred with them.

2. Other Authors generally take Sunday with the Gentiles for a weekday, and
not for the day of a month.

3. Had the seventh day Sacred to the Sun been the seventh day of every month,
as they affirm, the Greeks doubtless would have noted the same down in their
Calenders. Though they could not set down constantly the seventh day of the
week, by reason of their intercaling so many days at a time, no more than
others then could do; and no more than we can set down the moveable Feasts that
were with us, unless it be in a yearly Almanac, before that Julius Caesar had
corrected the year. Yet never shall we see a Calender, in which the Principal
immovable Sacred days were omitted. Now there is an Ancient Attick Calendar to
be seen in Scaliger de emend. temp. wherein things of less consequence are
noted; but this seventh day Sacred to the Sun in each month cannot be found.

4. Dr. Francis White and Dr. Heylin also tell us White of the Sabbath p. 197.
Heyl. par. 2. p. 53.
that Christians of the first Ages, because they kept the Sunday for their
Sacred Services, and bowed Eastward in their Worship, were upbraided for
Sun-Worshippers, though they neither Worshipped the Sun, nor called their day
of Worshipping God Sunday, but the Lords day, being their Sabbath Sacred day of
Rest to the Lord. Surely if Sunday had not been with the Heathen who were Sun
Worshippers indeed, a weekly service day, but the seventh day of the month
only, there had been no cause or ground, why either Jew or Gentile should have
cast such an aspersion on them of being Worshippers of the Sun.

5. This may further appear by the decree of Pope Milchiades, whom some call
Miltiades, the last of all the Popes that were Martyrs. He to make a clear
difference between the observation of Sunday by Christians, and the observation
of Sunday by the Heathen, ordained that all Gentiles who were converted and
were Christians, should not fast on the Sundays nor on Thursdays, as the other
Gentiles did. Note, that as Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, were now in late
times called Sacred or Prayer-days; so were Thursday and Sunday in old times;
on which days they filled not themselves as on other days till their Sacred
Services were ended. The decree Sever. Binius on the Life of the said Pope sets
down thus: Jejunium vero Dominici diei, and quintae feriae nemo celebrare
debet; ut inter jejunium Christianorum, and Gentilium veraciter, etc. He would
not that Christians should fast on the Thursday, and on the Lords day, called
by the Gentiles Sunday, that so there might be an open and apparent distinction
between Christians and the Heathen in the observation of those days. From which
time till of late, our Tables have testified obedience to that decree, being
usually furnished with more variety of Dishes on the Sundays and Thursdays,
than on any day of the week besides. If any one here say, that these days were
not Sacred but Fasting days, because Binius call them jejunia; I would have him
informed, that Sacred days were with the Heathen called Fasts, because they
abstained from feeding themselves till their Services were ended: the like did
the Jews, yea and Christians too in old time. Trogus Writing the Customs of the
Jews, when he would tell us that Moses ordained the Saturday, being the seventh
day with the Jews, to be a Sacred day perpetually, he thus expresses the same.
Septimum diem more Gentis Sabbatum appellatum, in omne aevum jejunio sacravit
Moses Trog. li. 36.
. Dr. Heylin shows plentifully that the Heathen Poets, and others called
Sacred days Fasting days Heyl. part 1. page 102.
. But to put us out of doubt that the Thursday, and Sunday were not only
fasting days, but Sacred also with the Heathen, Platina resolves the case:
who, on the Life of the said Pope, sets down his Decree thus. Miltiadis
institutum fuit, ne Dominico, neve feria quinta jejunaretur; quia hos dies
Pagani quasi sacros celebrant. Whereby it appears, that Sunday was a Sacred
day, not of the month, but of the week with the Heathen.

6. Lastly, The Testimonies of diverse Learned Writers show that the day of the
Sun with the Gentiles was a weekday, even the same which we call the Lords day.

Sozomen tells us that Constantine commanded Dominicum diem, quem Ebraei
primum Sabbati appellant, and Graeci Soli deputant, etc. a cunctis celebrari
Soz. Eccl. hist. li. 1. cap. 8.
. Constantine then held that the day which the Heathen then Greeks deputed to
the Sun, was the very same which we call the Lords day.

Justin Martyr in several passages called the Lords day no otherwise than
(...); as then the Gentiles or Greeks called it; says Dr. Heylin Heyl. part 2.
page 62.
and we call it now.

Bonaventure acquaints us how Christians spoiled the day of the Sun of its
Idolatrous Worship, and so kept it in honor of Christ. Secundum Gentiles, dies
Dominicus primus est; cum principio illius diei incipit dominari principalis
planeta Sol; propter quod vocabant eundem diem Solis, and exhibebant ei
venerationem. Ut ergo error ille excluderetur, and reverentia cultus Solis Deo
exhiberetur, praefixa fuit Dominica dies, qua populus Christianus vacaret
cultui Divino Borav. in 3. Distin. 37.
.

Cael. Rhodigin. lect. Antiq. li. 13. cap. 22. thus shows, Nos jure optimo,
diem, quem Mathematici Solis vocant, Domino ascripsimus dicavimusque and illius
cultui totum mancipavimus.

It seems by these that Christians at first, divested the Sun of the Worship
given him on the day of the Sun, and gave the whole right of Worship on that
day unto the Lord God. They served the day of the Sun as the men of Israel were
to serve their Captive Maidens; the things that grew excrementitiously on them,
as hair, and nails were to be shaven, and cut; Deuteronomy. 21.12. and so cast away,
etc. and then the men lawfully might keep and use them: So Christians of the
first Age after Christ's Ascension, pared off, and cast away what did
excrementitiously (if I may so say) grow on the day of the Sun, as the
Adoration, and Superstitious Services given to it on that day; and then they
lawfully might, and did make use of the same; and it became their standing
service-day unto Gods honor.

Diverse other Testimonies of sundry Authors may be given to prove the day of
the Sun with the Gentiles to be, not their seventh day of the month, but the
seventh day of the week; all which I here omit: only I referr the Reader for
his further satisfaction to Doctor Heylins. History of the Sabbath Heyl par. 2.
page 53, 61, 62, 63.
, wherein he shows that not only the days of the Moon, of Mars, of Mercury,
etc. with the Gentiles, were the same which we call Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
etc. But also that the day of the Sun is the same which we call Sunday, proving
the same out of Tertullian, Justin Martyr, Saint Augustine and others.

Quest. But here it may be demanded, that since the Sunday was the day Sacred
with the Heathen, Dedicated to the Sun, and to the dishonor of God so much
abused by their Heathenish Superstition, and Idolatry: Whether Christians in
the Apostles time, or afterward should not have done well to have chosen
Friday, or Saturday, or some other day for their standing day of the week for
Gods service rather then the Sunday?

Answer, To alter or change the Sabbath from the seventh day, and to make it
the eighth, ninth, sixth, or any other than the seventh, which is the last day
of the week, is against the express Law of God, as before has has been
showed, though it be no where forbidden to alter the whole week by beginning
the same sooner, or later.

Secondly, They lawfully might, and did alter and change both the name, and
also the Worship, or service done on that day; for they called it no longer
Sunday unless in their common talk with the Heathen, but they called it the
Lords day; being the day which the Lord in this Law commanded to be Sanctified;
Neither did they adore, and Worship the Sun any more on that day, but the Lord
their Creator and Redeemer.

Thirdly, It is true that all the weekdays were abused to the Idolatrous
Worship of the Planets, though not in the like degree as was the Sunday: And
that one day, in it self, was no more holy than another; Yet Christians should
not have done well in changing, or in their endeavoring to have changed their
standing service day, from Sunday to any other day of the week; and that for
these reasons.

1. Because of the contempt, scorn and derision they thereby should be had in
among all the Gentiles with whom they lived; and toward whom they ought by St.
Paul's rule to live inoffensively 1 Cor. 10.32. in things indifferent. If the
Gentiles thought hardly, and spoke evil of them, for that they ran not into the
same excess of riot with them: 1. Pe^. 4.4. what would they have said of
Christians for such an Innovation as would have been made by their change of
their standing service-day? If long before this, the Jews were had in such
disdain among the Gentiles for their Saturday-Sabbath (which the Gentiles held
to be a singularity, and innovation brought in by Moses) insomuch that Jeremy
lamenteth the same, Lam. 1.7. How grievous would be their Taunts and reproaches
against the poor Christians living with them, and under their power, for their
new set Sacred day, had the Christians chosen any other than the Sunday? Had
Sr. Francis Drake, and Captain Cavendise, and their companies, who Traveled
round the Earth with them, either out of tenderness of Conscience, or else out
of obstinacy continued to keep that Sunday Sacred which fell to them by course,
and true tale of the days succeeding each other: they must needs have had their
Sunday on our Monday, and our Sunday would be their Saturday: When it was holy
day with them, it would be working day with us; and holy day with us when they
would work. So Tacitus said of the Jews, Profana illic quae apud nos sacra,
rursum concessa, quae nobis illicita Corn. Tacit. Diurnal. li. 21.
. Now how unquiet, may any one imagine should those Travelers have lived among
us, as long as our Sunday was a weekday with them? Would not every
Ballad-maker have had them in their Rimes? Would they not have been a byword
with all? and every Apparator would be ready with a Citation for them. And can
we conceive that Christians at first should find more favor from the Heathen
for their wilfulness which was less excuseable?

2. Most Christians then were either Servants or of the poorer sort of People:
and the Gentiles (most probably) would not give their servants liberty to cease
from working on any other set day constantly, except on their Sunday.

3. Had they changed their seventh day from their Sunday to another day, there
must have followed an unsufferable confusion in the count of the weekdays with
whom they lived, as for example: had Sir Francis Drake, and his company
observed at his return, the weeks which by his exact account fell to them by
course; and not have changed them, and made them the same with our weeks, there
would have followed a miserable confusion even in their own families. The third
day of the week with some must have been the fourth with others of the same
family. And never a day would have been the same with them all. The like would
it have been with the Christians and Gentiles with whom they lived, if they had
changed their seventh standing day for Gods Worship (which was Sunday) for
another.

4. Because had they assayed such a change, it would have been a Testimony
against them of slighting the Glorious Resurrection of our Lord and Savior,
The Sun of Righteousness, Mal. 4.2. who on the Sunday most Triumphantly Rose
from the Dead for the Justification of all his People.

5. It would have been but labor in vain for them to have assayed the same,
they could never have brought it to pass. For,

1. They had no authoritative specification of any set day either by Jesus
Christ, or by his Apostles, on which they ought to keep the Lords day. Had
there so been, St. Paul would never have pressed the indifferency of days, as he
did, Rom, 14.1, 2, Col. 2.16. nor would he himself have with the believing Jews
kept the Saturday, Acts 13.14, 42.17, 2, 18.4. and with the Christians, (by
Christians I mean the Gentiles converted to Christ,) have kept the Sunday, Acts
20.7. 1 Cor. 16.2. neither would the believing Jews have remained so obstinate,
but would have kept that day for their Sabbath, which was so pointed out unto
them, if there had been such: Whereas they for the generality of them, would
never be withdrawn to keep any other than their Saturday for their Sabbath,
hundreds of years after the Apostles days.

2. They had no coercive Power to draw refusers to the observation of any other
day for the Lords day, had they been so disposed to have set any other.

3. Christians were not all of one City, or of one Country, or of one Nation,
Tongue or Government. It would have been even a miracle to have gotten all
Christians in all parts of the World to have observed one and the same day for
the Lords day with them all, which should be chosen, not by a general meeting,
or by a general consent, but by some of them only, had they chosen any other
than the day of the Sun, which they were generally before their Conversion
accustomed to keep. The People of Israel were but one Nation, all of one
Tongue, and severed from all other People, and also had Moses their
Captain General: yet Moses should never have withdrawn them from their old
accustomed day, to the observation of the Saturday-Sabbath, different from the
custom of all other Nations, had not the Lord God miraculously in the fall of
Quails and Manna, Exodus 16.12, 16, 22, 23, 26. showed that it was his good
pleasure so to have it, when he assigned unto them their six days for their
labor, and so pointing out to them the Saturday, being the seventh from their
first gathering Quails and Manna, to be the day of Holy Rest unto the Lord.
Sylvester the first Pope of that name, when out of his hatred to the memory of
the Heathen Gods, he would have changed but the names of the weekdays, decreed
them to be called by the names of Feriae, as has been before showed; though he
was of great Authority and Command, and highly beloved of the People; yet he
could not prevail herein, but with very few except Scholars; the vulgar People
in their common talk, called their week days as they did before, by the names
of the Planets; and so have they continued to call them, even to this day. The
Jews are now a weak People, yet there is not a Prince or Power on earth able to
withdraw them from their Superstitious Custom of keeping the Saturday Sacred;
yea the believing Jews, as was showed, in the Apostles time, and in many years
after, could not be won by any means that the Christians might use, to give
over their Saturday-Sabbath, and for Unities sake to keep the Lords day on the
Sunday, except a very few of them who better knew and acknowledged their
liberty by Christ. How impossible may we then think it to be for any to bring
to pass, that all Christians in all quarters of the World, should leave off
their observing the Sunday Sacred, and have another day instead thereof? In
vain therefore would it have been for poor Christians at first to have assayed
the same.

These reasons, if there were no more, may suffice to show, that although all
days be in themselves indifferent: yet Christians should not have well done,
had they endeavored to have changed their seventh Sacred day, from Sunday to
any other weekday; no not to Thursday, though it was the day of Christ his
glorious Ascension; nor to Friday, though it was the day in which Christ paid
our Ransom: but better to retain the same day as they did; and which the Church
of Christ has since that kept, even to this present time, and by Gods Grace
will so do unto the end.

CHAP. XVI. The Sabbath Day is to be sanctified. Works of Piety, Government,
and of Nature only are to be done on the Sabbath Day, etc. the necessary helps
thereunto.
THere has been before showed, that the Sabbath day in this Law commanded to
be kept holy, is not a part of a day as is the Artificial day, but an whole
day. And that it is not such a kind of day as are the days of the Creation
mentioned in the first of Genesis, but such a kind of day, as is or has been
in use with men. And also that it is not in tale, the fifth, sixth, eighth, or
ninth day, but the seventh, not the seventh day of the month, but the seventh
day of the week, the day following the six known days of labor, where men
dwell and inhabit. Which day with Christians is vulgarly called Sunday,
otherwise more fitly, and as indeed it is, The Lords day, even our Sabbath Day
to the Lord.

Now in the next place is to be showed how the Lords day is to be Sanctified.
To the sanctification of the Sabbath Day of the Lord, which we call the Lords
day, two things are required.

1. That we keep it a day of rest. 2. That we Sanctify that time of rest.
That we are to keep it a day of rest the Scripture fully shows.

On the seventh day thou shall rest, in Earing time and in Harvest, Exodus
34.21. The like have we in diverse other places of Scripture, calling it a day
of rest.

All men are to cease from the works of their calling, which on other days they
lawfully may, yea and ought to do for the maintenance of themselves and theirs.
Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, ye
shall do no work therein. Lev. 23.3, So are the words here in this Law, Thou
shall not do any work.

But whereas we are here forbidden to do any work, we must not so understand
the words, as if on the Sabbath Day we should rest from all kind and manner of
works, and so do no work at all upon that day, the words of the Text do not
bear such a sense. These are the words of the Commandment, (...). Thou shall do
all thy Trade, Art, or Occupation, and such are the words of the Text in diverse
other places of Scripture. Deuteronomy. 5.14. Exodus 35.2. and 31.15. Lev. 23.3, 7.
Val. Schindler in his Pentaglot. on the root, (...) tells us thus; The
Rabbis take (...) for Art or Vocation, and (...) in the plural, for Arts, and
Vocations. So Arias Montanus also corrects Pagnines Translation of the Bible,
that whereas Pagnine has it, Non facies omne opus, he turns it, Non facies
omnem functionem, Deuteronomy. 5.14. where Pagnine Translateth thus, Omnis qui fecerit
in eo opus, etc. Montanus has it, Omnis faciens in eo functionem, Exodus 35.2.
Where Pagnine says, Omnis faciens opus in die Sabbati: it is thus to be read
according to Montanus, Omnis faciens opificium in the die cessationis, etc.
Exodus 31.15. The like may be seen in diverse other places of Scripture, so
Translated by the one, and so Corrected by the other. Whence we may gather that
the true meaning of these words commonly read in our Translations, Thou shall
not do any work: is not that we should do no manner of work at all; but that we
should do on the Sabbath Day no manner of the works of our Trade, Function and
Occupation. The Smith is not to work at his Anvil, nor the Shoemaker with his
Awl, nor any other about any works that belong to men's Trade and Profession,
which on the six days of labor they may and should do for getting their
maintenance and livelihood.

There be some other works which on every day may lawfully be done, even on the
Sabbath Day it self without the least breach of this Law, and they are of three
sorts.

1. Works of Piety. 2. Works of Government toward the Creature subjected to
us. 3. Works needful to the preservation of man's life.
These works may be done one every day without any violation of the Law of the
Sabbath. Neither does the Law of the Sabbath abridge us from doing them on any
day.

What God ordained before ever the seventh day was in being, was not, and is
not nulled or abridged by the Law of the Sabbath, but these works were before
ordained by the Lord.

First, Man was made and had his being to serve God, to Honor and Worship him,
to perform duties of Piety, in such manner as he should appoint him. The doing
of these duties on the Sabbath Day does no Violation to the Law of the Sabbath.
Men doing them may be said to break or profane the Sabbath; yet not break the
Law of the Sabb^th. When we have been diligent on the Sabbath Day in doing
service unto God, and the duties he requires of us for his Honor, we may
therein be said not to make the day a day of rest, but to break the rest or
Sabbath; yet not to break the Commandment by doing these works. Thus Christ
told the Pharisees, that the Priests in the Temple did profane the Sabbath and
are blameless. Mat. 12.5. Sure they could not be said to be blameless, had they
by their Sacrificing Bullocks or Sheep broken the Commandment; they brake the
Sabbath, they made it not a day of rest from these works, and so were said to
profane it, that is, in respect of these labors they made it common with other
days; all days being alike Lawful or common for doing works of Piety.

Secondly, Works of Government of the Creatures subjected unto man, were
ordained of the Lord before man was made. Let us make man (says God) in our
Image after our likeness, and let them have dominion over, etc. Genesis 1.26, 28.
and when God had made man, he commanded them to have Dominion over the Fish of
the Sea, over the Foul, over Cattle, and over every living thing upon the
Earth. This Law and Ordinance was not repealed or nulled by any succeeding Law.
Man is to exercise this his Rule and Government committed unto him on any day.
If fire should threaten to destroy a house or houses, Corn, or such like on the
Sabbath Day, man is as well bound to use his power in suppressing the same on
the Sabbath Day as on any other. If Water endanger drowning of Cattle, or if
Cattle strive together, whereby some are like to perish, and man do not succor
and seek to preserve what was in danger, because it was on the Sabbath day, he
shows himself to be a bad Governor of the Creature; or if he should suffer
Sheep or other Cattle to perish for want of Foddering, Folding, or Housing
them, as need requires, he is not worthy to have the Government of Cattle.

The like I say, concerning works needful for the preservation of man's life.
When Adam was in the state of Innocence, before ever the seventh day was, even
on the day of his Creation, the Lord ordained him food. Behold, I have given
you, said God, every herb bearing seed, (some whereof were Physical) which is
upon the face of all the Earth: and every Tree in which is the fruit of a Tree
yielding seed, to you it shall be for meat, Genesis 1.29. It was Gods will and
Ordinance that man being made a living soul should use the means for the
preservation of his life. And this his Ordinance, was never repealed by any
succeeding Law. All these three kind of works may be done on the Sabbath Day as
well as on other days; always provided that there be no irregularity in
performing them. We must have regard to necessity requiring present help; when
this gives way, the duties more excellent are more especially to be regarded.
And as these works may be done on the Lords day, so may the necessary helps
thereunto be then done also. A man may on the Sabbath Day Travel on foot to the
meeting place, and assembly of Gods People; and if he cannot well go on foot he
may ride. Also as men may feed, fold or house their Cattle on the Lords day, so
may they use the necessary helps thereunto, which could not be done the day
before. And so also may they not only eat, drink, sleep, and take Physic
according as need requires, but also may use needful helps thereunto; as
heating their meat, and such like; for all stomachs cannot feed on cold meat.
But let all take heed lest under a pretense of necessity, he robs God of his
due Honor, and his Conscience of true Peace.

Object. But here some will object, that this Commandment tied the J^ws from
kindling any fire on their Sabbath Day. If then we are bound to keep this Law
as strictly as the Jews were, we ought not to kindle fire at all upon the
Sabbath Day for any occasion whatsoever, though for saving ones life.

Answer, To which I answer: that this precept in Exodus the five and thirtieth
Chapter, and third Verse, forbade the Jews not from making any fire at all,
whether it be a help toward the duties of piety, or men's health and safety:
But from making fire, whereby it should be a help toward their Trades,
Occupations or Functions which are expressly forbidden to be done in this
Commandment on the Sabbath day. And that this is the meaning may appear, for
that,

First, This precept has an eye, and reflecteth on the words immediately going
before in the former Verse, in which is a rehearsal of the sum of this fourth
Commandment. In these words, according to the Hebrew Text, Arias Monta.
Six days shall Function (Occupation or Trade) be done, and in the seventh
there shall be to you holiness, a rest of cessation to the Lord, every one
doing his Function in that day shall die. Then immediately follows, There
shall no fire be kindled in all your habitations in the day of cessation. The
works about men's personal callings, and functions for getting wealth being
forbidden in the former Verse; in this is forbidden the means tending thereto,
as the kindling of fire. And happily kindling fire is here mentioned rather than
any other means; for that they being all Brick-makers in Egypt before, they
kindled fire throughout their Habitations for the burning their tale of Bricks.
But when works are lawful and needful to be done on the Sabbath Day, such as
are works of piety, and works of preserving the Life of Man, the necessary
helps thereunto, as making fire is lawful also.

Secondly, The continued, and never blamed practice of the Jews of making fire
on the Sabbath Day for these duties, proves the same. They were never at any
time blamed for making fire on the Sabbath for these duties, as far as we can
read in Sacred Scripture. The man that was put to death for gathering wood
(whether to faggot it, or to add it to his Pile or Heap, is not expressed) on
the Sabbath day, Number. 15.32. does make nothing hereto. And that they did make
fire on the Sabbath Days for these duties is undeniable. How else should the
meat offerings baken in Ovens and in Pans, and in Frying-pans be made, which
they were to bring to the Priests as oblations? Levit. 2.4, 5, 7. How else
could the Shewbread be Baked, which were constantly provided and set on the
pure Table of the Lord every Sabbath Day? Levit. 24.5, 6, etc. And how else
should the Paschal Lamb be Roasted, when the Feast of the Passover fell on the
Sabbath Day? Every family was then to eat Roast-meat throughout their
Habitations; and the remains to burnt in the fire, that nothing be left until
the morning, Exodus 12.10. Sure these things could not be done without making
fire. In like manner did they make fire on the Sabbath for preservation of
their life and health. For doubtless the Israelites baken and sod their Manna
on their Sabbath Days, as they did on the other days of the week. Cold Manna,
and unpound would not agree with many men's stomachs on the Sabbath, who on
every of the other days did eat it hot, either Baked or Sodder. On every of the
other six days they gathered every man according to his eating an Omer for
every man, Exodus 16.16, 18. And then ground it, or beat it in a Mortar, and
baked it in Pans, and made Cakes of it, Numb. 11.8. And in that week which was
set for the measuring out to them their first Saturday-Sabbath, which was their
seventh day from their first beginning of gathering Quails and Manna; Moses on
the sixth day (that is, on the day before their new Sabbath appointed) said
unto them, This is that which the Lord has said, To morrow is the rest of the
Holy Sabbath unto the Lord; Bake that which you will Bake to day, and seethe
that you will seethe; and that which remains over, lay up for you to be kept
until the morning, Exodus 16.23, 24. On this sixth day they gathered double to
what they did before; whereof Moses told them that the one part they should
Bake or Seethe at their pleasure, but the remainder, that is, the other part,
they were not willed either to Bake or to Seethe on that day, but to lay it up
for the next day; the which they did: and although it was neither Baked nor
Sodden, yet it stank not neither did worms appear therein. Now if the
Israelites might not pound the said Manna laid up for their Food, nor Bake, nor
Boil the same, and so e^t it hot, as on other days; the Sabbath Day which
should be a delight unto them, would breed them sorrow, and be burdensome unto
them: and doubtless than we should read of their complaints hereof. We read how
they complained for want of change, and wept when they remembered the Flesh,
Cucumbers, Melons, Leeks, Onions, and Garlic which they had in Egypt: But now
said they, our soul is dried away, there is nothing beside this Manna, etc.
Numb. 11.6. How would they have complained if on the Sabbath Days they should
have been driven to have eaten the Manna, not Pound, nor Baked, nor Sod? Their
silence herein argues them not to have been driven to such a strait, but that
they did either Bake or Boil their Manna, and so eat it hot as they did on the
other days; the which could not be done without their making a fire.

Or otherwise if by this precept the Jews were not to make any fire at all on
their Sabbath Day, neither for the furtherance of their Services, and duties
toward God, nor for the preservation of the health, and life of man; then I
say that that precept was particularly given to the Jews, and peculiarly
concerned that Nation and no other Commonwealth whatsoever. And that this
Commandment bound them not thereto, no more than it binds us or any other
People whatsoever. This Law bound, and does bind all men to make the seventh
day with them a day of rest, not only from works of slavery, commonly called
servile works, from which the Jews were bound on their Feast of the Passover:
Lev. 23.7. Number. 28.18. and on certain other of their Feast-days. Lev. 23.8, 21,
25, 35, 36. Number. 28.25, 26. But also from all the works of men's Trade,
Occupation, or Function whatsoever: Yea our thoughts, and minds are not to be
upon them on the Lords day; as the one are called our works, Exodus 23.12: so
the other are called our thoughts.

This Law binds all, that they should not only make the seventh day to be a
day of rest, and cessation from all the works of our callings; but also that we
Sanctify that rest. Remember (says God) that thou Sanctify the Sabbath Day:
that is in English, the day of cessation, or rest, for that is the Sabbath of
the Lord. We may well call it the Lords day, or the Lords Sabbath; for that it
is a day holy to the Lord: we are not only to cease from the works of our
Professions and Callings on that day; but are then to perform also, and do
duties, and works of Holiness unto the Lord. On the seventh day is a cessation
to rest, a Convocation of holiness, Lev. 23.3. Or as it is in our Translation;
The seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, and Holy Convocation: And in Exodus, In
the seventh day is the rest of cessation, Holiness to the Lord, Exodus 31.15.
And a little after that: In the seventh day shall be to you Holiness, a rest of
cessation unto the Lord, Exodus 35.2. All which do show that on the Sabbath Day,
which is the day following our six days of labor, we should not only rest from
all our Functions, and works of our Professions for getting of worldly Wealth
and Maintenance, but we are to keep this rest, cessation or Sabbath holy, to
the Glory and Honor of the most great God our Creator, and Redeemer.

Quest. If any ask here, whether it be lawful for an Apothecary to let Blood in
case of great need; or for a Physician to minister Physic to his sick Patient
on the Sabbath Day?

Answ. Doubtless it is lawful: and not only so, but either of them may go, or
ride for that purpose: it being of the duties before spoken of, for the
preservation of the life and health of Mankind, which are not forbidden by this
Law, provided, neither of them do the same for his fee, reward and gain; for
then he makes it a work of his Profession, for gaining of Worldly Wealth and
maintenance, which may be done on other days, but not on the Sabbath, without
making himself a Transgressor.

And now I conclude this point with the express words of the Homily for the
time of Prayer. Thus it may plainly appear, that Gods Will and Commandment was
to have a solemn time and standing day in the week, wherein the People should
come together, and have in remembrance his wonderful benefits, and to render
him thanks for them, as appertains to loving, kind, and Obedient People. And
with that a little before. And therefore by this Commandment we ought to have a
time, as one day in the week, wherein we ought to rest, yea from our lawful and
needful works; for like as it appears by the Commandment, that no man in six
days ought to be slothful or idle: but diligently to labor in that state
wherein God has set him: Even so God has given express charge to all men,
that upon the Sabbath Day, which is now our Sunday, they should cease from all
weekly and work-day labor, to the intent, that like as God himself wrought six
days and rested the seventh, and Blessed and Sanctified it, and Consecrated it
to quietness and rest from labor: even so Gods Obedient People should use the
Sunday Holily.

As concerning the particular duties to be done on the Sabbath Day, there being
so many Learned and Godly men who have Written so fully of them; and are or may
be in most men's Hands or Closets; I forbear to speak of them here for brevities
sake, referring the Reader to their Plenty; and now in the next place will
speak of the second part of this Commandment.

CHAP. XVII. The great care and provision had by the Lord, for man's keeping and
Sanctifying the Sabbath day.
THE former part of this fourth Commandment, which is, that we should keep Holy
the Sabbath Day, has been at large handled before; now it rests, that I
speak somewhat of the second part also; which I will do briefly in this Chapter.

In this second part is set out in many words the great care and provision had
of the Lord, that men should observe this Law, and keep holy the Sabbath day as
God commands. And this provision of the Lord stands not in one, two or
three only, but in many and weighty Inducements and reasons, the least of which
should have been sufficient to enforce our Obedience, had not our hearts been
hardened, and we most rebellious, wilfully refusing to yield Obedience unto the
same.

The several inducements and reasons the Lord used to win us unto obedience to
this Law are these.

First, Is the Caveat prefixed only to this, and to none other of the
Commandments, Remember, Remember the Sabbath day to Sanctify it. This charge
of heedfulness would mightily work upon an Obedient heart; he would every day
of his six, be thinking how to do and dispatch all his businesses in those
days, that when the seventh day come, he may freely without any encumbrance,
betake himself to the Worship and Service of his God; and when it comes will
be mindful of the day, and careful of observing and keeping the same Holy as
his God Commands.

Secondly, The Lord has here plainly pointed out unto man, what day is the
Sabbath Day which he should Sanctify. The Lord has affixed as it were an
Index to this Law; that as the true hour of the day is known and pointed out by
the Index or Finger in a Dial, whereby he that can but tell the number of the
hour lines, may easily know what hour of the day it is: so here, he that can
but tell the days of the week, may easily tell what day is the Sabbath Day. Six
days shall thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath.
The seventh day is the Sabbath, not the seventh day from thy Birth, nor the
seventh day from the first beginning of the Creation, nor from any set Epoche:
For then it would have put the most skilful Mathematicians to a stand, for the
finding out when this seventh day should begin, but it is the day following the
six days of labor. In what Country soever a man is, though he is not well
skilled in the Language of that place, and does not understand what the names
of the weekdays signify; yet if he can tell which be their six work-days, he
may then tell also which is their seventh day. It makes not much by what names
the days of the week be called, nor what the signification of either or any of
the weekdays should be. The seventh day of the week with Christians, has been
called by diverse several names, and that even by Christians themselves, such as
these: Sunday: The Lords day: The first day of the Week: And in latter times it
has been called also the Sabbath Day; but in the first times Christians would
not call it the Sabbath Day, because all the Gentiles detested the name of
Sabbath, as the Jews did the name of Sunday, as before is showed: Neither could
they relish this name for a good while after their Conversion. It is not much
matter by which of these names we call our seventh day; nor whether we
understand the signification of the name; as what Sunday, or The Lords day, or
The first day of the week do signify, or why we do so call our seventh day.
Though he do not know it to be called Sunday from our Heathen Ancestors, who
called this day so, in honor of the Sun, whom they Worshipped: nor know it to
be called the Lords day, because it is his Sabbath who Sanctified it: nor know
it to be called the first day of the week, for that the Jews called this day
the first of the Sabbath, and so was called by them in Sacred Scripture; and
for that the latter Translators of the Bible, would have this name by which the
Jews called it, to be in our Tongue, called the first day of the week; So as
that now we count it not the day of the Sun, as our Heathen Ancestors did: nor
count it to be the first of our work-days, or first in order and tale of our
weekdays as the Jews did. The name of the day does neither add or alter any
thing of the nature thereof.

Thirdly, Here is set down the equity of this Law. It is so reasonable that
none need complain. The Lord allows man six days, and reserveth but one for
himself. Six days shall thou labor and do all that thou have to do, but the
seventh day is the Sabbath How unreasonable are such who are not contented with
the Lord's liberal allowance, but incroach on the Lords day also, which he
reserved for his own honor and worship?

Fourthly, In that the Lord did in many words set down so punctually. 1. The
works from which men are restrained. 2. The persons who are restrained.

The works forbidden are all kind of Trades, Professions and Occupations, which
on other days men do or may use for getting their living and maintenance. There
is no word in English, which does so fully express (...), which here the Lord
forbids to be done, as does Function, Art or Occupation, as I showed before,
so that none can excuse himself, saying, that his Profession requires little
or no labor of the Body; as do Husbandry and diverse other Handicrafts: for God
forbids (...) all Vocations, Functions or Occupations. Men ought to abstain
from all their works, of what Profession or Vocation soever they be. Yea these
works are not only forbidden in respect of the labor of the hand, but of the
Tongue and mind also; we should not be talking of them, neither should our
hearts and minds run on them on the Lords day.

As God for the furtherance of Man's true Obedience to this Law, has fully
showed the works we are forbidden to do, so does he also as fully, and in many
words show who are forbidden to do any of these works; Thou, nor thy Son, nor
thy Daughter, nor, etc. Whosoever has any authority and command over himself,
must not only be careful that he himself abstain from his labors, but also if
he has authority and command over others, as Son, Daughter, Man, or Maid, Ox,
or Ass, he is to see that they also cease from all work-day labors on the
seventh day; he is not to employ any of them: He nor any of his may employ
either Ox or Ass, nor lend or let them to hire for their labor on the seventh
day, or on any part of that day. The Lords expressions are large herein, that
so all pretenses and excuses may be taken away.

Fifthly, The Lord shows here, and would have us to know that we have no
right unto the seventh day, nor to any part thereof, for doing of our own works
thereon, for the seventh day is the Lords day, and not ours, it is The Sabbath
of the Lord thy God, (as it is in this place in our Bibles so Translated,) it
is, says God, (...) a Sabbath to the Lord: that is, a Rest or Cessation to the
Lord, as before I have showed. See chap. 8. It is a day Holy to the Lord, and
therefore none other than the Lords. All the Tithe of the Land, whether the
seed of the Land, or of the Fruit of the Tree, (in the time of the Law) was the
Lords, Levit. 27.30. and so was the Tithe of the Herd or of the Flock, even of
whatsoever passed under the rod, verse 32. for the Tithe of all these were Holy
to the Lord, verse 30, 32. and therefore they were the Lords; they were his
Seed, his Fruit, his Lambs, etc. One Lamb was no more Holy than another when
they fell from their Damms; and before they were Tithed out, the Possessor of
them might have mingled them at his pleasure; he was not tied to begin his
Tithing at one Lamb rather than at another; but from what Lamb soever he began,
every tenth Lamb that in order passed under the Rod was the Lords: he might not
then change it, nor search whether it was good or bad; verse 33. it was then
Holy to the Lord, it was the Lords Lamb; and of such as detained the tenth, the
Lord complained that they had robbed him, Mal. 3.8, 9. And so I say, concerning
the seventh day in the like sense, that one day of it self is no more Holy than
is another. Christians were not tied by any Divine Law to begin their week, or
sevening from any set particular time: but they continuing their accustomed
week, and so beginning their sevening from the day of Christ's Resurrection, the
seventh from thence in an orderly course is Sacred to the Lord, it is the
Lord's day; no man upon his particular occasions may change the same: he may
not say, My business is such that I cannot keep this Sabbath Day, but I will
keep another day in the week which will be as good. He does deceive himself
herein, he may not put off the seventh to another day, but should defer his
business rather. When men take the seventh day which is Sacred to the Lord, and
employ the same about their own business, either in whole or in part, they may
as truly be said to Rob the Lord, as they under the Law were said so to do in
not paying their due Tithes and offerings, Mal, 3.8, 9.

Sixthly, The Lord was pleased to set out unto us the ground of this Law; why
he would have a day in a week appointed for his Worship, rather than a week in
every month, or a month in every year: And why he would have the seventh day
for his Service rather than the tenth; the ground hereof the Lord here shows
to be this; In six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea and all that in
them is; and rested the seventh day. The same ground for the Sanctification of
the seventh day is also declared before in Genesis 2.3.

Seventhly, The Lord declares, and he would have his People hereby to know
that he has Annexed a Blessing unto this day: God Blessed the seventh day.
They who wait on the Lord, and Serve him sincerely, during this their day of
attendance, shall find the Lord a bountiful rewarder: their ceasing from labor
for doing him service, shall be for their profit, they shall be gainers thereby.

Lastly, If there had been none other reason or motive to stir us up unto
Obedience in a careful keeping of the seventh day unto the Honor of Good, yet
this alone which the Lord has given in the Close of this Commandment should
suffice; The Lord has Sanctified it: God has Instituted it. But when the Lord
has given us such a special Charge of remembering the Sabbath Day to Sanctify
it, and has so plainly pointed out unto us what the day is which he will have
us to Sanctify, that none may plead Ignorance about the time, and how many
words the Lord used in prohibiting all works, and in the enumeration of all
degrees prohibited: laying down also the equity hereof, and his own example
together, with his Blessing it and his Sovereign Institution hereof: how can
any without palpable Ignorance, or wilful Rebellion plead Ignorance of the
Sabbath? or knowing it, not yield ready Obedience thereto?

A POSTCRIPT TO THE READER.
I Pray thee when thou have read this Tract, consider seriously, whether the
day of rest, the Seventh day in this Law commanded to be observed do relate to
the six days of Gods Work, or to the six days of man's labor. It cannot relate
to the six days of Gods work, and so be the day of Gods Rest, unless the day of
Gods Rest, and the Jews Sabbath day be the same, and begin in all places at
Sunsetting wherever the Jews did or ought to observe their Sabbath; which
cannot possibly be, except the Earth be plain; as I have showed: Or except the
day of Gods rest did at the first, and does begin sooner in some places than in
other, and so first at one particular place when it was no where else the day
of Gods Rest, either East or West thereto. Both which are so against reason,
that no understanding man will hold either.

But if thou find that the seventh day Commanded does relate (as truly it
does) to the six days of labor with men, and so must be the day following
their six weekdays of labor wherever they live: then consider whether
Sunday, be not as truly the day following the six days of labor with
Christians as Saturday was with the Jews; and as truly the seventh day with
Christians, and by the express words of this Law commanded to be kept Holy: as
the Saturday was with the Jews? If so; what cause (think thou) have Jews,
Antinomians, Libertines, or any other to Scandalize, or say of Christians, that
they do not, nor at any time have observed the true time, and day Commanded of
God in this Law?

FINIS.
