By the King.
A PROCLAMATION For the due Payment of the Subsidy and Aulnage upon all Woollen
Clothes and Draperies.
CHARLES R.

CHARLES By the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all Our loving Subjects of England, Greeting.
Whereas Our Royal Grandfather, King James of Blessed Memory, by His several
Letters Patents, grounded upon several Acts of Parliament, bearing Date the
Thirteenth day of April, in the Eleventh year of His Reign, did Nominate and
Appoint Lodowick Late Duke of Richmond and Lenox to be Aulnager, for the
Surveying, Measuring, Searching, and Sealing of all sorts of Vendible Woollen
Clothes, and Stuffs made of Wool, or part of Wool, as well of the Old as of the
New Draperies: And also made and Appointed Him the said Lodowick Duke of
Richmond and Lenox Collector and Farmer of the Subsidies, moiety of
Forfeitures, and Duties, due to Us and Our Royal Progenitors, as parcel of the
Ancient Revenue of the Crown of England, for and touching the same, To Have,
Hold, and Enjoy the same, to the said Duke, His Executors, Administrators, and
Assigns, under a great yearly Rent, payable, and Reserved upon the said Letters
Patents, for diverse years then and yet to come: And whereas, the Right and
Interest in the said Offices and Farm is Vested in certain Trustees, To the use
of, and in Trust for, Our Right Trusty and entirely beloved Cozen Charles, Duke
of Richmond and Lenox, We taking notice, That the said Duties of Subsidy and
Aulnage, as well for the New Draperies as the Old, have for many years before,
and until the beginning of the late Wars, been duly and orderly Collected, and
Paid to the said Aulnager, His Substitutes, Deputies, and Assigns, and that
since the Late Wars, diverse Clothiers and others, taking Liberty to themselves
by the disorder of the late Times, have, and still do, put, set, and send to
Sell, diverse Clothes and Stuffs of the Old and New Draperies, without payment
of the said Subsidy due to Us, or of the Aulnagers Fee, and before the Seals
appointed for the same are affixed to the said Clothes and Draperies, contrary
to the Laws and Statutes of this Our Realm, Whereby the said Aulnager, and His
said Trustees, are disabled from paying the said Rent reserved upon the said
Letters Patents, and a great Arrear is incurred and become due to Us, and the
Denial and non-payment of the said Subsidy, manifestly tends to the lessning
and diminution of Our said Ancient Revenue: Wherefore Minding and Intending
Remedy and Redress to be had in this behalf, We do by this Our Proclamation
Command, Publish, and Require all Clothiers and Others, whom this Our
Proclamation may concern, That they from henceforth pay the said Subsidy and
Aulnage, due and to be paid, by the Laws and Statutes of this Our Realm, as
well for the Old Draperies as the New, in such Manner and Proportion as has
been formerly Used and Accustomed, and as by the Laws and Statutes of this
Realm, the same of Right are due and payable, unto Our said Aulnager, and
Collector of the said Subsidy, His Deputies and Substitutes; And that they, nor
any of them, do presume to put, send, or set to Sale, any Clothes,
Half-Clothes, Pieces of Clothes, Kerseys, and Freezes, called or known by the
name of the Old Draperies, or any Bays, Says, Serges, Stuffs, or other
Draperies whatsoever, called or known by the name of the New Draperies, before
payment of the said Subsidy and Aulnagers Fee, as by the Laws and Statutes of
this Realm the same of Right are due and payable, under the Pains and Penalties
thereupon ensuing, and as they will answer the contrary at their Perils. And
Our Will and Pleasure is, and We do hereby straightly Charge and Command all
Mayors, Bailiffs, Justices of Peace, Head-boroughs, Constables, and other Our
Officers, Ministers, and loving Subjects whatsoever, That they be Ayding and
Assisting, to Our said Aulnager and Collector of the said Subsidy, His Deputy
and Deputies, and every of them, in and by all lawful ways and means
whatsoever, for the due Execution of the said Offices, and Collection of the
said Subsidy, as they tender Our Pleasure, and will answer the contrary at
their Perils.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Twenty ninth day of September, in the
Twelfth year of Our Reign.
God save the King.
