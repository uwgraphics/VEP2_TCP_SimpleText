THE ANABAPTISTS CATECHISM.
Question. WHat is your name?

Answer. Anabaptist.

Q. Who gave you that name?

A. The priestly Fathers, and learned Scholars of the world, who study the
profane tongues of Greek and Lataine, and still retain the superstitious
Ceremony of the Hebrew, and use all the languages of the beast.

Q. Why are you called Anabaptists?

A. Because we went naked into the pure water, and were dipped in the holy
streams, where we cleansed our bodies (from the corruption that was before upon
us) in the presence of the Brethren, and the Sisters of the Congregation.

Q. Why was the Congregation present at that time?

A. To be witnesses of the promises which the Dippers then caused me to make.

Q. What were the promises that were made between you and the Congregation?

A. First, that I should forsake all the learned, and renounce the wise, and
men of understanding, to follow the Communion of Fools, and simple people, and
that all things may be common among us.

Secondly, that I should believe a sister, and take her word, and she mine,
without the abominable ceremony of Marriage.

Thirdly, that I should keep the secrets of all the Brethren, and Sisters, and
walk in the same all the days of my life.

Q. Do thou not think that thou art bound to all that thou have promised?

A. Yes truly, and (had I nothing else to bind me) it is tie enough to keep the
favors of our loving company.

Q. Which is the way to keep still in favor with them?

A. To be constant (against all reason) in the maintenance and defense of their
opinions.

Q. What be the opinions of the Anabaptists?

A. The Anabaptists are of opinion that they may do what they will if
conscience moves them to it, and they are of opinion that infants are not fit
to be baptized, nor received into the Communion and brotherly fellowship, till
they be of bigness fit to accompany with; And that men and women have no souls
more than their life blood. Also that what the conscience approves of, cannot
be ill, and that all men and women who are not of this mind, are the profane
of the world, who have not any power at all to command us to any thing against
our consciences.

Q. Are all Independants of your opinion?

A. No, none but only Anabaptists.

Q. Why, are not you Independants?

A. Yes, but Independants differ in judgment.

Q. What is the main thing that you and Independants d^ffer in?

A. We differ very much from them, for though you call them Independants (a
name too honorable for them, yet) they are none, for they do allow of laws,
and orders, and blacke-coats, and profane learning, and superstitious
preaching in Pulpits, and many such things the Independants approve of, but we
dare not allow of any such things.

Q. If you cast off all order, by what Discipline do you walk?

A. Discipline I do you talk to us of Discipline? what do you think we
cannot walk without Discipline: alas! alas! we have a liberty (which the rest
of the world are ignorant of) there is never a one of us but may follow what
Discipline he thinks in his own conscience is best and that's a pleasant
Discipline.

Q. How can you agree together, and continue your meeting, without some manner
of Order, or Discipline, to do it by?

A. Why, let me tell you, there is so much correspondency in affection amongst
us, that all the Brethren, and the Sisters, will agree, they are resolved upon
that, so soon as they are made Anabaptists. After which they will not in any
case offend the consciences of the weak, in any thing tending to the further
kindling of the love of one to another.

Q. What Customs have you in your meetings? have you no laws?

A. Customs, oh fie upon them, they are Popish, we hate the very name of
superstitious Customs and laws are a burden that we cannot bear.

Q. What then is the rule by which you walk?

A. We are a freeborn people, and have privileges above all rule.

Q. How many privileges have you?

A. Ten.

Q. Which be they?

A. 1. That all the goods, husband, wife, and all things whatsoever, any of the
Congregation have is in common to all. 2. That we are free from bowing down
under the yoke of man's Law, and Rule, and all obedience, and subjection
whatsoever. 3. That we are free from all oaths and covenants, either with the
King, Parliament, or People, so we keep promise amongst our selves. 4. We are
privileged from the burden of the Sabbath, and are not strict in observing of
it, every man is left to himself, to keep it, or not to keep it, as he will
himself. 5. We give no honor, nor respect to one more than to another; but
are (without all difference of persons) hale fellow, well met, when we are
together. 6. We are free from bloodshed, and will not kill, no not a Lowse;
nor do we hold it fit that any should be punished for his infirmities. 7. No
man is to lie with his brothers wife, whilst her husband is in presence, except
he be fast asleep, or dead drunk. 8. Whosoever desires to live without taking
pains, to get his living by his trade and calling, he may go from house to
house, to be releeved with all that he can get. 9. None of the fellowship dare
presume to disclose the secrets of our Conventicles to the profane, lest the
world render us more odious than they do already. 10. None of the Fellowship is
to keep his house, his table, his wife, his servant, his estate, or any thing
he has, for himself; but is to let any member of the Congregation partake
with him of all things in common.


Q. What use do you make of these privileges?

A. We have two special benefits by them; first, in having a share in the
Brethrens goods; and secondly, in having a right in the Sisters affections.

Q. How do you do to get to share with the brethren in their goods?

A. We go to the Pastor, and he procures any thing for us that we want.

Q. In what way do you address your selves to the Sisters?

A. We put off our hats, and make them a leg, look devoutly upon them smiling,
with our sparkling eyes, enough to enamour a Lady.

Q. Who are your Preachers, and what are they?

A. There are diverse: viz. Mr. Patience, an honest Glover; Mr. Griffin, a
reverend Tailor; Mr. Knowles, a learned Scholar; Mr. Spilsbey, a renowned
Cobbler; Mr. Barber, a Button-maker, and diverse others, most gallant Teachers,
well grounded in their opinions.

Q. Where are your places of meeting?

A. We have many places, and are glad when we can meet quietly in any of them.

Q. But have you not some joviall meetings, where you use to be merry
sometimes?

A. Yes, that we have.

Q. Where is that?

A. At Westminster.

Q. Where there?

A. We have met at several places; we met often at a great house in the new
Palace by Westminster Hall; but when we asked the name of the place, they said
it was Hell; O then we hated that profane place, and would never come in it
after: and they say there is a place called Heaven in the Old Palace; but we
could never find that place out, and so we dined since at Adam and Eve.

Q. What had you to dinner?

A. Thus is the List of our Mess: 1 Imprimis. The mumping Crust of an hot
loaf boiled with a Calves head and Bacon. 2 Item. The neck of a young Coney
boiled to a jelly. 3 Item. The shoulder of a grave, long-bearded Goat, stewed
between two dishes, stuffed with Cocks combs, and larded with Goose grease. 4
Item. The breast of a fat Capon well soaked in white broth, stuffed with Dasies
and Cowstips. 5 Item. A loyne of young Mutton well carbonado'd, with a plump
kidney, as round as an apple. 6 Item. The rump of a Woodcock baked with a pair
of Goose gibblets. 7 Item. A Leg of Lamb larded with Trotters, and roasted till
it be as brown as a Berry. 8 Item. A well made and neatly dressed Neats-foot
Pie, full of plums and spices. 9 Item. A dish a Pigs petty-toes stewed in
plumb-broth. 10 Item. A dish of fresh Lobsters soaked all night in vinegar. 11
Item. A sheeps head boiled with wool and horns, for a standing dish for the
brethren. 12 Item. An Humble Pie for the sisters, after the brethren are risen.


Q. What Officers have you in your Church discipline?

A. We have first the Pastor, secondly the Deacon, and thirdly the
Congregation, and none else at all.

Q. What is the office of the Pastor?

A, He teaches and instructs the Congregation; and when any are received
into the fellowship of the Church to walk with him; he examines them, and if
they be found right, then he dips them.

Q. In what manner does he teach you?

A. We meet in some convenient house, and he making choice of the privatest
place that he can in the house, he (after the Deacon has prayed with the
Congregation, and exhorted them) prays, and then preaches an hour or two, or
sometimes three, more or less, as he finds his ghests straitened or enlarged.

Q. Do none come to hear him preach, but only those who are in
Church Fellowship?

A. Yes, if they be brought in by some friend, that we may be sure they come
not to spy us, they may come to heat, or join with us in the Church
contribution, but can partake with us no further.

Q. Must the people do whatsoever he binds them to observe?

A. There is an oath, which is administered to all before they be received into
Church Fellowship with us.

Q. Do you swear all before you receive them into communion with you?

A. Yes, else they are not admitted.

Q. Do other Independants do so?

A. No they have not that policy.

Q. What is it that you make them swear before you admit them to be dipped?

A. 1 We promise and swear to walk with our Brethren and Sisters (in the
Congregation we are received into) with all watchfullnesse, and tenderness,
avoiding all jealousies, censurings, and provokings. 2 To do nothing against
the Members. 3 Not publicly to discover the failings of our Brethren or
Sisters, but attend an orderly call thereunto.


Q. Has the Pastor power to receive whom he will into the Congregation?

A. Yes except the Congregation allege something against the person presented.

Q. In what manner are they dipped when they are received into
Church Fellowship?

A. After the persons to be dipped are exaamined and have declared a sufficient
testimony before the Congregation, and taken the Oath, the Pastor, that is the
Dipper, takes the person that is to be dipped, and goes with him or her
whether it be man or woman into the water, and there setting one hand upon the
back, and the other upon the head, dips the said person quite over head and
ears, and then leads him or her so dipped by the arm out of the water, and
presents them to the Congregation, who receive them as Members of their
Congregation.

Q. What is the Deacons office amongst the Anabaptists?

A. To gather the Contributions of the Church, and take care to see the
Congregation provided for, and if any person of the Congregation be in trouble,
to labor and use all the means he can to get him free.

Q. What is it that is in the power of the Congregation?

A. Whatsoever is done, is confirmed by the approbation of them, for against
their consent the Pastor and Deacon has not power to do any thing.

Q. In whose power then is the Ordinance of marriage?

A. There are many things required in the order of marriage before it be done.

Q. What are those things that are required?

A. 1 That both parties be Anabaptists. 2 That both parties be agreed. 3 That
they have the consent of the Church. And fourthly, that they be married
according to the way of the Church with which they walk.


Q. Why must both parties be Anabaptists?

A. Because the one being so, it would be of evil consequence to be yoked with
the wicked that have not been rebaptised.

Q. How far must the parties (to be married) be agreed?

A. To their well liking one of the other without forcing either of them by
violence to marry one that he or she cannot love.

Q. Which is the way of marriage in the Anabaptists Church?

A. Both parties coming before the Congregation they join hands and taking
each other for man and wife, promising to live and dye together, and so kiss
and are made man and wife.

Q. And what is your order of burial for the dead?

A. When any person is dead, we invite our neighbors, and friends, and having
served them with wine and biscuit, or diet-bread or sugar-plums as all others
do, we go together and when we come to the grave the bearers put the corpse
into the grave and so we part without any more Ceremony or trouble.

A brief Discourse between an Independent and an Anabaptist.
Independent. Of what religion are you?


Anabaptist. I am one of those commonly called Anabaptists. I pray you what
religion are you of?


Indep. I am one of those called Independents.


Anab. I am very glad I have so seasonably met with you brother, we should
rejoice in one another; for you know we suffer, and are reproached by the
wicked.


Indep. But it is long of you Anabaptists, that we suffer so as we do, under
many honest meaning men, who know not the difference between us and you.


Anab. Why, both you and we are Independents, and we desire the liberty of
conscience as you do, though we differ in some things.


Indep. We deny to be Independents, though they call us so, because you and
other factious people are so; common people not knowing the difference; we do
not desire any liberty of conscience further than Gods word will bear,
abhorring that false doctrine which you do daily broach among you. There is
more difference between us and you, than between you and the Papists.


Anab. But I pray you tell me why you do charge us so high, for what cause do
you do it?


Indep. You do not only teach to your own disciples, but print, and publish
blasphemies, and profane, scurrillous, and naughty things, and the
generallitie of the people take us and you to be all one, and so we are hardly
thought on for your sakes, though we abhor, and do utterly disclaim your
wretched and horrible impiety therein,


Anab. Why, but you know that the common people envy you as much as us; and in
that relation you stand in opposition to them just as we do: and therefore why
should there be any difference between us amongst our selves?


Indep. I tell you, it is your unjust ways, your blasphemous tenets, and base
libells, that have given just offense, and most people believe we are such as
you, they not knowing the difference between us, you calling your selves
Independants, as they call us: and I tell you, we do protest as much against
you, as ever we did against the Bishops; and therefore I will leave you, and
desire to have nothing to do with you, and so adieu.


FINIS.
