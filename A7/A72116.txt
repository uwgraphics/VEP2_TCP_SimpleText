The Contents of a Bill, preferred by the Creditors of Thomas Frith, late of
London Scriuenor, deceased, for sale of certain Lands and Leases by him
purchased, for payment of such Moneys, as was owing by him unto them, and are
yet unpaid.
The Preamble.
WHereas the said Frith (being a Putter forth of much money for other men at
Interest) after he had got such credit, that many men trusted him with great
Sums upon his own Security, and others became bound with him; and had
purchased in Lands and Leases, above 1600 pounds per Annum: He was arrested
and laid in the Fleet, whence he procured himself to be removed, into the
Prison of the Kings Bench; where he became Felo de se. Sithence whose death,
neither the said Lands nor Leases were forfeited by his Felony, nor yet
subject to the payment of his Debts (for some were conuayed over to other men
in trust, some were purchased partly in the name of his Wife, and partly in the
names of his Children, and other some were morgaged for moneys borrowed) but
are enjoyed, partly by his Wife and Children, and partly by color of a Decree,
and virtue of an Iniunction; which Decreeis made in show for all the said
Creditors, but indeed for Three of them only: So that those Creditors, to whom
the said Decree in show only does extend, and who in equity ought also to
enjoy the benefit thereof, are utterly defeated of their debts; whereby some of
them are sithence become decayed in their estates, other suffer imprisonment
for his the said Friths debts, others have perished in Prison for the same, and
others are in imminent danger utterly to be undone, and also there to perish:
Except that by his Majesty's most gracious favor, they may be relieved out of
those Lands and Leases aforesaid; Wherefore the said Creditors are most humble
Suitors, that it may be enacted:

The Act, containing Nine Branches.
viz. such as have been either high Shirifes of Essex (where most of the said
Lands do lie) or such as be Common Council men, or called to be Shirifes of
London) And that those Commissioners, or the most part of them, may have
authority to call before them, all such of the said Creditors, as shall within
three months next after this Session of Parliament, have their names entered in
the Assurance Office, in the Royal Frith, either by matter of record, or the
oaths of such as any of them have formerly produced, or shall produce, to
prove the same; And shall examine upon oath, either the said Creditors
themselves, or any other, how much of those Debts are or is unpaid: And shall
cause thereupon a Schedule indented to be made, containing the same Debts so
proved and unpaid, and the names unto whom they be owing: Of which Schedule,
one part to be left at the Capital Message of the Manor of Vpminster in
Essex; and the other part to remain with any of the said Commissioners: And
shall, within six weeks after the leaving thereof at the Message aforesaid,
cause a Writing thereof to be published, on some Sabbath day, after Divine
Service, in the Parish Church of Vpminster; and afterward cause the same
Writing, to be fixed to the door of the same Church, to the end the Wife and
Children of the Frith, may have notice thereof. And if neither the said Wife
nor Children, shall, within Three months after the Publication and leaving of
the said Schedule, pay nor cause to be paid, unto all and every the said
Creditors named in the said Schedule, respectively the Debts so specified in
the same Schedule; Then the said Commissioners shall cause a Jury to be
empannelled, and inquire what Lands, Annuities, and Leases, the said Frith, or
any other in trust, were seized or possessed of, at the time of his death, and
what Lands, Annuities, and Leases, he had purchased in his own name, or in the
name of any other in trust (whether the Deeds thereof made, do express the
same trust or not) which were and did remain in them, or any of them, at the
time of his decease, and where the same do lie, and in whose occupation they,
or any part of them, shall be then remaining. And thereof, or of so much
thereof, as shall be found sufficient to satisfy the said Debts, with such
damages as the said Commissioners shall give and allow (if the same will
afford so much) the said Commissioners, or the greater part of them, shall by
Frith, to be divided amongst them as the said Commissioners shall think meet.
And upon payment of such moneys, as shall be paid to any of the said Creditors
by virtue of that Act and of the said Commission, the Security and Assurance
of every Frith, etc. all and every their former right, etc. And lastly, that
all and every Clause, Article, and thing contained in the same Act, may be
construed, deemed, and taken, to the most avail of such, as shall purchase any
of the said Lands, Annuities, or Leases.
