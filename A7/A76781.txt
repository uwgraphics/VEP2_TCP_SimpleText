BLACK TOM, his Speech to the House, after the delivery of the City by a
cowardly Southwarition crew.
Go on, brave Gallants, pray go on,
Seem to consult for peace,
But if you love your selves and me,
My Army don't release.
What though I do pretend to bring
The King into his Throne,
Fear not I may do what I please,
Militia that is our own?
By crying up his Majesty
The peoples hearts I gain,
What think you? that is the only way
If ere we mean to reign.
Their twenty hundred thousand pound
My soldiers for to pay,
Which when they have they will do their best
These wars for to delay*
We Will tell them that the Citizens
Poor CHARLES do much despise,
And should we state him in his throne,
They suddenly would rise.
When twenty hundred thousand pounds
Again to them is due,
Weell stop their mouths with flattering words,
Which shall be for me and you.
Then I brave Southwarke will requite,
My promise to effect,
Of all the Independents they
A Major shall elect.
Besides this, they shall suddenly
A Corporation have,
For that brave entertaynment which
They to my soldiers gave.
Thus having them now on our sides
Weell make an insurrection
Of all that Presbyterian crew.
Not one shall find protection*
But when that Independency
By us shall be promoted
There is no need of Monarchy
Its downfall shall be Voted.
Weel then poor CHARLES send into France
With his wife to abide,
He absent, betwixt me and you
The Kingdom we will divide.
It Will be a conquest certainly
If ere a conquest were,
We Will rule in triumph and will cause
All others us to fear.
But as for English men who then
Shall Independents be,
Troubled by none they shall enjoy
Their conscience Liberty.
Then shall proud Massy stamp and stare,
And Poyntz shall frantic be.
Then will the Major of London flee,
And all for fear of me.
Then Peter's shall a Bishop be,
And Goodwin shall be Voted
The chiefest man in England while
King Thomas is promoted.
Then down shall go the Steeple houses,
That freeze in Winter night,
And weell have Chimneyes in the Church
Which people more delight.
Weell Vote the Assembly null, and put
Down Cranford with his grace,
Weell race out Calamy, and set
Up Patience in his place.
Weell banish Case with all his host,
His converts shall return
Unto our Independency,
Or else weel make them burn.
Then you and I shall live at ease,
And think that naught's a sin,
Unless we do in English coast
Let Monarchy creep in.
If you desire that this my plot
May have effect still still,
Take daily care that peoples hearts
With thoughts of peace to fill.
FINIS.
