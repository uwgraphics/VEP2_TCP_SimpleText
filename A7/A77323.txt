AND The Prisoners comfort in distress.

When he was a prisoner in London, in Chap. 49. the Reader may take notice of,

I. His Observations of many passages in prison, during his being there. II.
The several humors and carriages of his fellow Prisoners. III. His advice to
them, and to some of his and their kin, and unkind friends. IV. Gods singular
care and providence over all distressed prisoners, that put their trust in him
in all afflictions.
PSALM. 94. 19. In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight
my soul. Written by William Bagwell Merchant.

LONDON, Printed for Richard Wodenothe, at the Star under Peter's Church in
Cornhill. 1645.

To the Worshipful William Barkeley, Alderman of London, and one of the
Commissioners for the receipt of Customs.
Worthy Sir:
I Have in my troubles (among other things) observed that when the Lord Job 12.
5.
deprives a man of the superfluous things of this life, Lam. 3. 2.
and brings him into distress, Pro. 19. 7.
his friends and acquaintance are then wanting unto him, Psalm. 38. 11.
they stand aloof, Job 10. 1.
and leave him to himself, being (in their opinions) in so miserable a state
and condition; Deuteronomy. 8. 5.
this is the usual manner of Gods dealing with those whom he loves, for by
this means, 2 Cor. 4. 16.
though the outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. But
when the Lord is graciously pleased to Jonah. 4. 6.
deliver the party afflicted from his grief, Psalm. 90. 15.
he is exceeding glad, and then his Job 42. 11.
friends and acquaintance rejoice with him, and express their love and
affections toward him in a bountiful manner: Psalm. 116. 5, 6.
this have I (through Gods goodness) known by experience, especially these
latter times: Psalm. 5. 12.
for many are the courtesies which I have received from diverse friends, 1 Cor.
16. 18
the which I shall ever acknowledge. But the truth is, the continuance of Psalm.
112. 5.
your great favors, is such a happiness to me, as I must needs confess you
are to me more like a Job 29. 16.
father then a friend or master. And therefore an so much the more obliged unto
you. Pro. 18. 24.
In testimony thereof, and of the true love and service I owe you, I humbly
dedicate to you these first fruits of my poor endeavors, gathered in my
aforesaid troubles, (when I was Jer. 32. 2.
shut up in a miserable place from the delights of the world) out of Cant. 5. 1.
the spiritual garden of Gods Word; wherefore my hope is you will Psalm. 119.
103.
relish them so much the better, and vouchsafe them your kind acceptance,
though published by so weak an Instrument as my self, whose further
endeavors (notwithstanding) shall be to do somewhat more some other way, that
may conduce to the public welfare, as God (the Jam. 1. 5. 17.
liberal giver of al good gifts) shall enable me: To whom I commit both you and
all yours, and remain,

Your Worships most humble servant, William Bagwell.

The Epistle to the courteous Reader.
IT is not unknown to many, how that of late years I Eccles 2. 24.
enjoyed the blessings of this life with much comfort, and how I then lived in
good credit, being much respected of friends and kindred who Psalm. 55. 14.
delighted in my company, and many were as glad to receive courtesies from me,
as I was willing to bestow them. Pro. 23. 24.
But this lasted not long, for after a while Job 3. 26.
I fell into many troubles, and then Psalm. 107. 27.
I lost my self, Job 19. 14.
and my friends, I lost my Pro. 23. 5.
estate, my Psalm. 7. 5.
credit, and Rev. 18. 17.
trading, and after that to make up the Tragedy, I lost my liberty, being Mat.
18. 30.
cast into prison for a small debt, which I was not able to pay, and being
there a while ( 1 Samuel 30. 4.
at the center of all my troubles and miseries) Psalm 69 20.
destitute of all outward comforts, did then begin to think Psalm. 39. 5.
of the vanities of the world, Eccles 2. 17.
and Psalm. 25. 1.
lifting up my soul to God, Psalm. 37 4.
desired him to give me some inward comfort, which was not in vain, for being
Pro. 3. 6.
directed by him, I found Romans 12. 12.
patience, 2 Cor. 1. 12.
and peace of conscience: I found Heb. 13. 5.
contentment, and 10. 24.
love and Job 10. 12.
favor, I found Jam. 1. 2.
joy of heart, Ephesians. 4. 23.
and liberty of mind, so that at length more thought Phil. 3. 8.
I found a great deal more then I lost, all which by a diligence John 5. 39.
search I found out of Gods Word the holy Bible, which was the only Book I
had (for in my necessities I was forced to pawn and sell away all my other
books) Wherefore Acts 17. 11.
I applying my self wholly thereunto, found therein such 2 Timothy 3. 16.
variety of matter ( Psalm. 119. 9^. 143.
wherewith my soul was so delighted) that I could not be quiet in my mind
until I had set up a new trade, (for, for want of other employment I was fain
to turn Poet) and although I was very Heb. 5. 13.
unskilful therein, being but a 1 Pet. 2. 2.
new beginner) yet my endeavors were not wanting to give the best content I
could to all my customers both at home and abroad. Yet notwithstanding all
this, in regard I could not procure so much as would discharge my chamber rent,
I was threatened by my Landlord (the Master of the Prison) to be turned out of
my lodging and put into a Act. 5. 18.
worse place in the same prison, which did in some sort trouble my mind,
because I knew not how to prevent it. But whilst I was musing with my self
how I should Jer. 37* 20.
be able to endure that misery, Jer. 38* 8, 9.
the Lord raised me up a friend in another Kingdom, Jer. 38. 13.
by whose means I was forthwith delivered out of that distress, and set at
liberty.

Since which time till now of late I was not resolved to publish these the
first fruits of my poor endeavors: but being thereunto moved by some friends,
and considering Romans 15. 4.
the substance thereof drawn from the holy Scriptures so agreeable to each
circumstance, I could not but conceive them worthy of acceptance, and the
rather because people Act. 13. 26.
of all sorts, whether they be young or old, male or female, rich or poor,
whether they live in prosperity or adversity, whether they be sick or in
health, they may observe and suck some sweetness out of them, although they
seem to be never so plain, I know they are 2 Cor. 3. 12.
very plain, and therefore may peradventure be by some curious wits the less
regarded, but those who are of Psalm 34. 2.
an humble spirit, will like them never a whit the worse for that, but rather
conclude and say (according to the old Proverb) that plain dealing is a
jewel, and make good use thereof 1 Cor. 10. 31
to Gods glory, and their Psalm. 119. 50
own comfort.

To conclude: 2 Chronicles. 33. 12, 13.
The Prison was the best School that ever I went to, and Mat. 22. 16.
he that taught me, the best Master that ever taught, the book I learned in 2 Timothy 3. 15.
the best book that ever was read, the lesson I learned out of that book,
Phil. 4. 11.
the best lesson that ever I learned, and the time I spent there 2 Chronicles. 33.
12, 13.
the best time that ever I spent. An account of all which I have briefly and
plainly set down in the ensuing particular directions contained in this small
Volume, which I humbly present to all those that Pro. 2. 3, 4, 5.
desire the knowledge of Psalm. 119. 162
Gods word, the only Psalm 9. 9.
refuge for the distressed and afflicted, and chiefest joy and Psalm. 119. 16
delight to those that are in prosperity, who count themselves but Psalm. 119.
19 Heb. 11. 13.
strangers in this world, setting little by the things of greatest price (they
enjoy here) in comparison of those Luke 12. 33.
heavenly treasures above which are not seen.

Now although it be but a little Luke 11. 33.
candle (which I thought not good to keep secret any longer) yet it gives so
much light as the Reader may thereby see and observe that this work is none of
mine, the maine substance and matter is Gods own word. In the labor of
disposing and ordering them, I have used my best skill, and if you please to
accept of them, I shall then think my time well spent for the good of others
as well as my self: Desiring the Lord to bless and prosper all our good
endeavors, that we may Acts 23 1.
so live in his fear, and John 15. 8.
glorify him in this life, as we may hereafter Romans 14. 8.
dye in his favor, and be Romans 8. 16, 17.
glorified of him in the world to come. Amen.

Yours in all true loving and Christian affection, William Bagwell.

The Preface.
To all Christian people distressed and afflicted in what kind soever.
ALL men naturally Pro. 30. 8.
desire to live peaceably, contentedly, and to be freed from all manner of
Psalm. 143. 11.
troubles, afflictions and distresses ( Pro. 15. 10.
which are so grievous to the senses,) but this happens to none, Job 5. 7.
for every one have their crosses in some kind or other, or at one time or
other, in Psalm. 38. 3.
body or Genesis 26. 35.
mind, or Job 6. 2.
both, Psalm. 144. 7.
either in the having of that which they desire not, or in the Jam. 4. 2.
want of that which they desire, Eccles 9. 2.
all which is common both to the Psalm. 34. 19.
good and to the and 32. 10.
bad, for who can say that his body has been always freed from Mat. 9. 35.
sickness, his soul from Psalm. 13. 2.
sorrow, his person from Heb. 11. 36.
imprisonment or other inconveniences, his state from Psalm. 69. 29.
poverty, or his name from and 119. 22.
contempt, etc? Or what man (though he Eccles 5. 10.
enjoy the outward blessings of this life) can say Eccles 4. 8.
his mind is satisfied and contented therewith, or that he is free from Jer.
6. 13.
covetousness, Esther 6. 7. 8. 9.
ambition, Esaias 39. 2.
vainglory, 2 Timothy 3. 2.
self-conceit, Pro. 20. 6.
or some other such like Col. 3. 5.
inordinate affections of the mind, with the which he Esth. 5. 9. 13.
afflicts himself, Eccles 6. 2.
and is an evil disease? The other (happening by Gods providence to those that
Psalm. 103. 7.
are acquainted with his ways) Heb. 12. 6.
are evident signs of Gods love toward them, which is the reason 1 Samuel 3. 18.
they submit themselves so willingly to undergo them, knowing that Psalm. 119.
71
they are the seed, the occasion, the matter of well doing, Romans 5. 3, 4, 5
and the discoverers of many excellent virtues which are not seen in them
Deuteronomy. 6. 10, 11, 12.
whilst they live in prosperity: And therefore although Dan. 9. 16.
adversity be the punishment of sin, yet Acts 28. 4.
God in punishing of men does not always John 9. 3.
respect sin, wherefore Luke 13. 2, 3, 4, 5.
they judge rashly which either do not wait for the Job 42. 12.
end, or do judge and Jam. 2. 2, 3, 4
esteem of men according to prosperity or adversity. But when men Job 29 7, 8.
that have lived in good reputation and credit Job 30. 11.
are once fallen into trouble and misery, Psalm. 88 18.
then their beloved friends and acquaintance fall away from them, and Job 14.
13.
the more Psalm. 32. 4.
heavy Gods hand is upon them, the more Job 16. 2.
they neglect and Psalm. 22. 6.
despise them, but when they find by experience Psalm. 60. 11.
the helplesnesse of earthly things, they are then weaned 1 John 2. 15.
from the love of the world, and kept from Zeph. 2. 15.
living carelessly, Hos. 5. 15.
they draw the nearer to God, knowing that Heb. 12. 7.
they are tokens and pledges of their adoption. And considering with themselves
that their Job 5. 6, 7.
afflictions come not unto them by chance, 1 These. 3. 3.
but from Gods decree and appointment, and that the Rev. 2 10.
continuance and Jer. 46. 28.
measure of them is appointed by him, they then never Psalm. 11^ 6.
stand much upon the malice of men, or Rev. 2. 10.
rage of Devils, but Psalm. 5. 3.
look up principally to him with this Dan 3. 17.
assurance, that he will deliver them Jer. 30. 11.
when his measure is full, 2 Pet. 2. 9.
in good time. In the mean while, their Heb. 11. 17.
faith, Jam. 5. 11.
patience, 2 Chr. 33. 12.
humility, Heb. 11. 8.
obedience, and such like noble Phil. 4. 8, 9.
virtues are set a work, and John 15. 8.
God in them 1 Pet. 4. 14.
glorified.

But few men have this great gift and privilege to Jam. 1. 12.
suffer afflictions patiently. Every Job 1. 9, 10.
hypocrite will serve God whilst he prospers and blesses him, 1 Samuel 28. 15
but when he falls into troubles he is then led by the devil to impatiency,
Pro. 19 3.
fretting, Ex. 15. 23, 24
murmuring, Psalm. 59. 15.
grudging, Esaias 57. 17.
frowardness, 1 Samuel 18. 20
and most painful pensiveness, Esaias 9. 1.
all which do vex him more by many degrees, then the troubles themselves, and
when he Esaias 65. 14.
cries for help, it is either pain or Fx. 10. 16, 17
fear that causes him so to do, so that Jer. 6. 10.
he cannot rest upon Gods word with Jer. 16. 5.
peace. The child of God Job 3. 3. 20.
may likewise be Jer. 20. 14. etc
very impatient in his afflictions, and utter Job 30. 21.
dangerous speeches, by which means he may for a time have Genesis 37. 35.
no comfort in trouble, but John 14. 18.
God leaves him not so to himself always comfortless, but has a time to
Psalm. 39. 13.
recover himself again, and Psalm. 118. 21
then he praises the Lord who often times Psalm. 89 31, 32
inflicteth upon his children temporal afflictions, 2 Cor. 4. 17.
that he may deliver them from eternal destruction. And herein does the
wisdom and Psalm. 27. 13.
goodness of God appear, for 2 Cor. 1. 8, 9.
by afflictions we come to the knowledge of our selves, and repose Mic. 7. 5.
no confidence in any creature, and likewise wise to the 2 Chr. 33. 13
knowledge of God, reposing all 2 Samuel 22. 3. Nah. 1. 7.
trust and confidence in him, and thus Psalm. 119. 71.
affliction begets understanding in those that are afflicted, in so much
that the Mar. 8. 34, 35
cross is to the children of God mercy, and Mat. 10. 39.
loss is gain, Phil. 3. 7.
afflictions are their schooling, and Psalm. 31. 7.
adversity their best Universitie, by which they learn how to Pro. 4. 14, 15.
avoid the dangerous Mat 7. 13.
broad way of the wicked of this 1 John 2. 16.
world, which is so Eccles 2. 8.
pleasing to flesh and blood, and are turned into the Mat. 22. 16. Pro. 15. 24.
right way to heaven, which in regard of its Mat. 7. 14:
narrowness and straitness, so few desire to walk therein. This being Psalm.
50. 22.
considered, there are none able to go through the Psalm. 86. 17.
troubles and crosses of this life with comfort, Mar. 3. 34.
but such as utterly mistrusting 1 Cor. 10. 12
their own assuredness and Psalm. 146. 3.
all worldly aid and help of man, and 37 7.
do wholly depend upon Psalm. 62. 2.
Gods defense. But there are some which complain of the Psalm. 13. 1.
tediousness of their afflictions, because they are afflicted almost Genesis 47.
9.
all the days of their lives even to the very death. To such Esaias 41. 10.
God will testify his holy presence another, way namely by 1 Cor. 10. 13
giving the distressed parties power and strength to bear their afflictions.
But how can we 2 Cor. 4 17.
count our afflictions so tedious and long, Job 14. 1.
seeing our lives are so short? howsoever Neh. 1. 3.
let them be never so great and tedious, they are Ezra 9. 13.
far inferior to our sins; yet every man by nature Psalm. 40. 17. and 69. 17.
desires Gods ready help in his necessities and troubles, but few attain unto
it, because they Mat. 30. 31.
want faith to believe it, Mar. 11. 24.
prayer to obtain it, and 2 King. 6. 33
patience to wait for it. But on the contrary, if they James 5. 11.
endure their afflictions quietly, Psalm. 13 5.
trust in Gods mercies firmly, Esaias 40. 31.
and tarry his good pleasure obediently, then although they seem to be Psalm.
57 3.
swallowed up in misery, they shall find Psalm. 46. 1.
the Lord ready at hand to deliver them. Now 2 Cor. 4. 8.
howsoever the child of God be afflicted he shall find Psalm. 23. 4.
many comforts therein, in regard they are like unto a Esaias 25. 4.
storm that comes and goes. Let no man therefore that is afflicted Esaias 41.
11.
struggle under Gods hand, for then it will be the worse for him, for Jer. 50*
24.
there is no striving or wrestling with him Exodus 32. 10, 11, 14.
but by Genesis 32. 9, 10. 11.
prayer: he therefore that with Col. 1. 11.
pleasure and joy endures adversity Romans 8. 36.
for Christ's sake, may think he has found the Luke 17. 21.
Kingdom of Heaven here on earth, Psalm. 149. 4.
and God will delight in him. Cant. 7. 6.
For as the fish is sweetest that lives in the saltest waters, Psalm. 72. 14.
so those Psalm. 49. 8.
souls are most precious unto Christ who are most Heb. 12. 11.
exercised and Heb. 12. 6.
afflicted with his Cross.

Thine in Christ. W. B.

THE MERCHANT DISTRESSED, HIS OBSERVATIONS.
CHAP. I.
To the comfortless Prisoner.
BE not Esaias 41. 10
dismayed, thou that art lodged here:
What need'st thou care, if thy Pro. 15. 15.
conscience be clear? Ecclus. 14. 2. Acts 24. 16.

Thy 2 King 4. 1.
Creditors perhaps may be unkind:
What though? fear not, but bear an Psalm. 15. 2.
honest mind. Heb. 13. 18.

Psalm. 88. 18.
Thy friends and thine acquaintaince may neglect thee: Ecclus. 6. 12.

What though? be Jam. 5. 11.
patient, God will not 2 Chro. 33. 12. 13
forget thee. Ps. 9. 18.

Acts 12. 6.
The Prison doubtless is a place of care:
What though? rejoice, Genesis 39. 21
for God is with thee there.
Genesis 40. 14
Use lawful means, Psalm. 37. 5.
and on God still depend:
Ps 71. 20. 21.
He Will quickly bring thy troubles to an end. Luke 18. 8.
Psalm. 31. 2.

CHAP. II.
To the cruel Creditor.
WHy is thy mind so bent to Mat. 18. 28.
cruelty Ps. 71. 4. Pro. 11. 17.

Against thy poor Debtor, which here does lie?
a King. 4. 1.
Is it thy debt thou would have him to pay?
Alas, Mat. 18. 25. and
he cannot, the v. 30.
prison's not the way.
What is it, his Psalm. 27. 2.
flesh thou then would have alone? Micah 3. 2.

The Job 19. 26.
worms must needs have that to feed upon.
What is it then, his Micah 3. 3.
bones thou would feign have?
That cannot be, Josh. 24. 32. 2 Samuel 21. 14.
they must go to the grave.
What would thou do with them? make dice to sell?
Or with them play away thy soul to hell?
As for his soul, surely thou can not have it;
For that must needs Eccles. 12. 7.
return to God that gave it.
Mat. 6. 15.
Do thou by this course ever think to thrive,
Psalm. 31. 12
To bury thy poor debtor here alive?
Mat. 18. 12
Ten thousand talents to the Lord thou ow'st,
And yet he is Mat. 18. 27.
merciful to thee thou know.
Pro. 21 13. Job. 19. 21.
And have thou no pity on him in thrall,
That owes thee but Mat. 18. 28.
an hundred pence in all?
Mat. 18. 32 33.
If God should deal with thee, as thou with him,
In what great v. 34.
misery then would thou be in?
What if in this case God should take away
Luke 12. 20
Thy soul, and call thee to account this day?
Romans 2. 15. 16.
Thy guilty conscience then would soon accuse thee:
Mat 25. 43
And for thy cruelty Christ would refuse thee.
Mat. 18. 34.
Then into hell that Luke 16. 26.
gulf of misery,
Rev. 20. 10.
Thou should be cast to live eternally, Psalm. 9. 17.

In woeful torments, where Rev. 14. 11.
no rest is found,
And where all such as thou art, are Mat. 22. 13.
fast bound. Rev. 20. 2. 3.

Wherefore if thou those judgments would prevent,
Be Mat. 5 7.
merciful, kind, loving, and Romans 12. 10
repent.
Act. 26. 20
Discharge thy poor debtor out of this place,
Heb. 13. 3.
As thou would be discharged being in his case.
Luke 6. 31.
Then God will mollify thy stony heart.
Ezekiel. 36. 26.
And likewise bless thee wheresoever thou art,
CHAP. III.
To the Prisoner that lay sick upon his bed.
THe Genesis 40 14
Prison of it self is tedious to thee,
Psalm. 6. 2.
But sickness therewithal may quite undo thee. Ecclus. 30. 17.

Where art thou sick, in body or in mind?
Or art thou grieved Ecclus. 22. 21, 22. and 12. 9.
because friends are unkind?
Art not thou sick and pained at the Pro. 13. 12.
heart, Ecclus. 38. 10. Psalm. 55. 4.

Because thou Esaias 24. 22.
can not from this place depart?
Think with thy self, that thy Psalm. 107. 17, 18.
sins are the cause Ecclus. 38. 15.

Of thy disease, by the breach of Gods laws.
Psalm. 6. 3.
Now is thy soul wounded with mortal sin? Psalm. 109. 22.

Hos. 10. 12
Oh then it is high time for thee to begin
Lam. 3. 40.
To look into thy self, and thy condition,
To see what need thou have of the Physician,
I mean the great Mat. 9. 2.
Physician of thy soul,
Which is thy Savior Christ, who does control
Mat. 28. 18.
All things in heaven above, and earth below,
Mat. 9. 6.
He Will cure thy body and thy soul also
Mat. 4. 23.
Of all diseases, if thou him entreat,
And likewise give thee John 6. 51.
heavenly food to ear,
Joh. 6. 54. 58. Psalm. 56. 13. Esaias 55. 2. 3.
Whereby thy soul shall live, and be quite freed
Of all diseases; for it is so decreed.
Luke 8. 43.
Earthly Physicians will not undertake
Physic to give, but for thy moneys sake;
Unless thou give them Angels of pure gold,
They Will not come near thee, be thou young or old:
But when Mar. 2. 17.
Christ thy Physician takes in hand
To cure thy poor sick soul, then understand
He Will not then only take away thy pain,
But cause his Ps. 91. 11.
Angels with thee to remain:
Though thou restrained art, yet they are Psalm. 34. 7.
free
To come both day and night to visit thee.
Wherefore receive from God this chastisement
With Ps. 116. 17.
thankful heart, and therewith be content.
Act. 16. 25. 26.
And then this prison shall not thee annoy,
But be a palace to thee day by day.
Jer. 38. 13
Out of which place the Lord will thee deliver, Pro. 11. 8.

And take thee up to live with him for ever.
CHAP. IV.
To him that betrayed the Prisoner into his Adversaries hands.
WHat trade art thou, oh Traitor! can thou tell?
Is it thy occupation now to sell
Thy friend to one that means him to oppress,
And lay him up to live in great distress?
Psalm. 55. 13, 14. Pro. 26. 25.
Thou came unto him, and did speak him fair,
Which made him often unto thee repair,
Psalm. 41. 9.
Because he did believe what thou did say,
Not thinking then that thou would him betray:
Mat. 26. 15, 16.
But when thou had fit opportunity,
Thou him deliver'dst to his enemy:
Who keeps him fast in prison like a slave,
Which, thou art to be blamed for like a knave.
Mat. 26. 16
But tell me, Traitor, how did thou him sell?
For a French Crown, a Noble, or Angel?
Doubtless thy Chapman gave thee more for him
Then ere he is like to get of him agin.
But why have thou thy friend sold for a song
Which to another justly does belong?
The bargain thou have made must needs be void,
1 Cor. 6. 20
For Christ bought him before, and for him paid.
Wherefore thy Chapman cannot keep him long,
Although he has him in a place so strong.
Gal. 4. 31.
He shall be free, Ps. 69. 33.
for Christ does him regard,
Psalm. 55. 23.
And for thy treachery he will thee reward. Mat. 16. 27.

Take thou example by Judas thy Brother,
Mat. 26. 24, 25.
Who for treachery did exceed all other;
Mat. 26. 25 and
His Master he betrayed, who was a 27. 29.
King,
And thou thy friend betray'dst for a small thing.
Judas was punished, and so shall thou be;
For thou a Traitor art as well as he:
Mat. 27. 3, 4.
Yet he confessed his fault, and did restore
The money back, which he received before,
To do the deed about the which he went;
Which having done, he then seemed to Mat. 27. 4.
repent.
Yet for all that, he being void of grace,
Mat. 27. 5. Acts 1. 18.
Died in despair in a most woeful case.
Let me advise thee, be like him in this,
Confess, restore, repent; it is not amiss:
But do not Mat. 27. 5.
hang thy self, as Judas did,
Acts 16. 27 28.
Because such things thou know God does forbid.
But give over thy trade of treachery,
Acts 8. 22
And call to God for grace before thou die,
Heb. 13. 18
That thou may as an honest man here live,
Until thy soul to God thou do up give.
Rev. 22. 14. 2 Timothy 2. 12.
Heaven is the place where faithful men shall reign,
Rev. 21. 27.
Which place no lying traitor shall obtain.
CHAP. V.
To the Seaman, a Prisoner:
THou Seaman, that art subject to the weather,
Tell me what wind it was that brought thee hither?
Who was thy Pilot, that had so much skill
To bring thee to this port, against thy will?
The Sergeants are the Pilots for this Bay:
Without the Compass they can find the way.
Doubtless 'twas some of them that did thee guide
Unto this Haven, where thou must abide.
Thy sails are down, and now thine Anchor's cast,
And hence thou can not budge, thou art so fast.
Though wind and tide do serve, yet have thou lost
Thy voyage for this time, to thy great cost.
Now when thou shall depart, thou do not know,
For till thy peace be made, thou can not go.
Whilst thou art here, I wish thee to consider
Ps. 146. 7.
Who it is that must thee from this place deliver.
It is the Lord, whose Psalm. 107. 23, 24.
wonders thou have seen,
In the Esaias. 51. 10
deep Sea, where thou have often been
Psalm. 107. 25. 26. Acts 27. 18.
Tossed with the waves in storms and tempests great;
Which Jonah 1. 4.
raging waves against the Ship did beat,
Act. 27. 20.
Insomuch that thou could not choose but think
The beaten ship would at that instant sink.
And when thou did approach Acts 27. 27 28. 40. 41.
near to the shore,
Ecclus. 43. 24.
The danger then thou know was more and more:
For then the Act. 27. 29.
Rocks and Sands did thee affright,
Which could not be discerned in the dark night.
Ps. 107. 28. 29.
Then thou on God did call, and he thee heard,
And from those greater dangers thee preserved.
Ps 107. 10.
Thus by the Lords great power and mighty hand
In Act. 27. 44
safety thou wast brought unto the land:
Where thou no sooner wast, but did Ps. 106. 13
neglect
To give him thanks that did thee thus protect:
Pro. 23. 20
But with rude company did drink and Lev. 19. 12.
swear,
Living Psalm. 94 2^. Song of the 3 ch^l. 5.
most wickedly without all care:
ibid. 7. Neht. 9. 33.
Wherefore 'twas just with God to let thee fall
Into these troubles: therefore on him 2 Samuel 22 4.
call
To give thee grace, that thou Psalm. 78. 7.
never forget
To P^ 22. 23, 24 and Ps. 107. 31.
praise his name. Then though thou art in debt,
Ps. 107. 13. 14
Thou shall not in this prison long remain;
For he will Acts. 17. 14
send thee to the Sea again.
CHAP. VI.
To the Stranger, a Prisoner.
THou that a Stranger art in prison here,
Jof. 9. 6. Deuteronomy. 29. 22.
Far from thy Country, friends and parents dear,
Ps. 27. 3. and 73. 26.
Be not quite out of heart, for God above
Ruth 2. 10.
Will new friends raise thee here, Jos. 23. 11.
if thou him love.
Jer. 23. 23.
It Is not the distance of the place, that can
Ps. 139. 9. 10.
His providence keep back from any man.
God of the Ps. 146. 9. Deuteronomy. 14 29. Wisd. 19. 13.
stranger has a special care,
As well in a strange Country, as elsewhere:
Act. 10. 35.
His goodness and his mercy does appear
Throughout the world, to those that do him fear.
What need'st thou then take any thing to heart,
Deuteronomy. 10. 18 Heb. 15. 5.
Seeing the Lord does love thee where thou art?
Now Ezekiel. 14. 5.
though thou have estranged been from him,
Nehe. 9. 17
Yet he will not leave thee to thy self to sin.
Psalm. 92. 4. and 107. 30.
When thou his mercies felt, thou then wast glad
Psalm. 31. 9.
But now he thee corrects, thou art sad.
2 Samuel 7. 9. Jer. 2. 7.
Experience thou have of his goodness
By sea and land; and yet nevertheless
Thou did forget thy self, Psalm. 119. 176
and went astray,
As travelers do, Romans 3. 12
that are out of the way.
Mat. 11. 7. 8.
What came thou in this Country for to see?
Strange 1 Cor. 7. 31
fashions? or some other vanity?
In prison here strange things thou may behold,
Genesis 39. 20 and 40. 3.
For here vain people are, both young and old:
Ecclus. 13. 1.
If in such company thou take delight,
Ephesians. 5. 6. 7.
They Will bring thee to a miserable plight.
Consider with thy self what thou have done,
Exo. 21. 18 19.
To Offend; or how in debt and want thou have run;
Pro. 11. 15.
For which thou art here laid up to remain,
Where thou may lose, much more then thou can gain.
Wherefore it is time for thee to look about,
To see if some Pro. 17. 17.
good friend will help thee out.
Endeavor what thou can, 1 King. 8. 41, 42, 43.
and crave Gods aid,
He Will stand thy friend, therefore be not dismayed:
And when he thee delivered has from hence,
Do what thou can Wisd. 8. 8.
to get experience:
And let me now advise thee as a stranger,
Ecclus 21. 1.
Thou fall not once again into such danger:
But being free, Acts 17. 21.
spend not thy time in vain,
Then thou with credit may Mar. 5. 19.
go home again.
CHAP. VII.
To the faint-hearted Prisoner.
BE not dejected, thou Ecclus. 2. 23.
faint-hearted man:
What ayl'st thou, Ecclus. 19. 29.
that thou look so pale and wan?
Thou think it strange in prison here to lie,
And art Ecclus. 22. 18.
afraid thou shall be sick and die:
Even as a man at Sea thou seem to be,
Sick at the first, distempered and queafie:
This malady will not last very long;
Psalm. 39. 13
After a while thou will again grow strong.
Take courage man, and do not him resemble
Lev. 26. 36.
That at small things is apt to quake and tremble:
The Sergeants thou need'st not at all to fear,
For they are gone, now they have lodged thee here:
The Docket man, when he does for thee call,
To go along with him unto Guild hall,
Give him his groat, and pay th'Attorneyes fee,
Or else they will not do any thing for thee:
Thy Creditors, if they do not Declare,
Nonsuit them: for why should thou them forbear?
And if they do Declare, be not afraid,
Mat. 18. 30.
Although this harsh course they take to be paid.
What if they have taken a resolution,
To charge thee quickly with an execution?
It Is very like, that for a time thereby
They may deprive thee of thy liberty.
Yet though thy body in prison they keep,
2 Samuel 12. 17. 1 King. 21 4.
Do not forbear to eat, drink, rest, and sleep.
What need'st thou Psalm. 56. 11 Esaias 51. 12.
fear what men can do unto thee?
Ps. 56. 1.
Do think by this course they mean to undo thee?
Believe it, and do not thy self deceive;
Joh. 19. 11
They can no more do then God gives them leave.
What if to malice they are so much bent?
Psalm 56. 9.
Call on the Lord, their designs he will prevent.
Job 3. 25. 1 John, 4. 18.
The fear of danger which thou had, be sure
Is more then that, which thou do now endure.
Luke 12. 4
Fear thou not those that may thy body spoil,
But cannot give unto thy soul the foil.
Luke 12. 5 Psalm. 145. 19. Mal. 4. 2. Pro. 3. v.
Fear thou the mighty God of Israel,
That can both soul and body cast in hell.
Pro. 16. 6. Ecclus 33. 1.
The fear of him which wise men do enjoy,
Without all doubt Ecclus 34. 14.
drives other fears away.
Ecclus 2. 12
Wherefore if thou art wise, do not give place
To slavish fear, it will bring thee to disgrace.
Heb. 12. 5
Faint not under the Cross, Ecclus 26 4.
cheer up thy heart,
Ephesians. 3. 16, and 6 10.
Get strength in Christ, now thou in prison art.
Psalm. 79. 11
Then though thou have not things here to content,
Psalm. 69. 33
Yet shall thou have no just cause to repent.
For if with Heb. 4. 16
boldness thou repayr'st to him
In thy distress, then shall thou want nothing.
He Will give thee Psalm. 27. 14
courage, and much and 29. 11.
strength to bear
Thy great afflictions, both here and elsewhere.
And they that laid thee here, 1 Samuel 18. 11.
shall never have
On thee their wills, though they the same do crave.
For let them do to thee the worst they can,
Thou need'st not fear, Esaias 51. 6.
look thou up like a man
Prove. 21. 1 and 15. 11.
To him that rules the hearts of men: he will please
To rule them so, as thine shall have much ease.
Genesis 28. 15
And when God sees it fit thou hence do go,
Make him thy friend, 1 These. 5. 15.
and thy time well bestow:
Jer. 37. 20.
That thou no more into this place do come,
Which is a place all wise men feign would shun.
Whilst thou art here, Deuteronomy. 31. 8
be not at all dismayed,
Esa. 26. 20.
Though for a little time thou art here stayed:
Prove. 3. 5.
But trust in God, 2 Esd. 1. 6 67.
and let thy sins decrease;
Dan. 6. 16.
Then God out of this place will thee release.
CHAP. VIII.
To his Son.
When I in prison was, nine years ago,
2 Esd. 8. 8. 9.
Thou at that time in Prison wast also.
I never in prison was before that time,
No more wast thou, for then thou wast not mine.
Genesis 5. 3. Prove. 23. 22.
I was the Sergeant that in prison laid thee,
Psalm. 51. 5.
Thy mother was thy Jailer that obeyed me.
I, no close prisoner was, though I had foes;
Psalm. 139. 13.
But thou wast shut up close, thy mother knows.
In prison I could walk, and look about,
But thou in prison then could not peep out:
In prison I my sight had to my mind,
But thou it is known in prison wast stark blind:
In prison I was cold, and took much harm;
But thou in prison wast kept very warm:
In prison I hard shift made for my diet;
But thou in prison had thy food in quiet:
In prison I grew lean for want of feeding;
In prison I know thou had thy first breeding:
Psalm. 109. 24. Jub 33. 21.
My flesh in prison did consume away;
But thy flesh then increased every day:
In prison I had always company;
But thou alone in prison then did lie:
My Keeper in prison did me neglect;
But thy Keeper did never thee forget:
My Keeper was a man that was above me;
Thy Keeper was a woman that did love thee;
My Keeper did at me oft-times repine;
But thy Keeper a dear friend was of thine:
My Keeper often saw me in the light;
But thy Keeper deprived was of thy sight;
My Keeper I was feign to pray and pay;
But thy Keeper cared for thee night and day;
I was nine weeks in prison; so long tried;
But thou 2 Esd. 8. 8. 2 Macch. 7. 27
nine months in prison did abide:
When I came out of prison, glad was I;
When thou came out of prison Wisd. 7. 3.
thou did cry:
When I came forth I then some clothes did lack;
Job 1. 21.
But thou then had not a rag to thy back:
When I came forth, my friends I went to see;
When thou came forth, thy friends did visit thee:
Into prison again I may adventure;
Joh. 3. 4.
But thou into thy prison shall never enter:
Nine years have I my liberty enjoyed,
But now in prison am again annoyed.
Five times nine years and upwards have I lived,
Sometimes contentedly, but often grieved.
Nine years in sorrows have thou lived with me,
Which with thy tender years could not agree.
But God, who for his children does provide,
Has raised thee friends, with whom thou do abide,
Far distant from this naughty place; and yet
They love thee dearly, which I Will never forget;
Where thou good breeding have, and may have still,
With all things else according to my will;
And where thou willingly shunn'st that that is naught,
Ecclus 30. 3. 4. Eccles 4. 13.
And also learn'st apace what thou art taught.
If thou continu'st as thou have begun,
Pro. 10. 1. and 23. 24. 25.
I then shall have of thee much joy my Son.
And now to Pro. 13. 22. 3 John 11.
goodness I hear thy minde's bent,
In all my troubles I shall have content.
Ecclus 3. 6
The hope of comfort which of thee I have,
Makes me rejoice in this living men's grave.
Wherefore Ecclus 6. 18 2 Timothy 3. 15. Pro. 22. 6,
learn now whilst thou art young and tender,
Then thou hereafter wilt the same remember.
Thou then may be a man of good esteem,
Pro. 17. 6
And my lost credit may at last redeem.
Ecclus 3. 12
Then thou may be to me a help and stay,
When I am old, and ready to decay:
Ps. 22. 26.
Thou then the Lord wilt praise, Pro. 18. 24
and thank thy friends,
Endeavoring how thou may make them amends.
Now though in prison I am here a while,
By reason of those that did me beguile;
Yet still my hope is, that I shall one day
1 These. 2. 17. 3 John 14.
See thee and all thy friends again with joy.
CHAP. IX.
To the Scholar, a Prisoner.
Ps. 119. 179
When Scholars have the truants played their fill,
They must be Pro. 15. 10.
whipped, though much against their will.
The truant thou have played, and eke Ezekiel. 23. 35
neglected
Thy Book to learn, for which thou art corrected.
This Prison is thy School now for a time,
Mat. 4. 23. and 12. 16.
Christ thy Schoolmaster is as well as mine.
Now seeing thou unto this School art brought,
2 Timothy 3. 14.
In practice put that which thou have been taught.
For Christ thy Master is with thee offended,
Mat. 21. 20 Jer. 26. 13.
Because thy life thou have not yet amended:
Deuteronomy. 19. 19 Job 9. 28.
And yet thou need'st not be too much afraid,
Ps. 78. 40.
Though thou the truant have so often played.
Deuteronomy. 6. 3.
For if thou do endeavor to do well,
Esaias 1. 20.
And wilt no more against him so rebel;
Then he to thee (I know) will be as mild,
As any Psalm. 103. 13.
Father can be to his Child.
Psalm. 103. 9.
He will not always angry be, nor chide
With those that his corrections can abide.
Job 6. 2.
Yet thou complain'st, thy punishment is great,
And do with grief the same oft-times repeat;
Psalm. 42. 5.
And art disquieted here in this School;
Yet do not thou with others play the fool.
2 Timothy 2. 14.
For thou should rather teach, then learn of those
Which have no breeding, though they wear good clothes.
Be thou the usher of this School, that so
Esaias 28. 9
Thou may teach others that which they don't know.
Here are poor Scholars, that are apt to learn
Psalm. 52. 3.
Much ill: but goodness they cannot discern.
Thou may observe, Psalm. 78. 32 33. 2 Chro. 28, 22.
how some are still addicted
To wickedness, Gal. 3. 4. Hag. 2. 17.
though they are here afflicted.
Some Ecclus. 19 and
give their minds to drink, others to 23. 9.
swear,
And some Hos. 4. 11.
their whoring will not here forbear.
Some do delight at cards and dice to play;
Pro. 21. 17
And thus most of them pass their time away.
Consider this; Instruct them to be 1 Pet. 5. 8. 1 These. 5. 8.
sober,
That they may learn a new lease to turn over.
Omit no time, 2 Timothy 24 25, 26.
good counsel now to give
Unto such as in ignorance here live:
1 Cor. 15. 34.
For some so ignorant are, that they scarce know
So much, as little babes, the Christ-crosse-row.
Tit. 2. 7. 8.
Lead thou a godly life, and virtuous be,
That they example may here take by thee.
Acts 27. 36
Cheer up thy heart, and be not now so muddy,
Although thy books thou have not here to study.
It may be thou have pawned, or sold away
Thy books to such Pro. 18. 2.
as seldom read or pray:
Yet be not still so Genesis 40. 7.
sad as thou have been,
Although those books thou can not yet redeem:
For if thou have one book amongst the rest,
Ps. 119. 14^
The Bible, which of all books is the best,
Thou have enough, to study thereupon,
Psalm. 119. 50.
And need'st no other book but that alone.
He that does Eccles. 12. 12.
study much (without all doubt)
In other books, will soon be wearied out.
But he that in Psalm. 1. 2.
Gods word takes great delight,
And therein Ecclus. 6. 37.
meditates both Ps. 119. 97.
day and and 55. Josh. 1. 8
night;
Psalm. 1. 3.
That man shall flourish, and see happy days,
For God will prosper him in all his ways.
Esaias 34. 16
God is the Author of that holy Book,
And therefore thou therein may boldly look.
2 Timothy 3. 16
All holy Scripture's given by inspiration,
And therefore is in such great Job. 23, 12 Psalm. 119. 127, 128.
estimation.
Joh. 5. 39. Acts 17. 11.
Search them alone, and thou therein shall find
Eternal life, Psalm. 63. 5. and 36. 8.
which satisfies the mind.
Psalm. 119. 99. 100.
There wisdom thou may learn, for thy souls health:
Pro. 8. 18. 19.
The rich find there much joy, Esaias 55. 1.
the poor much wealth.
There Is choice of spiritual food; Psalm. 119. 103.
feed on it then:
1 Cor. 3. 1, 2.
There Is milk for babes, Heb. 5. 12 13, 14.
and meat for stronger men.
It Is like a brook, that is large and deep, wherein
Ps. 19. 7.
The lamb may wade, Esaias 40. 28
and th'Elephant may swim.
2 Timothy 3. 15
All, that to our salvation tends, is there
Penned down in holy writ; and not elsewhere.
And yet Gods word is to the stubborn Jews
A 1 Cor. 1. 23.
stumbling block; which makes them it refuse:
And to the self-willed Gentiles it is likewise
A 1 Cor. 1. 23.
foolishness; therefore they it despise.
To say the truth, Mat 22. 29
this Book's not understood
Joh. 3. 10
By learned Scholars, that seem to be good.
Luke 24. 45 Acts 8. 30, 31.
There Is none at all can understand this thing,
Until God Acts 16. 34 Psalm. 119. 34.
open their understanding.
Now study't with delight, Ps. 25. 4, 5.
call on Gods name,
So shall thou rightly understand the same.
Then shall thou be in a most happy taking,
Job. 36, 22. Psalm. 119. 102.
When thou a Scholar art of Gods own making.
Whilst thou art here, Pro. 10. 14.
learn something every day,
Romans 11. 25.
And teach such as are quite out of the way.
Pro. 16. 7.
Please thy Schoolmasters, and contented be;
So shall thou break up School, and be set free:
And afterward 2 Timothy 4. 7, 1.
thou having lived well,
Shall with thy Master Christ for ever dwell
In heaven above, 1 Cor. 13. 12
where thou shall see and know
More then thou ever heard'st of here below.
CHAP. X.
To an ancient man, a Prisoner, exceedingly oppressed with grief, and sorrow
upon sorrow.
THy Lam. 3. 12.
sorrows, old man, are sorrows indeed,
Psalm. 88 7, 8
Which sorrows do all others here exceed.
Psalm. 42, 6.
Thou art a man dejected in our fight,
Job 7. 3, 4.
And careful thoughts are with thee day and night.
Job 16. 8.
Thy countenance shows how thy Pro. 17. 22. Ecclus. 13. 25.
heart is grieved,
And thy ^ Sam. 12. 2
gray hairs show that thou have long lived.
Ezekiel. 23, 21.
If thou thy youthful days did not well spend,
Tit. 2. 2.
Now thou art old, endeavor to amend:
2 Cor. 4. 16.
And then although thy body do decay,
Thy spirit shall revive and live for aye
In heaven with Christ, who Job 34. 28 Acts 7. 34.
hears thy groans and cries;
He Will Rev. 7. 17.
wipe away all thy tears from thine eyes.
If thou for debt art to this place committed,
Psalm. 106. 46.
Thy case (if thou art poor) is to be pitti'd.
It was thy Ecclus. 7, 24.
daughter, whom thou love full dear,
That was the occasion of thy being here.
Thou did her place with one, that did her keep,
Pro. 27. 27.
Where she no want had of food, clothes, nor sleep:
But therewithal she was not well contented,
And therefore she from thence Genesis 16. 6.
herself absented;
Pro, 1. 10.
Being by wicked counsel much deluded,
So that in danger she her self intruded:
Romans 2. 21.
And proving false to him, with whom she dwelt,
She then the misery of a Prison felt:
Pro. 6, 1, 2.
And thou having for her truth thy word past,
Arrested wast, and into prison ^ast:
When she came shortly after to be tried,
1 Pet. 4. 15.
She was found guilty; for which cause she died:
Then thy poor wife Psalm. 31. 10
fell sick, and died for grief,
Hearing her child did suffer as a thief.
Jer. 45. 3.
Thus was thy grief and sorrow much increased,
Esaias 64. 12
As with Gods children it is, when they think least.
Besides all this, now in thy great distress
Ecclus. 6. 10.
Thy friends do not themselves to thee address;
Ecclus. 6. 12.
But leave thee comfortless here in this place,
To muse upon thy daughters great disgrace.
1. Sam. 3. 13
If thou, like old Eli, did e're neglect
Thy children in their young days to correct;
1 Samuel 3. 14.
Then thou, like old Eli, for that cause art
Corrected now thy self, and feel'st the smart.
If thou, like David, (when thy girl was young)
Was fond over her, 2 Samuel 18. 5.
as he was over his son;
2 Samuel 19. 2.
Then thou like David must afflicted be,
(For being then so fond) as well as he.
Like Eli be, when thou corrected art,
1 Samuel 3. 18
Submit to God, and take it in good part.
2 Samuel 19. 4.
Like David be, who after he had cried
For his lost son, 2 Samuel 19. 8.
was then well pacified.
Now David's son, 2 Samuel 18. 14.
by his untimely death
Died in his sins, and so gave up his breath.
Thy daughter had a time before she died,
To call on God: her Psalm. 32. 5.
sins she did not hide.
Luke 23. 42, 43.
Doubtless the Lord heard her humble request,
And that her soul is now with him at rest.
2 Samuel 12. 20.
Comfort thy self in God now she is gone,
v. 23.
And think that thou must follow her ere long:
Thy Adversaries Job 36. 15.
cannot long detain thee
Here in this prison, where Psalm. 79 4.
they now disdain thee.
Jer. 15. 11.
When God his time sees fit, he will thee release:
Tit. 2. 12.
Live therefore well, 2 King. 2^. 20.
so shall thou dye in peace.
Eccles 12. 7
Thy soul shall then ascend to God on high,
Joh. 10. 28.
And live with him in heaven eternally.
CHAP. XI.
To his eldest Daughter.
THere was a time, before thy time, in which
I was beloved of the Job 29. 12
poor and Pro. 4. 20
rich.
For in those days Deuteronomy. 6. 11
I had good things about me,
And many could not well subsist without me.
I then alone did live, wherefore I sought,
Tob. 1. 9.
And found her which into the world thee brought.
Tob. 4. 4.
A burden thou wast to her a long while,
When she thee carried then many a mile,
Into a Country which thou could not see,
Where I had Esa. 24. 11
Land, that caused my misery.
Jer. 31. 8.
And when from thence she brought thee back again,
After a while Rev. 12. 2.
thou put'st her to great pain:
For thou so heavy wast, and big also,
Jer. 4. 31.
That she then could no longer with thee go.
So weak was she, that thou made her to fall,
So that for help Esa. 42. 14.
she did both cry and call.
And then between you both there was such strife,
Genesis 35. 16
That she therewith had almost lost her life.
After which combat, though she had the worst,
Yet she thy best friend was, 1 Samuel 1. 23.
for she thee nursed.
And though her pains were great, yet shortly after
We both rejoiced in thee Genesis 30. 21
our elder daughter.
I then in credit lived, and did enjoy
Eccles 2. 1
The pleasures of this life, which seemed so gay.
Job 17. 11
But now those days are past, my credit's lost,
Tob. 1. 20.
My means are gone, and my designs are crossed.
Much trouble I of late have undergone,
And now at last Act. 12. 4.
am in a prison strong,
Deprived of that which heretofore I had,
Pro. 15. 15. Psalm. 88. 4.
It Was never with me as it is now so bad.
So that to say the truth, I may be here
Compared to the four Genesis 1. 14.
Seasons of the year.
The joyful Wisd. 2 7.
Spring, the dainty Mat. 24. 32.
Summer fine,
The fruitful Joel 3. 13
Harvest, and the Joh 10. 22
Winter time.
Cant. 2. 12
The Spring time of my youth Eccles 9 7.
I lived in pleasure,
Then God gave thee to me, thou wast my treasure.
Job 1. 10.
In those days I knew not what troubles meant,
For then my Country House I had in Kent.
The Summer time Eccles 7. 0
of my good days had I
Much trading and withal, my Girl Mary.
Ecclus 11 24.
In those days I got means, and lived well,
My credit then was good, my friends can tell.
In The Harvest time Pro. 13. 11
I gathered much, and than
I lost much, yet, God gave me my Girl Nan.
In those days Luke 10. 41
I much care had to uphold
My credit, which I valued more then gold.
The Winter season, when Psalm. 88. 3.
I had my fill
Of troubles, then God sent me my son Will.
In those days I was then, as now I am,
In great distress, Psalm. 88. 4.
and counted a lost man.
Great losses I sustained that stormy time,
Phil. 4. 12.
Which makes me now to suffer and repine.
Esaias 47. 8.
The loss of ( Nan) thy sister, was then more
Grievous to me, then all I lost before.
A tedious Winter it is as I suppose,
Psalm. 13. 7.
How long it will last, the Lord above best knows.
Thus in this world have I been Ps. 109. 23
tossed and tumbled,
Sometimes advanced aloft, and sometimes humbl'd.
Job 16. 12
The daylight of my former days are done,
The dark-night of my latter days are come.
Yet still I hope it will not be so with thee,
1 Pet. 3. 10
But that thy best days will hereafter be.
Although thy worst days be now for a season,
Yet doubtless thou have so much wit and reason,
To think, if thou Psalm. 2. 11.
serve God, Pro. 18. 24
and thy friends please,
That thou hereafter may live more at ease.
Lam. 3. 27. Pro. 29. 15.
The more thou art in thy young days deprest,
The more one day will be thy joy and rest:
And if thou live to be a woman grown,
1 Cor. 13. 11. Pro. 31. 25.
Thou will rejoice that thou so much have known.
Thou now art with Ecclus 6. 14
thy friends, who love thee well,
Give them content, whilst thou with them do dwell.
Pro. 19. 15
Give not thy self at all to idleness,
Ruth 3. 5.
But be thou doing something, more or less:
Be Ecclus 22. 4.
modest, loving, and of good behavior,
So shall thou be esteemed of, and in favor.
Romans 11. 22
And if to goodness thou do now incline,
Thou then art Gods dear child, as well as mine:
Thou then two Fathers have, be of good cheer;
Luke 11. 2.
The one's in heaven above, Genesis 44. 10
the other's here.
Psalm. 69. 29
Thy earthly father's poor, and weak withal,
2 Esdr. 17. 65.
Thy heavenly Father's rich, and liberal.
If thou want that which I have not to give thee;
Go to Mat. 6. 32.
thy heavenly Father, he will releeve thee:
Make thy case known to him, the Pro. 12. 19.
truth declare,
And Pro. 12. 22 Ecclus 7. 13.
tell no lies, but thereof have a care:
For God will never grant such their desires;
Joh. 8. 44.
The Devil is the father of all liars.
Now if thou learn'st good manners every day,
Ecclus 22. 4
And carriest thy self well, not being coy;
Pro. 15. 9. Titus 2. 12.
If thou to godliness do give thy mind,
Judith 8. 8.
And wilt live virtuously, then thou shall find,
Ecclus 30. 8.
That though thou many things art now denied,
Yet shall thou be hereafter satisfied.
In the mean while 2 Timothy 2. ^
consider well these things,
That I may from thee hear some good tidings.
Pro. 23. 15.
It will rejoice my heart, though I am here
In prison, where I want means to be clear.
Ecclus 3. 6
Be thou my comfort now, and thou shall see,
I Will be thy comforter, when I am free.
CHAP. XII.
To the domineering Creditor over a poor Debtor of his in Prison.
THou domineering man, Pro. 28. 11. Romans 12. 16.
that art so Pro. 11. 12
wise
In thy conceit! Mat. 18. 30
why do thou so despise
Jer. 38. 9.
Thy Debtor, which at thy suit here does lie,
Where he for want of food in time may dye?
He has good friends (say thou) that will not see
Him lie in Prison long, in misery:
But rather will some order take to pay
His debts, that he no longer here may stay.
Alas! thou art deceived, it will not appear,
Ecclus 6. 12
That they will do any thing whilst he is here.
Ecclus 37. 4
He rather fares the worse for them, so that
He Is like a Mouse that is taken in a Trap.
Psalm. 52. 1.
Yet thou do boast and brag what thou have done,
In laying up a poor man in prison.
What have thou gotten now by doing so?
The Psalm. 109. 6
Devil for thy friend, and Psalm. 11. 5.
God thy foe.
Job 2. 7.
The Devil takes delight in cruelty,
Jam. 2. 13.
And God rejects him that shows no mercy:
Ecclus 11. 24.
Yet thou thy self, having the world at will,
Ecclus 11. 25. Amos 1. 11
Take no pity on him that is so ill.
Pro. 21. 17.
Thou take thy pleasure, Psalm. 6. 7.
he grieves at the heart;
Job 34 19. Pro 22^^. Mal. 2. 10
Yet he is Gods creature, even as thou art.
Luke 18. 11.
Yet thou beleev'st thou art better then he,
(...), 22 7.
Because thou have him made subject to thee.
Yet when all comes to all, one day thou must,
As well as he, Genesis 3. 19. Eccles 3. 20.
be turned into dust.
Then who shall judge, which of you is the better,
Whether the Creditor, or the poor Debtor.
Job 21. 26.
Your bodies in the dark grave may be there
Alike unto the worms without compare.
Your souls may differ much, Eccles. 12. 7.
for they must fly
Up to the Psalm. 50. 6.
Judge (of heaven and and 94. 2.
earth) on high:
Mat. 25. 31, 32.
Where that great Judge pronounce shall to all men
v. 33.
Both v. 34.
good and v. 41.
bad, their sentence just; and then
John 5. 29.
The soul that has done well, heaven shall enjoy;
John 5. 29.
The soul that has done ill, God will destroy.
Consider this, Romans 14. 10
thou that do domineere
Over thy poor debtor whom thou have lodged here:
For thou thy self Amos 5. 12.
art mightily in debt
Unto the Lord, which thou should not forget;
Romans 8. 9.
And if Christ will not for thee undertake,
Thy debts to pay, Esa. 43. 25.
for his own mercy sake;
Then thy poor soul and body shall at last
Mat. 25. 30
Be into Hell (that fearful prison) cast.
Ecclus. 35. 20.
If thou therefore would mercy now obtain,
Ephesians. 4. 32.
Be thou to others merciful again.
Job 30. 25
Come to thy poor debtor that is in distress;
Psalm. 105. 20.
Give him his liberty, and so express
1 Pet. 3. 8.
Thy love to him, that he hereafter may
Be able (with Gods help) his debts to pay.
Thus thou may do him good, and thy self too;
Heb. 13. 16 Pro. 3. 28.
Wherefore delay no time this good to do;
Mat. 6. 14.
Then doubtless thy great Creditor will forgive
Thee all thy debts: 2 Timothy 28 11.
and thou with him shall live.
CHAP. XIII.
To the men, which are Prisoners in the Hole.
Esaias 42. 22
YOu that are Prisoners in the Hole, do not
a Cor. 4. 8.
Despair of help, although it be your lot
To be thronged up together in a hole,
1 Pet. 8. 8.
Where you each others misery may condole.
Experience you have had of Psalm. 107. 9.
Gods goodness,
Which he to you has showed Ver. 10.
in your distress:
Psalm. 23. 4.
The Lord your help and comfort will be still,
Esa. 1. 19.
If you obedient are unto his will.
Jer. 15. 11.
It Is God alone that moves men's hearts to pity
Poor prisoners both in Country and in City.
Psalm. 69. 33
Your Benefactors he makes liberal,
And therefore you Ps. 145. 18
should daily on him call
Ps. 115. 13.
To bless and sanctify the means you have
Mat. 6. 26.
To feed your bodies, Jam. 1. 23.
and your souls to save.
It Is like in former time that some of you
Did not fare half so well as now you do:
And if again you had your liberty,
It may be you so well could not supply
Your hungry bellies with such food, as now
Provided is, which none can disallow.
Your bodies likewise need endure no cold,
For you have fire enough for young and old.
Many besides you are here in this place,
That think they are not in so good a case;
Because they often times in great want are
Of that (God knows) which you sometimes can spare:
But if their chamber rent they cannot pay,
Then in your Hole they must be put to stay.
Consider also how 1 Cor. 10 3.
your souls are fed
With Gods Word, Neh. ^. 8.
which to you is daily read.
Heb. 12. 25
God by his Word to you speaks very plain;
Dan. 9. 25.
And you by prayer speak to him again.
1 Timothy 4. 7.
This exercise you have now twice a day,
Having occasion just to sing and pray.
Jam. 5. 13.
If inward mirth you have, sing heartily;
If outward crosses, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 17.
pray continually:
1 Cor. 14. 15.
If you those godly Psalms of David sing
Without true knowledge, or understanding,
Then you sing like the Bird that does rejoice,
The Nightingall, that is nothing but a voice.
1 Cor. 14. 15.
If you to God do pray, and not regard
How you speak to him, John 9. 31.
then you are not heard:
Much like the Papists you are, when they pray,
Who utter words, but know not what they say.
Jer. 6. 10.
If you Gods word do hear with no delight,
Ezekiel. 20. 32.
And live like Heathen people in our sight;
Ezekiel 36. 19.
You then like Heathen shall be cast away,
The Lord will not your punishment delay.
There are amongst you, doubtless, that have been
In drink, and otherwise much overseen:
At Tavernes and Ale houses were your meetings,
Where you with others had your merry greetings:
And there, and at worst places you have spent
Your time away in beastly merriment.
In stead of David's Psalms, you have sung out
Your Ps. 69. 12.
drunken songs, and so kept revell rout:
In stead of prayer, prattling you have used,
Ezekiel. 36. 20.
And Gods most holy name have much abused:
The Fiddlers you have heard with more delight
Then Psalm. 119. 140.
Gods pure word, which is so just and right.
Thus most of you have done when you were free,
But now in the Hole such things you cannot see:
Ezekiel. 23. 27.
From such lewd courses you are now restrained,
And to do better things you are enjoined.
Thus in your bondage Acts 6. 4.
you exercise more
Your selves in prayer, then you did before.
A happy bondage it is, you cannot deny,
If you your sinful Col. 3. 5. Ecclus. 18. 30.
lusts can mortify:
Rev. 2. 22.
But if for all this you will not amend
Your lives; then you shall find, that in the end,
Although your bellies be with food suppli'de,
Your backs may want course rags your skin to hide.
Your bones in time by lying hard, will ache,
Your flesh the lice will not at all forsake.
Until you die; and then they will turn you over
Unto the Job 17. 14.
worms, which then shall be your mother:
And then the Mar. 9. 46.
worm of Conscience, which never dies,
Shall feed upon your souls with woeful cries:
And though your bodies in the John 5. 28.
graves remain,
And turn to dust, Acts 24. 15
yet they shall rise again
To judgment, at which time they must needs dwell
Mat. 10. 28.
With your poor souls, in the dark hole of hell.
How soon that day will be, you do not know;
But when death comes, you to that place must go.
Your state is wretched now, 'twill then be worse,
For you shall ever be under Gods curse.
Thus 'twill be with you, if your minds are bent
Romans 8. 13.
To live and die in sin, and not repent.
Wherefore 2 Chro. 6. 37.
bethink your selves what you have done,
And be reclaimed, that you the Heb. 12. 1.
race may run
Of Christians pure, who never cease to Pro. 15. 24. Hos. 14. 9.
walk
The way to heaven, Psalm. 145. 11. and 119. 46.
of which they joy to talk.
That 1 Cor. 9. 24
race you may now run, and get the gole,
Though you are stayed, and shut up in a hole.
Pro. 3. 6.
Gods word is your direction, John 8. 47.
hear, and Luke. 22. 40
pray
Jam. 1. 6.
In faith; and then the hole will be the way.
Acts 14. 22
Through troubles and afflictions you shall find
The readi'st way, if you are not stark blind.
Whilst you therefore are here, 1 Pet. 2. 17.
fear God, and Ps. 146. 7.
feed
Your bodies, 1 Cor. 10. 3, 4.
and your souls, that have such need.
Yet be not like the Fox, or like his brood,
Which loves his hole, if he there can have food.
But rather use good means to get out hence,
That you may have such food without offense,
Abroad in other places, being free,
Which to good minds does best of all agree.
Then doubtless God in his due time will send
You liberty, and 2 Cor. 1. 4.
comfort in the end.
And if the Steward of your hole be just,
Your Reader chaste, not given to his lust;
Your Cook a cleanly fellow in his place;
Your Constable well ordered, and not base;
And you that are inferior to all these,
That are so full of Lice and biting Fleas;
That have no beds to lie on, but must needs
Lie in your clothes, where all your vermin breeds;
1 Pet. 1. 15.
If you together in good sort do live,
Joh. 14. 14.
The Lord will change your lodging, and soon give
You such a place to dwell in, as shall be
Heb. 11. 16.
The place where you for ever shall be free.
CHAP. XIV.
To his youngest Daughter.
WHen thou into this wretched world Wisd. 7. 3.
came crying,
Psalm. 91. 7
Ten thousand round about thee lay a dying.
Many which in the morning had their breath,
2 Chronicles. 20. 24.
Before night were deprived thereof by death.
Death in those days with his sharp poisoned Dart,
2 Chronicles. 24 25.
Smote thousands weekly through the very heart;
And led them captives to their graves, where they
John 5. 28.
Must needs remain until the Lords great Day.
Ezekiel. 31. 14 Romans 5. 12.
This domineering Death took rich and poor,
J^r. 9. 21. Ps. 107. 18.
And some that lived with me were at his door.
He at that doleful time was fierce and bold,
And made more havoc of the young then old.
Great was his privilege then in the City,
Eccles 2. 16
For fools and wisemen he took without pity.
Psalm. 78. 50
He then spared none at all that were in's reach,
But did amongst all callings make a breach.
The Belfrees he caused to be full of people,
Who made the Bells to ring in every Steeple.
A doleful sound there was, Eze. 32. 22.
then graves were plenty,
2 King. 21. 13. Lam 1. 1.
Which made the streets of London to be empty.
Ezekiel. 27. 34.
And then most trades did fail, I knew but one
That flourished, which were wooden Cooks alone.
Their wooden crust Death furnished with great store
Of flesh, Genesis 23. 4.
which living people did abhor:
And therefore they conveyed were under ground,
For Ecclus 10. 11.
worms to feed on, which did then abound.
The pye-crust which was framed and made of wood,
They did dislike, yet Job 24. 20
th'inside they found good.
Death was their friend, he daily did provide
Such food, and yet they were not satisfied.
Psalm. 91. 3*
Thou then Deaths hands escap'dst, as well as I,
Yet when he comes we cannot from him fly.
My Country house in those infectious days
I had, where grew much Rosemary and Bays,
In The town of Battersey, where thou did make
Thy mothers belly, sides and back to ache,
Genesis 25. 22
With struggling over much with her to be
Discharged out of that place where she kept thee
As long as e're she could, yet at the last
1 King. 3. 17.
She let thee go, because thou wast in haste,
Now when thou came into the world stark naked,
1 Cor. 12. 18. 24. Psalm. 139. 15.
Having thy limbs and members all well shaped,
Yet thou a name did want, 1 Samuel 4. 21.
which those did give
Unto thee then, with whom thou now do live:
Thy Godfather and Godmother are they
Which thy name gave thee; and the self same day
By promise they engaged themselves for thee,
Ephesians. 4. 27.
That thou from Satan and his works should flee,
And likewise should abstain 1 Samuel 12. 21.
from vain delights,
Gal. 5. 17
And sinful lusts, which against the spirit it fights:
And that thou should Romans 10. 9
believe all in thy Creed,
Ps. 119. 34
Keeping Gods holy Laws, and so proceed
To Ps. 119 1.
walk therein all the days of thy life,
Romans 8. 6.
That thou in peace may live, and not in strife.
All these things they have promised for thee,
Which thou ought to perform, then they are free.
They are thy sureties, till the art of age,
And then thy sureties thou should disengage.
When they that charge first took of thee, I then
In credit lived among all sorts of men.
I in that sickly time was forced to walk
The City streets, Job 16. 7.
yet with few men did talk.
For then was I to them much like a stranger,
Job 2. 4.
Because my life I would not then endanger.
But afterward when losses came upon me,
Job 2. 11.
In my first troubles, some friends did bemone me.
And when by many men I was undone,
I walked the streets, yet was I feign to shun
The company of many, which to me
Seemed Officers, Job 3. 25.
so that I feared to be
In danger of that, which I now at last
Am brought unto, Psalm. 88. 8.
where I am locked up fast
In a poor prison, where are good and bad,
Job 29. 2 and 30. 16.
And where I want that which before I had.
Yet if thy mind thou now giv'st 1 Pet. 3. 6.
to do well,
Then comfort I shall have, though here I dwell.
Psalm. 34. 12
Fear God above, and thy and Ephesians. 6. 1 etc.
parents obey,
So shall thou Ephesians. 6. 3.
live many a happy day.
Thy Godfather and thy Godmother love;
Ecclus 22. 5
Be thou not wild, Hos. 7. 11.
but gentle as a Dove.
Be ruled by them, Ecclus 6. 16. 17.
for they thy best friends are,
They love thee well, that art from me so far.
Thou art their Godchilde, Phil. 4. 9.
learn of them, and know
Some goodness now, Col. 1. 10.
and therein daily grow.
Such Godfathers and Godmothers as those
Are much to be respected (I suppose:)
There are not many such now to be found,
Whom thou enjoy'st, though I am in Lobs pound.
Wherefore whilst thou art with them lose no time,
Eccles 9. 8.
Be cleanly, and do not thy self begrime.
1 Timothy 4. 13.
Read thy Book often, Judge. 5. 30.
let thy Needle be
Always in use, and a delight to thee.
Pro. 20. 11.
Do willingly such things thou go about,
Pro. 4. 24.
Be not at all dogged, frown not, nor pout.
But let thy carriage be now, and always,
Judeth 8. 8.
Such as hereafter may get thee the praise.
Phil. 1. 27. Tob. 10. 12.
If I could now from thee such good news hear,
It would revive me more then Wine or Beer:
For though Genesis 40. 23
I am neglected in this place,
If thou do well, I shall be in good case:
My mind will be at ease I make no doubt,
Jer. 38. 7. etc.
And some good friend at length will get me out:
And when my liberty I shall obtain,
I hope to 2 Timothy 1. 4
see thee with much joy again.
CHAP. XV.
To the Prodigal young man, a Prisoner.
THou Pro. 29. 3.
that a spend-thrist art, clapped up for debt
In Prison* where no goodness thou can get!
Thou see here are Ecclus 13. 15.
companions to thy mind,
Which are like thee to vain Pro. 21. 17.
pleasures inclined.
Though thou now art a prisoner here deprived
Of liberty* yet being here arrived,
Thou take thy liberty Esa. 5. 11.
to drink Levit. 19. 12
and swear,
Ecclus 23. 9.
Which wicked custom thou should here forbear:
Psalm. 73. 9.
For this a place is of disconsolation,
Levit. 26. 23. 24.
Which ought to work in thee a reformation.
And if this place will not at all thee tame,
Then must I needs conclude, Zeph. 3. 5.
thou art past shame*
Though thou have money to swagger and roar,
When that is spent, how think thou to get more?
Thy friends and parents, by whom thou had means,
Luke 15. 39
Which thou have spent amongst base knaves and queans,
Will now leave thee unto thy self to shift,
Luke 15. 14.
Because thou have been such a wild unthrift.
Acts 17. 5.
Thy lewd companions now will forsake thee
Although they were the only lads that brake thee.
Ecclus. 18. 31.
Thy wenches, with whom thou did take delight,
Will scorn thee now, and not come in thy sight.
The truth is, whether thou be rich or poor,
A Bear is fitter for thee than a whore.
Thy credit in this place will soon be lost,
Though thou have been here long to thy great cost.
If thou the Tapster should owe but a groat,
He would go near to plucked out of thy throat:
Though thou should spend here forty pound a year,
Yet he will scarce trust thee for a pot of beer.
Pro. 13. 25
Though thou in want should make to him thy moan
For bread, drink, or tobacco, Luke 15. 16
he has none
For such as have no money; and therefore
He Will bid thee get thee gone, for he will not score.
Now when thou art Pro. 23. 21
brought to so much disgrace,
The Hole it is like will be thy dwelling place.
Many a worse lodging thou have had, when
With harlots thou did lodge, thou know, for then
'Twas worse with thee, Pro. 9. 13.
thou then wast in great danger
2 Timothy 2. 26.
To be ensnared by Satan, that great ranger:
Pro. 7. 22, 23.
For thou then wast plunged over head and ears
2 mi T 2. 22.
In sin, which thou should here bewail with tears.
Thy case was desperate then, and now is like
To be worse, if Acts 26. 18
God give thee not a sight
Of thy great sins, the which thou have committed
Against him, Micah 6. 13.
for which thou art here afflicted.
Esd. 3. 20.
And though much sorrows thou have, do not think
Pro. 20. 1.
To mitigate thy sorrows by much drink:
For if that course thou take, thou may be sure
Esd. 3. 23.
Thy sorrows will increase, and long endure:
Such seeming remedies have some undone;
Wherefore be thou like the prodigal son,
Luke 15. 14
Who when his substance he had vainly spent,
Luke 15. 15 16.
Being in extreme want, 18, 19.
did then repent,
v. 18.
Confessing all his faults, and then resolved
To go to his Father to be absolved;
v. 20.
His father, when he saw him in that ^ase,
Took pity on him, and did him embrace:
Psalm. 103. 9.
He did not with him chide, although he were
A naughty child, such was his love and care,
And joy withal, when he his Luke 15. 32
lost son saw
Returned, and found obedient to his law;
Then he received him, and him entertained,
Although before Luke 15. 15
he was so much disdained:
v. 22.
He clothed him bravely then from top to toe,
v. 23.
And feasted him most sumptuously also:
Besides all that, this loving father had
v. 25.
Music and dancing, to make his heart glad.
Now if this Prodigal thou will resemble,
Ps. 119. 120 Esaias 66. 2. Heb. 10. 27.
And at Gods fearful judgments quake and tremble:
If thou thy wicked ways wilt leave, and Hos. 14. 2.
turn
Unto thy heavenly father, and so spurn
At thy Psalm. 119. 115.
companions, Pro. 1. 10.
that would thee entice
To leave all goodness, 2 Pet. 2. 2.
and to follow vice.
Psalm. 40. 1.
If thou with patience can a while abide
This chastisement, Job 9. 34.
and not be terrified,
Psalm. 119. 67.
But thereby brought to goodness, and so love
Thy Father, Psalm. 113. 5.
whose dwelling's in heaven above;
Ps. 119. 37.
Thou then all sinful pleasures wilt detest,
And Psalm. 63. 1.
long to be with him in heaven at rest:
1 Pet. 1. 4.
A portion there he will give thee to content,
Heb. 10. 34
Of such good things as never shall be spent:
Nay furthermore, he will likewise give to thee
1 Pet. 5. 4.
A Crown of glory, and there thou shall be
Romans 8. 17.
Co-heire with his son Christ, Mark 3. 35
thy elder Brother,
Rev. 19 7. 14.
With the triumphant Church Cant. 4. 9.
his Spouse, thy mother.
Heb. 12. 22 23.
Angels and Saints shall be thy company
(In that most glorious place) continually.
Phil. 3. 19* 20, 21. Psalm. 137. 6.
All earthly pleasures, and the chiefest joys
Are to those heavenly pleasures but mere toys.
1 Cor. 15. 48.
Think on those heavenly things, and let thy Mat. 6. 21.
heart
Be there, although in this place now thou art.
Ps. 119. 92 Hos. 5. 15.
Thou then shall find, that this affliction shall
The best thing prove, as ere did thee befall:
For God hereby has brought thee in the way
To heaven: wherefore Heb. 13. 14
thou shall not long here stay.
Thou art still going, though thou stir not hence;
Ps. 119. 32. and
Keep on thy way, 62. 6. Job 22. 25.
God will be thy defense:
And though in prison thou art now so fast,
He Will bring thee safely 1 Pet. 1. 4.
to that place at last.
CHAP. XVI.
To the Prisoners called by the name of Rats, which are debauched men, taken at
unlawful hours in the night by the Watch, and brought into Prison.
Ephesians. 2. 2.
YOu that the Black Prince are forced to obey,
(I mean the Ephesians. 6. 12.
Prince of darkness) night and day:
Mat. 23. 33
The end of your obedience is damnation,
Which shall begin in his Mat. 25. 30 Jude 6.
dark habitation.
1 These. 5. 3.
How soon you know not, too soon you shall know
Dan. 12. 2. Jam. 5. 1.
To your eternal shame, misery and woe.
The places you tick out Esa. 56. 12.
to drink and rore,
Rev. 18. 2.
Are doubtless the Suburbs of hell; therefore
Wisd. 2 9.
You rather choose to be there then elsewhere
Heb. 13. 4. Pro. 23. 27.
With your base whores, with whom you drink and swear.
Judge. 19. 25
The longest night in the year you think too short
To spend like wicked wretches in that sort.
John 3. 19.
Seeing therefore the night you love so well
You shall have night enough, being in hell:
Jude 13.
For there the night shall never have an end,
Which loathsome night you shall be forced to spend
Mat. 25. 41
With Devils, and with all their damned crew,
Luke 16. 26
From which place none shall ever you rescue;
Wis. 16. 15. Nahum 1. 3.
You by no means those judgments can escape,
Because Esa 5. 14.
hell for such wicked men does gape.
1 Pet. 5. 8.
The devil, he is always ready to take
Your souls away, if you do not forsake
Genesis 18. 20
Your grievous sins, which to the Lord on high
For vengeance daily do both call and cry.
Psalm. 50. 22.
You little think on this, it does appear;
For if you did, you would not now be here.
John 20. 26, 27.
But you those secret places do frequent,
Joh. 21. 13.
Where you your time have oftentimes misspent:
Ephesians. 4. 19.
In drinking, dicing, whoring, and such like
Eccles. 11. 9
You take your pleasure, and in the dark night
You Ps. 55. 10.
walk the streets, where Watchmen then, like Cats,
Seize on you, as you are, like drunken Rats;
Psalm. 59. 6.
And hither they you bring, where you are mad
Until the Joh. 24. 17
morning, and then you grow sad,
Because th'officious Constable so witty,
That Is never out of office in this City,
Pro 7. 7, 8.
Who finding you disguised and void of wit,
Could do no less but speedily commit
You to this Prison, from whence you must go
Along with him, like sodden sheep; and so
You bring before the next Justice of Peace,
Who will out of this Prison you release,
When you have paid for swearing, and likewise
Your fees discharged, then you will soon advise
What place to go to, where you may relate
To your companions, at what a cheap rate
You have escaped the punishment then due
For your foul misdemeanors, which is true:
And then your wicked crew, when they hear this,
Ecclus. 5. 4.
They Will do the like, and think it not amiss:
For they think, if they money have to pay,
Pro. 14. 9.
They may commit such follies every day.
2 Esd. 7. 56.
Not knowing what vengeance hangs over their heads,
Judith 13. 2. 8. 15.
Whilst they lie sleeping in their drink on beds.
Hab. 1. 4. Eccles 8. 11.
Think not though earthly Judges do forbear
To punish vicious fellows as you are,
Jude 15. Ecclus 41. 8.
That God will spare to execute his just
And severe judgment on you for your lust.
Pro. 5. 21. Ecclus 17. 19. 20.
He notice takes of all your ways, therefore
Ecclus 17. 25. and 35. 3.
Your sinful wicked courses now abhor:
Hos. 14. 4. Jer. 3. 12. 2 Pet. 3. 9.
His anger then from you he will turn away,
So that you shall never perish nor decay.
Go then from hence, 2 Timothy 2. 22. 1 Pet. 2. 11.
abstain from vain delights,
Forsake all such Job 17. 12.
as turn days into nights.
Psalm. 10^. 2
Behave your selves like men that live in fame,
Jude 10.
And not like to bruit beasts, Zeph. 3. 5.
that have no shame.
It Is known that you have got by being here
The title of base Rats, at which men jeere;
And not unfitly are such names imposed
On you, that are within this place enclosed:
For you like Rats, in the dark silent night,
Jer. 6. 5.
More mischief do, then in the day that is bright.
If Rats find food, they I feed on it all night long,
1 These. 5. 7
At which time you drink most, be it never so strong.
In The night Rats are more troublesome then in the day:
And so are you, Job 36. 12 Jude v. 8.
that will no laws obey.
Rats in the night, when they think least, are taken,
Esa. 8. 15.
And so are you; you are not then forsaken.
Rats of themselves go freely in the Trap;
Job 18. 10
But you to this Trap are brought, it is your hap.
The greatest difference I find between you,
Is, that they have four legs, and you but two.
I wish your fellow Rats which us annoy,
Would go with you when you hence go away.
I wish when you from hence are gone, you would
Pro. 26. 11.
Never more be (as you are now) befooled.
Ecclus 19. 2. 3.
Drink (and Tobacco) taken in excess,
Ecclus 19. 2. 1 Esdr. 3. 22.
Make wise men fools, Ps. 107. 17
and fools come to distress.
Ecclus 19. 23.
Those that delight in harlots shall at length
Ecclus 23. 16.
Be full of foul diseases, and want Pro. 31. 3.
strength.
The rich man that is a gamester, let him know,
Whether he win or lose, he will be brought low,
The wretched swearer, that may swear his fill,
If he can pay for oaths, the Judge then will
Let him go free, yet he is the Devils slave,
Ezekiel. 5. 3.
The curse of God will follo him to his grave.
Hos. 4. 2.
You that to these vices are now addicted,
Hos. 4. 3.
Shall for the same be one day much afflicted;
Col. 3. 5. 6.
If you your wicked lives do not amend,
Heb. 10. 31 Pro. 19. 29.
Gods judgments shall overtake you in the end,
Psalm. 1. 5.
Which judgments you by no means can prevent,
Acts 8. 22.
Unless the Lord give you grace to repent,
Which he will do, Jam. 3. 17.
if you can him entreat,
And Esa. 1. 18. Jer. 26. 13.
pardon all your sins, though never so great.
Oh, what a happy thing will it be then,
When you all vice give over, Gal. 6. 15. Ephesians. 4. 24.
and be new men!
Phil. 4. 8.
You Will then bethink your selves of better things,
Psalm. 18. 44
And yield obedience to the 1 Timothy 6. 15
King of Kings.
Joh. 12. 26.
Your service he will reward here and above,
Mat. 22. 37. Tob. 13. 14.
Wherefore above all things do you him love:
Ecclus 2. 15. 16. Psalm. 119 104.
And then all vice and wickedness you will hate,
Ps. 128. 1.
So that you will be in a most blessed state.
Then Jam. 4. 7.
shall the Devil away from you fly,
Romans 14. 8.
And you in Gods favor shall live and dye.
CHAP. XVII.
To the Carrier, a Prisoner.
THou that a Carrier art, I must thee tell,
Thou have not carried thy self very well:
For if thou had, it might be well supposed,
Thou had not at this time been here enclosed.
Doubtless thou wast very much overseene,
To take up this base prison for thine Inn.
But seeing now thy nest thou have here built,
Think not thou can depart hence when thou will:
For now thou art here, here thou shall be stayed,
Until thy reckoning to a Doit be paid:
And what thy Chamberlain does say is due,
Thou must needs pay, be it never so false or true:
When thou call'st to thine Host out of the grate
For food, he will send it thee at his own rate.
Yet if thou pay not for it beforehand,
For all thy calling he will not understand.
I Will undertake thou shall be here so yoked,
That the proud Tapster will first see thee choked
Before he will trust thee for a little drink,
Though thou entreat him, yet he will from thee slinke.
Coarse entertainment thou shall find and see,
The longer thou art here, the worse it will be;
So well it will like thee, that I dare maintain,
When thou art gone thou wilt never come here again.
Yet let me tell thee one thing by the way,
If thou should be disordered every day
In drink or otherwise, with knaves or whores,
Yet will not thine host turn thee out of doors:
Nay though thy carriage should be never so base,
Thou shall be kept safe in this lawless place.
Wherefore discharge thy reckoning and be trudging;
Do not delay the time to change thy lodging.
But how came thou behind hand, can thou tell,
That thou should be constrained here now to dwell?
Thou must needs say, that Pro. 23. 21.
thy ill husbandry
Has brought thee to this great calamity.
Exodus 9. 21
Thou have been careless, Pro. 14. 15.
and too credulous,
And therefore it must needs be with thee thus.
P^^ ^6 25*
For he that will believe every tale,
And make mad bargains, (...)
when he is in his Ale,
And his calling neglects, which should maintain
His charge so great Ps. 104. 23
by his labor and pain,
Job 34. 8. Pro. 28. 7.
He that is thus drawn away by company,
Pro. 28. 19.
Doubtless shall come to extreme poverty.
In all which thou can not thy self excuse,
Though late, yet now, 1 Cor. 5. 11
bad company refuse.
Where are thy pot-companions, and thy crew
Of good fellows? they bid thee now adieu:
Esa. 57. 13.
They Will not come near thee, now thou art in trouble*
Because thou have not means with them to fuddle.
Such Joel 1. 5.
drunkards are by drunkards called good fellows,
Which rather should be called the Devils bellows.
For he with them blows and kindles the fire
Pro. 23. 29, 30. Ecclus 31. 29.
Of quarrels and debate, which they desire.
A good riddance thou have of them, therefore
Psalm. 26. 5.
Desire thou their company no more.
And when thou have thy liberty, do not
Count him thy friend that is given to the pot.
For such a one will Ecclus 19. 1
cause thee to foreslow.
Thy business, which may cuase thy overthrow.
Thy wise and servants may do what thy can,
Ecclus 11. 11.
Yet 'twill not thrive till thou be 2 Cor. 5. 17.
a new man.
But thou thy freedom have not yet obtained,
Lam. 3. 7.
It Is God that has thee hitherto restrained,
2 Chronicles. 33. 12.
And if thou unto him do now repair
In all humility by hearty prayer:
Confessing all thy sins, then make no doubt,
Jer. 38. 10.
But he will raise thee friends to get thee out.
Consider how the Lord thou have offended,
Amos 6. 6.
And yet thy sinful life have not amended:
Thy Carts were never charged with commodity,
Esaias 1. 4.
As thou art laden with iniquity.
Yet when unto the Inn they come, then they
Unladen are without any delay:
So Mat. 11. 28.
thou that laden art so much with sin,
Go to thy Savior Christ, and seek to win
Joh. 14. 21.
His love by thy obedience to his will,
Mat. 11. 29
And he will ease thee, be thou never so ill.
Thy wagon wheels, when they want grease, do cry,
And keep a squeeking, till thou them supply.
So when thou feel'st the want of grace, Heb. 4. 16.
cease not
To cry to God, till thou the same have got:
Heb. 12. 15
For wanting that, thou can not but offend
Thy gracious God, Jer. 14. 10.
for which cause he does send
These troubles, which his rods are to reclaim
Thee from those sins, Ezekiel. 33. 10.
in which thou have long lain:
Psalm. 44 10 Hos. 5. 15.
That by his chastisement thou may be brought
To serve God likewise, Col. 2. 7*
as thou have been taught.
Thou know, thy teeme of horses, though well fed,
Like pampered Jades, they care not to be led
Out of the Stable to thy Wagons, where
They are put to do service, it is thy care:
Yet if sometimes they are not whipped and beaten,
They Will do no service, though thou them do threaten.
If God in like manner should not thee give
Ps. 119. 71.
Correction, then in sin thou wonld'st still live,
Deuteronomy. 8. 11
And him forget to serve, that has always
Ps. 121. 7, 8.
Defended thee from danger all thy days.
Wherefore be Ps. 100. 4.
thankful to the Lord for this
His love to thee, Joh. 5 14.
and do no more amiss;
Then when thy liberty thou shall obtain,
Thou may with credit 2 These. 3. 12.
do thy work again,
Luke 19. 15, 16, 17.
And thy calling discharge more faithfully
Then e're thou did when thou had more plenty.
Thy wagon wheels, if thou not'st, when they go,
That part that is now above, anon's below:
Then that part that is below, again's on high;
Thus are all men subject to casualtie:
1 Cor. 10. 12.
There Is no man breathing can say he stands fast;
1 Samuel 2. 7.
The rich man that is up now, is soon down cast:
Again 1 Samuel 2. 8.
the poor man that is full of sorrow,
May be a poor man now, and rich to morrow.
Observe thy wagon wheels on the high way,
Which never cease turning about, till they
By turning, gain the place where thou would be
Of thy lading discharged: then thou art free.
So likewise should thou turn about, until
Thou turn not, as the wheels turn in a mill.
Job 36. 10. Ecclus. 17. 26.
But turning from thy sins, thou shall have rest,
Romans 8. 28.
And then the Lord will turn all to the best.
And if by chance one of thy wheels should break
Upon the way, thou then would send to speak
Unto the Wheele-right, to come and repair
That breach, lest thou should be forced to stay there.
John 3. 4.
So when thou do fall into any sin,
1 Pet. 4. 1, 2.
Do not at any hand lie long therein;
But quickly 1 John 2, 1
go to Christ, and he will thee give
Grace to amend, Romans 6. 2.
that thou in no sin live.
Observe thy horses, (which do stand in awe)
Their heavy lading they do forward draw,
So that by drawing thus, it is often seen,
They in due time come safely to their Inn:
But if one of those horses should draw back,
Their labor then were lost, and thou should lack.
Now if thou, with thy wife, and servants all
1 These. 4* 11, 12. Ps. 133. 1.
Agree together, then thy business shall
Go forward, and no doubt but Deuteronomy. 28. 12
God will bless
And prosper thy endeavors more or less.
Jam. 3. 16. Gal. 5. 15.
But if together you do not agree,
Thou can not thrive, 'twill be the worse for thee.
Wherefore Psalm. 25. 1.
lift up thy soul to God on hie,
For he is Heb. 13. 20.
the God of peace and unity:
Psalm. 5. 8.
He Will set all straight, and thou shall quickly find
Job 14. 14.
A happy change, according to thy mind.
CHAP. XVIII.
To the Master of the Tap-house.
THou art Judge. 3. 17. Psalm. 73. 7.
so fat, that thou can hardly run,
And half as bigi'th middle as a Tun:
Luke 12, 19
Thou take thine ease, and have and 16. 19.
daily good fare,
Amos 6. 6:
Thou drink'st good wine, until thine eyes do stare.
Though thou a mighty man art in this place,
Yet liv'st thou by those that live in disgrace.
Thou do Luke 3. 13.
exact on prisoners that are here,
By selling such things as thou have, too dear.
Thy beer, though dead and low, yet do thou think
It Is for poor prisoners good enough to drink:
Thy ale though small, and measure very little,
Poor prisoners must have that, or none to tipple.
Thy bread though not full weight, Josh. 9. 12.
and nere so stale,
Thou think it good enough to sop in ale.
Thy cheese which thou mark'st out so neat and round,
At thy rate is almost two groats a pound.
Thy rich tobacco, which poor fools are feign
To buy at thy dear rate, yields thee sweet gain.
Thy pretty fine faggots, as green as geese,
Thou think too cheap at seven tokens apeece.
Thy candles, which are made of kitchen stuff,
Are quickly burnt out to a stinking snuff.
Thou art so wise, that thou no coals wilt sell
To prisoners which within this house do dwell;
Neither will thou suffer their friends to bring
Them such fuel, though it them cost nothing.
What is the reason? let me tell thee plain,
Because by fagots thou so much do gain,
Regarding not Jer. 38. 9.
what prisoners do endure,
So thou get'st means to satisfy the Brewer:
For by thy liquor thou gain'st most of all,
And that by drunkards: who do cry and yall
For drink, though they are full; yet when they will
Hab. 2. 15.
Have more, their pots thou will be sure to fill.
Then they will drink till they Ps. 107. 27.
reele to and fro,
Not being able of themselves to go.
These are thy friends, which thou will not see lack
So long as they have a coat to their back:
And if such fellows were not in this house,
Thy trading then would scarce be worth a louse.
Est. 1. 8.
Now when a civil man comes, that cannot drink
More then will do him good, thou then do think
He Is no good customer, let him stand by,
For his roome's better then his company.
An honest man, Levit. 25. 35.
that is fallen to decay,
If he ask credit of thee for a day,
But for a penny loaf, or pot of beer,
Though he entreat thee, yet thou will not hear:
Nay, if he should be sick, ready to dye,
For want thereof, thou would not him supply.
If prisoners have a mind to drink in the night,
No room thou wilt spare, unless they will pay for light.
Such orders thou have made, which I dare say,
May hold a while, which prisoners must obey:
But if thou thus continu'st Col. 3. 25.
to do wrong,
Thou may thy self a prisoner be ere long.
CHAP. XIX.
To the Card-player, a Prisoner.
ALl thy delight's here in playing at Cards,
And usually with those that have Pro. 20* 29.
gray beards,
Old men that dote, Zech. 8. 4.
and have one foot in the grave,
Although in prison, yet they needs must have
A pair of Cards, to drive the time away,
And then their heads together they will lay:
Making their matches with such eagerness,
As if they were about great business.
All which is for Tobacco and strong Beer,
Tit. 2. 2.
Which they will have, although it cost them dear.
And when they do mistake, they then fall out,
And in great choler throw their Cards about.
But why should thou, Pro. 20. 29.
that art lustly and strong,
Pro. 21. 17.
Sit at this idle sport all the day long?
Before thou came to prison, thou did spend
Thy chiefest time in Carding most an end.
Pro. 18. 19
Which idle course of life, I must needs say,
Has been the only cause of thy decay.
But now thou art a prisoner in this place,
Me thinks thou should not have so little grace
As to continue playing in this kind,
Heb. 6. 9.
When thou to better things should give thy mind.
I wonder of what mettle thou art made,
That thou should always follow such a trade.
But seeing now thou will not be reclaimed
From Carding, by which thou say thou have gained;
Know this from me, whether thou lose or win,
Thou art a loser 1 John 3. 4.
by committing sin.
When thou the Cards do deal* afraid thou art
To lose thy dealing, for 'twill vex thy heart.
Pro. 10. 4.
Yet thou thy dealing have now lost with those
By whom thou got'st money, meat, drink, and clothes.
When thou the Cards did cut, thou know not where
To cut them, yet thereof thou have a care.
Ps. 106. 1^
If thou had been cut short of thine own will,
When thou wast free, thou might have been so still.
When thou the Cards do shuffle at thine ease,
Such a game thou may have as may thee please.
Tit. 1. 1^.
A shuffling fellow thou have been, those say,
Which often advised thee to give over play.
When thou a good game have, thou bend'st thy wits
Thy game to play well, to get many tricks:
If all be true, I lately understood,
Micah 2. 1.
Thou have more tricks then e're will do thee good.
When thou have store of Trumps thou then do grin,
And fleere, because thou then art sure to win.
Pro. 15. 14
Thou with much trump'ry art stored every day,
Which thou will keep, and never play away.
When one a ten does play, the trick to save,
Thou that trick winn'st by playing of the knave.
Psalm. 7. 14.
Thou have often times the knave played, and yet have
Not got thereby, but greatly lost at last.
When thou do rub, thou then art very glad,
Because thy game can then be hardly bad.
A dangerous 2 Chronicles. 28. 26.
rub thou have in this place, which
Will make thee rub and scratch where't does not itch.
Again, when thou do rub thou art a getter,
The stock thou gain'st, which makes thy game the better.
Thou had in former time a pretty stock,
Job 15. 29.
Which thou by play have lost, like a Wood-cocke.
If thou renounce, and wilt not follow suit,
Thou play'st foul play, and causest a dispute.
Jam. 47.
Renounce the Devil, and his works, lest he
Follow thee close, and never renounce thee.
When thou a Card discard'st, it is conceived,
It Is for the best, yet may thou be deceived.
Those that discarded thee, did play their game
Exceeding well, Pro. 9. 7.
for thou those friends did shame.
If these the fruits of idle Carding be,
For shame give't over, that thy best friends may see
Some alteration in thee in this place,
Psalm. 65. 4.
And that thou will some goodness now embrace.
'Twill be a means thou may once more obtain
Their love Pro. 11. 27.
and favor, to help thee again
Out of this nasty place, where Psalm. 70. 5.
thou do lack
Food for thy belly, and clothes to thy back.
And likewise may for thee a way contrive,
How in some honest calling Deuteronomy. 29. 9.
thou may thrive.
Which course of life no doubt but God will bless,
Ps. 118. 5.
And keep thee from living in such distress.
CHAP. XX.
To the Papist, a Prisoner.
THou art not here afflicted (as thou know)
For thy Religion, but for what thou ow'st.
Thy creditor Rev. 3. ^6.
does not much stand upon
Religion, so he may but have his own.
For he is a man that is rich, and Col. 3. 5.
covetous,
Which makes him, as thou art, idolatrous.
Now thou art here, Job 21. 34.
small comfort thou shall find
From him, and others, 'twill trouble thy mind.
For when thou art in want, and otherwise
Afflicted here, thy friends Job 12. 5.
will thee despise.
Then will thou in a poor condition be,
Number. 14. 43.
If God be not thy friend, to stand by thee.
1 Samuel 28. 16.
But thou that have made God thine enemy,
Esa. 42. 17.
By trusting gods that are mere vanity:
Adhering to the Rev. 17. 1. 5
Whore of Babylon,
Rev. 17. 14.
The enemy of Christ, Gods only Son,
Ezekiel. 14. 7, 8.
Can not from that great God true comfort have,
Rev. 14. 8.
That art to that and 17. 4.
great Whore such a bondslave.
What an erroneous Church do thou live in,
That to all men Gal. 5. 13. Ecclus 15. 20.
gives liberty to sin?
The Pope, 2 These. 2. 3
that man of sin (who is misled
By Satan) is of that false Church the head.
That head that has on it a triple crown,
2 These 2 8
Shall one day be by Ephesians. 5. 23.
Christ our Head pulled down.
The Pope, with his Rev. 9 3.
Locusts, his underlings,
Have power, as thou beleev'st, Mar. 2. 7.
to pardon sins.
But if such sinners as to them do go
To have their sins forgiven, they must know,
If they fall short of money to obtain
Their pardons, then their labor's but in vain.
In what a poor deistressed case art thou,
That want thy liberty, and know now how
A little means to get, that art in debt,
That thou a pardon for thy sins may get?
What though thou think thy sins be never so small?
No pardon thou shall have for them at all,
Unless thy ghostly Father thou content
With money, then though thou do not repent,
Esa. 43. 25
He Will pardon them, though they be never so great;
Rev. 12. 9. 2* Cor. 4. 4.
Thus does the Devil all such blind fools cheat.
Oh! how are all the members of thy Church
2 Thessalonians. 2. 11.
Deluded, and at last left in the lurch?
That cannot be a true, but false religion*
Which most wise men thereof have in derision.
The Religion of the Romish Church is such,
Rev. 17. 4.
As is polluted and defiled much:
The wickedness thereof cannot be hid,
Mar. 7. 9.
For that maintains that, which Gods Laws forbid,
Lev. 26. 1.
Idolatry, 1 Cor. 10. 4.
which true Christians abhor,
1 King. 12 19. 1 Pet. 2. 13. 14
Rebellion against Princes, and yet more,
Lev. 20. 10.
Adultery, and 1 Cor. 6. 18.
fornication, which
Them permitted is, to poor and rich;
Zach. 5. 4.
Perjury, 1 Timothy 1. 10.
Buggery, Genesis 19. 36.
Incest, and such like
2 Chronicles. 36. 14.
Abominations, of which they make light.
Those Popish Clergy do and will maintain,
Because thereby they have much 1 Timothy 3. 3
filthy gain:
This seems a brave Religion to th'unwise,
That Is stuffed with 2 Pet. 2. 1.
base old heresies, and lies.
What good do think from thy Religion springs,
Rom* 16. 17.
That contradicts it self in many things?
But when Psalm. 119. 140.
the Word of God, which is so pure,
Heb. 12. 3.
Is thereby crossed, who can the same endure?
But 2 Cor. 6. 15
truth and falsehood we shall never see
As long as this world lasts, e're to agree.
Acts 3. 17.
Thou that in ignorance have been so long bred,
1 John 2. 21
Know not the truth, no more then he that is dead.
Those Mat. 23. 4.
ignorant Clergy, Heb. 10. 26
that the truth would smother,
Say, Ignorance of devotion is the mother.
What greater ignorance then, can there be found,
Then in the Romish Church, Hos. 4. 6.
that is therein drowned?
How can it otherwise be, when they deny
Acts 17. 11
The Scriptures to be read to the Laity?
Such orders they have made; and besides this*
Whatso'ere they do, be it never so much amiss:
Yet will they not by Gods pure Ps. 105. 19.
word be tried,
Jer. 8. 9. Pro. 13. 13.
Because they never could the same abide.
It is no marvel then, they are so vile,
2 Thessalonians. 2. 10.
Whom Satan their leader does thus beguile:
For he conducts them clean 2 Pet. 2. 15.
out of the way,
1 John 4. 6.
From truth to errors, for they him obey.
Rev. 19. 19
Such as under the Devils banner fight
Against their Maker, the great God of might,
Rev. 19. 20
Shall lose the battle* and likewise be sure
Eternal captivity to endure.
Rev. 14. 9. 10.
Such shall the estate and the condition be
Of all Idolaters* that from God flee.
Wild. 14. 27, 28.
for such regard not what sins they commit,
As dumb Idols and Images worship.
Psalm. 37. 12. Micah 2. 1.
What devilish plots and practices have been
Psalm. 124. 7.
Discovered here against our King and Queen,
And all our Royal Issue, with our State*
By all the Romish Sect, Mat. 5. 12.
who scorn and hate
All Christians, which the Gospel do profess
2 Cor. 1. 12
With all sincerity: yet never the less
1 King. 6. 20.
They would have blown up all, ('it was their intent)
When they assembled were in Parliament.
Those that unto their Mat. 15. 9.
Doctrine will not yield,
Heb. 11. 39.
Shall be tormented, scourged* and at last killed:
Heb. 11. 37
Such cruelty they use to Christ's poor members,
As if in hell there were no such offenders.
This Church Rev. 17. 5.
(the mother of harlots) is known
To be the Church Acts 17. 22
of Ceremonies alone:
Job 21. 12.
Organs with other sweet music, and singing,
Wax Baruch 6. 19.
candles lighted, Books, and Bells often ringing:
Rich Copes, fine Beads, and holy water, which
With other rare conceits that some bewitch:
Ps. 115. 4. Baruch 6. 39.
Brave images, and pictures of some Saints,
And Angels, which they say, hear their complaints.
Crosses gilded with gold, beset with stones,
And Relics, whereof some are dead men's bones,
And some are teeth, heads, arms, and other parts
Of Saints dismembered, which grieves not their hearts
To see what monsters they of some Saints make,
At which the wiser sort their heads do shake.
One Saint at several places had three heads,
Six arms another, and a third four legs.
There was a Saint in England, we are told,
That had more teeth then two hogs-heads could hold.
2 These. 2. 11.
Such lying fopperies Papists maintain,
Ps. 106. 39.
As merely are devised by their own brain.
A man would wonder, in this age, to see
What strange disordered orders now there be
Ordained in the Church of Rome, whereby
That Church is much enriched; but the Country
And Kingdoms that are subject thereunto,
Are much impoverished, some they quite undo.
So many Sects there are, both high and low,
Of Clergymen, which they themselves scarce know:
Esaias 2. 17.
The lofty Cardinals, proud and ambitious;
The Jesuits, Acts 13. 50
which are every where seditious;
1 Pet. 5. 3.
The domineering Bishops, which have cures;
The lazy [Monks] Mat. 23. 4 Psalm 37 7.
that are mere Epicures*
The drunken Priests, Esaias 44. 15. 16.
who eat their breaden Gods;
Jer. 5. 8.
The lecherous [Friers] who whip Nuns with rods;
The Capuchins, who wear to shirts, and go
By two and two, Mat. 23. 28.
are hypocrites we know*
And diverse other Orders from Rome sent,
With unchaste Nuns, make up the Jer. 5. 27.
Rabblement.
These Popish Clergy are 1 Timothy 4. 3.
forbid to marry,
Hos. 7. 4.
And yet from common whores cannot long tarry.
1 Cor. 7. 9.
Their reins must needs be purged by maids or wives,
Else they will be sick, and endanger their lives.
It is more lawful for a Priest to have
Ten Concubines, then one wife, never so brave.
This 1 Timothy 4. 1.
Devilish doctrine is taught unto those
That are apt Scholars, whom their Master knows.
They likewise do on certain days 1 Timothy 4. 3.
forbid
Flesh to be eaten; and yet they instead
Of flesh may eat of other things their fill,
With dainty Cakes and sweet-meates, if they will,
And several sorts of wine of pleasant taste;
This is the manner of the Popish Fast.
If thou such fasting days could here observe,
Though thou fast often, yet thou need'st not starve.
But what a wicked custom have those got,
1 Cor. 14. 14.
That in a strange tongue pray, which they know not?
Yet ignorant Papists pray as they are taught,
Although their prayers (God knows) are stark naught:
For when they understand not what they say,
They do but prate; a Parrat may so pray.
1 King. 18. 26.
The form and substance of their prayer's such
As does the Lord dishonor very much:
Luke 11. 2.
For to some Saints they pray, and cannot tell
Whether those Saints in heaven be, or in hell.
Whether true Saints, or Popish Saints, Jer. 11. 12.
they fail
That to them pray; 'twill nothing them avail:
Yet when this Popish crew want help, they then
Pray to those Saints, which were but mortal men.
The Virgin Mary, Jer. 7. 18.
she is more called upon
Then Christ Luke 1. 47.
her Savior, the Mat. 21. 42.
chief corner stone.
Rev. 19. 10. and 22, 8, 9. Col. 2. 18.
Angels that are Gods servants, as Saints be,
They worship, for their Church does so agree.
Exo. 20. 4.
Carved Images and pictures on the wall,
Crosses, Relics, and other things withal
Psalm. 115. 4, 5, 6, 7.
That have no life, yet Jer. 50. 38.
they like beasts do creep
And crawle to them, sometimes in the open street:
Exo. 20. 5.
And when they are thus prostrate, then they cry
Unto those Idols, their wants to supply.
So soon as people dye, their Mat. 25. 46.
souls do go
To heaven or hell, the word of God says so.
Yet those ungodly Papists have invented
A place besides hell, where souls are tormented;
That place of Purgatory, where they say,
The souls must needs be Heb. 1. 3.
purged before that day.
They are delivered thence, therefore they make
For those souls prayers, which lie in that lake.
Thus those, that are in thy religion bred,
In vain do pray for their friends, which are dead.
Believe me, if a Purgatory be
On earth, it is here, thou can not choose but see.
This place will thee so purge, thou need'st not care
To be purged again, thou know not where.
The Romish Church, like Pharisees and Scribes,
Mar. 7. 13.
Prefer men's vain Traditions* (like Mat. 23. 24.
blind guides)
Before the written word of God, which none
But such blasphemers Lev. 26. 15* 16. Pro. 13. 13.
do despise alone:
For they Rev. 22. 18.
add thereunto, and and 19.
from it take
That which shall make their souls in hell to quake.
Their great legend of Psalm. 52. 3.
lies is more set by
Then Pro. 30. 5.
Gods pure word, Job 37. 22.
that is full of Majesty.
The Exo. 34. 28
ten Commandments of God, wherein
Deuteronomy. 32. 34 Col 2. 3.
A mass of treasure's locked up to the brim:
Those Clergy have the second clean left out:
And of the last made two: there is no doubt
Esa. 33. 22.
But God, that gave those laws, will suddenly
Psalm. 97. 7.
Bring them to shame for their Idolatry,
Which sin's against that great Commandment,
And that is the reason the Counsel of Trent
Would not have that once mentioned, lest thereby
Act. 17. 16 Jer. 5. 31.
Their people should forbear Idolatry.
Though in Pro. 7. 2.
Gods Law all sins are comprehended,
Yet have those out-lawed Clergy recommended
Unto their people five Command'ments more
Then e're the primitive Church heard of before.
Which laws are so observed without excuse,
Jer. 9. 13. 14, 15.
As Gods Laws now are almost out of use.
Luke 11. 42.
That man that breaks but one Commandment
Of theirs, must penance do, though he repent:
But if he should at once break all Gods Laws,
No penance he should do: and why? because
Ezekiel. 16. 20
The sins against those Laws are very small,
1 John 3. 4. 8.
And some such sins they count but venial:
The Priest therefore no penance will enjoyne
To such a sinner, though he have no coin.
Exodus 20. 8.
The Lords day all true Christians sanctify
An holy rest to God our Lord on high:
Act. 20. 7.
Which day's appointed to read, hear, and pray,
Exodus 20. 10.
And no work to be done upon that day.
But those profane and wretched Papists hold,
Neh. 10. 31
That wares on that day may be bought and sold.
After they have in the morning been at Mass,
Neh. 13. 15.
Some go to work, and some their time do pass
Esa. 58. 13
In wanton sports; thus they may work or play
On that day more then any holy day.
Christ only has Ephesians. 4. 5. 1 Cor. 11. 26.
two Sacraments ordained,
Which in his Church shall ever be maintained:
The Church of Rome has added thereunto
Five Sacraments more, which they ought not to do.
The two which Christ ordained, these men unwise
Sophisticate with their ceremonies:
The other five they never could maintain
As Sacraments to be joined with those twain.
Now this corrupted Church, with much envy,
Pro. 30 6.
Add what they list to Gods Word wrongfully.
The Canons of the Mass they hold equal
Unto the Rev. 14. 6.
Gospel, which is eternal.
This hellish doctrine they hold, and so would
Heb. 13 9.
Have all the world believe it, if they could:
And to win credit thereunto, we know
Rev. 16. 14
They did false miracles devise, and so
Amazed the people, and made some to jarre;
Rev. 19. 20 Bell and Dra. 13. 14. 20. 21.
But now their juggling tricks discovered are.
These are the blind Scribes, and Pharisees, that
Mat. 23. 24
Swallow a Camel, and strain at a Gnat.
And yet these merit-mongers, though they be
Psalm. 101. 8
Such wicked livers, as the world may see:
Luke 17. 10
They think to merit heaven by their good works:
Such wicked Christians are as bad as Turks.
Nay Joh. 8. 44.
these sons of their Father, that old Liar,
Say men may do more then Gods Laws require.
Jude 11.
Such damnable and wicked errors these
Base Antichristians teach, even as they please.
Psalm. 106. 35 36.
Thou art one of their Scholars, here despised,
Forget their lessons, Pro. 19. 20.
and be well advised.
It may be God to this School has thee brought,
Esa. 29. 24.
To learn a lesson which thou never wast taught.
If thou will therefore Esa. 34. 16.
Gods Book take in hand,
Luke 24. 45
And learn the same rightly to understand,
1 Cor. 10. 14.
Thou will abandon all that Popish crew,
Luke 12. 32
And be of Christ's poor flock, though they be few:
Act. 8. 32.
Read then the holy Scriptures with delight, Tim. 4 13.

Manasseh was a great idolater,
As thou and others of thy Church now are:
2 Chronicles. 33. 10.
He would not hearken to the Lord, until
V. 11.
He was in great affliction, very ill;
V. 12.
He being led into captivity,
Humbled himself, and to the Lord did cry;
V. 13.
Who heard his voice, that was in such distress,
And did out of that bondage him release;
Prayer of Manasseh.
Be thou like him, now thou afflicted art,
Psalm. 32. 5.
Confess thy sins to God, with all thy heart.
1 John 2. 28 Psalm. 31. 6.
In him alone put all thy confidence;
Ps. 86. 11.
Embrace the truth, let it be thy defense.
Ps. 51. 13.
Thou being thus converted, God will thy
Body and soul 2 Timothy 4. 18.
preserve continually.
Then as Manasseh was delivered, so
Shall thou likewise, then 2 Chronicles. 33. 13.
thou the Lord wilt know.
Thou being then 1 Cor. 1. 4.
endued with Gods grace,
Psalm. 92. 1.
Wilt give him thanks that brought thee to this place,
Where thou shall not stay long, if thou him love,
1 Pet. 1. 4.
For he will remove thee to a place above;
1 Cor. 6. 9.
To which place no Idolater shall go,
Rev. 14. 11
For their dwelling shall be in hell below.
But those that are Ephesians. 5. 30.
Christ's members, when they dye,
Joh. 17. 24.
Shall live with him their Col. 1. 18.
head eternally.
CHAP. XXI.
To his Brother:
I Must confess thou art 1 Samuel 17. 28.
my elder brother,
But if in Barkshire there be such another,
I am deceived; yet can I not forbear
In my distress, Job 13. 17.
but this to thee declare:
Five months and upward in this place have I
A prisoner been, thou can it not deny;
In all which time 2 Chronicles. 18, 26.
although thou knew'st my grief,
Would not at all send me the least relief.
Had it not been for some here, that me cherished
At certain times, Psalm. 9. 18.
I might have starved and perished
Ruth 2. 14. Luke 10. 33.
More love have I from these poor strangers found,
Then from thy self, since this world on me frowned.
But now in prison I am, thou know where,
Luke 10. 31. 32.
Whether I sink or swim, thou take no care.
Had thou a feeling of my misery,
1 John 4. 20.
Thou could not have so little charity
Psalm. 69. 8.
Thus to neglect me, now I am in thrall,
But that thou art 2 Timothy 3. 3
to me unnatural.
Consider therefore, Zech. 7. 9.
and do not forget
Thy brother, that is imprisoned for debt.
I was thy friend, and am thy brother, tho
In Prison, Job 16. 20.
where false friends will not me know.
Thou art my brother, yet I must thee tell,
Pro. 18. 24
A true friend's nearer to me, I know well.
Let me therefore not only thee advise
1 These. 4. 9.
To be my brother, but my friend likewise.
Mat. 7. 12.
Do as thou would be done unto, thou then
Wilt please the Lord, and be beloved of men.
Romans 14. 10.
Howsoever thou deal'st with me, I Will strive to be
Heb. 13. 5.
Contented, and 1 These. 5. 25
pray to the Lord for thee:
Hoping, though I in this extremity
Have not thy help, yet 1 These. 1. 6
God will sanctify
These great afflictions to me, and me send
Help and 2 Pet. 2. 9.
deliverance out of them in the end.
Number. 27. 3
Our father's dead, be not so strange to me,
Whilst we have breath Psalm. 133. 1.

To the merciful Creditour.
A Poor man thou have in this Prison laid,
Philem. 11
Who heretofore was by thee well employed.
2 King. 12 15.
Credit thou gav'st him, and did him well use,
Whilst he dealt with thee, yet did he refuse
2 Kin. 4. 7.
To give thee such content as he was able,
And yet without just cause Pro. 10. 31
did with thee brabble:
Wherefore when thou in him could find no reason,
Psalm. 55. 19
Hither thou sent'st him, which was in due season:
For since his being here, Romans 8. 13.
he is mortified,
Tit. 3. 3.
That heretofore was stout, and full of pride.
Ecclus 35. 20.
Now in his great distress, when he to thee
Did make his moan, thou quickly did agree,

Then though thy debt he do discharge, yet still
Philem. 19
He Is thy debtor, but not against thy will.
For debts of such a high nature are not
1 Cor. 16. 18.
To be by honest Christians e're forgot:
Which debtors, though Jam. 2. 5.
they may be poor in spirit,
Will make thee rich, that shall one day inherit
Mat. 25. 34.
A kingdom, that is for all good men prepared,
Which shall be their everlasting reward.
Such creditors God will preserve and keep,
Psalm 71. 20.
Though they in troubles are plunged never so deep.
If other creditors were like to thee,
This prison which is full, would empty be.
The Jayler and his underlings might then
Go shake their ears, like poor conditioned men.
But in these days we know it to be true,
Esa. 57. 1.
The number of such creditors are few.
Psalm. 18. 25
Thou being now thus to thy debtor kind,
Ecclus 12. 2,
Shall favor from God thy creditor find.
Ps. 103. 2.
Bless thou the Lord, Jam. 1. 17.
for besides him there is none
That moves men to do good, but him alone.

WHen Captains are surprised, and lose the field,
1 Samuel 4. 2.
They then unto the enemy must yield.
By thy relation, 1 M^^h. 11. 69 70.
thou have been upon
Hot service, which unto thy selfe's best known.
Howso'ere thou have to danger been exposed,
Gen* 40. 3.
Thou now art here, within this sort enclosed.
Brought in by Mat. 5. 15.
those, whose daily exercise
Is to endeavor how they may surprise
And get into their clutches such brave sparks,
Ecclus. 29. 5. 6.
As study how to run in debt like sharkes:
Ecclus 29. 4
But take no care their debts to satisfy,
Until they are put to extremity.
Luke 12. 58.
The Sergeants, when they meet with such a one,
Although he be a valiant blade, well known,
They Will venture on him, be it day or night,
And make him yield, although he rail and fight.
And when they have him, they will make him to know
(Unless he bribe them well) he must needs go
To prison, where he will want his liberty,
To spend his youthful days in vanity.
Ezekiel. 6. 9.
The Prison therefore is the fittest place
For such a Captain, that runs such a race.
In these days Judith 12. 17* 20.
that Captain is counted brave
And valiant, that is Psalm. 81. 12.
unto his lust a slave.
Which lusts are cause of much Ecclus 28. 9.
unquietness,
And unjust quarrels there upon increase,
Which cannot be appeased by friend nor brother,
Ecclus 28. 11.
Until they stab and (...) one another.
Such Captains do more hurt at home, then they
Do good abroad in the wars, as many say.
How many likewise are there at this time
Judge. 3. 2.
That have no skill in marshall discipline,
1 Samuel 17. 10.
And yet they will brag, as if they durst to fight
With Sir John Old ^^stle, that high flowne Knight?
Their combat Pro. 6. 26.
is with wenches, when they please,
Who wound them sorely with the French disease.
Many such youngsters (as we understand)
That never traveled yet by Sea or Land,
Have by some means procured themselves Jer. 13. 21.
to be
Made Captains, which can lead a company
Act. 17. 5.
Of swag'ring fellows, which do not regard
Their King nor Countrey's good, and yet hazard
Their souls and bodies, Ephesians. 4. 19.
by spending their days
In Tavernes, Bawdy-houses, and Stage Plays.
So that at last those Soldiers must needs fall
2 Timothy 2. 26.
Into the Devils hands, their General.
Who for their service will be sure to give
Them their due wages, when their souls shall live
With him in his Rev. 16. 10
dark kingdom, to remain
Both Rev. 20. 10
day and night in everlasting pain.
1 Chronicles. 12. 18.
Some Captains are endu'd with excellent parts,
2 Chronicles. 32. 7.
Having courageous understanding hearts:
2 Chronicles. 20. 15.
These fight the battle of the Lord on high,
2 Samuel 23. 10.
Who gives them often times the victory
Over the enemy, though never so strong:
Wherefore Psalm. 98. 1.
the glory thereof does belong
Unto Esaias 1. 24.
the Lord of Hosts, the God of might,
Psalm. 68. 35.
Who gives them strength, and 144. 1.
and teaches them to fight.
Such Captains as are thus guided by him,
(...) 3. 3.
Shall credit to their King and Country win.
1 Mac. 4. 23. 24.
And when they from the wars return, they will bless
And praise the Lord, 1 Macch. 4. 55.
that gave them such success.
1 Mac. 3. 59.
What if in fight they chance to lose their lives?
Their loss is nothing Rev. 2. 10.
to that glorious prize
Which they shall gain in heaven, and keep for ever,
1 John 5. 11.
Which prize their Captain Christ will them deliver.
If thou art such a Captain, then I Will say,
It Is pity thou should in this prison stay:
Deuteronomy. 8. 11.
But rather be in some employment, where
Thou may have more contentment, and less care,
Such as are out of service, may well be
Mislead, and so come into misery.
How thou came hither, I need not enquire,
But here thou art attended like a Squire,
Where thou have got a company that are
A ragged Regiment, most fit for war.
1 Samuel 22. 2
Distressed men in debt, and in despair,
With discontented minds to thee repair,
Wishing thou were their Captain, and that they
May wait on thee, when thou hence go away.
I cannot blame them, for thou art so free
To them, that they could live and dye with thee.
But thou art not yet gone, but here art stayed,
And so shall be until thy ransome's paid.
Thou now art under the command of those
That keep thee fast, and yet are not thy foes.
The Turn-keyes, and the Book-keepers are they
That thou (although a Captain) must obey.
Yet if thou feed them with good drink and money,
They Will love thee dearly, as the Bees love honey.
But if thou do neglect them in that kind,
No favor thou at all shall from them find.
But what need'st thou care for their love at all,
Or for their hatred, having wherewithal
Not only to discharge thy chamber rent,
But other things that may yield thee content?
Yet let me tell thee, if thou stay here long,
Thou to thy self and others may do wrong.
But seeing thou art to this place confined,
Whilst thou art here Josh. 23. 6.
have a courageous mind.
Gal. 5. 17.
For here thou art with enemies beset,
As well as in the open field; and yet
Thou can not them discern with mortal eyes,
Ephesians. 6. 12.
Because they are thy spiritual enemies.
1 Pet. 2. 11
Thy soul they do besiege, which is within
Thy earthly 2 Pet. 1. 14
tabernacle Luke 5. 8.
full of sin.)
Job 33. 6.
Which is so weak and brittle, that unless
1 John 4. 13
Gods holy Spirit do the same possess
And eke defend thee Ephesians. 1. 19.
by his mighty power,
Rev. 16. 14
Those wicked spirits will thy soul devour:
Ephesians. 2. 2.
For they are powerful, and diligent,
Crafty, malicious, and wickedly bent
Against weak worldlings, which with them accord,
Because they are not Ephesians. 6. 10
strong in Christ our Lord.
Such though they fight, it will nothing them avail,
Rev. 11. 7.
For those strong enemies must needs prevail.
Their forces they do muster up each hour,
Mar. 5. 9.
To signify how they are armed with power.
Rev. 20. 7, 8.
It is no worldly strength nor policy
That can withstand their cruel tyranny.
Thou must therefore Heb. 4. 12.
take that two-edged sword,
Ephesians. 6. 17.
Which weapon is Gods pure and holy Word:
With that thou may be sure, with good directions,
Gal. 5. 24.
In time to conquer thy corrupt affections.
Pro. 16. 32.
Which if thou do, thou then do such a feat,
As never did Alexander the great.
2 Timothy 4. 7, 8.
So shall thou be, after this life, renowned,
And with such like Captains 1 Pet. 5. 4.
in heaven be crowned.
Where thou shall triumph Heb. 12. 22, 23.
with a company
Of heavenly Soldiers, Col. 3. 4.
with pomp and glory.
CHAP. XXIIII.
To the Master of the Prison.
THou art a Master of the masterlesse,
As also of poor men here in distress.
They never such a Master served before,
When their time's out, they will serve thee no more.
For thou them keep'st so much within, that they
Cannot get leave to go abroad to play.
And if they could get leave, I dare maintain,
That some would never find the way back again.
Wherefore thou take a course Acts 16. 23
to keep them fast,
Where they may work, or play, and dye at last.
Thy courtesies to some are very small,
And why? because they have not wherewithal
To gratify thy love; which is expressed
By thee to them that are in more request.
I mean those that are able to requite
Thy love again, which thou hold'st just and right.
The poorer sort of prisoners that are here
Pro. 18. 23.
Cut short of means, do often stand in fear
Of thy displeasure, when they cannot get
So much as will them bring out of thy debt.
For if their chamber rent they cannot pay,
Thou them remov'st into the Hole, where they
Have lousy lodging, yet they live more quiet,
Because they are provided with good diet.
There they also sit rent free: yet before
They are released, they must pay their old score.
But if in prison they should chance to dye,
Thou losest all, and have no remedy.
Those that lodge on thy side thou do regard
A little more then us of the Knights Ward.
I know no reason for it, unless it be
Because they pay more for their drink then we.
The Rats and Mice are thy best guests we know,
For after one nights lodging they must go
Away from hence, if they their fees can pay,
If not, they then are forced longer to stay.
Thou art a master of a Mat. 27. 16.
wicked crew,
Acts 8. 3.
As well as of some men honest and true.
This place a receptacle is for all,
Both good and bad, the poor, rich, great and small.
Some for their misdemeanors, some for debt,
So that all is fish that comes into thy net.
Of which thou make a purchase, and thereby
It Is known thou Pro. 13. 11. and 22. 1.
get'st more wealth then honesty.
Thy servants often times do take large fees,
Which they digest, as Rats digest old cheese.
They care not how men suffer, Jer. 17. 11:
so they gain
Means indirectly, Psalm. 10. 2.
their pride to maintain.
The master and his men, for ought I know,
Esaias 24. 2.
Are all alike, they may together go.
Pro. 19. 1.
Gods poorest servant's in a better case
John 3. 10.
Then such a master, that is in such a place.
Thou have within thy self unruly guests,
And those are Col. 3. 5.
thine affections, which witness
Unto thy Romans 2^ 15.
conscience, which one day will be
(When thou think least) a witness against thee.
If thou therefore seek not in the mean while
Gal. 5. 24.
To over-master them, which are so vile,
They Will over-master thee, and suddenly
1 Timothy 6. 9
Will bring thy soul into great misery.
Amos 5. 11
By poor men in great want thou have thy gain,
And liv'st thereby in pleasure, they in pain;
Jam. 2. 6. Pro. 14. 20.
Regarding them no more, nay not so much
As Dogs and Cats, that are unlike to such.
Thou this one day wilt be forced to remember,
When it is too late, Pro. 21. 13.
if thou art not more tender
Over poor prisoners that are here committed,
Pro. 29. 7.
Which certainly deserve much to be pitied.
Wherefore if thou Gods favor would enjoy,
Acts 16. 33, 34.
Show favor to these men without delay.
Then Col. 4. 1.
God thy master Psalm. 25. 8.
will thee teach, and guide
Thee in the way to heaven, Ephesians. 2. 19.
where Saints abide.
CHAP. XXV.
To the Merchant, a Prisoner.
A Merchant when he once begins to fail*
Is like a Ship at Sea without a sail,
Which flotes upon the waters, and is tossed
And tumbled up and down, until she is lost.
In thy declining time thou knew'st not whither
To go; so that the Sergeants brought thee hither.
Ezekiel. 27. 34
And now thy trading and thy credit too
Is lost; and here thou know not what to do.
For in times past, those with whom thou have walked.
Upon The Exchange, and there of business talked,
Perceiving how thou wast often times molested
Because of losses, and of Bills protested,
Job 19. 4.
Do leave thee now in misery in this place,
Ecclus 12. 8* 9*
As if before they never had seen thy face.
The friendship of such friends is like a bubble,
Soon got, soon lost, Ecclus 37. 4.
and best discerned in trouble.
In former time 2 Chronicles. 17. 13.
thy business was so great,
Ecclus 31. 1
That thou could scarce find time to eat thy meat.
Ecclus 31. 3
Thou then had trouble, which did vex thy mind:
Psalm. 88. 3.
Thou now have troubles of another kind.
Psalm. 39. 6.
Thou then wast troubled how to get much wealth;
Heb. 12. 9, 10.
Thy troubles now may be for thy souls health.
Mar. 4. 19.
How careful wast thou then for outward things,
Luke 10. 41, 42. Ephesians. 1. 3.
And careless how to get inward blessings?
Before The Exchange bell rang, thou had a care
To keep touch with those that should meet thee there.
But when thy Parish Bells did ring all in,
Thou made no have to the Church, to pray or sing,
Or John 8. 47.
hear Gods Word, and 1. 1. 3.
which is that spiritual light
Esaias 55. 2, 3. Psalm. 119 162* 172.
And joy, wherein thy soul should take delight:
But with that John 6. 33
heavenly food Esa. 43. 22. Ezekiel. 33. 31.
thou wast soon cloyed*
Luke 8. 14,
Because thy mind was otherwise employed;
Wherefore Pro. 3. 12.
God for thy good, without all question,
Has brought thee hither, to give thee correction.
For he hereby will make thee Job 6. 24. Psalm. 19. 12.
understand
How thou art out of cash, and behind hand
With him thy heavenly creditor above*
Whose Romans 15. 5. Psalm. 117. 2.
patience thou have found, out of his love
In Psalm. 39. 13
sparing thee so long, who might require
Mat. 18. 34 Psalm. 130. 3.
In justice, all thou ow'st him, in hell fire.
Psalm. 40. 12
For when thou have made up thy great account,
The foot or balance thereof will amount
Unto Mat. 18. 24
ten thousand Talents, which must be
Deuteronomy. 27. 25.
All satisfied before thou can be free.
And yet of that great sum thou must needs say,
Mat. 18. 25 2 Cor. 3. 5.
Thou have not of thy self one Mite to pay.
Pro. 24. 16. 1 Timothy 1. 15. James 3. 2.
The holy'st man that lives must needs confess
His debt to be so much, it cannot be less.
How then is Gods great Justice satisfied,
Col 2. 14. Romans 5. 6. 8.
But by his Son, our Lord, who for us died?
If thou unto thy soul can this apply
Romans 3. 22.
Through faith in Christ, ^ Pet. 2. 21
that he for thee did dye.
1 Cor. 15. 3
And that thereby thy sins are all remitted*
Col. 1, 20. 21. 22.
Gods Justice satisfied, and thou acquitted.
1 These. 1. 10.
Not only from the punishment that is due
Unto thee for thy sins, but will renew
Job 33. 26
His favor to thee, whereby thou may know
Heb. 8. 10.
Thou art in the Covenant of grace also.
Phil. 1. 27 1 Pet. 2. 12.
Thy outward carriage then will soon express
Thy inward faith, and joy, in thy distress.
Pro. 3. 21, 22, 23.
Thy life a comfortable life will be,
Joh. 12. 24
When thou the fruits of thy troubles shall see
2 Cor. 4. 17 Gal. 5. 22. 23.
Thus to produce such rare effects, which will
Col. 3. 10.
Advance thy knowledge, and teach thee such skill
Esa. 55. 2.
In heavenly wares, and merchandise so rare
As in Gods Word is found out every where.
Joh. 5. 39.
Go to that heavenly Magazine, and see
What Romans 11. 33.
rich commodities are there and 9. 23.
for thee.
Mat. 13. 45, 46.
A Merchant that found there a Pearl by name,
Sold all that e're he had to buy the same.
Job 28. 16. 17.
Such Jewels, Pearls, and Treasures there are, which
2 Cor. 4. 3.
Are hid from worldlings, be they never so rich.
Joh. 8. 44.
For they had rather trade with that old Liar.
Rev. 12. 9.
That cheating Merchant, whose chiefest desire
Is to put off Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21.
his base commodities
To those his chapmen, at too high a prize.
2 Thessalonians. 2. 10.
His wares are false, his Jewels counterfeit,
2 Cor. 11. 3
Yet like a crafty Broker, he will soon get
1 Cor. 10. 20.
Some of his customers with him to trade.
Whom, when with them a bargain he has made,
Mat. 48. 9.
Such base conditions he will tie unto,
Mar. 8 36.
As will their souls and bodies quite undo.
1 King 21. 25.
When they are in his debt* he will make them pay
To the utmost farthing, Rev. 18. 8.
and just at the day
Acts 13. 10.
When he is in their debt, then will he be sure
Luke 16. 24.
To pay them soundly, and v. 26.
which they must endure.
Mat. 22. 13
Such cruel payments he will make, that they
Jude 11. Wis. 5. 7, 8* 9.
Shall rue the time that they e're knew his way.
2 Pet. 2. 15
That way of sin that causes death, which is
Rev 20. 14
The second death, and 9. 6.
that living death to his
Unhappy chapmen, who shall be together
Mat. 25. 41
With him tormented in hell fire for ever.
Wherefore, let me advise thee to take heed,
Ephesians. 5. 11.
Thou traffic not with him, nor with his seed.
2 Timothy 1. 9
But follow thou that calling which will bring
Thee in great credit with thy Lord and King:
Mat. 18. 23.
That great accomptant, who will reckon right
With his poor debtors, to give them a fight
Job 13. 23.
Not only of their sin, Eccles 8. 6.
and misery,
Number. 14. 18. Psalm. 103. 11.
But also of his infinite mercy.
1 John 3. 24.
When thou art versed thus in this heavenly way,
Mark 8. 34
Thou will thy self deny, Deuteronomy. 30. 8.
and him obey.
Jer. 3. 15.
Thy judgment then will be so rectified,
As thou will not at all Phil. 1. 28. 1 Pet. 4. 12.
be terrified
Psalm. 112. 7 Pro. 3. 24.
At any thing that may befall thee here,
Phil. 3. 14. 20.
Because thy course toward heaven thou do now steer.
Where being once arrived, and ascended,
Mat. 25. 23.
Thy joys begin, Rev. 21. 4.
and thy sorrows are ended.
2 Esd. 7. 33.
Thy miseries then thou must here leave behind,
Romans 9. 23 Psalm* 36. 5.
And Gods great mercies there be sure to find.
CHAP. XXVI.
To the merry man, a Prisoner.
R -- Emember thou, Eccles 7. 4
that art so merry here,
Pro. 14. 6.
Thou do not in this place any man jeere.
I -- t Pro. 1. 22.

1 Pet. 3. 11
For here thou should better things learn and know.
C -- ivill and honest Neh. 8. 12. Eccles 8. 15. Luke 15. 23.

Eccles 7. 4. Ephesians. 5. 4.
But foolish mirth belongs to Robin-hood.
H -- ere in prison, Pro. 14. 13. Jam. 4. 9.
vain mirth should be abhorred:
When thou art merry, Psalm. 104. 34. Acts 16. 25. James 5. 13.
be merry in the Lord.
A -- nd Genesis 43. 34
then thy mirth shall not others displease,
Which being true, thou may live more at ease.
R -- emember Esaias 24. 22

Which should in some sort touch thee to the heart.
D -- oe not therefore in this place take delight
= With those that make Job 17. 12.

Roaring like Lions in their nasty den.
A -- s for Pro. 28. 19.
such company, do not frequent
For they will leave thee when thy money's spent.
N -- ecessity may then Amos 8. 10 Ecclus 11. 27.

To a Prisoners wife of a refractory condition.
ONe Pro. 18. 22 Ecclus 26. 1.
of the chiefest blessings that
In this life God does give
Unto a man, a good wife is,
Ecclus 26. 2.
With him his time to live.
Thou art no blessing, but a curse,
That art a Pro. 27. 15
froward wife
To thy poor husband that here lies
Job 3. 21. and 7. 15.
Quite weary of his life.
Ecclus 25. 13.
What greater cross can happen to
An honest quiet mind,
Then to be matched to such a wife
As proves to him unkind?
Especially here in this Jayle,
A place of misery,
Pro. 19. 13
Where he no quietness can have,
Thou art so refractory.
Job 29. 5, 6 Tob. 1. 13, 14.
In former time when he had means
To keep thee in good fashion,
Thou then did fear and flatter him,
And durst not be in passion.
Ecclus 15. 25.
But now the Lord has humbled him,
And brought him to distress,
1 Cor. 7. 10. Tob. 2. 14.
Thy love from him is drawn away,
Esa. 32. 10.
And thou art grown careless.
Judge. 15. 1
If thou from him be long absent,
He cannot it abide,
And when thou come to visit him,
Thou then with him do Pro. ^1. 19. Ecclus 25. 20.

Now be thou present or absent,
His grief is not asswag'd,
The more he seeks for quietness,
Pro. 9. 13. and 21. 19.
The more thou art enraged.
Ecclus 4. 3.
So that thou add'st affliction to
Affliction in this kind,
Which is the greatest cross of all,
And troubles most his mind.
Job 1. 12.
When God permitted Satan to
Afflict Job, that Job 1. 1.
just man,
Job 1. 14, 15.
His substance first he took away,
Thus with him he began.
Job 1. 17.
Then the Chaldeans he provoked
His servants all to slay,
Job 1* 18, 19.
And after that likewise did he
His children take away.
Job 2. 7.
Then with great Botches and sore Boiles
His body he did smite,
So that on him he exercised
His malice and his spite.
And yet the Devil, for all that,
Did seem to favor him,
In leaving of his wife behind,
Ecclus 26. 13.
That might him comfort bring.
But that was not that Tempters drift,
It was his policy
To stir her up him to persuade
Job 2. 9.
To blaspheme God and dye.
Thus Job in his adversity
Was vexed and troubled sore,
By his untoward Job 2. 10.
foolish wife,
Who then Job 19. 17.
did him abhor.
Eccles 7. 28
Such wives there are too many now,
There Is one the more for thee,
For thy conditions do not much
With Jobs wife's disagree.
Ecclus 25. 16.
If thou continu'st in this course
Ecclus 26. 27.
To chide, scold, chafe, and fret,
Because of these great troubles, then
Thou do thy self forget;
For thou Genesis 2. 18.

To thy husband distressed,
And not an instrument to Ecclus 4. 2.

Wherefore consider with thy self,

Therefore Susanna 35
put thou thy trust in him,
And Ephesians. 5. 22, 24.
thy husband obey.
Then though in prison he now be,
Where he does much lament,
Psalm. 40. 17
Yet God will soon deliver him,
And give you both content.
Now when thou have him home again,
Provide him wholesome diet,
With all things else to his consent,
And with him live in 1 Pet. 3. 4. Ecclus 26. 14.

Thou art thus grieved for me,

God never sends adversities

He Will give to them above.
Nay Mar. ^0. 30

The Lord will comfort send

These troubles which we now are in,
Came not to us by chance,
But by the providence of God,
John 11. 4

Ecclus 2. 4.
Why should thou then impatient be:
Do think'tis for thine ease?
Oh no! Jer. 50. 24.
thou striv'st against the stream
And do the Lord displease.
Will thou be like those 2 Timothy 3. 6.

Although they read and hear much, yet
Do nothing understand?
How can thy Jam. 1. 3. Heb. 6. 12. 1 Pet. 1. 7.

And if on him we do depend,
1 John 4. 18
We shall not need to fear,
Esa. 51. 11 John 16. 20.
Our sorrows he will turn into joy,
^ Esd. 8. 45 Est. 16. 21.
Which we shall see most clear.
And though in this place now I am
Where I can get no bail,
Esaias 42. 7. Acts 7. 10.
Yet Christ will soon deliver me
Out of this noisome Jayle.
Joel 2. 26
Then shall we have just cause to praise
1 Pet. 5. 7.
The Lord for his great care,
Psalm. 37. 28
Which he has had, and still will have
Of us every where.
Hos. 6. 2, 3
And doubt not but we shall again
With comfort live together,
Psalm. 107. 28, 29.
For after the great storms are past,
Then comes the calm weather.
Phil. 4. 11.
Be thou in the mean time well content,
Attend, and Psalm. 27. 14
wait Gods leisure,
Psalm. 21. 2. Pro. 10. 24.
So shall thou have thy hearts desire,
Psalm. 69. 32*
And live always in pleasure.
CHAP. XXXV.
To his Maidservant.
WHen thou came first to dwell with me
About twelve years ago,
When I in Fanchurch street did live,
Psalm. 23. 5. Genesis 33. 9.
My cup did overflow.
Since which time Job 29. 12.
many have thereof
Drank freely at their pleasure,
So that with that Tob. 1. 20.
which has been spilt,
There Is nothing left to measure.
Ecclus 33. 20.
Those that the greatest part thereof
Should have had at that time,
Had the least share thereof, although
I was then in my prime.
Ecclus 30. 14.
The Cup although it empty be,
Yet is it whole and sound,
Jer. 31. 25.
And may again replenished be,
And not fall to the ground.
Job 13. 15*
Whatso'ere God now unto me sends,
My mind is truly bent
It to receive with thanksgiving,
Phil. 4. 11, 12.
And be therewith content.
The troubles which thou know I have
In thy time long endured,
Psalm. 65. 3.
A purge have been to my sick soul,
Which is not yet quite cured.
Pro. 16. 6.
This purge doubtless will do much good
Joel 3. 21.
It has not yet done working
Upon some humors ill, which yet
In my poor soul lie lurking.
Psalm. 103. 3
The great Physician of our souls
Jer. 10. 24.
Does temper with great skill
The potions which he gives to those
His patients that are ill.
Jer. 30. 11.
Those that he takes in hand to cure,
Although they feel much pain,
Psalm. 71. 20
Shall have much ease at length, and be
Jer. 30. 17.
Restored to health again.
In this great Doctors hands have I
Been Psalm. 34. 19
long, and am so still,
1 Samuel 3. 18.
Let him do what he please to me,
I Will submit to his will.
When God his scourge laid first on me,
Pro. 15. 10.
I took it so to heart,
Psalm. 107. 27
That then my senses all from me.
Did for a time depart.
Job 7. 5.
So irksome 'twas unto the flesh,
2 These. 2. 2
So tedious to my mind,
Job 7. 15. and 10. 1.
So grievous to my soul, that then
Joh. 10. 20 Lam. 1. 17.
No comfort I could find.
A fit of melancholy great,
Thou know I likewise had,
Psalm. 55. 5.
And being then with grief overwhelmed,
Psalm. 88. ^^
I thereupon grew mad.
2 Chronicles. 32. 31.
The Lord then left me for a time,
Job 1. 12, Mar. 5. 13.
And gave the Devil leave
To tempt me in such grievous sort,
That I then did conceive
Romans 7. 24.
My self to be the wretched'st man
That e're lived on the earth:
Pro. 18. 14.
And being thus in mind distressed,
Job 3. 1.
Cursed the day of my birth.
My sins then to my sight were brought
By the Ephesians. 2. 2.
Prince of the air,
1 Pet. 5. 8.
Who did endeavor what he could
To bring me to despair.
I then persuaded was by him
Acts 16. 27
My self to make away,
Acts 16. 28
And if God had not me preserved,
It had been done that day.
Such was my Job 30. 26.
woeful misery,
Jer. 30. 15.
Which seemed to me past cure,
I would not for a thousand worlds
The like again endure.
All troubles since, and those which now
I have, put all together,
Job 6. 2, 3.
Are in comparison of those,
2 Cor. 4. 17
As light as any feather.
And yet to Heb. 12. 13
flesh and blood are they
Full heavy to be borne,
By reason Job 18. 3.
I am counted as
A creature that is forlorn.
The troubles all which I have had,
In thy time thou have seen,
And with much discontent have thou
Rev. 1. 9.
A fellow feeler been:
Ruth 1. 16.
Yet would thou not from me then go,
Thy mistress knows full well,
Though thou preferment might have had,
Yet thou with us would dwell.
Thine eyes may see Pro. 10. 15.
how poverty
Has us now overtaken,
Yet such has been thy love, as yet
Thou have not us forsaken.
Nay though thou see Job 17. 15.
the small hope we
Have to get means again,
Yet thou so constant art, that still
With us thou do remain.
Now what the cause thereof is, must
Be to thy self best known,
Pro. 17. 17
Yet has thy love herein appeared,
Thou have it truly shown.
What can thou now from us expect?
If longer thou should stay,
Thou must needs think Ruth 2. 12.
thy recompense
Must come some other way.
2 John 1.
If it out of thy love be to
My children, which are now
With thee in the Country with our friends,
I then will make a vow,
That if the Lord e're send me means
To bring me out of trouble,
2 Samuel 2. 6
I Will not of thee unmindfull be,
But will requite thee double.
Be kind and loving still to them
Thou shall fare never the worse,
Ruth 4. 16
And have a care of my son Will,
For thou wast his dry Nurse.
His favorite thou art I know,
Thou do in him delight,
And he cannot endure that thou
Should be out of his sight.
A faithful servant thou have been,
Thou need'st not be ashamed
Pro. 14. 35.
Before thy betters to appear*
Though I am to be blamed.
Rev. 2. 10.
Be faithful to the end, and thou
Some Job 14. 14.
change shall see no doubt,
Though some Lam. 3. 14.
at my misfortunes do
In these days Baruth 4. 31. Ecclus 7. 11.
scoff and flout.
And though Psalm. 60. 1.
the Lord has us dispersed,
And scatt'red to and fro,
So as we cannot as we would
One to another go:
2 Chronicles. 15. 4.
Yet if in troubles we can put
Our trust in him alone,
Esa. 57. 13.
He Will us again together bring,
To live in peace at home.
If not at home here in this life,
Heb. 11. 16
Yet he will for us provide
In heaven a place far better, where
Romans 8. 17
We shall be glorified.
CHAP. XXXVI.
To the unruly young man, a Prisoner*
IF Pro. 13. 18
thou had been by thy friends ruled,
Thou had not now been here;
But seeing thou this course have run,
E're long it will appear,
That those whom thou did not regard,
Because Pro. 15. 32.
they thee then blamed,
Will now for thy unruly tricks
Leave thee here to be tamed.
If thou art like Psalm. 32. 9^
the horse, that will
Not ruled be a whit,
Jam. 3. 3.
Until into his mouth be put
The Bridle, or the Bit;
Then this place shall a Bridle be,
Now for to keep thee under,
Job 18. 12.
But thou a bit wilt sometimes want,
To satisfy thy hunger.
If thou here now 1 These. 5. 14.
unruly art,
Thou shall then have the worst*
For thou will in the hole be put,
And there be soundly purs'd.
Jer* 5. 3.
And if this place will not thee mend,
Thy friends then may conclude,
That thou will never be good, until
Thou like a Hawke art mewed,
And shut up close, where thou may not
Ecclus 18. 31.
Have things at thine own will,
That thou thereby in time may leave
Thy rudeness, Psalm. 4. 4.
and be still.
Ecclus 3. 26.
For now the more unquiet thou
In prison art, believe,
Ecclus 3. 27.
The more will be thy misery,
Which will thy heart much grieve.
These things therefore consider well,
Pro. 13. 16*
Show not thy self so idle,
Col. 3. 5.
In giving way to thine own will,
But thine affections bridle.
And then thy friends, when they shall hear
Psalm. 78. 34
And see thee thus reclaimed,
They Will then believe thou have much lost,
By which loss thou have gained.
For having lost thy stubborn fits,
Pro. 17. 20.
Which brought thee into trouble,
Hos. 14. 4.
Gods love thou have obtained, so that
Thy gain is more then double.
Acts 24. 23
Thy liberty likewise shall thou
Get, if the Lord see it fit,
How e're Psalm 37 7.
rest thou on him, and then
E're long thou shall be quit,
And freed out of this place, where thou
Have been curbed of thy will,
Psalm. 73. 24
And be at length received to joys,
Psalm. 16. 11
Where thou shall have thy fill.
CHAP. XXXVII.
To the Prisoners, called by the name of Mice, which are light huswives that
are taken at unlawful hours in the night by the Watch, and brought to Prison.
YOu Ecclus 26. 25.
that a shame to women are,
That modesty have none,
Pro. 7. 11, 12.
Why wander you so late abroad,
When you should be at home?
What is your business at such hours
Pro. 7. 9, 10
In The night, when you should sleep?
No reason you at all can give,
Why you such hours keep.
For if you could have satisfied
The Constable, who did
Examine you about the same,
Tit. 2. 5.
Which you know is forbid,
He had not brought you to this place,
Away you might have gone
Home to your houses, but here now
Esaias 3. 18.
You must sing a new song.
This prison is no place for you,
You must not long here stay,
For he that brought you in, is bound
To carry you away
1 King. 3. 16.
Before the next Justice of peace,
Ecclus 20. 19.
Where you your tale must tell,
And if he like it not, then he
Will send you to Bridewell:
Where entertainment you shall have,
For when you are let in,
Ezekiel. 23. 28, 29.
The Blew-cotes will take you aside,
And whip your tender skin.
Ecclus 7. 24.
Now when your parents fond shall hear,
How you are thus corrected,
Ecclus 22. 3.
They Will then bethink themselves with grief
How they have you neglected.
Ecclus 22. 4
For when untoward Girls you were,
Which made them discontented,
Pro. 22. 15. and 19. 18.
If they had whipped you soundly then,
This might have been prevented.
But now it is too late for them
For this thing to repent,
As it is too soon for you to be
Pro. 7. 13.
So vile and impudent.
Yet is it not too late for you
Acts 3. 19.
To repent and amend,
Which if you do, then certainly
Acts 3. 20. John 15. 14.
The Lord will stand your friend;
Esa. 54. 4.
And bring you out of this disgrace,
Into which you are run,
Ezekiel. 36. 31.
And likewise give you grace, that you
These wicked ways may shun:
But if the Lord should suffer you
Romans 6. 12.
In sin to live, then know
^ John 3. 8.
Into the Devils trap at length
You would be sure to go.
Such Mice he often times does catch,
Ephesians 6. 10.
With his deceitful baits,
2 Cor. 2. 11
And like a Cat, both day and night,
For such Mice hourly waits.
The silly Mouce you know when he
His hole keeps not in the night,
But in a room s^kes up and down,
Although there be no light.
The watchful Cat spying this Mouse
In The dark, without a Candle,
Does catch it on a sudden, which
It does cruelly handle,
And will not leave this Mouse, until
She has it quite destroyed;
Pro. 7. 27.
Thus will the Devil deal with you,
Jam. 5. 5.
That have the wantons played:
And that like Owls Pro. 7. 12.
will be*abroad,
When others are at rest;
And when it is day, like them you do
Repair unto your nest.
The Owl and other Birds, you know,
Do live always asunder,
And if in the day she should be seen,
Those Birds would at her wonder.
Ecclus 13. 15.
The Owl and other Birds do not
At all agree together,
And therefore they divided are,
Not being of one feather.
Ecclus 26. 24.
So you that so much differ from
Good wives, that virtuous be,
2 Esd. 16. 49.
Your company they must needs shun,
With you they will not agree:
Pro. 31. 27.
For women that good huswives are,
That live in reputation,
Genesis 18. 9. Ecclus 25. 25.
Will not be gadding, when they should
Be in their habitation.
Your houses are your prisons, that
This course of life have taken,
Mat. 8. 12.
A prison dark's prepared for you,
That have the Esaias 1. 4.
Lord forsaken.
The Devil shall your Jailer be,
He Will keep you fast no doubt,
Mat. 5. 26.
So fast, that all the friends you haev,
Shall never get you out.
In which dark dungeon you then shall
Live in great misery;
Where Mat. 25. 41
Satan with his cursed crew,
Shall keep you company.
Pro. 5. 3, 4*
Your pleasures then shall surely end,
V. 5.
Your pains shall then begin,
And never end, if you resolve
2 Esd. 16. 77.
To live and dye in sin.
Consider this you shameless Imps,
Pro. 7. 7.
Who young fools do entice
To wickedness, for which cause you
Are hither brought for Mice.
Tit. 2. 4, 5.
Be civil, and learn modesty,
Keep home, Esa. 55. 7.
and quite forsake
Your former evil wicked ways,
Then Esaias 38. 14
God will undertake
Ezra 9. 13.
To keep you from those fearful plagues
Which you justly deserve;
Job 36. 11
And give you joys in stead of thereof,
If you him duly serve.
Hos. 10. 12
Wherefore delay no time at all,
Your minds to goodness give,
That when your bodies here shall dye,
Joh. 17. 24
Your souls in heaven may live.
CHAP. XXXVIII.
To his Mother.
I Psalm. 73. 21
have with grief of heart been here
Five months and more, it is known,
And if I here should be a year,
I scarce know any one
Psalm. 69. 20
That would of me take pity, and
Releeve me in distress:
Alas, Job 35. 9, 10.
no friends will understand
How some do me oppress.
Job 19. 14
I am forsaken of all those
Psalm. 55. 14
That in me took delight,
When I lived well, and wore good clothes,
Job 30. 1.
But now they do me slight;
Psalm. 69. ^.
As if a mere stranger I were,
They Will not on me now call,
But do with one consent forbear
J^m. 1. 27.
To visit me at all.
Job 19. 13*
Friends, kindred, and acquaintance, now
No kindness will me show,
I think they have made all a vow
2 King 14* 26.
To leave me here in woe.
But that is not all that troubles me,
One thing there is moreover,
That Job 30. 25
grieves my very heart to see,
Th'unkindnesse of a mother.
Oh that I had no cause to write,
Or think to my great grief,
Psalm. 27. 10
How you have me neglected quite,
As if I were a thief.
Yet when I call to mind 1 John 4. 16
the love
That God bears to all such,
Esaias 51. 12
As look for comfort from above,
My mind is eased much.
Esa. 49. 15
Though mothers tender may forget
Their children, captives taken,
Yet God, our Father, will not let
His children be forsaken.
Wherefore Psalm. 141. 8
my trust and confidence
Shall be in him alone,
Hoping he will bring me out hence,
Psalm. 17. 6.
He Will hear my plaint and moan.
2 Esd. 8. 8.
When I nine months was shut up fast,
In your close womb, you know
The Lord he brought me forth at last,
Joh, 16. 21.
And gave you joy also.
I then almost for 2 Mac. 7. 27
three years space,
Your tender breasts did suck,
Pro. 4. 3.
In those days you did me embrace,
And called me pretty Duck.
John 9. 20
I am your son, dear mother, still,
And shall be till I dye,
Although I am now called poor Will,
Being in misery.
It is no money that I crave,
Perhaps you have it not,
Ecclus 3. 8.
It is your blessing I would have,
If it could now be got.
If you once would but send to me,
I know it would me revive,
I then should think 1 Samuel 10. 2.
your care would be
To know how I did thrive.
But howsoever it is with me,
3 John 2.
My hope is you are well;
And that one day we shall both be
Rev. 21. 3.
In heaven, with Christ to dwell.
In the mean space whilst I am here,
Esa. 66. 1;
Let me some comfort find,
From you that are my mother dear,
'Twill ease my troubled mind.
Why should such Pro. 26. 28
flattering friends, that are
In The Country now about you,
Ecclus 28. 9
Seek to make you with me to jarre,
That here must live without you.
I am your son, they are your friends,
Think of them as you please:
Pro. 19. 4.
They were my friends, for their own ends
When I lived more at ease.
I am persuaded in my heart,
If'twere not for that Psalm. 35. 20.
crew,
That you would act a mothers part,
And your old love renew.
Your motherly affection then
Would once again appear
Psalm. 44. 13
To me, that am a scorn to men,
Now I am shut up here.
If I have not with all respect
Pro. 23. 22.
To you my duty done,
Then I Will confess a great neglect
In me, your youngest son.
And on my bended knees I Will crave
Pardon of God on high,
Pro. 30. 17.
Who will soon bring down to the grave
Such as the same deny.
Psalm. 38. 10.
You now are old, and much decayed
In strength, and otherwise,
And I in prison being laid,
Know not how to devise
Which way to help and succor you,
It Is not now in my power,
The Lord knows Psalm. 70. 5.
I have much ado
Here to subsist an hour.
Three children I have of mine own,
Which I cannot maintain:
Mich. 7. 18.
But God who is to mercy prone,
Pro. 14. 26.
Has eased me of that pain.
Psalm. 31. 7.
For he considering my distress
Psalm 72. 4.
Has raised them friends, with whom
They live, and have (I must confess)
More then they had at home.
1 Samuel 5. 15
My wife that is vexed and sorely grieved,
With me she takes a share,
Psalm. 69. 20.
For scarce one friend has her releev'd,
Since we have had this care.
Judge now, dear mother, what a case
At this time I am in,
If I should long be in this place,
Job 16. 8.
'Twould make my cheeks look thin.
Heb* 10 24.
Think on me then, and let me hear
Some news from you to morrow,
By some one of Buckinghamshire,
'Twill mitigate my sorrow.
And let me now, good mother, be
Excused, though you may find
In these few lines written by me,
Some things against your mind.
1 Samuel 1. 16
For out of the abundance of
My great complaint and grief
I write, (though some thereat may scoff)
To have some poor relief.
Thus to conclude, Psalm. 37. 5.
I Will leave all to
My Father that is on high,
For Pro. 3 6.
he will direct me what to do
In this extremity.
Beseeching him to Jam. 4. 6.

And favor, so that we

IF Pro. 11. 27.

Of Pro. 18. 24
friends or kindred, which thy case do pity,
Gal. 5. 13.
Whereby thou may out of this place be freed,
And take thy pleasure in Country or City:
1 Pet. 1. 17
Make good use of thy time, Pro. 22. 26.
run not in debt,
To live out of Pro. 22. 7.
danger do not forget.
Mat. 5. 25.
For if the Sergeants take thee once again,
Unto the Compter gate they will thee bring,
And there thou know thou can not long remain
The Turn-key he will be sure to let them in:
And then the Book-keeper will on there look,
And ask thy name to enter't in this Book.
The Chamberlain likewise thou then shall see
With his clean sheets, thee to appoint thy lodging,
And when he to thy chamber has brought thee,
Thou must needs pay thy Garnish without dodging,
And when thou art here, thou will look about,
And say, God help me, when shall I get out?
Mat. 12. 45.
Thy case may then be worse then ever'twas,
And besides that, all thy best friends perhaps,
May judge thee to be but an idle Ass,
Pro. 26. 11
Thou being fallen into a relapse:
Wherefore take heed, Pro. 1. 10.
lewd company refrain,
Lest thou thereby art hither brought again.

To those that come to visit their friends in Prison.
YOu that are Mat. 25. 36
come to visit your poor friends,
Which in this solitary place do lie,
Psalm. 89. 32
The Lord Psalm. 71. 20
which to us all afflictions sends)
Acts 10. 4.
Takes notice of your works of charity,
Acts 28. 12
If you your helping hand will now them lend,
Your coming then may be to some good end.
Jr. 38. 9.
It Is hard with them (God knows) now they are here
Ecclus 37. 6.
Here they want many things, though you have plenty,
Ecclus 37. 5.
Bread and small drink often times is their best cheer,
Psalm. 127. 2
And many times they sleep with belly empty.
Pro. 11. 25 2 Cor. 9. 7.
Wherefore take heed, be free, and not hide-bound,
Ecclus 4. 8
But let your friendly love to them be found.
Their debts increase, by being in this place
Their rent is double, and their charge is great,
Their liberty they want to their disgrace,
Job 19. 14
Their friends neglect them, 16. Pro. 19 7.
though they them entreat:
Job 6. 14.
If you will undertake among the rest
To help them now, Jer. 37. 20. Ecclus 4. 4.
do it at their request.
Esaias 51. 18.
For here none will about their business go,
Unless before hand they be well rewarded,
Which prisoners cannot do, that are brought low,
And therefore are so much the less regarded:
Ecclus 4. 5.
If you supply their wants now they have need,
You shall perform a charitable deed.
Help them therefore Esaias 63. 5.
for help here they have none,
Psalm. 88. 8.
Abroad they cannot go their means to get,
Ecclus 4. 9.
And being here, they are much wrought upon,
So that in time they lose all by neglect.
Ecclus 29. 20.
Consider this, you that have liberty,
For this your own case may be e're you dye.
Now when you from these captives do depart,
Heb. 13. 3.
Think of them though they are out of your sight,
Then by your means they may no longer smart
Here in this prison, where is no delight:
Then they without all doubt thankful will be,
Ecclus 3. 31
And your love gratify, when they are free.
Job 6. 14. and 30. 25.
He is indeed a true friend, that can take
To heart the great afflictions of another,
And in his troubles will not him forsake,
Such a dear Pro. 18. 24
friend is nearer then a brother.
If you such friends will be, Christ will one day
Be your chief friend, Mat. 25. 34, 36.
and you receive with joy.
CHAP. LXI.
To the careless man, a Prisoner.
A Judge 18. 7.
careless man thou have been in thy days,
For which cause thou unto this place art brought,
And will thou yet be careless here always,
It is the way never to be worth a groat.
For here thou losest time, and may at last
In great want live, having spent all thou have,
Ecclus 5. 1
Here thou can live (say thou) with means as well
As in another place, it is all one to thee,
Ecclus 5. 2.
Yet if a mind thou have here long to dwell,
Thou do not know how soon it may undo thee.
He is a fool, or knave, that here will be
Shut up in prison, when he may be free.
Ecclus 22 3
It seems thy breeding has not been so good,
That thou should not regard thy liberty,
But like a Novice that never understood
How to distinguish joy from misery.
For if thou pleasure take here day or night,
Thou know not what belongs Pro. 19. 10.
to true delight.
Doubtless that man that bears an honest mind,
Will scorn Psalm. 142. 7.
to live here longer then needs must,
For he elsewhere better content may find,
In things that lawful are, honest, and just,
The careless man regards not at all
What place he lives in, and therefore must fall.
What if thou have a bed to lie upon,
With meat and drink enough here for a time:
Luke 15. 14.
What will thou do when all thy money's gone
Go in a corner, and there cry and whine.
Thus 'twill be, if thou do it not prevent,
Yet careless men are never diligent.
If thou thus careless art now of thy self,
Do think thy friends a care of thee will have,
Thou art deceived, for though they have much wealth,
Pro. 19. 7.
They Will suffer thee to live here like a slave.
If thou these things do not at all regard,
Think if thou suffer, it is thy just reward.
Be thou not like 2 Pet. 2. 22.
the Sow, or filthy Hog,
Which leaves fresh straw, to wallow in the mire:
Or like the Raven that barks like a Dog,
Which here abides, although it can fly higher,
For if thou here wilt needs set up thy rest,
Thou may then be compared unto a beast.
The careless man that in prison does lie,
Regards now how things may with him be,
1 Timothy 5. 8
He cares not for his wife and family,
The Heathen man is not so bad as he:
If thou still in this kind so careless art,
Thou shall one day for it be sure to smart.
Wherefore have thou a religious honest care,
To think before hand how thou should provide
For thee and thine, such things as needful are:
Mat. 6. 31, 32.
But pensive carfulness lay thou aside,
Mat. 6. 33.
Let thy chief care be for the life to come,
Then shall thou no want have, having so done.
Now seeing thou here art in prison fast,
Which prison is a place of care, no doubt,
Be not yet careless, Psalm. 43. 5.
nor thy self down cast,
But use thy best endeavors to get out:
Pro. 16. 7.
Be careful to please God above all things,
Then he will release thee, Esa. 55. 7.
and pardon thy sins.
CHAP. XLII.
To the rich man, a Prisoner.
THou Eccles 5. 13
that art rich, and good means have abroad,
What need'st thou be penned up in this close place?
2 King. 4. 7.
Why do not with thy Creditors accord?
But show thy self in this to be so base.
If thou here live, having wherewith to pay,
Thou shall for it be sure to smart one day.
Thy Creditors want that which thou can spare:
Psalm. 37. 21
Why do thou not in time give them their due?
It Is like that some of them cannot forbear
Their debts, Ecclus 29. 4.
for which they now are forced to sue.
If thou will not them pay, then art thou shameless,
And they in laying thee up here are blameless.
Ecclus 11. 18.
It may be thou lie here charges to save,
Regarding not thy credit in this kind:
In which thou show thy self to be a knave,
In bearing such a wicked wretched mind.
Though thou hereby thy creditors do displease,
Yet know thou can not here live long at ease.
Luke 6. 24 Pro. 11. 4.
What art thou now the better for thy wealth,
If thou no better use thereof do make?
Ecclus 30. 15.
Thou should esteem of liberty and health,
And not lie basking here like a poor Snake.
If thou from men thus keep'st thy means away,
The Lord will not thy punishment delay.
For shame do not thy creditors abuse,
But look about thee, Romans 13. 7.
and them give content:
For thou can not thy self in this excuse,
And therefore deserve to be soundly shent:
Wherefore thy creditors now satisfy,
That thou no longer in this place may lie.
And when thou art hence gone, Pro. 29 7.
consider what
Great misery many poor men do endure,
That meat, drink, clothes, and lodging here do lack,
Which they by no means know how to procure.
Pro. 3. 27.
Do them some good, Mat. 6. 12.
that art thy self a debtor,
Then thou by being here wilt be the better.
1 John 3. 17.
But if thou riches have, and have no care
Of thy poor brethren, who are in distress,
But on the contrary wilt yet forbear
To pay thy due, and live in idleness,
Jam. 5. 12. 3
Thy cank'red money shall a witness be
Against thee, when thou art in misery.
Ecclus 14. 18.
Be not a slave to that which should serve thee,
Eccles 6. 2.
As those are which have means without Gods blessing:
But having means be to poor prisoners free,
'Twill be to them thou know a great refreshing:
Being thus well disposed, God will one day
1 Timothy 6. 17
Give thee such riches as will never decay.
CHAP. XLIII.
To the idle man, a Prisoner.
HE Pro. 12. 24.
that an idle course of life does lead,
Into great danger must needs fall at last,
What man will undertake to intercede
For such a man when he is in prison cast?
It Is idleness has brought thee to this place,
Where thou art like to live in a poor case.
Pro. 20. 4.
Thou now art fallen into poverty,
Which Pro. 19. 15.
idle men cannot at all avoid,
For which cause thou art now here forced to lie,
And here may lie until thy debts be paid;
And though some may at thee a while connive,
Yet such an idle fellow cannot thrive.
2 These. 3. 10, 11.
Unworthy thou art of meat, drink, and clothes,
2 These. 3. 12.
That slothful art, and labor do refuse,
Thy friends in time will turn to be thy foes,
That have a calling, which thou do abuse:
The prison is too good for such a one,
That his time spends thus like an idle Drone.
Pro. 6. 6, 7.
The little silly creatures, that are dumb,
Are wiser then thou art, and can thee teach
Pro. 6. 8.
How thou should labor, and idleness shun:
This doctrine others besides them do preach:
If thou of them learn not, thou shall be sure
Pro. 6. 11.
To live in want, and misery endure.
When God at first our parents did create,
He made them not in idleness to live,
Genesis 3. 19. 2 These. 3. 8.
They labored and took pains early and late,
Although the Lord the whole world did them give.
Thus Job. 5. 7. Ecclus 10. 27.
men are borne to labor, and therefore
Such idle persons the Lord does abhor.
He that his mind now gives to idleness,
May fitly be compared unto a weed
Which in it has no virtue, not goodness,
Therefore should not be let alone to breed,
But rather be plucked up, and cast away,
Because Luke 13. 7.
the ground it does so much annoy.
But now thou art in prison, thou do think
A privilege thou have idle to be;
And that thereat Pro. 15. 3.
the Lord above does wink:
Thou art deceived, Luke 13 6.
for thou like the Fig Tree,
(Which fruitless was) Luke. 13. 7.
shall be cut down and cursed;
For idle men of all men are the worst.
Acts 18. 3.
If thou a calling have, thou may it use
In some sort, or be otherwise employed
1 Timothy 4. 7, 8.
In godly virtues, which good men do choose
To labor in, and therewith are not cloyed:
For God rejects and casts all such away,
As only love 1 Cor. 10. 7
to eat, drink, sleep, and play.
What pleasure can thou take to fit and drink
With others, that no goodness have at all?
That take Tobacco till their breath do stink,
Psalm. 14. 4.
And set no time apart on, God to call.
Is this a time to spend time in this kind?
Joh. 12. 40.
Surely the Devil has made such fools blind.
Romans 14. 18.
The time will come when thou account shall give
How thou thy time have spent here and elsewhere,
Job 8. 9.
Thou can not think thou have here long to live,
Pro. 15. 32
Though thou of thy souls health have now no care.
1 Pet. 4. 2.
The time thou have, that precious time spend well,
And have a care no Mat. 12. 36
^lle tales thou tell.
Unto a place thou must go, where thou shall
Dan. 12 2.
Live everlastingly in joy or pain;
1 John 2. 17.
This world's the through fare, think now what a fault
2 Pet. 3. 11
It is in him that think not of these twain ^,
2. Pet. 3. 14.
Be diligent therefore, Pro. 15. 24.
and walk a pace,
So shall thou go to heaven Rev. 21. 10, 11.
that joyful place.
1 Pet. 1. 13
Rowze up thy self, and think though thou here art
In prison of thy liberty restrained,
Yet if from this place thou would soon depart,
Heb. 6. 12.
Shun sloth and idleness, and be reclaimed.
In action always be, Psalm. 26 4.
spend no time vain,
Col. 4. 5.
And thy lost time seek to redeem again.
CHAP. XLIIII.
To the dissembling hypocrite, a Prisoner.
THou Mat. 15. 7. 8
that have often played the counterfeit
With those whom thou by that means have deceived,
Art for that cause into the Compter let,
Where many such as thou art are received:
If thou dissembling tricks wilt still here use,
Men will thee loath, Jer. 42. 20, 22.
and God will thee refuse.
He cannot live (say thou) that cannot dissemble:
Esaias 32. 6.
I grant in thee this Proverb's verified,
Yet have such knaves just cause to quake and tremble;
For certainly God cannot them abide.
Thou by dissembling may think to live well,
Job 8. 13. Mat. 24. 51.
Yet will that course of life bring thee to hell.
Pro. 26. 24, 25.
Sometimes some friends thou may deceive, I grant,
Job 17. 5.
By thy deceitful, flattering, lying tongue,
And afterward thereof may boast and vaunt,
Yet for the same thy conscience shall be stung.
Job 20. 5.
What inward peace, think thou, can in thee be,
Ecclus 5. 9 1 Timothy 4. 2.
When thy smooth tongue and false heart cannot agree?
Such hypocrites may make most men believe
Mat. 6. 5.
They are religious, honest, and discreet:
Yet if they do not now for their sins grieve,
The Lord (who Acts 15. 8. Mar. 12. 15.
knows their hearts) will with them meet
Mat. 23. 13 etc.
And many woes against them he will pronounce,
Psalm. 52. 4, 5
And their deceitful souls will soundly trounce.
Mat. 23. 28
Thy outward carriage may to them appear
To be upright, as thou would have them think,
Mat. 23. 27
But thou within art full of filthy geere,
So that in the Esaias 65. 5.
Lords nostrils thou do stink.
The Luke 18. 14
sinful Publican shall mercy find
Sooner then the proud John 9. 41. Mat. 23. 26
Pharisee that is blind.
Act. 5. 2.
Though thou with men dissemble, yet take heed
Act. 5. 3, 4.
With God thou do not play the hypocrite,
For if thou do, think not thou shall be freed
Act. 5. 5. Pro. 26. 26.
From being punished in the peoples sight,
If thou of these great sins art not afraid,
Thou will ere long in Gods prison be laid.
Satan his children teaches to deny
The truth to God and man, Joh. 8. 44.
he is a liar,
Job 1. 7. Mar. 5. 9.
Yet he himself would not tell God a lie,
But told the truth, when he did him require:
Job 36. 13
The hypocrite whose heart's inclined to evil,
In this point far worse is then is the Devil.
Now what a fearful case art thou then in,
2 Timothy 3. 5
That in the Church visible art now living,
And can not thy heart give to God, being
Act. 8. 21.
A false dissembling heart, Pro. 10. 20.
not worth the giving,
Joh. 6. 70.
Which heart the Devil having once possessed,
Will keep it, for with him it is in request.
Consider this, before it be too late,
Thou in a place art now in Psalm 71. 20.
troubles great,
Where thou should 2 These. 5. 17.
often pray and Psalm. 63. 6.
meditate:
Psalm. 17. 6.
God hears them which him faithfully Esaias 19. 22
entreat.
And then a Ezekiel. 36. 26.
new heart he will thee likewise give,
Pro. 23. 26
Which heart thou may return to him and live.
CHAP. XLV.
To the Commissioners appointed by his Majesty for the relief of poor
Prisoners.
YOu noble Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, and others,
That are appointed by our gracious King
In these bad times to be Commissioners,
For the relief of prisoners, lamenting,
Job 35. 9.
Here are poor men oppressed, Lam. 5. 17.
ready to faint*
Be pleased to hear Psalm. 55 2.
their pitiful complaint.
Pro. 12. 10
The cruelty of many creditors
Is such, as heretofore was never known,
Job 6. 14.
No pity they have on their poor debtors,
Ezekiel. 3. 7.
Because their hearts are as hard as a stone:
Wherefore poor prisoners Psalm. 31. 9.
laden here with grief
Pro. 29. 7.
Appeal to you for succor and relief.
Mat. 18. 29.
The debtor's willing to do what he can
His cruel creditor to satisfy,
And though he offer like an honest man,
To give him all he has for's liberty:
Mat. 18. 30.
Yet will he not at all listen unto him,
Because he had much rather quite undo him.
A man imprisoned cannot exercise
His calling, by which means his family
At home want food and raiment, and likewise
He Is like to perish here without mercy:
For his rich creditor Pro. 30. 14.
says he cares not
If he in prison lie until he not.
Such ill conditioned creditors do know,
The Prison's not a place where men e're thrived,
And yet they take a course to overthrow
Some that are here of liberty deprived:
For some well known are not ashamed to say,
Mich. 3. 2. 3
They Will have their bones, if they their debts cannot pay.
These rig'rous courses against prisoners must
Be here endured by them, unless you please
To mitigate the same, Psalm. 82. 3.
which is both just
And lawful, which will be much for their ease:
Hos. 12. 6.
If Mercy be with Justice mixed, then may
Many poor prisoners be released each day.
Wherefore those that have just cause to complain,
Refer themselves, Job 29. 16.
and their distressed cause
To you, that have full power to maintain
That good Commission, grounded on Gods Laws:
Now you by virtue thereof much good do
To prisoners that refer themselves to you.
Although some creditors be obstinate,
And very wilful, which will not obey
Such orders as you power have to make,
For such as their debts cannot presently pay:
Ecclus 4. 9
Yet without doubt you have authority
To punish those that are refractory.
2 Cor. 10. 1
But by your gentle, sweet, and mild persuasions,
Such creditors whose hearts are mollifi'd,
Do yield themselves upon all good occasions,
Your charitable censures to abide:
Poor debtors by this means may be enlarged,
And afterward their debts justly discharged.
Now if you do procure them certain days
Of payment, that they may with courage go
Abroad to seek their fortunes, Psalm. 146. 1, 7.
they will praise
The Lord for you, that do such favor show:
Pro. 31. 9.
For those that do the cause of poor men plead,
Mat. 25. 34
Their lives in heaven with Christ shall ever lead.
CHAP. XLVI.
To his Chamber-fellowes, and other distressed Prisoners of the Knights Ward,
that were there shut up of the Plague.
WE now have cause to look about, and think
How soon Romans 14. 10.
we may be called unto the bar
Of Gods great Justice, from which we cannot shrink:
Let Us therefore think on it whilst we yet here are;
Eccles 8. 8. Ecclus 14. 12.
For when Gods Sergeant comes, he will make us know
Romans 14. 12
We must be gone whether we will or no.
Examples to our terror here we have,
Psalm. 102. 20.
Of Gods delinquents, how they do lament
When they are smitten, and marked for the grave,
Heb. 9 27.
Because by no means they can it prevent.
Psalm. 106. 29.
To this great danger we are all exposed,
That are in this infectious place enclosed.
Our Chamber-fellow being sick a bed,
Made us believe that he was free and clear
From all infection, but when he was dead,
Gods tokens on his body did appear;
Which sight increased our fear, and suddenly
We changed our lodging, Mar. 10 47.
and cried for mercy.
The seventh day after, he that lay with me
2 Chronicles. 13. 20.
Died likewise of the same disease, then I
Began to think Esaias 38. 10
that my turn next would be,
And did resolve to take it patiently.
Ezra 9. 15
But you and I God to this day has spared,
Let Us yet look up, and be always prepared.
1 Chronicles. 21. 16.
For the sword of the Lord (the Pestilence)
Is still stretched over us, and not yet sheathed,
V. 16* 17.
To whom shall we repair for our defense,
But to the Lord, lest we be much deceived:
1 Samuel 2. 6.
He kills, and makes alive, it is he alone
Hos. 6. 1.
That wounds, and heals; Psalm. 55. 2.
to him let us make our moan.
Some of our company Psalm. 78. 50*
he kills outright,
And some Number. 14. 12
are sorely wounded every day,
And we that are in the combat day and night,
Not killed nor wounded, yet cannot run away.
But as the forlorn Hope in the time of war,
2 Cor. 1. 8.
Are in a desperate case, so we now are.
1 Chronicles. 21. 13.
We now are fallen into the Lords hands,
As well as into'th hands of cruel men,
Esa. 49. 13.
Lo, mercy now against cruelty stands,
And will overcome it, though we know not when;
Let men be what they will, Neh. 9. 33.
the Lord is just,
Job 13. 15.
Then though he kill us, yet let us in him trust.
Psalm. 38. 11.
Our friends and kindred, now, will not come near us,
They have a fair excuse, yet may they send:
Our creditors whom we feared, Psalm. 31. 11
now do fear us,
Psalm. 119. 74.
More then they fear God, on whom we depend:
Psalm. 118. 6.
Let friends and kindred, creditors and all
Do what they please, Cant. 8. 10. Zech. 2. 5.
the Lord is our sure wall.
Psalm. 69. 33
Gods prisoners now we are, Ezekiel. 21. 24
the action's laid,
Esa. 59. 12. Job 22. 5.
Our debts are just, and withal are so great,
Joel 3. 4. Job. 9. 3.
That by our selves they never can be paid:
Mat. 11. 28
Wherefore let us our Creditor soon entreat,
Gal. 1. 4. Heb. 2. 17.
To be our surety, then no doubt but we
1 Pet. 1. 3.
Shall mercy find, John 8. 36
and e're long be set free.

troubles to this present day. To the King of Heaven.
THou 2 Pet. 2. 9.
that the great deliverer art of those,
Heb. 11. 6. and 4. 16.
That seek to thee for help in time of need,
Lam. 3. 31.
Wilt not reject them, Jam. 4 8.
but with them wilt close:
O Lord, Mat. 12. 20
thou will not break the bruised Reed.
Psalm. 27. 13
When I was weak and faint, and 9. 18.
ready to perish,
Esaias 25. 4.
Thou then gav'st strength, Psalm. 146. 9.
and did me likewise cherish.
Phil. 2. 27.
When I was sick, and in danger of death,
Job 29. 12.
Wanting at that time means to get relief,
^ King 17 17.
Not being able scarce to fetch my breath,
Job 33. 19
Feeling much pain, Psalm. 31. 10
and almost killed with grief:
Mat. 4 24. Psalm. 30. 2.
Thou then wast my Physician, which did cure
Esaias 3. 9.
And gav'st me health, Genesis 43. 28
the which does yet endure.
Psalm. 38. 19
When I had enemies for me too strong,
Psalm. 65. 2.
That sought my ruin, and my overthrow,
Psalm 8 6.
That did rejoice when and 35. 26.
they could do me wrong,
Lam. 3 52.
So that I could not tell which way to go:
Psalm. 136. 24.
Thou then did me defend, and made them fail,
Psalm. 129. 2
So that against me they could not prevail.
2 Cor. 11. 26.
When I of cruel thieves was in great danger
Upon the ways, in Number. 21. 4.

Luke 10. 30.
Where I alone then traveled as a stranger,
Fearing I should be forced to see their faces:
Josh. 24. 17 Psalm. 78. 52.
Thou then did me conduct, and wast my guide,
So that I had no hurt of neither side.
Jona 1. 4* 11.
When I at Sea was, in tempestuous weather,
2 Cor. 11. 26.
In perils great, and often times dismayed,
When sands, and rocks, and raging waves together,
Jona 1. 5.
Caused all the Mariners to be afraid:
Mar. 4. 39.
Thou then, O Lord, did cause the storms to cease,
Psalm. 107. 30.
And brought us to the land, to rest in peace.
2 Cor. 11. 26, 27.
When I was often times in dangers great,
In diverse parts, which thou Lord best do know,
Which several dangers I cannot repeat,
Being so many, and fearful also,
Psalm. 138. 7*
Thou then did evermore stretch forth thine hand,
And me preserved as well by Sea as land.

That were to me in their life time a stay,

Psalm. 33. 15.
Thou then which rul'st the hearts of all good men,
Ruth 2. 13 20.
Did raise me other friends in stead of them.
Job 1. 14, 15.
When I lost all the estate I had, which thou
Ecclus 11. 14. Eccles. 5. 19.
Did give me for my comfort in this life,
After which losses great I knew not how
To live, Tob. 1. 20.
but in great want with my poor wife:
Jam. 5. 11.
Thou then of me took'st pity, and again

Restor'dst to me that which did us maintain.

Did me out of that loathsome place deliver.
Heb. 10. 32
