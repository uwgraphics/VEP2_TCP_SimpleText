A SPEECH Made by the Right Honorable the Earl of ARRAN, to the Scots Nobility
and Gentry, Met together at the Council Chamber in White Hall, on the Eight of
January 1689, about an Address to His Highness the PRINCE of ORANGE, to take
upon him the Government of the Kingdom of SCOTLAND.
MY LORDS,
I Have all the Honor and Deference for the Prince of ORANGE imaginable. I
think him a Brave Prince, and that we owe him great Obligations, in
Contributing so much for our Delivery from Popery. But while I Pay him those
Praises, I cannot Violate my Duty to my Master, I must distinguish between his
Popery and his Person, I dislike the one; but have sworn and do owe Allegiance
to the other; which makes it impossible for me to sign away that which I cannot
forbear believing is the KING my Master's Right. For his present absence from
us, by being in France, can no more affect our Duty, than his longer absence
from us in Scotland had done all this while.

MY Lords,

The Prince in his Paper desires our Advice, mine is, That we should move his
Highness to desire His Majesty to Return and Call a Free Parliament, for the
Securing our Religion and property, according to the known Laws of that
Kingdom; which in my humble Opinion, will at last be found the Best Way to Heal
all our Breaches.

Printed in the Year 1689.
