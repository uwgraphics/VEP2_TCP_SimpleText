Wards, Idiots and Lunaticks; And given under His Highness great Seal of
England, The 23. of February 1617.
JAMES by the grace of GOD King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To Our right trusty, and right well-beloved Counselor, William Lord Knollys,
Viscount Wallingford, Master of Our Court of Wards and Liueries, And to Our
trusty and well-beloved the Counsel of the same Court, And to the Master and
Council of the said Court for the time being, Greeting.
WHEREAS it does appear by common experience, in the course which has bin
held, sithence the first erection of Our Court of Wards and Liueries, That
partly by the slackenes of the friends of the Wards upon the decease of the
parents or Ancestors, who have forborne to offer timely Composition, sometimes
with opinion that no Title could be found for Us, and sometimes with purpose to
suppress the same, and partly by the suite of other men, the Custody of the
bodies and lands of Our Wards have been committed to such persons, some for one
respect, some for another, as (notwithstanding the care and providence of you
the Master and Council of Our Court, to bind them in great Bonds and
Covenants for the well educating of the Children, and pre^^^^ of their
inheritance) have been careless of their education, married some in mean
places, committed wastes and spoils upon (...) lands, and in the end have
exacted greater sums of money, for the marriages of such Wards, then they
ought to have done, in (...) and equity; notwithstanding any their
disbursements whatsoever for passing or procuring the same.

(...) whereas also We have been informed by you the Master of the said Court,
that by reason of the great difficulties that have been (...) by the Court,
upon sight of Offices, and Surucyes only, to set down Compositions for
Wardships and Leases of Wards lands, (...) such equality and moderation
between Us, and Our Subjects, as were just and reasonable; and that through
want of due information that behalf, much of the profit that might have been
raised for Us, has been diuerted to diverse Suitors and Committees, who by
^^^^i^g the truth of the Wards estate, and by misinforming of the Court
therein, have reaped greater profit, then was intended, if you (...) ^y
ordinary means have come by the knowledge of their values; so as, both We
have received less then otherwise We should (...), and the Wards found little
ease in many cases.

^^^refore, for the preventing of these and the like inconveniences, and to the
end that Our loving Subjects may stand assured, That (...) nothing more, then
that their children and their lands that shall fall unto Us by reason of
Wardships, might after their decease, (...) ^^^^ted to their nearest and
trustiest friends, or to such as they be VVil, or otherwise, shall commit the
charge unto, upon such valu^^^^ ^^^^iderations, as are just and reasonable: And
to the intent that the Parents and Ancestors may depart in greater peace, in
hope of (...) gracious favor; and their friends may see their children brought
up in piety and learning; and may take such care as is fit for ^^^^uation of
their inheritance, if they will seek the same in time, and by such means as
are fit and convenient; We have thought ^^^^by to require you, the Master and
Council of Our said Cour, and the Master and Council of the said Court for the
time being, ^^^^posing and committing of the Custody of the bodies and Lands of
such our Wards, whose Ancestors have deceased since Ia^^^^^ past, or shall die
