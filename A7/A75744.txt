THE ASSOCIATION.
WE, whose Names are hereunto subscribed, who have now joined with the Prince
of Orange, for the Defense of the Protestant Religion, and for maintaining the
Ancient Government, and the Laws and Liberties of England, Scotland, and
Ireland, do engage to Almighty God, to His Highness the Prince of Orange, and
to one another, to stick firm to this Cause, and to one another in the Defense
of it, and never to depart from it until our Religion, our Laws and Liberties
are so far secured to us in a Free-Parliament, that we shall be no more in
Danger of Falling under Popery and Slavery: And whereas we are engaged in this
Common Cause, under the Protection of the Prince of Orange, by which means his
Person may be exposed to Dangers, and to the desperate and cursed Attempts of
Papists, and other Bloody Men: We do therefore solemnly engage both to God and
to one another, That if any such Attempts are made upon him, we will pursue not
only those who make them, but all their Adherents, and all that we find in Arms
against us, with the utmost Severities of a just Revenge, to their Ruin and
Destruction; and that the Execution of any such Attempt, which God of his Mercy
forbid, shall not divert us from Prosecuting this Cause which we do now
undertake, but that it shall engage us to carry it on with all the Vigor that
so Barbarous a Practice shall deserve.
