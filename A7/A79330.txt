A PROCLAMATION For Restoring and Discovering his Majesty's Goods.
CHARLES R.

WHereas amongst the manifold Disorders of the late times, it has happened,
that much of the Plate, Jewels, Household Stuff, Cabinets, Statues,
Inscriptions, Pictures, Drawings, Sculptures, Rings, Stones, ancient Coyns,
Medalls, Books, Manuscripts, Pieces of Art, and other Goods and Chattels, which
did belong unto Our late Dear Father, Our Mother the Queen, or to Our Self;
have been purloyn'd and embezilled, or upon pretenses seized, taken and
received, and are dispersed into several hands, and yet detained and concealed:

We of Our Princely Clemency and Care to prevent Suits and Prosecutions
according to the rigor of Law against the Offenders herein, and to give them
opportunities of voluntary restitution, have thought fit, by the Advice of Our
Privy Council, in this public manner, to admonish all such Persons, who have
any the said Goods in their possession, or know of any now, or formerly, in the
custody of any other Person or Persons, to restore or discover the same.

And to the intent that no man who shall neglect this Our Grace, hereafter may
be excusable, We do by this Our Proclamation, straightly charge and command all
Persons whatsoever, who either have, or know where, or in whose custody,
possession or keeping any of the aforesaid Goods or Chattels lately were, now
are or remain, to bring in, deliver, or cause the same to be delivered, or
otherwise to make discovery thereof unto Our Right Trusty and Right
Well-Beloved Cousin and Counselor, Edward Earl of Sandwich, Master of Our
Great Wardrove, on or before the Twenty Ninth day of September next ensuing,
under the penalty of Our High displeasure, and as they will answer the contrary
at their peril. And in case of refusal, or Non performance of Our Commands,
thus favorably signified, within the time before limited and appointed; We
do hereby also declare, that We shall not only look upon the disobedience of
the persons concerned, but also take a strict and speedy course against them
according to Law.

And We do further declare, That We will reasonably reward any of Our well
affected Subjects or others who shall discover unto us any the said Goods
wilfully concealed

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Fourteenth day of August, in the Twelfth
year of Our Reign, 1660

most Excellent Majesty, 1660.
