A Copy of Verses, said to be Composed by His Majesty, upon His first
Imprisonment in the Isle of Wight.
IMprison me ye Traitors! Must I be
Your fettered Slave, whilst you are at liberty?
T'usurpe my Scepter, and to make my power
Gnaw its own Bowels, and it self devour?
You glorious Villains! Treasons that have been
Done in all Ages, are lived ore again.
Nimble Proficients! you have far outdone
Your Tutors presidents; and have outrun
The practice of all times: We see again,
A second Caesar by a Senate slain:
A State disturbed by the Gracchi; and the times
Spawning with Sylla's and the Catalines.
The Villainies, and Treasons, which of old,
Time has for Incredulity enrolled,
Are but mock-shews to yours, whose Acts will be
Thought Legendary by Posterity.
Was It not enough you made me bear the wrong
Of a Rebellious Sword, and worser Tongue,
To take my Crown, State, Children, Friends, and Wife,
But will you have my Liberty, and Life?
'Cause I Will not sign, or give consent unto
Those lawless Actions you have done, or do?
Nor yet betray my Subjects, and so be
As Treacherous to them as you to me?
Mistaken Fools! do you think my soul can be
Grasped, or infringed, by such low things as ye?
And does the Coronet forget his own
True Interest, to joynet to spurn the Crown?
Can they not see, when the Oake's cut down, that all
The Clambring Ivy down with it must fall?
Subjects can have no safety but their graves,
When Slaves do sway, and Sovereigns are slaves.
True hearts, I pity still, whose Sufferings,
And Remedies are twisted with the Kings.
Alas! though I Am injured, my mind's so free,
I Will make my very Jail your Liberty.
Plot, do your worst; I safely shall deride,
In my crowned Soul, your base, inferior pride,
And stand unmoved, though all your plagues you bring,
I Will die a Martyr, or I Will live a King.
FINIS.
