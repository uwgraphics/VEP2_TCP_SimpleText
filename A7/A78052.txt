ANTWERP, Printed in the Year of our Lord

The Apology of Thomas Bushel, of Enston in the County of Oxford, Esquire,
My Lords and Gentlemen,
DIvine Providence having freed me from the Gunshot of a malicious pursuit, it
were more than madness in me to come again before the mouth of a Cannon,
where my enemies are known to give fire, and their eyes levelling at my
reputation, life, and fortune, but lest their cruelty should so far exasperate
the treason laid to my charge (as to condemn me before hand) I shall by your
favors, signify herein, a true and brief demonstrations of my transactions,
both how far I am guilty, and for what cause, and wherein I have been abused;
as if I were at the high Trebunall where all must give an account, that so
comparing the weight of my reasons, with their accusations, I may by your
wisdoms be either acquitted or condemned.

In the first place, having long since had the happiness of a very near
relation to that famous Philosopher the late Lord Chancellor Bacon, and being
instructed by the influence of his knowledge in the theorick of the Mynorall
profession, I resolved to betake my self to that innocent calling, and to make
the practick part of direction, my companion to retirdnes, for the glorifying
the God of Natute, by such public designs, as well as by my private devotions,
having formerly had the perplenities of a grieved fpirit, for the grand shate
my youths follies had purchased in this worlds rebellion, in prosecution
whereof, having obtained the honor to be his Majesty's sworn servant, and
farmer of his highness Royal, and so by consequence bound to obey his
commands, took an opertunity to acquaint him with the affection I had
thereunto, together with the production of profit, and honor it might bring to
this Nation, if diligently persued by men of experience and freeborn minds,
who would only resign the success to the will of the all-disposing power; and
upon the result of our discourse, I was at my own charge to cut through the
Rocks of five severall-Mountains, at the lowest level for a trial, whence if
Providence should sweeten my labors with quantity of Silver, his Majesty
assured me under his sign Manuell, I should have the assistance of his Mint,
to pay the minor with his own Coin, which his Royal Clemency performed like
the King of the Meads, and Persians, notwithstanding I had the opposition of
his whole Council at a public audience.

This high favor of his to the Common good, as also to me who had no other
inheritance than the birthright of a younger Brother did double ob(...) that
his necessities in War required my service, wherefore I should forbear the
voyage, and share with him in the sufferings of these Commotions, which I
willingly obeyed, with an alacrity not yet repented of, and finding too
apparently that his cause was more betrayed by the treachery of some of his
Cabinet Counsel, and their Agents, than by the hostile actions of his open
enemies, made me then take the boldness to tell him the truth of my
observations therein at large, and desired him to give me leave to stand upon
my own strength, and to keep the Garrison of Lundy at my own charge, promising
him either to die in the place, or that it should be the last Garrison
surrendered, and not then neither without (his Majesty's Consent.)

Several summons and attempts were made by shipping to storm, or starve it,
but the one failing, and they fearing time might prevent the other, the then
Lord General Fairfax sent a Letter by his Drummer, promising therein upon his
Honor, that if I would come over Sea, and treat with him, and the Lord
Viscount Say and Seal, I should have a safe conduct, if the propositions they
made could not give me content, which were these, to take off my Delinquency,
restore me to my Estate, and protect my person from an ill natured Creditor,
until I was in Actual possession thereof, according to an Ordinance of
Parliament made in that behalf.

And having obtained the Kings consent thereunto, with a caution under his
hand, that I should not be over credulous of their vain promises, which had
made him great (only in his sufferings) and would not discharge my debts, yet
the belief I had of a Lord Generals Honor engaged, a Parliaments Ordinance,
and many of the Lord Viscounts Says Letters to the same purpose, made me
decline my Masters advice, and trust so much to the reallity of their Acts of
honor, as I surrendered the Island according to their own desires, with all
things thereunto belonging.

But instead of having my Estate restored unto me, or my person protected, I
was presently arested by an uncharitable Creditor (even in the time of my
treaty) and no relief for either Person, or Estate, notwithstanding my daily
solicitations, and many intercessions made by the Lord Say therein to acquit
his engagement; which ignoble proceedings in persons that pretend to Honor, did
more perplex my grieved heart with sorrow for want ofmy creditors satisfaction,
than to receive from you the sentence of a fatal death.

Now for the Treason laid to my charge, and proved by witnesses (as is
reported) and wherein Colonel Andrews, and Sir John Gell, has suffered, is
of validity to condemn any man were he as innocent as a Saint; for no Negative
being permitted, when the Affirmative is past, the party need not plead, but
submit himself to his hard destiny; and therefore I shall by way of
satisfaction justify to you, and the whole world, that I deserve no more to
suffer for what I am accused for, either in Consenting, (...)

For were I personally present, I could prove the Isle of Ely plot but merely
the snare to entrap the Cavaleers, and I fear me Captain Holmes his
necessities provoked him to Act in this Tragedy, by some hints he gave me and
others of the employment he had from some higher powers to that purpose, for I
call God to witness, I never heard of the Isle of Ely plot from any other, but
amongst the discoursing Cameroes of him and his associate Master Bernard, in
the presence of Colonel Andrews at the Mermaid near Grayes Inn Gate, and
Master Bernard very well knows when he revived it the second time unto me at
my own Chamber, and desired my hand of consent thereunto, I so much renounced
it, that I never saw him after.

Neither did I ever speak with Sir John Gell or any other about any such thing
as is pretended, or he to me, but indeed I did Court Sir John Gell's
acquaintance with hope of profit, to be my partner, if by his means I could
procure the digging in the Earl of Rutlands manor of Hadden? but his brother
giving me notice, that double the value of the herbage which I had offered his
Lordship yearly, nor the price of the inheritance, could not invite him to have
the Mines discovered in Hadden field, made me soon surcease my suit, until a
man of greater power in the States employment, might persuade his honor to
look upon the public trade of a Nation, as well as his own particular
interest.

Whereupon I revived my former solicitations by letter to the then Lord
General Fairfax, for my right of ^rticles, otherwise to take leave of my
native country and travel; but receiving no other answer from his honor than
that it was not in his power to perform it, and being suddenly after
advertised of a plot laid by my adversaries, to apprehend my person, that I
might not go to a Commission for examining their accounts of above twenty
thousand pounds which they have already received out of my Estate; I then
addressed my Letter to the Lord President Bradshaw offering to justify my
actions against any pretended plots or conspiracies suggested against me, so
that I might have a protection for my person, according to the Lord Generals
agreement, but being not admitted an answer thereof, and having been informed
my enemies intended to press the General Engagement upon me, at the hearing
of my cause, wherein as yet my Conscience can no way be satisfied, I then
obscured my self, and writ the true reasons of my sudden departure, which are
also annexed.

I shall therefore trouble your patience no more than in some few words to my
charge of intelligence to the Prince, who being told that I was turned Rogue,
for petitioning the House of Parliament with the title of Supreme Authority,
did so much perplex my thoughts, knowing my heart not guilty of doing his
highness the least injury, and the faithful service I had done his royal
father, to the value of thirty thousand pounds, acknowledged under his
majesty's own hand, for clothing his Army, besides the loss of ten thousand
pounds by sea and land since these commotions began (...) ed such news of the
lines, as I had received from Captain Holmet and his associate Master Benson,
both which I gratefully rewarded, but this before any act of prohibition to the
contrary was published.

Taking it as granted for a general rule since divine providence would not
interpret the transgressions of Angels, nor men, to be sin before a law
prescribed, the regality of humane reason I conceive ought not to impute
treason to any before an Act established to all, besides it is not unknown to
the whole State, that my chiefest intellect has been a diligent lover of those
manescrip Histories as concerned the present passages of States and Princes,
ever since I had the desernable knowledge of the Lord Bacons prediction to the
revolution of Monarchy, by his sencibillitie of a former Parliaments severity
on himself, so that if I have been more vigilent than others in gleaning the
Vinyard of these modern times, for my future companions in solitude, I hope
your Charities will not measure my innocent endeavors to deserve death, since
all save one Letter of news, has been as yet kept from the public sight of
any, and the perusal of the rest at your service.

But for any other advises, either before or since, I shall desire no favor
from you, if found guilty in the least, (nay more) if any the pretended
treasons, or misprisions of treasons, shall be proved by the depositions of any
one witness that bears the reputation of an honest man, I shall then submit
my self, to the alternate fate of my misfortune in the punishment of the fact;
but if no other person can prove the crime, laid to my charge, than such whose
former perjuries for gain (I fear has been too late made manifest to the
World) I hope you will not be guilty of my innocent blood, nor abridge me that
right my Articles assures me to my Mines and Customs, when your better
thoughts may very well judge, that my designs in tewne were only to follow
those public suits, and to stop the Complaints of my more than solicitous
Creditors, and not to imbark my self, after so much experience of trouble, in a
second Delinquency with such Knights of the Posts, when common sense makes me
uncapiable of pardon or pity.

Or if unsearchable destiny, has pre-ordain'd my dissolution by such wicked
Witnesses, whilst I endeavored the way to satisfy those friends which gave me
credit, and to advance the trade of a Nation, by the assistance of forain
Merchants. I shall only say I have performed the good King my masters Commands,
to share with him in his sufferings here; and I doubt not to be partaker with
him in glory hereafter, having forgiven the faults and failings of my
ensnarers, as I am confident his Majesty did freely pardon and pray for his.

I shall not therefore desire to lessen a letter in the pronouncing your
judgment, nor seek to mediate the manner of my death, although it consignes me
from the hurdle to the halter; For truly since I must die in your displeasures,
any death that shall please you shall not displease me; it being indifferent
whether the Fowls of the Air, or the Worms of the Earth, be partakers (...) me
of the crime as from ta(...) poor Orphans, and Widows, both for the good of my
foul, and quieting of my Conscience, which is, that you would be pleased to
hear the Cause now depending in your Court of Equity before I dye, that the
manner how and when, each Creditor may be paid; may be set down, and settled by
Decree, according to any Deed of Trust, and my bargain with Foreign Merchants
long since made for that purpose, otherwise the Authors of my death, may
afterward be the ruin of my friends, and cause the curse of ingratitude to
attend me in my grave, which one hour of your patience may decide: For if my
Articles had been performed, and those Law-sutes, not forced upon me (I call
God to witness) I had not troubled the conversation of any creature as a
Companion, but the Libraries of the dead in some desolate desert: unles in way
of recreation to direct Mynorall discoveries for the Common good; protesting
upon the faith of a Christian I have no other heir to my affection than the
reputation of a Gentleman, and the ambition of knowledge in the search of
natures secrets. And therefore let me entreat your charities to see my Estate
restored according to my Articles, made with the then Lord General Fairfax,
and Viscount Lord Say and Seal, without forcing my Conscience to take the
Engagemet; will be so clear an evidence of your noble inclinations to Justice,
as the whole world cannot but take notice, it was my crime and not my Fortune
revived your displeasures against me (which being granted) I do hereby promise
upon the Faith of a Christian to submit my self, under the execution of your
sentence, if within eighteen months, when these commotions are over) I discover
not so rich a Mine for Trade, and Treasure in your own Judgments, as shall
ransom the error of my supposed treason, or procure an exchange, and this offer.

Although I am without any other power of your punishment, then what has been
already inflicted upon me by your late dis-favours, being barred from the
prosecution of the public good I intended my Native Country by unlocking the
new Treasures of the Earth to supply her threating necessities, making my
friends to shun me like a plague sore, and my Enemies to rejoice in my ruin,
whilst they enrich themselves, with what the liberal hand of divine bounty had
freely bestowed, as a reward of my Industry, and my friends and debts
unsatisfied, all these afflictions being placed to the sad score of my
condition in Solitude. I hope there is no one amongst you who desires to retain
the profession of Christianity, or has the least pulse of Compassion, beating
in his veins, who will not deem this too great a burden for humanity to bear,
did not the pencill of holy Writ prescribe me the sweetness of hope, with the
balm of patience, to overcome my oppressions, and also asfures me the most
perfect'st man knows not his own soul, nor the proudest the certainty of his
continuance.

Master Bushell's Letter to the Lord General Fairfax.
May it please your Excellency,
(...) in the compass of my Conditions) withdrawn, my six months protection
given by your Excellency worn out in solicitation, and my person in continual
danger of Arests, by such only who have designs by my restraint to forestall my
future fortunes, which mischief cannot fall singly upon me, but will in no
small measure concern the Commonwealth in the Mineral affairs. And therefore
in want of my restoration to my right in Mines, and Customs of lead,
discouraging my endeavors in new discoveries, and in want of convenient liberty
to recover my rights, and pursue my services in Minorall works, I must make use
of my last Article with your Excellency to travel, though not without much
reluctance at my disapointment, to be answerable to my Country, Creditors, and
relations by my just endeavors. And under this protestation, nevertheless
that I shall not interest my self afresh in the continued quarrel, but seek
to exercise my knowledge, and faculty in Mines in other parts, having not failed
in mine own Country by any cause imputable to my want of skill, or industry, or
adventure. My Lord, however unfortunaate I am, I shall not abate of my
profession to be

Your Excellencies most humble Servant Tho: Bushel.
March the 6th. 1649.

For the Right Honour^ble the Lord President Bradshaw.
My Lord,
BEing informed that those which procured the possession of my Estate in the
time of my Delinquency, do not only seek to wrest me out of it, by the power
of their purse and friends, but likewise endeavor to ruin my reputation with
the Parliaments, Army, and Counsel of State, by their scandalous Agents; and
to that purpose have procured several warrants from your Lordship to secure my
person, pretending some plot against the State, which I believe upon true
examination, will prove to no other end but to make such Authority their
devices, for the better accomplishing their wicked dasigns, against my life and
fortune, as also to obstruct my present liberty, that I might not go to my
Mines in Wales, to the executing of a Commission for perfecting the accounts of
twenty thousand pounds between us, hoping thereby to enjoy the continual
possession of my Estate in the Mines, from me and my Creditors, without
contradiction, although formerly assigned to Feoffees in trust, for the payment
of my just debts, due to Orphants, and Widows Be pleased therefore, my Lord,
in way of charity and justice, to move that I may either be restored to my
estate, according to the Articles made at the Rendition of Lundy; or my person
freed from Arests, until I recover the same in a Court of Equity; and I shall
upon sight thereof appear before the Counsel of State, or high Court of
Justice, to Vindicate the aspersions laid upon my action, against all opposers,
and submit my self to their honorable censures, if upon just proof they find
me guilty of any crime worthy of their displeasures* so God (...)
