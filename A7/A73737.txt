THE WONDERS OF THE AIR, THE TREMBLING OF THE EARTH, And the warnings of the
world before the Judgment day.

Written by Thomas Churchyard Esquire, servant to the Queens Majesty.

Imprinted at London by Thomas Dawson 1602.

To the right woorshipfull M. D. Sezar master of the requests, master of S.
Katherns, and judge of the Admiraltie, Thomas Churchyard wishes great worship,
wisdom, and wealth, with the favor of Prince, and good people, joined to
such a virtuous life as always waits for heavenly faelicity.
WHen the light of my life, (and candell of earthly comfort) was almost burnd
out, good M. Doctor Seazar, it was Gods will I should address my self, and
suite to our sacred Sovereign the mighty Caesar of our world: who often times
poured oil into my wasting lamp, and finding in wants a worthy master of
requests, that would not suffer my dim candell blaze to be blown out, so for
my benifit you brake with her Majesty, and brought from her gracious goodness
the little I live upon, and am likely to die withal, which kind courtesy of
yours (void of all taking of money) drew my affection and heart in a manner out
of my bowels, and my inward spirits to be so far in your dept, that I
searched the best of my inventions to the bottom, the shallownes whereof was so
great, that I found but little of contentment, fit to present you withal: Than
I bethought me of a translation out of Pliny, 30. years ago set down in
prose by me, Of the wonders of the air: Trembling of the earth, and warnings
of the world, desirous every day to publish in print that simple translation of
mine, but long sickness held my good will so far back, that weak body saw no
season to serve my hope. In the mean while a great learned doctor called doctor
Holland most learnedly with great pain translated all Plinies works, I
hearing thereof rejoiced much, because his torch would blaze so clear, that
the blindest sight in the world should thereby see where the sweet kirnell
lay, when the hard shelled nut was cracked and opened so cunningly. So taking
his gallant book as a witness of my labors (though I never read one line of his
translation) I boldly set forth this work of mine, hoping that you and the
wise of the world, will accept and judge as my pains and study may merit, in
that trust and confidence I present the patronage of these pains to your
consideration and approved wisdom, confessing that never work went from me
with a greater good will nor less flattery, God so knows, who increase in you
grace and goodness with worldly worship, what your own heart desires.

Yours in all that he may at commandment Thomas Churchyard.

The general Epistle to the Readers.
COme gazing world whose restles mind would see and read each thing
And mark what wonders wit may find, that in this book I bring,
Note now how nature is beguild, and God the nature takes
Of every wonder under Sun, and thereof triumple makes:
Come searching heads that finely shifts, the grosest bran from flower,
Who knows (through suttel sleights of world) no more tha^ naturs pour
And mark what maruels mighty God, with majesty does shoe
Our simple age and careless time, where lewd like learned go:
Come you that lives like Epicures, and likes no world but this
And thinks when your bad life is gone, there is no other bliss,
And note another kind of cause, that can constrain us all
In prostrate manner humble wise, with face on flower to fall.
Come proudest peacoks in your plumes, with ruffling painted robes
Come you that looks when stars will fall, and staers on goodly globes
And veiw how stars and planets falls, and earthly causes too
If God when nature is at worst, strange things himself will do.
Come stubborn men that will not stoop, at fearful signs and shoes
Nor care for trembling of the earth, which wonders comes and goes,
By course of nature as some say, but therein make a pause
Though kind commands amasse of things, there is a greater cause
That moves the earth, and shakes the world, well worldlings come and see
What wonders God has wrought for men, that wise and thankful be,
And see what warnings God has sent, to those he means to stricke
Preserues the good where favor leads, and plagues where grows mislike.
You stout stifnecked people proud, that stands on reasons ground,
Come here how far past reasons earth, in learned ears does sound,
Make faith a proof of your hard hearts, and so let nature guide
And you shall see who shootes aright, and when your shafts are wide:
If natures law and reasons rules, might run with right away,
No place were left for God that rules, to rule and bear the swaie.
O wily wits and babbling tongues, yield up your reasons lore
And folllow our great captains steps, that marches still before:
Who leaves them lagging far behind, that looks not after grace,
And in their own opinions dwell, with bold and shameless face.
Come all the flock of new found sects, that swarms to much this day,
And you shall see what glory great, Gods goodness does bewray.
Come Deitists and Athists all, bring brabling books and words
That you in bitter sort let fall, sometime with jests and bords,
And see his mighty works above, that rules all at his will,
Who makes earth air and waters move, to make men muse on still.
Come cunning brains whose quick conceits, are ripe and in their prime
Come read strange things that wonders are, bestow therein some time.
Come soldiers that loves sword and fire, and mark what wars God makes
With kings and kingdoms in his ire, when he the quarrel takes,
Come see the fall of mighty men, that many battayls won,
Yet dropped down headlong now and then, as fatal chances run.
Come you that think you sit so fast, you can ne slip nor slide
And think by guess of wonders past, what you may judge this tide:
Come hither high aspiring mind, that hopes the clouds to clime,
And by these warnings here you find, reform your selves in time:
Come you that please I say no more, my verses so I end
And crave that you with patience read, that I with pains have pend.
THE Wonders of the air, The trembling of the earth, And the warnings of the
world before the judgment day.
IN the dangerous days, and sorrowful season of Repentance, when people ought
rather to fall to prayer then disputations, and the manifest works of the
almighty commands the consciences of men to leave of frivolous arguments and
not to meddle too much with the height or deep mysteries that passes common
capacity, and the reach of weak judgments, It is most necessary toward
the honoring of God, and edifying of good men, that preachers should pronounce
meekness and mercy, and writers should persuade probable matter, that may
draw busy wits from curious questions, and quiet the wavering minds of
those that are carried away with every light wind and words full of vanity:
And though I seem but slenderly learned (having a good devotion to do well)
bestow some small talent to Gods great glory, I trust those labors shall
purchase as good acceptance, as the large volumes that are stuffed with dark
sentences, and pollished with racked reasons, but woe is me that am destitute
of knowledge, void of cunning, and utterly unfurnished of eloquence, that now
have thrust my self into alaborinth, and here am taking in hand to run a
further course then my wonted custom heretofore has familiarly bin acquainted
withal, notwithstanding the best is to be hoped (if I hap to stumble) that
the path is plain I walk in, and I presume not to go far in mine own
opinion, but will be led by the grauest authors of truth, and most venerable
divines and Philosophers, whose words and learning I will allege, and with
whom the Readers must strive and wrestle if they mean to struggle with any
piece of the ancient Fathers reports and philosophy. And for that in many an
infinite number of causes (both depending on natures reason, and earthly
operations) Wonders are to be talked off, and Earthquakes to be seen, I will
express as well as I may, diverse things as they were done many hundred years
ago, and so set forth such wonderful matters that happened in those days,
that the people at this present shall make a marvel off, and yet therein
behold no other thing, but the mighty work of the Lord, and majesty of our
maker that is seen shining in his workmanship, and gloryed in his creatures.

First and foremost is meant by this discourse to begin at the Wonders of the
air, and alterations of the heavens (which waxes old as a garment) and so to
come down orderly to the Trembling of the earth and shaking of the world,
declared only in this little treatise to make the ignorant believe and
acknowledge, that there is no other worker of wonders neither here nor above
(though many things are talked off) but the power of God and blessed hand of
the Lord: who was never idle, but from the beginning of the world has always
bin occupied, either in one place or another, by a wonderful manner both in the
heavens and earth, to call his children to repentance and to show himself a
merciful Father, but there are some stubborn boys (and I fear too great a
number) of the kind and complexion of king Pharaoh, whose heart was indurate,
and who forgot correction as soon as the rod was taken from his shoulders and
plagues from his people, now if such complexions and corrupt natures (for want
of good looking too) have or would infect the sound body and soul of those
that are easily tempted, and drawn to believe little that is true, and trust
much that is false and full of fair semblances: To these and to none other
(for the preservation of their good belief and purging of perverse
incredulity) these present pains are presented partly, to show in what parts
these manifold wonders did fall, and plainly to explain what followed
immediately after, among those nations where such wonders happened.

It is found in the Annals that in the year when Marcus Acilius and Caius
Porcius were Consuls of Rome, there was openly to be seen that from the
inferior region of the air did fall in manner of rain both blood and milk,
which as some affirm (albeit it was a strange thing to behold) befell many
times before some great alteration of the people and republicke, likewise in
the year when Lucius Voluminous and Seruius Sulpicius were Consuls of the same
city, it did rain perfect flesh, the most part whereof was consumed and eaten
by the birds of the air, and yet the rest that did fall and remain on the
earth did not corrupt of a long season: The very year before that Marcus
Crassus, or Rasilicata with his whole army, which were Italian soldiers, of
the country Lucania, was overthrown by the Parthes a strong nation that the
Romans made war upon: It rayned iron in the manner of a sponge in the self
same land where the Soldiers were levied, whereupon their wise men and great
clerks, by their Deuinations declared that the wounds and sores of the heavens
were to be feared, and that some sort of people were in danger to receive great
hurt from the skies and angry Planets. In the year that Lucius Paulus and
Marcellus were Consuls, it did rain wol like spunges about the town of
Carissan (or Carino) and the next year following Titus Annius Milo a great
personage was slain in battle near the aforesaid town of Carissan, you
shall find in the register of Senats that the same year that Milo was slain
in, it rayned brick stones, as Milo was pleading a matter in the senate house,
all which wonders spoken off wayed together, persuades no little argument of
the warnings and myraculous manner of the elements, that foresheweth great
matters to come, and presageth many things worthy memory.

It is said, and truly to be proved, that before and after the wars that the
Zelanders had, with the Danes of Denmark, There was to be hard in the air
oftentimes a certain sound and clickening of harness, and the sound of many
trumpets at that present instant was hard in the skies: In the year of the
third Consulship of Marius, the people of Ameria (or Amelia) and Todi (or
Tuderdani) in the towns of the Duchy of Spoleto, did behold two great armies
of men in the skies, the one power coming from the leuant, and the other from
the occident, and those that came from the occidentall were put to flight, and
chased by the other party, after both the armies had a long while been in
combat: and there fell out great things in the neck of this wonder, yea, the
self sam like matter happened in the air at Ramberg the year 1534. and at
Wisenburg the year of our Lord 1530. On which strange veiw fell out bloody
wars in Iermanie and other parts, both fearful in proof and pitiful to
behold. The Greek authors as Pliny says do affirm that the second year
of the 78. Olympiade, Anaxagoras Calzomenien, presaged by his great knowledge,
and told the proper day and hour when a mighty and monstrous great stone
should fall from the heavens, which came to pass in the open and plain day,
in the country of Thrace, which is along the flood Aegos, and in the time of
this stone (as big as a tumbrell) fell from the skies, a great commett was
seen in the clouds, and this commett endured blazing a long season, as did of
late a blazing star when the Queens Majesty lay at Windsore, not long
before the king of Portugal and all his army (a sorrowful tail to tell) was
overthrown in Barbary by the hard adventure of fortune, and force of the king
of Fesse. Then was another little stone that Anagoras spoke off long before, it
fell from the heavens (that now remains in the village of Abydo) which
superstitious people hold in great reverence, and another at Cassandri a town
of Macedone (or Thrace) this stone for fear of the wrath of God (that in his
anger might punish and suddenly stricke) was solemnly carried abroad and showed
to the people to daunt their pride, and bridle their follies: The raynbow which
as many affirm is never seen by night, but always appears in clear day,
manifestly declares that mightily Gods majesty works, and his merciful
dealings are to be marueilously noted: For never as is to be read (by good
authors) was seen more then two raynebowes at one time together in the skies,
who shows that a firm and constant course and sign of Gods mercyes, with no
alteration is planted perdurable where his people may behold it, sometimes is
to be seen (as Pliny makes mention of) a scarlet color, and a red sanguine
in the skies, and sundry other times is perceived likewise that the sky seems
to open, and fire falls down from the same, (a thing prodigious and
fearful) which consumes all things that it touches or encounters, as it
came to pass says Pliny the third year of the 107. Olympiade, at which
season King Philip of Macedonie obtained by victory the most part of all
Greece, And truly says Pliny I think that nature (which he calls God)
produces those things at certain times determined by Gods appointment, as he
works his other operations, and further says Pliny all the subtle
imaginations of man, nor the inventions of all humane spirits and judgments,
can render no good reason for the same, for there opinions thereof serves for
nothing, Pliny 27. For these accidence celestial have always signified some
great calamity to come, not that I think (says he) that those evils and
calamities that happen are the cause of the blazing stars or commetts, but I
hold opinion says he, that the same commetts are procreated and sent for
special marks and signs, to know thereby what calamity is likely to happen,
und because those signs are marvelous rare and strange, the reason of their
nature is in a manner incomprehensible, so that truly men may not speak on
them as they do on the order of the Planets, or on their eclipse, or on many
other things remarquable in the elements, look good Reader how excellently
that eathnicke Pliny has spoken of the divine majesty and doings of God
(which he calls nature) and note how he has so cunningly handled the
argument, that no one point or other may be reasoned against, for this in it
self confuteth all things to the contrary, and explaneth such secrets, that
every other natural reason is by this put to silence, I have seen (says
Pliny) often in the night (an corpse degard that made the sentinel in the
camp) near the trenches, certain lights of the manner of a star, which were
as it were a slame tied to the end of a soldiers pick, and on the Sea sundry
Mariners as they have sailed, have seen the like lights hanging on the mast,
which lights are a very evil sign to the Sailors, if they be but one of them
seen at one time, for that presageth shipwreck, or manifests great
mischief, for sometimes if the flame fall down wards, it burns the
vessel, if two lights be seen, they bring goodness and hope of happy
fortune, and presageth that the ship shall have a good voyage, likewise when
these two happy lights ariueth, (the unfortunate flame that comes always
alone) that the Mariners calls helene, vanishes out of veiw, yea sometimes
this light lights full upon many men's heads about the evening, all which
things says Pliny never happen without great matter to follow them, the
mysteries and knowledge thereof is reserved only to the majesty of God, (whom
he names nature) who will hyde and lock up the reasons of those causes in the
cabine or sacred chamber of his privy secrets: Here Pliny plainly
expounds (though he were a Pagan) many secret matters much to the purpose of
men's good opinions, and greatly to the glory of God, and to prove that strange
lights have and are to be seen, I being in Garnsey (having charge under Sir
Thomas Leighton) was searching of the watch in a place called castle Cornet,
and there full on the top of a cross, I espied this flaming fire, before the
face and veiw of diverse Soldiers, after the which sight fell a very great
tempest, and such a kind of a storm, as the small fishes in the Seas could
not abide, for they were driven to the shore so fast, that little children and
young maids wading but a foot deep in the water, took millions of the
fishes, and brought them to the land, some in their kirchers and aprons, and
other some in their capps hatts, and such things as they had for the cause.
Thus far have you heard some piece of the matter, touching the air and
secrets from thence sent to the world, (as God by his goodness pleases to
deal) And now shall ye have rehearsed somewhat of the Earthquakes, and other
worldly Wonders that many times have happened, and has bredde great harms and
no little wonder.

Now first and foremost to some wonders of the world, in Titus Liuius you shall
read, that before great wars burst out, between the Romans and Macedonians,
in many places and regions were some strange things most fearful and
lamentable to behold: For in the country of Lucanie the heavens seemed as they
had been all on a flaming fire, and in another country far from that, at
high noone the Sun became all over red as scarlet, and at midnight in the
Temple of Juno was heard a great alarm, and horrible cry, in diverse manners and
fearful sorts, yea and in many places sundry beasts of diverse shapes very
monstrous were brought into the world, and at Salonne a child was borne that
the people knew not whether it were a man or a woman, and likewise in Sauoye a
pigge was farryed that had the head of a man, and again in Lucanie was a horse
seen that had five feet, and as Cauies was a man that had his ears standing
in the middle of his brows, whereon was commanded (when the books of Sibell
had been seen) that chaste women should in murning sort sing a certain heavy
song, three times in a week through the city of Rome, all which ceremonies
the consul Aurellius did curiously accomplish, King Philip of Macedone anon
after these strange sights, did beseige the great city of Abydoo, in which
city the maiestrates and people, because they would not happen in Philips hand
and be made slaves, they all issued out and fought many times desperately, and
in the end burnt all their treasure, set a fire of the Town, slew all their
wives and children, and after all these horrible acts, one of them killed
another: here is to be noted (with the rest of miseries that fell out) that
many evils falls immediately in those parts where those strange and prodigious
sights and signs are to be seen. The Romans after this discomfited the Gauls
in which battle was slain five thousand knights, called noble soldiers, and
Amylkar the Duke of Penoyes and with him three noble Emperors of the Gaulles
were put to the sword, with a thirty and five thousand poor Soldiers: Ye
shall read in the 4. chapter of the second decaed, that as Titus Quincius was
going to leauie an army of noble Soldiers (that had been in Spain and
Affricke) one brought him news that by a thunder or miraculous working of the
elements, the high way where he should go, was broken and torn in pieces and
both the temple of Jove and Hercules were set on fire, and at Aretto the ground
for the length of a great distance, was opened and therein was made a deep
cave to the wonder of a great number of people, And at Assnesse there was a
calfe seen with two heads, and a pigge with four tails, after which sights
prayer and supplications was made to their gods a whole day long without
ceasing, and yet great wars and troubels began to be set abroch, in many
kingdoms, these wonders going before al these hurly burlies, the fourth decaed
the 12. chapter in the Consul of Domycius time, there was an Ox that spoke
and said in latin (Roma cave tibi) after which words pronounced the Ox was
diligently kept, and so the river of Tyber arose and did pass the bound so
sarre, that it ouerthrewe many houses and edifyses, and did very great harm
diverse ways, and through the abundance of rain that fell (or other causes
that pleased God) a great rock fell and overwhelmed a number of poor people,
and the floods were so high (by the mean of an outrageous tempest) that they
drowned many viilages about Rome, upon the which strange sight (or in a small
space after) three of the greatest Emperors of the world dyed most unhappily,
and as some authors makes mention those Princes took their leave all in one
year, Philopomenes, Scypion, and Hanniball was these three great personages:
Now to write what wars, troubels, seditions, and other calamities happened in
many kingdoms (after these terrible tokens and prodigious signs) it would
weary you with the reading thereof, and make you but marvel at the mighty
works of God, which assuredly comes to pass in every place by his appointment
(to show his power) and happens not by the course of the heavens, causes of the
earth, or natural operations, as many of Aristotels disciples affirm and
wilful schoolmen by reasons would prove, for as God is without beginning, so
his power is without ending, and his divine works and judgments are as
matters that we should not break our wits about, and are so far beyond our
reach, that we rather stand amazed at veiwe of them, then any way satisfied in
the searching or ceasoning of the cause of their beginnings, and though at the
first God gave the Elements a nature, past all the compass of man's base
knowledge, we neither must trust Aristotle, nor lean too much to our weakness
and imaginations, for the beginning of his Deity is as easily known, as the
nature of strange visions and signs in the air, that only are directed by
his omnipotent power.

Now come we to Earthquakes.

In the year of the Consulship of Lucius Marcius and Sextus Julius there
befell a case so strange at Modenna, that the like yet was never heard off, as
Pliny reports he has found written in the books of Hertusques, A marvel
that mountains meet.
and among the Toscane Philosophers: Then happened so terrible an earthquake
that two mountains met together, and shook so vehemently the one the other,
(separating themselves as a combat were fought) and meeting with such fury
and noise, that all the country adjoining stood astonished at the matter, and
when these two mountains had done their shaking, and at the instant of their
first remove there arose such a fume of flaming fire from the earth, that it
reached to the heavens, the which monstrous battle of mountains and
wonderful earthquake in those parts, was seen of many Roman Knights and
Soldiers, and an infinite number of travelers of the world (than being in the
way called Emylius, or via emilia, who considering that pitiful tragidie of
time and other matters that fell out, marueiled much and were sore afraid, for
indeed all the granges, tenements, farms, and houses that were one any of
these mountains, fell in small pieces, and little morsels, so that both
beasts in the field, and people in their dwellings, were all utterly
destroyed and clean overthrown, this marvelous chance fell a year before
the wars of Sociale, that was made against the Marses, the which wars
brought not much less damage to Italy (than the wars ciuell, by which
dissension millions of men were slain or put to shame and misery, and in the
chronicle of Neroes rain is to be found a very prodigious thing, for the last
year of Neroes ra^^ing, a great ground of Alive pertaining to Vertius
Marcellus (procuror general to the Emperor Nero) was transported from his own
proper place with all his trees, and set in the common way between the soil
it stood on, and another man's heritage, after which matter the tyrant Nero
dyed and a great alteration fell in the Empire, by the trembling of the earth
as Homer affirms waters did flow where firm land remained, and the Seas did
retire from their wonted course in another place, by which means a great
country was discovered before over flowed with water, as men might see
toward the mount Siscelo, in the fields and near the haven of Larta, or
Ambracia, a plot of ground ten long miles from the borders of the Sea, that in
times past stood drowned and undiscovered, and at Athens likewise the sea is
retired from the haven (that they call Piree) about five miles of length, and
at Epheson the Sea did anciently beat against the temple of Diana, but now the
Sea is a great way reculed from that temple, and if the history of Herodote be
true, aunciently the waves of the Sea went over the city of Memphys in Egypt,
running to the mountains of Ethiopie, and the plains of Arabie, in like sort
the Sea did beat against Illion called Troy, and covered all the whole
country of Tentertanie, and all the other fields where passes the river
Meander, these proofs and passages sufficiently shows, that the tremblings
of the earth are as much and more to be feared then the cracking of a rotten
house, or the fall of a mighty castle that stands on feeble proppes, and
totters at every blast of wind: Further it is said, in the Isles of
Pithecuses by the vehemency of an earthquake, a great town did sincke, and by
another earthquake again, a great lake was made in the same Islands, as yet
remaining a wonder to the world, read the four and ninth of Pliny, and ye
shall see a number of other matters, as myraculous as any yet rehearsed.

The divine Plato reports, that aunciently there was a mighty and a great
country, where now is the Sea Atlantique, and in the Sea Mediterranie a
marvelous deal of land is sunk and covered with water, yea to the very gulf
of Ambracia, which is in Acarnanie which comes out of Corinth, the same
having one member or leg upon Greece, and how many countries in Europe Azia
and other parts, are destroyed by the Sea and original cause of earthquakes,
I hope now needs not to make particular report off, albeit some notorious
things may be (by the sufferance of learned men that reads) touched and
somewhat treated off, under favor as far as serves to my purpose. There was
an earthquake in the Emperor Tiberius time, so wonderful that it ouerthrewe
twelve towns in Asia all in one night, and during the wars of Carthage it
was reported to the Senate of Rome, that within one year was seven and
thirty earthquakes, but now behold what followed the very self same season,
Hanniball discomfited the Romans near the lake of Perouse, and yet neither of
both the armies (which was a most marvel) hard nor felt no piece of the
earthquakes, albeit the earth trembled so often, as it was to be supposed that
the whole world would have suddenly been overwhelmed: Thus you see the earth
which is the mother of mankind (though she seems senseless) is moved by the
almighty to tremble and shake, when man is toward destruction, and commonly no
bloody battayls have happened but an earthquake or commet went before, the one
to make man look upward to the heavens, where he desires to dwell, and the
other to warn him and plainly show him, he must fall to the earth and ashes,
from whence all flesh did rise and took his original, and surely it is a
manifest sign of Gods favor when that both heaven and earth (and all other
things we can behold) are occupied and working away by some mystery to call
us to repentance, and make the pilgrim prepare himself to be gone from the
veil of misery, and miserable dungeon of disquietnes, but now I pray you
regard what Pliny says (he being but an infidel in respect of a Christian)
now truly says he The trembling of the earth never is the cause of one evil
alone, nor all the danger is not only in the trembling: for it always
presageth some mishappe and Des aster to come, and likewise says he there was
never seen earthquake in the city of Rome, but some great mischance fell out
suddenly after, if an infidel believed so and has set down his opinion in
print, for an infallible rule and ground to build upon, me think Christians
should confess without any difficulty, that the natural cause of earthquakes
is a supernatural matter, which neither agitations nor exalations can command
by their force, to move so great a mass of earth as an earthquake shakes,
though Aristotle and sundry others makes a great argument on the like purpose.

If all earthquakes, commetts in the air, signs and wonders in the skies, and
many other notorious maruells, rise on a natural cause, it may be asked who
sent the star to be seen at Christ's birth, and who caused the whole world to
shake at his death, if nature by the course of her operation, works such
wonders, then belike that fearful earthquake had happened though Christ had
not dyed, and at the same hour and instant though Christ had not suffered for
man, the earthquake would not have failed the ordinary season and working,
that springs on exalations, agitations, and such like matter, Aristotle for all
his superexcellent learning, knew no more then pertayned to the judgment of a
man, and though all the deep wise men of the world (and the world it self)
were possessed with his books and arguments, it passes all reason to believe
that the earth can shake, and the whole world trembling without his will and
pleasure that made the day and night, and knows all things before they come
to pass, and is both the mouer and maker of heaven and earth: And surely I
believe that neither all the Devils in hell, nor all the Angels in heaven, nor
all the coniurers and sorcerers in the world, have no power (of themselves) to
turn up side down a little mountain, much less have they power to turn
mighty kingdoms into the Seas, and make the maine Sea dry land, no doubt but
the winds, waters, air, fire, and earth (working together) have an excellent
force and nature to work their effects, and bring to pass things both
marvelous and past man's cunning to compass, but to show armies and battayls
in the skies, commetts in the clouds, force the heavens to rain blood,
compel the heavy molde to remove, and shake the universal world is a
diuiner matter to speak off, and deserves in a most high manner to be
handled, and more reverenced regarded and feared when it happens: For such
strange sights are the very messengers that the great judge sends before his
coming, and the only warnings the world (in the latter days) shall have
before this old earth shall be consumed, and new Jerusalem shall be made,
nature can not of her self make sweet apels sour, sour apels sweet, change
and exchange the natural kind of trees or other fruit, as in Lyche was seen
a town of Surrie, at the ariuing of king Xerxes in those parts, read
Aristander and the commentaries of Caius Epidius, and they will show you
things to be wondered at of trees (if it be true that they affirm) they say
trees did speak, which nature denies and reason can not conceive, but trees
stones and all other senseless things, God may make speak, as well as he made
Balams Ass reprove his own master, and the Ox in Rame cry Roma cave tibi.
Pliny in his naturals says, that it was reported of the Romans, that in the
territory of Cuma a city of Ionie, a great and a high tree did sincke so
low into the earth, that nothing but a few small sprayes on the very top
thereof was to be seen, but what think you followed after, marry many
mischiefs, terrible bloudshedde, wicked conspiracies, and open dissentions,
for the civil war between Pompeie and Julius Caesar began at that present,
and ended not God knows a long while after, the Romans to know what the
sincking of that tree did signify, did look in their books of deuinations,
and their they found that this wonder presaged a matter of great consequence,
threatened the slaughter of multitudes of men: What needs now to search or
rehearse profane histories, for the weight and worthiness of a true argument,
touching earthquakes, wonders in the air, and warnings of the world, that
manifestly sets forth the myraculous doings and majesty of the almighty,
for you need not to go any further for a ready resolution of these points,
but to the holy scripture, which plainly declares that in the latter days you
should see signs in the air, wonders in the world, the stars fall from
heaven, the Sun and Moon loose their light, and to be short and use the
pearcing and weighty words of the Gospel, we are told of wars, earthquakes,
desolation, faintnes of faith, and warned if God did not shorten those days
for the chosens sake, the very elect might be dissaued and but a few should be
saved, so many opinions and errors would arise (and iniquity would be so
great) that it would strive for the victory, and faith would wax so cold,
that God and all goodness should in a manner be forgotten, wherefore the maker of
heaven and earth reuiues our dead memories with earthquakes and wonders (not
engendered and produced by natural causes) because that omnipotent Lord does
what he lists, both in the elements and earth, compelling them to work his
will as their courses be set by the infallible order and ordinance of his
majesty, that does with his own workmanship what seems best in his sight,
Now I pray you under patience and favor demanded, shall the little star
(lately seen in July last) be forgotten, as unfit to be reckoned or noted
(for the smalenesse of it) among the wonders of the air, indeed the
incredulity of the world and hardness of stony hearted men, believes as little
as they may, either of the forewarnings of God or divine preachings of good
men, who daily in sweetest manner opens the scriptures unto us, and shows
familiar examples out of the old Testament and the new, that might move
millions to repentance, and frame a fraternall conversion among the people, but
thousands grow so stubborn and stifnecked that they neither will stoop to
consider what is spoken, nor bend their minds to the amendment of life, but
runs all on head (without looking back) into errors and vain imaginations,
thinking that wonder or that worthy matter will blow over, and stands in fear
of nothing, no scarce of a terrible blast of thunder, that often tears men
beasts and trees in pieces, and strikes down flat to the ground high towers
and stately buildings: All these strange accidents rehearsed, and ten thousand
times as many more fearful matters, if they might be set down (as a
spectacle to our sight) can never change nor alter the common course of our
dissolute manners, and incredulous minds.

A wonder lastes but nine days, a sign in the air is but wondered at, an
earthquake is called but a common custom of many causes, a blazing star
makes people but babble a while, a mounster in beast or man brings no great
maruels, a summer winter like is but wayed as wicked world pleases, an
unnatural wett out of season is named but a foul weather: a tempest or
blustering storms is quickly quieted with a calm: a dearth of grain and all
sustentation of man, tries but our patience: and seldom brings repentance, and
the plague of the sword war and pestilence is suddenly forgotten: so
careless is our life, and so full of incredulity are our hearts, wherefore
neither excellent men in a pulpit, true writers of good books, setting out of
ancient histories, nor showing of fearful examples, seems to do no good,
neither to the benifite of the body nor blessedness of the soul: Than of
necessity all must be committed to Gods grace and goodness, whose mercies
must uphold us, or else the wonders of the air, the trembling of the earth,
and the incredulity of the world will increase the wrath of the almighty, and
bring a badde world to confusion.

Warnings to the world.
IN the forenoone doctor Rogers being in a matter to the rebuke of some
disorders, he saw suddenly fall a great darkness over all the Church, (a
crack of thunder following the darkness) whereby all the people were not only
amazed, but likewise stricken down in a great terror and trembling, and at
their fall were marked under their clothes with bloody signs and shows of
Gods wrath, most wonderful to behold, because their garments were kept whole
and sound, at which season and fear some seemed dead, and fell so sick on the
sudden, that long after they recovered not, yet the preacher not a whit
stricken nor none of his folks hurt, notwithstanding (as doctor Rogers told
me) many of the people at that instant present were stricken down, but
howsoever things fell out by Gods visitation and sufferance, the mighty
majesty of the Lord was myraculously seen and understood in this fearful
action: The bishop yet most stoutely preached in the after noone, when no such
wonders were to be noted at that instant, but incredulous people cares for no
wonders, for the like of this was at Bongie a parish church in Northfolke, I
saw it my self and beheld the clock house, belfrie, and walls torn in
pieces, even as a man's hand had bin thrust through a great piece of warm wax,
and another church neighbor to this at the very same season was visited with
some sign of Gods displeasure, for in some one of them or both, were sundry
people slain, other churches since that time, as Norwich of late, and Born in
Huntington shire, have witnessed to the world that Gods anger on churches, has
often been marueilously seen, which may make many men wonder at the
strangeness thereof, namely for that in churches and places of prayer, God
permits and openly suffers his people to perish, and chiefly when they are at
service, where men ought rather to be mindful of their offenses, and frailty
of life, then bear in breast any motion that may purchase Gods displeasure:
But some do judge (and that a great number) the vilest sort that honors no
virtue, makes or would make the house of prayer, a den of thieves, and so
forth as Christ himself found fault withal, Solomon and no other was
ordained to build the Temple of the Lord, and when it was finished, Sollomons
own words and prayer in that Temple, is a most divine note and wonder to
look upon, honor and admyre, well well I dare say no more, but God is
marvelous angry at some matters, or men pertaining to the Church, when in
that holy house he sends such miracles, and sends such warnings: I refer
the judgment thereof to grave Fathers and Divine preachers: So bringing to an
end the small matter of this book, that has treated of Wonders and signs in
the air, Trembling and shaking of the earth, and warnings from God sent before
the judgment day: which mighty matters because they pass my reach to judge
off, and the common skill of men to discuss and deside, I leave unto the
almighty that daily works wonders, sendes warnings, shows miracles, and
never rests from making men know his duty, toward the admiring of him and
his works, which the more men write off, think on, or dispute in, the more
farther they run headlong to heaps of errors follies and unpardonable
offenses, wherefore avoiding over much boldness and presumption of entering too
far in these causes, I conclude and commit all to his mercies.

FINIS.
The Lords prayer and creed in verse, with the ten Commandments.
Our Father which art in persons three,
Thy mighty name most hollowed be:
Thy kingdom come, done be thy will,
As well on earth, as it is in heaven still:
Give us this day, our daily bread,
(With which our bodies, and souls are fed:)
Forgive us our trespass every way,
As we forgive them that seek our decay:
And lead us not into temptation,
(But for Christ's sake our only salvation:)
Deliver us from evils all, That makes us from thy favor fall:
For kingdom glory and al is thine, For ever and ever (by power divine.)
The Creed.
I Believe in God the Father of all might,
Made heaven and earth, sent darkness and light:
And in Jesus Christ, his son and our Lord,
Conceived by the holy Ghost (as scriptures do record:)
Of the virgin Mary this babe was borne,
To redeem man that else had been forlorn:
Suffered under Ponce Pilate, crucified and laid in grave,
Descended into hell (the elect souls to save:)
Rose the third day, such hope I have,
Was seen alive here, ascended into heaven than,
Sits on Gods right hand a mediator for man:
From thence shall he come, to judge both quick and dead,
Amyd the clouds to show his great Godhead:
I believe in the infinite holy Ghost,
The Catholic Church that honors God most:
The communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins,
The resurrection of the body, where gladness begins:
And in the life everlasting I trust,
To rise at the last day with Job out of dust.
The ten Commandments.
GOd spoke these words, the Lord thy God I am,
That brought thee home, when thou from Egypt came:
I set thee free from bondage every way,
Because thou shall my holy will obey.
Thou shall not have any other Gods but me,
Thou shall not serve strange Gods in any degree:
Unto thy self, no graven image make,
Like any thing, that is in heaven above,
Nor earth below, thy pleasure so to take:
Nor underneath the earth, my wrath to move:
Nor worship them by any kind of mean,
For I thy God loves people pure and clean.
Thou shall not bow down to any image wrought,
Thy only Lord a jealous God he is,
That plagues the sins of people vain and naught:
Yea to the third, and fourth generation, note well this,
I visit the Sons, and Fathers of them all,
That do hate me, or to idolatry fall:
And mercies shows, to thousands when I will,
That loves me, and keeps my commandments still.
Thou shall not take, thy great Gods name in vain,
He gilty is, that will mine honor stain.
The sabbath day, look that thou keep in fear,
Six days thou have, to work, to trudge, and toil,
The seventh is the Sabbath every where:
Than thou shall not thy hands with labor foil,
Thou and thy son, thy daughter, maid, and man,
That serves thee, shall do no labor than:
Thy cattle and, the stranger in thy gate,
Shall do no work, that day early nor late:
For in six days, thy Lord that all has blessed,
Made heaven and earth, and in the seventh did rest.
Thou shall honor, thy father and mother well,
(That long alive, on earth safe thou may dwell.)
Thou shall not kill, for blood craves blood, or vengeance still.
Thou shall not break, true wedlockes band no way.
That knot and staff, is an honorable stay.
Thou shall not steal, for thieves robe Prince and common weal.
Thou shall not bear, false witness in any sort,
For that may take, from justice good report.
Thou shall not wish, thy neighbors house nor wife,
His man servant, nor maiden for thy life,
His Ox, his Ass, nor nothing that is his,
Live with thine own, as the Lords pleasure is.
Verses fit for every one to know and confess.
TO bed I go from you, God knows when I shall rise,
Nights darkness bids the day adue, till morning glads the skies:
The bed presents the grave, in shrowding sheets we lie,
The flattring boulster that we have, is stuffed to please the eye:
The blankets are green grass, that grows when we are gone,
The pillowes with sun beams do pass, for pilgrims to look on:
The couerlet is care, that clothes us whilst we live,
The bed staves gentill scourges are, that does us warnings give:
The bedstocke and the tycke, and all belongs to bed,
Is but vain pleasures that we like, to please a wanton head:
Sleep is of death the shape, to show man's substance small,
As earth does for the body gape, so death will have us all:
Then live as thou should die, when God shall please to stricke,
The grave wherein our bodies lie, and bed are both alike:
But sure when senses sleep, from labor toil and pain,
The soul for fear do wayle and weep, till man awake again:
Death waits so hard at hand, when soundest sleep we have,
That all our state does doubtful stand, till body be in grave:
Man shortens his own days, and so does wear and wast,
By wilful steps and wicked ways, that cuts of life in have:
Sleep is a step to death, and time that wears full fast,
Life waits no longer on the breath, then blood and health does last:
When candell waxes dim, or near the socket draws,
Man's goodly glistring glory trim, declines by kindly cause:
Then aged syres like me, small tarrying have you here,
When faulters shall examind be, they buy their folly dear:
In bed that brings no rest, those strange events we find,
When roling up and down the breast, sad thoughts lodes heavy mind:
The bed breeds dreams and toys, that idell fancy brings,
More vain than rash are earthly joys, that hinders heavenly things:
The soundest sleep of all, in Abraham's bosom is,
Here joy is mixed with bitter gall, and there gall turns to bliss:
To bed go in these bounds, as babes in cloutes are laid,
To rise with Christ (when trumpet sounds) who has our ransom paid.
FINIS.
