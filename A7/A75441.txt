AN ANSWER TO THE PETITION Sent from the University of OXFORD to the
Honorable Court of PARLIAMENT.
THe great Petition or rather that which bears so great a name, as coming
from the Universitie of Oxford to uphold a greater which is Episcopacy; finding
it to be so little worth, and to so little purpose (as it is by the judgment
of all that have judgment) as I should have thought to have come from the
hands of some under Graduate, who had been tutored in some Popish way, had I
not seen the Humble Petition of the University of Oxford Printed in great
Letters; for although they have proposed some thing, they have proved nothing,
unlesseit be charity to themselves and their successors. For though their
duty toward God and the Nation be much, yet how it has been performed, let
others judge, they are not like to have so much as an ordinary interest in the
resolution of their own cases: all their Authors have not made them wise
enough to prove the succession of diocesan Bishops from the Apostles: nor dare
they speak any thing without book; they would feign live merrily, and feed
upon the fat, and drink the sweet, like lazy drones which rob the laboring
Bees; and no goverme^nt will admit of it but that which is contrary to all
government, the tyra^nical government of Bishops, that they have bin the running
plaguesore of this Nation, is evident by their practices, there are Books out
to prove their descent from Antichrist clear enough; but none to prove them
from the Apostles, or to be jure divino, but what either are or deserve to be
hist at; nor is there any Petition put up for them, but what may claim kindred
with yours, for arguments and success; the cause is not put to the arbitriment
of mad men, (as you styled them in your Letter sent to the Pope of Lambeth,
dated the ninth of November 1640.) where you call him a Judge of Religion, and
style your selves the devout worshipper of his holiness: which Letter was
written in Latin by a learned Papist in lofty language, being an answer to
his sent to you but three days before, fearing yet the villifying the
honorable Court of Parliament, but as wise men are your judges, as you would
seem to be. Now your Pope has betrayed himself, that would have betrayed the
City of Oxford when he made you Lords over them that live in it, and the whole
Kingdom suffered by his holiness, but now he must suffer for his unholines, and
there is a diminution of the order already, and the man must follow: but those
pious commanding Doctors, with their Proctors, are now become humble suitors to
them which they hated, since they are Parliament converts, there is more change
wrought amongst them since the third of November last by the Parliament, than
thirty years preaching could work; for the still voice would not move them,
and the voice of thunder stirred their malice, that the word could not be
entertained: the Cathedralls are built (they say) upon pious foundations; I
thought holiness had not layne so low, nor did I think it had been placed in
stones; but there is more piety in the glass windows, and in your Altars you
suppose, but now your Altars are altered, I believe there is no other holiness
in them than such as his Holiness cast upon Saint John's College and Saint
Paul's, which was so much in that kind that he left himself none at all; He
laid the foundations in sin, which is contrary to holiness, he took bribes to
turn a cause oftentimes, and large ones too: of all which he will spare some
thing for the holy place: so many that built the Cathedralls, were
merit-mongers, and their ends were Popish, and so have they been employed for
the most part, for they have Deanes and Prebends, who devour the revenews,
that have no pastoral charge, and for the most part they are as unclean as
the Monks and Friars were for whom they were built. And for the singing men,
they do no good, but fill up rooms, and feed upon the prey. Was ever any man
converted so, or built up in the faith by any of them, produce but one man, and
take the revenews for your labor, but if you cannot, be contented to leave
your three four five hundred or a thousand pounds a year, with which you do
nothing that good is, and be contented with an hundred pounds a year, and
preach the Gospel, and let your betters share with you. That they were first
dedicated to Idols or Idolatry, which they call S^ints, and the honor and
service of God, is the least ^h^ng considerable amongst them, and seeing they
nurse superstition, although they have been up ^olden by the former Laws of
the Land, yet seeing more light is sprung up amongst us, let them, by better
Laws, with their means to them, be ordered for better uses, if that be a
motive to make Scholars study, that they may live without study. I cannot
conceive but it is the way to make them hypocrites: but sure this argument
dropped from a Civil Lawyer and not from a Divine, and so let them fall
together: some deep Scholars that will dive into the bottomless pit for
preferment, and light their torches at Hell fire to find the way to
greatness, may expect a reward in such places as is fittest for them, or a
Jesuit or a Seminary Priest may desire it in regard it did formerly belong to
their tribe, and in respect of the affinity such places have with their
Monasteries, but I cannot find that every any Scholar that was eminent did
ever desire or accept of such Monastic preferment, except he were notorious
for some fact, and foul in his practice as as well eminent for his learning or
natural parts; nor was there ever any godly man produced or nourished by them,
for it is impossible any good can spring out of evil, because every thing does
produce its like, nor can it work beyond nor above its own sphere; light
cannot spring out of darkness, but by a command from heaven; and then light
makes war with darkness, and admits of no agreement; so godly men scorn to
receive the means of their livelihood in a superstitious way, as to draw their
nourishment from the breast of an Idol. You begin to call them adversaries of
the Church of Rome, but I know you will call their Church the whore of Babylon,
and maintain their doctrine to be only Antichristian, by that time the
Parliament has sat nine months long. As for the portions that they do
afford to younger brothers of good parentage, I know you mean by goodness,
greatness: it is a shrewd mistake in such an assembly as was present at the
making of this Petition, for goodness without greatness is slighted if not
hated amongst many of you that are younger brothers indeed, if being devoted to
the Ministry of the Gospel, they deserve not respect for their works sake, to
be preferred and honored as Ministers in a pastoral charge, and not to
cloister themselves up, as unfit to labor in the Lords Vineyard: and all are
younger brothers that doubt of the truth of it. The Officers and Ministers that
depend upon them, are but Pensioners to those Priests that are maintained in
the Cells, they must be all conformable, not only to their superstition, but
their humors: could they not be better maintained if the revenews were shared
amongst them? but this is their Priestly State to have their vassals to wait
upon them, and to eat their scrapes which would otherwise fall to the dogs. Oh
I but here is our great works; Free-Schools and Hospitals are upheld by them; I
confess, some thing is done that way by some of them, partly being enjoined,
partly for custom, and partly for vainglory; but free Schools would be free
indeed, if half those rents were given to that end, and Hospitalls might be
better maintained, or poverty prevented, if the other half were bestowed to
that purpose, but they will be Scavingers to mend high ways and bridges. I
wonder what Authors they have to prove these to be pious works, which the
Carters can do better than they, but they have their ends if they are at any
cost that way, either for coming to their houses, or for to gain applause for
doing that which they and others are bound to do. I see now they do not
confine holiness to the Church, nor to things belonging thereunto, seeing they
bring it over bridges into the high ways; as for being causes of much profit
to those Cities where they are situate, in relieving the poor; a poor
pittance the poor have of them. It would be a great help to the Cities, if
the means save what would maintain two godly Ministers were bestowed upon
those Cities to maintain the poor in work that are able to work, and to
keep those that are not; nor do I conceive that any strangers do come on
purpose to visit the Ornaments, unless they be some superstitious Pilgrims,
such as did use to visit Thomas Beckets Tomb, and such hinder the City, and
not help it, because they go a begging, then surely the City has no more
dealing with Chapmen, then if the Cathedral and all that belong to it were at
Rome: well, piety comes again, nay, monuments of piety, I am sure the
wickedest wretch that is may do good, Bonum sed non bone, they may bestow
their estates to such purposes when they can keep them no longer, especially
if they think to merit Heaven by that means, which they would not labor for
before. We know many of them were great Oppressors, Usurers, Popish Bishops,
Cardinals, amongst the rest, the Cardinal Wolsey, which was a proud
traiterous wretch, yet must these build monuments of their piety? they have
built fair houses, which might be useful if they were better employed: for as
they are now, they are not the honor of this Kingdom in the sight of foreign
Nations, but its disgrace: I had thought they had not been all Churchmen that
were maintained here, spoken of before, because they were multitudes and whole
families, but now I find many thousands of the laity, who enjoyed fair
estates from them; and in a free way too: I perceive the first were all devoted
to the Church, I dare not question it as a repetition in their Petition, nor as
tautologies, being three motives betwixt the one and the other. It is as well
done as the Articles of the Synod were last year, to establish the Church, but
that it is not stuffed so full of Antiquities: they would steer all, and have
all our liberties and livelihoods come from them, but they were such ill
Pilotes, that they are like to be put out of office, and wiser men set at the
stern. And let all men judge whether they add to the crown or take from it,
and whether those fat Livings did not or do not properly belong to it, and
whether they have those things by desert, or whether by their preaching, that
all is the Kings right, he may not first challenge those revenews of them in
part. As for those that are learned professors there, they may have maintenance
allowd when those Priories are abolished, but they are so accustomed to
idleness, that their learning goes not out of their Colleges, there they
stay themselves; if they are sent to a Benefice abroad, they can preach but
seldom; for they have not been used to it, and now they cannot learn: then
they will give ten pounds a year for a journey-man to read service, and to
talk once a fortnight to the people, of what dead men spoke before, which will
serve their turn, if he can mix a little Latin amongst it, but then he must
not hold them too long; he will preach three times a year himself, if his
means will make good, a hundred pounds a Sermon, or else he scorns to preach
so often: the selling of Fellowships will help the Masters that remains
there, but that was not the Founders intent. The subversion of those Abeyes
from their corrupt abuses, and converting them to good uses, will be attended
with honorable consequences, nor will it bring reproach to any but to those
that are Popishly affected: some harder conditions it may to drones, because
none will be in request, but preaching Ministers: the laity will be eased, nor
can you have more contempt than what your pride and fullness have brought upon
you; and under the correction of any wise men, except your selves, it will
encourage Scholars to be industrious, that when they excel, they shall not
only be placed, where they shall have sufficient maintenance, but honor among
the best of men. And those that foresee this, will not desire to have it
remedied. I think such considerations as yours will not move any unless it be
to laughter, or to mourn against your cause the more from your own arguments,
how are you changed? you call that Assembly honorable and say, they have great
wisdom, whom you style madmen in your Letter to Laud, November the ninth,
that pious jeere of that great Assembly is known to promote Religion in a
spiritual manner, not so much houses, which you call religious, after the
Popish custom, but the revenews is that you stick most upon: you have made
void the intents of the Donors, in preferring those which bid most, whose
friends are greatest, and keeping poor Scholars out for whom it was intended,
poor indeed. I do believe God is more dishonored in and by such places, than
in most Alehouses, by their confused bawling, they have a pretense to serve
God, but they intend their own bellies: the man that whips the dogs is thought
commonly to be the best amongst them: those Students which have outward by
ends, when they begin to study, they seldom or never bring Gods ends about,
which is to convert the souls of men: in studying themselves they are
strangers to the truth: but honest endeavors are always accompanied with
blessings of increase. I did not intend to be seen at all in this answer,
therefore what wants the force of an Argument, compare it with yours, and then
it may pass. You promise to pray, etc. What you intend by it I know not,
whether it be, pray we, which was in fashion of late, or for my Lords Grace, or
for the breaking up of the Parliament; you may put any thing to etc. But you
seldom pray without the Service Book, for that is an innovation: and some of
you have been questioned for innovations of late: there are none of those
prayers in it, but it is a wonder you had not the prayer against the Scots put
in it, for it was courageously penned. I am so charitable as to think you mean
to pray for the sick: but you would have been to seek for examples, if it had
not been for Peter's wives mother, and the Captains servant; but if the
praying, etc. were joined to the preaching, etc. they might draw both one way.
Although your Petition came from the Convocation house, where the Doctors and
Masters were assembled, yet omnibus and singulis, was too much; it would not
have it to all, nor ab hominibus, from all; it would feign have some of you
free; but I doubt your copy was corrected coming into some Lay man's hands,
before it came to the Press, or else the Printer being careless, left out
your strongest Motives, or weakened the sense, on purpose to make some women
laugh at it; if it be so call it in, or disclaim it for your act and deed, and
then I will call in mine too when this impression is sold.

FJNJS.
