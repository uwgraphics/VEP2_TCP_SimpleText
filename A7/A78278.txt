The CASE of those Persons that have Purchased Soldiers Arrears, the Irish
Transport Debt, Salt Tallies, Malt Tickets, or an Interest in any other
Deficient Funds.
A good or bad Title enhances or debases the Purchase of any Commodity, is well
known to any Man that ever bought a Foot of Land upon a controverted or
disputed Right.

If the Hazard bear a proportion to the Gain, it is a Just and Righteous
Bargain; I am sure it appeared so to the Wisdom of The Honorable House of
Commons, when for Ten Pounds they allowed a Chance of Thousand Pounds per
Annum, as in The Million Lottery, etc.

That this is the Case of those Persons that have bought Arrears, may appear
from hence:

They were esteemed both by the Buyer and Seller to be unsettl'd and precarious
Things, not likely to be paid of a long time, especially if the War had lasted,
or broke out anew, carried no Interest, by the Sale of them, there was no
Right vested in, or transferred to the Purchaser, as in Salt-Tallies, etc.

Many of the Officers that sold their Arrears bought Places with the Purchase
Money, without which they would probably have Starved before they could have
been Relieved by a Parliamentary Provision; and all those Gentlemen that sold
their Pay, hired Brokers and Sollicitors to find them Chapmen.

Many of those that bought Soldiers Arrears, Malt-Tickets, etc. took their
Money out of the Bank and other Funds in order to make a better Purchase, and
consequently, will be the greater loosers if this Clause be admitted.

What Provision would the Honorable House have made to Re-imburse the
Purchasers, in Case the Arrears had never been paid?

Where Officers sold their Pay two or three times over, what Provision shall be
made for the second or third Purchaser? Caveat Emptor is the common Answer,
then let him have a better Bargain for the great Risque he runs, etc.

When Salt Tallies have been sold sometimes at Cent per Cent loss, Bank Bills,
Chequer Notes, Malt Tickets, at a very great Discount, though they had
established Funds, and a growing Interest on them, why are not those Bargains
rescinded, and all other unequal Contracts, and where will the House Begin or
End?

If it be a Crime to take more than common Interest upon some occasions, or to
Buy a great Bargain, why has The Honorable House encouraged it all the last
War, and since; witness the great Premiums and the large Interests allowed upon
the safest Funds, witness a Clause in a certain Act made last Sessions, whereby
the Commissioners of the Victualling, were empowered to pay away Malt Tickets,
and Coal Tallies which carried Eight per Cent Interest at a considerable
discount both of Interest and Principle.

It is humbly proposed that this Matter ought to be decided in
Westminster Hall, if there be any Law that makes such Contracts Criminal, if
there be no Law, there is no Transgression.

It is humbly submitted to the Consideration of the House, that not one of
(...) Officers that sold his Arrears, was a Minor or a Non Compos, nor one (...)

there be no Law, there is no Transgression.

It is humbly submitted to the Consideration of the House, that not one of the
Officers that sold his Arrears, was a Minor or a Non Compos, nor one of the
Buyers extorted such a Sale, or reduced the Seller to any streights or
necessities in order to make an advantage thereby.

Where the value of any Commodity rises or falls by a bear Rumor, as Tallies
and Stocks have done by the report of the King of Spain's Death; such
Commodities can never be worth so much as others of lasting unchangeable value.

If notwithstanding what has been objected against in this Clause The
Honorable House I shall incline to rescind these Bargins, it is humbly hoped
that they will fix a short Day whereby those Officers who have sold upon
payment of the Money in Specie by them received, etc. and interest for the same
at the rate of -- per Cent may have the benefit of the Act, otherwise to be for
ever foreclosed.

Lastly, If all legal Contracts and Bargins be not preserved sacred and
inviolable, it is humbly submitted to the Wisdom of The Honorable House,
whither upon any great Exigence it would be possible to raise again those
mighty Sums, without which the Nation could never have carried on, nor so
gloriously have ended the late War with France. Many Officers who sold their
Arrears were Foreigners, and parted with them to raise Money to pay the Fees
for their Naturalization, which if they had not done, they could neither have
continued in the Service or been entitled to half Pay.
