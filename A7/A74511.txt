AN ORDINANCE For better amending and keeping in repair THE Common Highways
within this NATION.
WHereas the several Statutes now in force for mending Highways are found by
experience not to have produced such Good Reformation as was thereby intended,
Therefore, and to the end more effectual Remedies may be provided, Be it
ordained by His Highness the Lord Protector, by and with the advice and consent
of his Council, I. That in every Parish within this Nation of England and
Wales, there be two or more (according to the Greatness of the Parish) able and
sufficient Hous-houlders inhabiting in such Parish, and severally holding Lands
there of the yearly value of twenty pounds or more, in occupation, or such
others as shall be worth one hundred pounds in personal Estate, elected and
chosen, upon the first Tuesday next ensuing the five and twentieth day of
March, yearly, to be Surveyors of the Highways within their Respective
Parishes for the year ensuing. II. That if it shall fall out that no such
Surveyors shall be chosen, as aforesaid, within any such Parish, that then in
such case the Parishioners of every such Parish shall forfeit twenty pounds to
be levied upon the most Substantial Inhabitants thereof, who are to have
contribution from all the rest of the Inhabitants of the said Parish who are
taxable hereby for repair of the said Highways; and in case of difference in
rating, the same to be ordered and settled by the Justices of the Peace of the
said County, City or Town Corporate, where such Parish lies, or any two of
them; and in such case where no such election of Surveyors shall be made as
aforesaid, the then Overseers for the Poor of that Parish are hereby appointed
to be Surveyors of the said Surveyors of the said Highways within such
Parish, for the year ensuing. III. That every Person being elected, or hereby
appointed to be Surveyors of Highways, as aforesaid, shall undertake the
Office, and shall within ten days after such his Election, or being appointed,
as aforesaid, procure himself to be sworn before some Justice of Peace of the
County, Riding, City, or Town Corporate, or Limit, within which his Parish does
ly, diligently and faithfully to execute the office of Surveyor of Highways
within his Parish for the year then ensuing, and faithfully to account for all
moneys which shall come to his hands by virtue of his said Office, which oath
every Justice of Peace is hereby empowered and authorized to administer, within
the Limits of his Commission, accordingly. And if any such person so elected,
or hereby appointed, shall refuse to accept of his said Office, and to procure
himself to be sworn as aforesaid, that then every person so failing shall
forfeit for the same the sum of ten pounds. IV. That every Surveyor of High
ways, having accepted the Office, and being Sworn as aforesaid, shall
diligently apply himself to the duty and Execution of his Office, and shall
within ten days after his Oath taken, view all the Common and Public
Highways and Roads, where Carts and Carriages usually pass, and all Common
Bridges belonging to the said Parish, to repair, and all Watercourse, as also
all Streets, and pavements, and Common Nusances in the said Ways and Streets,
within their respective Parishes; And shall consider what Reparations will be
needful to be made, and what sums of money will be requisite and necessary
to be raised within the Parish for amending and repairing the same, upon pain
of forfeiting twenty shillings a piece for neglect of such view. V. That the
said Surveyors do, within six days after such view, give public notice in
the Church or Chapel to the Parishioners to meet to make an Assesment for
repairing the said Highways and streets, for making and repairing of
pavements, and for cleansing the said Streets and pavements, from time to time,
and for what else shall be requisite for the purposes aforesaid, and thereupon
a Rate or Tax in writing, within three days after such notice, shall be laid
by the said Inhabitants present at such meeting, or the greater number of them,
by a pound Rate, upon all the several Occupiers of Houses, Lands, Tithes, Cole
mines, fellable Woods, Tenements or Hereditaments, within the Parish, according
to the true yearly value of the same, and also upon the dead Goods, Commodities
or Stock in Trade of every particular Parishioner charged to pay to the poor,
rating every twenty pounds value of such Goods, equal to every twenty shillings
Land by year; And such further Rate to be afterward, and oftener made, as
occasion shall require, so as all the Rates together do not exceed twelve pence
in the pound for any one Parish in any one year. VI. That if such Parishioners,
or the greater number of them, shall not agree among themselves to make such
Rate within two days after such meeting, that then the said Surveyors of
Highways themselves shall make a Rate in writing according to the direction
aforesaid, and such Rate as the said Parishioners or Surveyors respectively
shall so make, being confirmed by one Justice of peace, shall stand, until upon
complaint and proof of some Irregularity or Inequality therein, to the Justices
of Peace at the Sessions, the Bench of Justices, or any two of them then
present shall see cause to alter the same; And if the said Justices shall find
cause to alter it, then the said Rate, with such alteration as they shall make,
shall stand without any further Appeal. VII. That in case where Common Nusances
are in Highways, or where such Common Highways in any Parish are
straightened by reason of enclosures made within twenty years, either by Hedges,
Ditches, Walls, or the like, or where Ditches or Water courses adjoining upon
such Highways, or which do lead the water from such Highways are not
scoured and dressed, or where any pavements are defective, or any Nusances by
filth or otherwise are in any paved Streets, the said Surveyors shall see that
the same be reformed, and the Offenders in any of the premises punished
according to Law, by Information or Indictments, deducting for the charge of
prosecution out of the monys collected; and the said Parishioners or Surveyors
of Highways respectively are hereby empowered in such case also to impose and
leavy over and above the twelve pence in the pound beforementioned, such
greater Taxes and Rates upon the Occupiers of those Lands where such
Enclosures, or Undressed Ditches or Fences be, as they shall respectively think
fit, having the same Rates allowed by the Sessions of the peace, or the two
next Justices of peace, as aforesaid, which shall be final to the parties.
VIII. That if any Parishioners rated to the mending of Highways as aforesaid,
shall fail to pay to the said Surveyors of Highways his proportion of Tax
rated upon him, by the space of seven days after public notice and warning
given for payment thereof, That then every such Parishioner failing shall pay
double as much as he is rated at in the Tax. IX. That for more effectual

public Nusances out of the same, The Surveyors aforementioned shall yearly at
such convenient times as they shall agree upon, hire such, and so many Laborers
and Workmen, and Carts and Carriages, as they shall think needful for mending
the said Highways, parish-Bridges, and Watercourse, and Streets, and shall
cause them to be fully and perfeccly mended from time to time, and such Workmen
and Owners of Carts and Carriages are hereby required to work accordingly, for
such reasonable Wages, and under such penalty, as any two Justices of peace
within the Division shall think fit. X. That in places where Ditches adjoining
to common Highways, or serving to lead the water from such Highways, are or
shall be undrest or unscoured, or where water does run into or stand in any
such Highways, to the annoyance of it, or where Trees, Bushes, or Hedges,
standing in Highways, or adjoining to High ways, are suffered to grow up, and
to hinder and obscure it from the power of the Sun for drying thereof, The said
Surveyors are hereby empowered in all such respective places to cause such
Ditches to be dressed and scoured, and to stop and divert any such watercourse,
and to turn the water into any adjoining Ditch, or to make new Ditches in
convenient places through the Grounds adjoining, for the most convenient
conveying such water, as also to cut, plash, and keep low all such Trees,
Bushes, and Hedges, as they shall see cause. XI. That the said Surveyors be and
are hereby empowered further to dig for and get Stones, Gravel, Sand, Sinder,
Chalk, or any other material fit for mending High ways in or upon any the wast

had, in and upon any private man's Pasture or fallow Ground where it may be had,
within the Parish, or in any other near adjoining Parish, with convenient way
for sending the same at such seasonable times, and for such reasonable
satisfaction and composition to such private person as the said Surveyors and
Occupiers of such Land shall agree upon, and in case of disagreement betwixt
them, then for such satisfaction as any Justice of Peace near adjoining, not
interessed in such Ground, to be indifferently chosen by the parties, shall set
down and appoint, and such Order as the said Justices of Peace shall set down
shall be final to the parties, without further appeal. XII. That in case where
the said common Highways and streets are or shall be so defective, or shall
extend in so great length in any one Parish as that the parish is overburdened
therewith, and the Rate of twelve-pence in the pound before mentioned will not
suffice to amend and repair the same, the Justices of Peace, at their open
Sessions, are hereby empowered from time to time to rate such other parishes
within the Limits of their Commission, whose Rate for mending Highways
according to the true yearly value of the Land shall not amount to twelve pence
in the pound as aforesaid, as the said Justice shall think fit, till the Rate

such supernumerary Horse Mare, or Ox; And if such penalty be not paid within
seven days after such Distress or seizure, together with full satisfaction for
