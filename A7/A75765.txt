REVEREND Alderman Atkins (The Shit-breech) HIS SPEECH, To Mr. Warner the
venerable Mayor of London, the wise Aldermen, and most judicious
Common Council men, in relation to the present affairs in Kent, Essex, and
Surrey, concerning the Scots Invasion, and His Majesty's Interest.

Published for the honor of my Lord Mayor and Common Council Men.

'Twere pity such a Speech as this should die,
And not outstrip even Eternity:
So that the after-ages may have knowledge,
What reverend Rulers once of Gotham College,
Swayed famous London: Innocent indeed,
For, most of them can neither write nor read.
Fit underlings for Warner to advance,
Who is himself the Prince of ignorance.

Revenend Alderman Atkins (the shit-breech) his Speech.
It was the time when the Rebels at Westminster had unwelcome news brought
them, that the Kentishmenwere in Arms, to the number of ten thousand, that
Essex and Surrey were also preparing to rise, that they sent Commissioners to
M. Mayor of London, to his Brethren the Aldermen and the rest of the Common
Council, to acquaint them that it was high time to look about them, and to
consider of a way to secure themselves, and their Parliament, and for that
purpose to call a Common Hall, which the worshipful Mayor speedily put in
practice; and when the whole rout were met, Alderman Atkins opened his mouth,
and said,

Brethren and Fathers,
IT is well known unto you, neither are the men of the world unacquainted
therewith, that I have ever been a zealous promoter of the blessed Cause; to
consider of a way for the maintenance whereof, we are now happily met, you know
(and the scent of my breeches can yet witness it) that I have stank the wicked
from my company, so that they have been glad to run away each man with his nose
in his hand: I need not tell you the cause of our present convening, for you
very well know that M. Lenthall, even Lenthall the richest Saint amongst us,
who has (that so he might in all things be a pattern unto us) made himself
great friends of the unrighteous Mammon, that so when the Parliament shall be
no more, he may be received into the favor of Foreign Nations: for my own
part you know well, and it is notorious to the world, that I have left nothing
unattempted, that might make me as wealthy as he, or the best here; for at
first you know, I was a Gentleman Usher, and followed my master in -- with as
much dexterity, as a Lady would wish; after I turned Pander, but then to none
but noble and deserving men.

Sir, it is a thriving life to many men,
But I got nothing by it now and then.
A greazie suit, or cloak, in the dying spoiled,
Coarse cloth, in dressing, which French Fullers toiled;
Some small base silver of the second vein,
The Fates in parts, which men keep secret, reign.
Yet then alas it was my chiefest joy,
If that my trading might my teeth employ:
But what is the chiefest thing that does me grieve,
My master, when he should my wants relieve,
As a neglected thing he let me pass,
And sought himself a new two-foated Ass.
And therefore being justly weary of that office, I now betook my self to my
calling which I now labor in, and how I have thrived you all know. But
Gentlemen, I shall now come to the point o'th business, and if my Genius fail
me not, open the case unto you like an Alderman. You my Lord Warner, you that
are Aldermen, and my dear brethren, you my fellow-Citizens and friends,
hearken unto my words.

Our most mighty, most worshipful and most wicked (out and alas how was I
mistaken) I mean our most worthy Parliament are pleased so to esteem of our
known wisdom and valor, however the malignant Cavaliers call us cuckolds,
wittolls, fools and knaves, I say those deserving men at Westminster are
pleased so to rely on our known fidelities, as to put their noble persons into
our protection; and God and his Angels forbid that we should flinch from them
in the time of need, and see their throats cut, and not cut our own and follow
them immediately, that so we may al take our journey to heaven together: for
wot you not what, my dear copartners, I have read of the Hypocrite, as his
name to me signifies, I mean Hippocrates a famous Vrinall man, that he had two
twins conjoined together, which if separated, would both perish, now therefore
I compare, (I beseech you mark the comparison) for you shall not learn this of
every man, yea, though I say it my self, that should not, not of my Lord
Warner here, for all he is so well red in the Servile Arts; and can neither
write nor read, I say, our Parliament and we are so united by a mutual
Antipathy, and there has been such a discontinued friendship betwixt us this
seven years, that now we must resolve to rise together, in case (which Omen God
confirm) that the wicked Cavaliers should get the better on it; and therefore
dear Brethren and fellow-Saints, it nearely concerns us to maintain a firm
and sure discord with our Parliament, for if they should chance to meet in a
Committee, and their noble heads knock one another in counsel on poles over
the Palace Gates, our noddles shall be sure to discourse together on
London Bridge, to the great affliction of our souls, when they shall be
miscarried to the blessed shades of Dis, to prevent the safety whereof we are
now met.

First then we must know that the wicked and godly ones in Kent, have dispersed
themselves together with an intent to turn the Bullocks of the Lord out of
their stables, and to send them a grasing into a lean and withered fat pasture:
mark what proud Pharoahs these are, who dare more then dream of lean kine, they
have for their commander a Lawyer, and a pilgim, so M. Walker that learned
Hebrician, as his Occurrences testify, to wit Sir Gamaliel and Sir Palmer,
aptly interpreted those two Conjurers, the one with his book, the other with
his Jacobs staff, perform more mischief to us, then ever our two
Almanack-marrers, I would say Astrologers, Lilly and Booker have
prognosticated in the behalf of the roaring party. Our first lying still
therefore must be to think nothing, and consider what course we shall leave
off, to assemble those miscreants one from another: For if in time we should
not take some tardy course to unite them, they will ere long come to be so
poor of spirit, as to dare us even at our ^very doors, as the Apprentices did
you of late my Lord Mayor, when your Lordship was forced to take the Tower over
your head, and to converse with wild beasts, such as Lilburne and the Lions; my
counsel is therefore that we give speedy orders, that the Auxiliaries disarme
themselves, and go armed cap a pe, without sword or Muskets, and fight against
our loving enemies of Kent, under the Command of our most ignoble General Sir
Thomas Swarthie, who (the more's our good fortune) was lately beaten soundly at
Rochester, and returned home in triumphant manner, having augmented his Army to
the loss of one thousand men.

In the second place we are to consider of a way how to multiply and suppress
the tumults in Essex and Surrey, and now I speak of Surrey, verily I cannot
but weep tears of joy to think how lovingly and inhumanely the Petitioners of
that Country were embraced, and kissed by our Parliament, and what vexes and
settles my mind most is that the Soldiers under the command of the high
descended obscure fellow Barkstead, should cut the throats of sixteen of those
poor rich men privately and throw them into a Jakes, which act of theirs for
my part, (for I would have you think that I am not destitute, or possessed of a
spirit of Revelation any more then you my Lord, or any of my Brethren) but can
smell a plot as well as another, I say, for my part I look upon those honest
murderers as mere Saints and Reprobates who laid those men a pickling so
near the House where our Parliament sit, on purpose to stench them out thence,
and so are verily desperate Plotters and Enemies to our low and mighty States:
but for the Essexian silent bleaters, I cannot tell what to say unto them, yea
and nay I am in a Quandarie, as the learned have it, for if you will (for I
have read the Poyets) as our modern Chawcer says, at Dulcarnan, or the
beginning of my wits, it would be strange unto, if while I am silent of those
Calves, I should speak Bulls. But thus far I will hold my peace, and no longer.

I say, that for those of Essex, we had better not to trouble our selves to
suppress them, since we have found these many years to come, how unfirmly and
steadfastly they have fought against us, for the maintenance of the cause, but
to send our Trained Bands with all convenient delay amongst them, who may
thrust their swords home into their bellies, and so appease them without
bloodshed.

The third thing that we are negligently to take into our serious
consideration, is the opening a passage to our Brethren of Scotland, to the end
they may be hindered from coming on this side Twede, which I confess to be a
task very easy and intricate. My counsel therefore is this, that we send
them a sufficient number of empty barrells stuffed with beef, as many hogsheads,
each having a hundred holes in them, filled with beer, which will so employ
them, that for one month we need not fear they will lie still, and so invade
us. And verily brethren, to speak my conscience (and yet to hold my tongue,
that I be not trapt) I am an utter friend to the Scots, and their well molded
mouldring Presbytery: for the truth is, I shall never endure to give account
of my actions to Cobblers or Weavers, be they Gentlemen never so well descended;
yea though they keep open house, and be as unhospitable as Monkeries, I would
have said Monasteries. And moreover, I shall never abide to stand in the stool
of repentance, though it be my discomfort and chief solace, that they will
never mount me there, out of sure confidence and distrustful belief, that I
will be no more favorable or discourteous to their stool, then I was once to
my own breeches. But to conclude this point; and since it must be so, that I am
commanded to be silent in this business, my counsel is this, that so soon as
Kalendas Graecas shall be past, the very time that I am uncertainly persuaded
the Kentishmen with those of Essex, and Surrey, will all be disquieted and
appeased, our Fairfac't General with his whole Army be disbanded, and then
march backward against the Scots.

In the last place we are to be inconsiderate in ouur counsels and
consultations, how we disagree about the person of the King, you know brethren
that he is our King, and no more then our King, or if you please not so much as
our King, which is the sense of the dishonorable Houses; you all know that he
is a man and no more then a man, or if you will not so much as a man, which is
the sense (as I take it) of this worshipful Court* Now the business we are to
eat upon is, whether or know we shall have a King, if a King, whether or no he
shall be King, if he be not King, who shall be King? Mark the affinition I
beseech you, for my own part, and I hope you are all so ingenious and unwise,
as not to conster me rightly, I look beside him as a man free, and altogether
besmeared with blood, the blood of Saints, most impure and unholy men, and
therefore I judge him altogether meet and unworthy to be ours and our
Parliaments Anointed, and I hold it convenient to re-inthrone him, and with
all speed to unking him; but then the question will be, whether we shall have a
King or no? to which I silently reply, giving my judgment, it will be very
disprofitable and commodious, for us to have no King at all, but to be King our
selves, and jointly to reign with our most irreligious and pious States: but
if that shall not seem good in your ears, for one may see further into a
millstone then another, I answer, that our most pusillan^mous and heroic
General, Sir Thomas Lackwit, or our Lievtenant-Generall the most timorous and
undaunted Oliver, whose nose bespeaks him a King, were very unfit for our
election; this my counsel if it find disregard, and affection from you, I
shall think I have done my self and this Court exceeding dishonor, our
Parliament most unacceptable service, and this City most ungrateful duty, if I
have spoken like a wise Citizen and an Alderman.

Let us shake hands, and then each other cuffe
Then like our Statesmen play at blind man's buffe.
FINIS.
