AN ENDEAVOVR OF Making the Principles of Christian Religion, namely the Creed,
the ten Commandments, the LORDS Prayer, and the Sacraments, plain and easy:
Tending to the more speedy instruction of the meanest capacities, and weakest
memories. And for the making trial also of their understandings, who though
they have attained some measure of saving knowledge, yet through the weakness
of their abilities cannot express even that which they do conceive.

The third Impression.

The Preface is specially to be heeded.

Hos. 4. ver. 6. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.

John 17. ver. 3. This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and
him whom thou have sent, Jesus Christ.

LONDON: Printed for Thomas Underhill at the Bible in Woodstreete. 1644.

A Direction to the Christian Reader, concerning the reason and use of this way
of Questions and Answers.
CHristian Reader, Thou have here an endeavor of making the Principles of our
Christian Religion plain and familiar, even to very weak capacities, and easy
to be remembered, even by very weak memories.

How fit it is to perform this, though thy own expe^^ce will best inform thee,
if thou be pleased to make trial of it toward any thou have care of, yet thou
may partly conceive, if thou will take along with thee the reason of the
composition of it in this form, and the drift aimed at by the Author, which
will also direct thee to make right use of it.

Whereas thou can not but observe at the first I
view, both a double sort of Answers and a double sort of questions; That is
done, because the Author conceives that neither sort alone will suffice to drop
in knowledge into narrow mouthed vessels, for whose sake this labor has been
undertaken. Experience has taught him this, and he is willing to teach it thee
better cheap.

For the Answers (to speak of them first) observe in II
them first their brevity: secondly, their compleatnesse: thirdly, their (...)
1. One sort of them are undeniably as breef as may be; only Yes, or No: and yet
even they will be of good use for instruction, but especially for trial. 2. Of
the other sort also special ^are has been had, to make them all as short as
may be (considering their compleatnesse) that the weakest memory may not justly
complain of burden.

2. Then for the compleatnesse of these Answers, take notice, 1. That they are
all framed into entire sentences of themselves, without depending for their
sense upon the f^regoing questions. Hereby the learner shall have a stock of
Divine Truth in his head, even though he should forget the questions. And
withal, this may help to prevent a common error observable in diverse learners;
who when the sense is shared between the question and the Answer (as for
brevities sake it is usual) forgetting the question, often give the Answer,
which they have learned by rote, to a wrong question, to the great confounding
of their understandings: which cannot so easily be here, where the Answer
carries ever a full sense in it self; besides that for the most part it
repeats part of the question. 2. These answers, though suiting directly to the
first or head-question of every division, yet also agree fully to every one of
the under-questions, by joining but the brief Answer yes, or no, which is
placed at the end of the question, and making it the beginning of the larger
answer.

3 These answers are also remarkable easy, by reason that there is not a word
in any of them, but has been before in some of the Questions of that division.
And so after the learner is but little used to them, he will soon get the
answer; as having it altogether or in parcels, put into his mouth before in the
Questions, and after he has once learned them, he will the easier both
understand and remember them upon the rehearsal of the questions again, or
even of some of them. III.


Now concerning the Questions. First, as there is 1
ever more then one Question belonging to the same division and full answer; so
ordinarily and as often as could be with convenience, the first question is
general, and therefore printed in a different Character, as the answers also
are: And then the following questions are sub-divisions of that into more
particulars, so to help to make the meaning of it more plain. Secondly, 2
where ever the nature of the general question would fairly bear it, and that
it could be without multiplying too many questions under one head, the
under-questions are by way of disjunction one cross to the other, Is it so? or
so? directing to own the truth by answering Yes, and deny the falsehood or
falsehoods (for oftentime they are more then one) by saying No. Yet now and then
it could not well be avoided but they must be all of one sort, and so the brief
answers of that division, all Yes, or all No. But these are but few if compared
with the rest. Thirdly to every question 3
there is a proper answer fitted. To the head-question the larger answer suits
fully; to the rest, the brief, Yes, or No over against it, besides the light it
has from the larger answer, as was noted before. So that in teaching or
examining any one question may be asked alone, or at the most borrowing but a
word or two out of the foregoing question (which is sometimes left out to spare
the trouble of repeating too often the same common and plain words) and even
the answering so any one question of a division (if done with understanding and
discretion) will be clearly so much progress in the knowledge of divine and
saving truth, and lead on fairly to more. Fourthly, the total 4
number of the head questions and larger answers amounts not to any great
proportion, and so will be the sooner learned and easilyer remembered: and the
under-questions and brief answers, though making the volume swell, yet diminish
the difficulty both of understanding and memory: and by the advantage of them,
the author hopes that nothing necessary to be known by way of foundation or
principle is omitted, or left without some clearing.

After all, the method and way of teaching these IV
questions and answers to young beginners may be this: First, read over to them
all the questions of a division 1
together, without expecting any answer at all from them at the first.
Secondly, then go over the severals, 2
and see what answer they can now make to the headquestion by having heard the
under-questions, containing among them the full answer. Thirdly, if they 3
cannot do this, then try whether they can discern the truth from falsehood,
by answering yes or no to the under-questions severally. 4. if this yet be too 4
much for them, then reach them those brief answers in order. 5. being perfect
in the brief answers of 5
that division (and not before) teach them the larger answer. 6. In examining
when they have once learned 6
all the answers of a division, ask the head-question twice, namely first and
last, that so the larger answer may ever be made to the Head-question, and so
proceed to another question in due season.

Now the God of all wisdom and grace, who has graciously promised, that under
the kingdom of Christ the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the
^^ord, ^s the waters cover Esaias 12. 9 Esaias 54. 13.
the sea, and particularly that all our children shall be taught of him: von
^safe for Jesus Christ's sake, and through him our great Prophet his blessing,
as upon all other means used by any, so upon these weak endeavors of his (...)
thiest servant, that by them, thou (whoever thou art) that think good to
attempt the making use of them, may for thy solfe and thine, si^de some help
toward the more easy overcoming the conceited inseparable difficulty of making
those that are not book learned (as the phrase is) attain to any measure of
understanding in matters of Religion, so as both thou and they may be both the
more willing and able to teach and to learn, until we all com^ to the blessed
persection promised, Ier. 31. 34 Heb. 8. 11
when there shall be no more need of teaching every man hi, neighbor, and
every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord, because all shall know him from
the least to the greatest: coming all in the unity of (...), and of the
knowledge Ephesians. 4. 43.
of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the
fullness of Christ.

I end with a double suit to thee-One, that according to thy knowledge, thou be
careful to walk humbly, holidy and justly: The other, that receiving any good
by this little work, thou pay the Author (though unknown to thee) by affording
him a share in thy prayers: in which latter he promises again to requite thee
whether known or unknown; as being ever

26. 2^. Is that true when it is only for some sins ^ and not for all known
sins? No. Or, When a man turns from his former sins, and willingly falls to new
ones? No. Or, May not a man be sure of his repentance if he be sure he does
