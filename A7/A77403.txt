A Brief ANSWER TO A BOOK ENTITLED, HIS MAJESTY'S LETTER AND DECLARATION TO
THE SHERIFFS and CITY OF LONDON.

Jan. 30th LONDON, Printed in the year, 1642.

An Answer to His Majesty's Letter and Declaration to the Sheriffs and City of
London.
First, We were glad to find that there was yet some hopes they would look to
the peace and happiness of that City, and at last sever themselves from any
faction or dependence which might insensibly involve them in those Calamities
they did not foresee. It Is the nature of Mortals (but the cause I know not) to
rest secure in his own thoughts, when in the opinion of others he is subject to
the greatest casualties; nay, so averse are they, that when reason cannot
promise a happy success to their bad attempts, they make it a matter of faith,
and believe that for an absolute certainty, which in it self i^ less than
probable: I wish this disease may never steal into the Royal, but if His
words be scanned, 'twill breed a jealousy of His inclination to that
distemper; for if He were not, how could He imagine that the City of London,
should now after so many desperate designs be insensible of the miseries that
will ensue the Conquest, if obtained by their Adversaries? surely they about
His Majesty have not that power over His Rational faculties, as to possess
Him with a thought of Divinity inhaerent in them, as if their ways were like
Gods, past finding out; Or if His Majesty do but weigh the several accidents
and passages that have happened since these differences, He will find no
promise from God of the Victory; nay, I am confident His tender Heart cannot
be free from some fears, seconded with pregnant reasons, wh^r^on He may ground
a belief of His loss; and for any thing that He has yet gotten, the City may
continue as zealous for the Parliament as ever they were; and with no less
safety than their diligence has hitherto with Gods assistance purchased for
them.

Secondly, With that Answer of ours we sent a Servant of Our own to require and
see that it might be communicated to the whole body of that Our City; but
instead of that admission we expected to Our Messenger, Guards of armed men
have been brought to keep Our good Subjects from being present at the reading
thereof. What hopes is there of doing good, when His Majesty does so confide in
those ill instruments about Him? who but the Messenger himself could make that
false Report? were there at any time this twenty years more present at a
Common Council, than at that? or did they keep out any that had right by
custom to be then present; and for those that had no right, His Majesty
Himself does implicit acknowledge how justly they were kept out; for He says
in this His Letter and Declartion to the Sheriffs, That Speeches were made by
strangers, who were admitted the City Counsels contrary to the freedom and
Custom of those meetings: now if those that made speeches had no right to be
there, and those that were kept out by the Guard, had as little right as they;
then His Majesty does implicitly commend the keeping of those out; and yet in
another place of that Declaration He blames them for keeping them out; and for
the entertainment of His Servant that brought the Message, what greater respect
could be showed him, than the admittance of his presence, and what fairer play
can there be, than that above board; the Messenger himself being made a
witness of that days work.

Thirdly, That all Our good Subjects may clearly understand how far We have
been from begetting, how far We are from continuing and from nourishing
these unnatural civil dissentions, and how much it is in their own power to
remove the present pressures, and to establ sh the future happiness and glory
of that famous City.

It Is most certain and believed of all, that His Majesty did not beget these
distractions; but it is known by whom they have been maintained since their
birth; I mean, by whose authority, though his Warrants (as is probable) have
bin used about that which was never intended at his granting of them: and it is
clearly to be discerned, how easily they may remove the present pressures, and
it is as clearly to be discerned how if they take that way prescribed to them to
remove their present miseries, they will bring greater miseries in their stead,
and greatest of all to their posterity: for the way prescribed is in effect
this, that the City should first apprehend an inability to make resistance, and
then yield themselves to the cruel mercy of those who have so far possessed
His Majesty; and that they should apprehend the Parliament men, and other good
Commonwealths men, as fast as the King accused them, till at last there would
be none left to defend the Kingdom: now if this were done, the War would
doubtless cease, and these present pressures would be removed; not taken away,
but drawn into greater mischiefs that would follow, so that then the cure
were worse then the disease, for by this kind of physic you may tamper with
the body to cure a Fever that is spotted, and turn it to the plague.

Fourthly, We do hereby Declare the said Isaac Pennington not to be Major of
that Our City of London, and to have no lawful Authority to exercise the same,
and that Our good Subjects of that Our City ought not to submit to any Orders,
Directions, or Commands, which shall issue from him as Lord Major.] Here his
Majesty has excused the Lord Major, for not sending a Warrant to apprehend him
that said he hoped to wash his hands in His Majesty's blood; it seems he has
no Authority to do it: But I rather hope His Majesty was misinformed, for
those words if they were spoken by any man, might well have been questioned by
the same authority that other things were done by; but it is likely that those
which informed his Majesty of that, either knew more then my Lord Major did in
that particular, or else wilfully injured my Lord by his false Report; but
hour if some Ceremonies were not performed which used to be sollemnized, nay
though he had not been chosen by the City, yet he has authority from the
Parliament for what he does, and which is sufficient to force an obedience from
those within his Liberties: but it is most likely that he was chosen by the major
part, for if the City did trust him with the government of their estates in the
Parliament House, surely they would trust him with their Charter and to govern
the City, and Alderman Cordwell was known before as well as now, and why had
they not chose him to sit in Parliament before Alderman Pennington if he had
been better beloved, or if the City had been so opinionated of him: but it is
probable that many are offended because this Lord Major was chosen before
others that were his Senio^ Ald:, but for those that are offended they must
needs know it is without cause; and so they may guess how they shall be pleased,
for the Office of Major goes not in order but by election, for otherwise the
City might be enforced to have a Major that might undo the City, but it has
been the care of former ages (as I may say) to provide better for this City.

FINIS.
