A CENTURY OF SELECT HYMNS. Collected out of Scripture. All to be sung in five
or six Tunes commonly known and practiced. By W. B. Minister of the Gospel at
Martins in Leicester.

Paul's Churchyard, and Francis Tyton at the three daggers near the Temple in
Fleetstreet 1659.

Justin Martyr of the use and Excellency of spiritual Songs in the Church. In
his 107. Answer to the Orthodox.
IT moves the mind, and makes affection strong
To that which is so taking in the SONG.
The fleshly motions are by it suppressed,
And vicious thoughts which foes unseen suggest.
The mind it moystens (as a fruitful field)
Abundance of Divine good things to yield.
It makes Religious men (such power it brings)
Champions for patience in all adverse things.
It cures the godly man of worldly cares,
It is the spirits sword, as PAUL declares,
Which acts and arms a Christian soldier so
That he may grapple with his Ghostly foe;
For it is the Word of God, which while revolved
And sung aloud: The Devils are dissolved,
And driven away: yea, it has power so great
The mind to perfect, and to make complete
With Christian virtues, while (in sacred throngs)
The Saints set on with these spiritual songs.

To the Right Honorable the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, etc.
May it please your Honors,
IT appears plainly by Justin Martyr, Tertullian, and many others, That the
ancient Churches used not only David's Psalms, but other portions of
Scripture, chosen ad libitum, to be put in Song for their Edification.

Yet it does not appear so plainly, that they used Psalms Apocryphal or
Unscriptural in Primitive times; but rather that such by corruption crept in.
Eu ebius reporting of Paulu^ San osetanus (the gr^nd Heretic) that he
countenanced such Songs in the Church, as would make a man's hair stand staring
on his head to hear, and we find among the Papists sundry Hymns savouring of
horrid blasphemy, and shameful superstition; Neither are our own altogether
allowable, for that which is called the complaint of a sinner (next before the
Psalms) is very non-sensical, and in that after veni Creator, the Author
says, that in the glorified body of our Savior in heaven, the wounds are yet
to be seen. Now such inconveniences as these would not so easily occur, if we
kept our selves to Scripture expressions: And what other does the Apostle
admit, when he says, Col. 3. 16. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly,
etc. Surely Apocryphal Hymns are not the Word of Christ. We see Justin Martyr
(if that work be his) speaking of this, says, (...). It is the Word of God,
Omitting, therefore all unscriptural hymns (which many great Councels did forbid
and condemn) I have here composed an hundred Hymns out of express Scriptures,
not injured I hope in their conjunction, but may say with Divine Herbert.

This verse marks that, and both do make a motion
Unto a third, that ten leaves of does lie,
Then, as dispersed herbs do watch a potion
These three make up a Christians destiny.
Herberts Church. of H. Scriptures.
These Hymns are plainer then Psalms and more suitable to our condition, and
more pertinent to Cospel occasions: such as wherein Christians may truly say,
that they do teach and admonish one another. Such as inculcate our duties, and
reprove our vices out of the most piercing pas^ages of holy Scriptures; such as
may answer all Sermons, and accommodate all occurrences, and may competently
serve instead of Psalms, till a better translation then the old comes in.
Finally, they are such as do excellently instruct a Christian unto prayer, and
Minister both hints and helps abundantly.

To Dedicate these to your Honors is as necessary, as well-beseeming, both to
give you account, and crave your countenance in so great a business, which is
no innovation or induction, but a reduction to primitive use and order; And
humbly prays for this encouragement to be recommended or allowed to be sung in
public and private Congregations. Now the God of mercy that has withdrawn the
cloud of interruption, Give you the spirit of reformation, that your authority
may be universally owned, honored, and obeyed, prayed for to God by us, and
God praised for it as a singular blessing to this Nation, under which we may
lead peaceable and quiet lives in all godliness and honesty, in persuasion
whereof I rest,

Your Honors most devoted servant for Jesus sake. William Barton.

To the Reverend and Religious Ministers of England, especially in and about
the City of London.
Reverend Brethren,
TO you also do I cheerfully render an account of my labors, since at the
request, and with the good liking of some of you, I composed some Hymns,
(published heretofore) and sundry others now. Wherefore I intend no further
Apology then what is tendered in the preceding Epistle to the Parliament, and if
more be necessary, I hope I may reasonably expect it from you in behalf of the
Work.

I have not much meddled with the Lamentations (though a book Poetical) in
regard the like subject is so fre^uent in the Psalms, neither with the
Canticles (not only because they are done, ^oth in plain way and paraphrase,
by other hands, but because of the difficulty of the sense; I think best to
gloss upon that Text of Cant. 5. 10. By the expression of 2 Cor. 5. ult. And
of that fruit spoken of, Cant. 2. 3. I add this gloss.

The Word and Sacrament.

Not that I want occasion to steak of His Odors sweet of scent, or some such
out of the letter of the Text, but for the occasion for which I chose it, as
being virtually implied, and applied fittingly.

Indeed I would gladly annex to these Hymns some select places, and whole
Psalms touching the most spiritual and concernable matters of praise and
public worship, Exhortation, and Consolation, that thereby I might again bring
in those frequent Metres which some of you say I have left out (to your loss
and mine own) in the last Edition, and which you do prefer (and I think justly)
to those that are put in.

To what end therefore should I comply any further with the old, which, being
altered no more then needs must, would be like an old garment with a new pi^ce,
and would put the people to as much cost as a new Translation, much nearer to
the Text, much easier to be sung, and got without book. The best way, as I
conceive, is to collect a Semicentury of choice Hymns (which out of my store I
can easily afford) and make no other addition to the last translation then you
shall think necessary. So shall you find (among the Psalms or Hymns) all the
frequent Metres that are not harsh, the 119. Psalm all of a piece, the short
Psalms (and here and there a longer) rendered in duplicates. The whole might be
reduced to six s^eets Nump^il; whereof the Hymns would (with the Psalme-Hymns
added) make up two.

Te Deum is an exquisite Hymn, harping all along upon Scripture, and in my
Translation exemplified with Scriptureproofs, done at the request of one of
you, but there is no room for printing either it or any Psalm-Hymns, till the
next impression. And that with your concurrence and the Company of Stationers,
lest any should suspect the prejudicing of their interest. Thus desiring to
answer your desires in all things to edification. I rest

Your ready servant for Jesus sake William Barton.

HYMN I. ACCLAMATION of PRAISE for Babylons FALL.
Rev. 14. 8. 16. 5,
NOw Babylon is fallen and sunk,
that City great in state:
Because she made the Nations drunk
with wine adulterate.
And thou, O Lord, a^t righteous,
who art, and always wast,
And art to come most glorious,
for judging as thou have.
6, 7.
For thy Saints blood hangs on their seore,
thy Prophets blood they shed:
And blood to drink thou gave them store,
as they have merited.
Even so Lord God omnipotent,
we gladly do confess,
Thy judgments are most emin^nt
^or truth and righteousness.
19. 3, 1, 7.
Now Allelujah sing aloud,
salvation, glory, fame
Be given to the Lord our God,
and honor to his Name.
Be glad in God (for this just doom)
rejoice and honor him:
The Marriage of the Lamb is come,
^is Wife has made her trim.
H. 2. ALLELVJAH for the same. Give laud, etc.
Rev. 19. 5, 6,
PRaise to our God proclaim,
O ye his Servants all:
And ye that fear his Name,
together, great and small.
Allelu-jah,
For God supreme with power does reign,
and bears the sway.
9, 1,
O they be ever blessed
that shall be called unto
The Lambs great Marriage Feast,
these are Gods words most true:
Allelu-jah,
Strength, glory, power and fame to our
Lord God always.
2.
For thou have poured forth
thy wrath on that great whore,
That did corrupt the earth
with all her acts impure:
And have, this day,
Avenged the flood of thy Saints blood,
Allelu-jah.
11. 15.
The Kingdoms of this world
are every one become
The Kingdoms of our Lord,
and of his Christ (his Son)
And he, always,
Shall reign on high, with Majesty,
Allelu-jah.
H. 3. ALMS-DEEDS.
Isa. 32. 8. Psalm. 112. 9.
THe Just devises liberal things,
and by such things shall stand:
He has dispersed his Charity,
and with a liberal hand.
With honor and with dignity
his horn shall sure be raised:
And these his Deeds of piety
for ever shall be praised.
2 Cor. 9. 6. Ecc. 11. 1.
For he that sows liberally
shall gather many a heap:
And he that sows sparingly
but sparingly shall reap.
Then, on the waters cast thy bread,
it shall not be in vain:
For, when long time's accomplished,
it shall be found again.
Prove. 19. 17.
For he that gives to the poor
does lend unto the Lord,
And, trusting him, he shall be sure
to have it all restored.
H. 4. The Blessed DEATH.
Rev. 14. 13.
BLessed, O blessed are the dead
that in the Lord do die:
Thus has the Spirit witnessed,
and most assuredly.
For from their royles that were extreme,
they are in quiet rest:
Their works likewise do follow them,
to be their true attest.
Isa. 57. 2.
Thus shall they enter into Peace,
and quiet rest possess,
In blessed beds, each one of these
that walk in uprightness.
H. 5. BLESSINGS of OBEDIENCE.
Prove. 3. 1, 2, 3,
MY Son keep my Commandments,
forget not my decree,
For length of days, long life, and peace
shall these things add to thee.
Then let not truth and mercy kind
forsake thee and depart:
About thy neck my Precepts bind,
and write them in thy heart.
4. chapter 2. 5, 6,
So shall thou find a good respect
and understanding, then,
Approved in the sight of God,
and in the sight of men.
Then shall thou understand and know
his wisdom and his fear:
For from his mouth does wisdom slow,
and he gives knowledge clear.
10, 11, 9
When wisdom enters in thy heart,
and is thy souls delight,
Discretion shall preserve thee then,
and knowledge keep thee right.
Then righteousness shall readily
by thee be understood:
Judgment like wise and equity,
and every path that is good.
Mat. 25. 29. Prove. 4. 18.
For unto every one that has,
there shall be given more:
And he shall have abundant grace
still to increase his store.
For like unto the shining light,
is every good man's way,
Which more and more shines clear and bright,
unto the perfect day.
2 PART.
Deuteronomy. 28. 1, 2, 3, 4.
If thou shall hearken diligently
to all that God commands
The Lord thy God shall set thee high
above all other Lands.
And all these blessings shall come on,
and overtake thee soon:
The blessings of the Town, and Field,
and blessings of the Womb.
5, 6, 27.
The Lord shall bless thee mightily,
with fruits upon thy ground:
Thy Flocks of sheep shall multiply,
thy Cattle shall abound.
The Lord shall take away from thee
all sickness and disease,
And lay upon thee no such Plague
as did on Egypt seize.
7, 12,
The Lord shall smite thine enemies
that rise up, in thy sight,
One way against thee shall they rise,
and seven ways take their flight.
The Lord shall make the Heavens give rain
in season on thy Land:
And prosper thee in all the works
which thou shall take in hand.
9, 1 Samuel 15. 22.
The Lord shall then establish thee
a people of his praise:
If thou shall keep to his decree,
and walk in all his ways.
For better is Obedience
then Bullocks Goats and Lambs,
And hearkening to the will of God,
then all the fat o^ Rams.
H. 6. Blessed QVALIFICATIONS.
Mat. 5. 3, to the 10.
BBlessed, O blessed are the poor,
the poor, I say, in spirit:
For they shall have the Kingdom, sure,
of Heaven, to inherit.
And blessed they that mourn, and weep,
for they shall meet with mirth:
And blessed also are the meek,
for theirs is all the earth.
Blessed are they that hunger much,
and thirst for righteousness,
For God shall satisfy all such,
with comforts that refresh.
And blessed are the merciful,
for God will show them grace:
And blessed are the pure in soul,
for they shall see his face.
Blessed are they that strive for peace,
to make men to accord:
For we must call all such as these
the Children of the Lord.
And blessed are the sufferers
for love of righteousness:
Because a Kingdom shall be theirs
in heaven to possess.
H. 7. CALL out of Babylon. Have mercy, etc.
Rev. 18. 4, to the 8.
COme out of Babylon,
my people, at my Call:
Lest, for her sake, ye should partake
her sins and plagues withal.
Because her sins have reached
unto the Heavens high:
And God does find, and call to mind
all her iniquity.
Reward her to the ^ull,
as she rewarded you:
And fill her cup twice double up,
as she was wont to do.
Look how much she has been
a proud Luxurious Liver,
So much inflict her torments strict,
and so much sorrow give her.
For thus within her heart,
I sit a Queen, says she:
No desolate poor widows state,
nor sorrow shall I see.
And therefore shall her plagues
come on her in one day:
Famine, and death, and mournful breath
to make her pine away.
And she shall utterly
be burnt with fire at length,
For God the Lord, that does reward,
and judge her has such strength.
H. 8. Charities QVALIFICATIONS.
1 Cor. 13. 4, 5.
LOng-suffering is charity,
and most exceeding kind:
It envies not, nor vaunts it self,
nor is pust up in mind.
Does not unseemly bear it self,
it seeks not her own:
Is not provoked easily,
and evil it thinks none.
6, 7, 8.
It joys not in iniquity,
but in the truth takes joy:
Beheves, and bears, indures, and hopes.
in all things patiently.
And charity fails not at all,
but Prophesies shall fail:
And tongues shall cease, and knowledge sade,
but love shall still prevail.
13.
And now do Faith and Hope abide,
and Charity, these three:
But that which is most magnified.
is Love and Charity.
H. 9. CHASTISEMENT,
Heb. 12. 5, 6.
THe castigation of thy God,
my Son, do not despise:
And when rebuked by his rod,
faint not in any wise.
For whom he loves he never leaves
without chastisement fit:
And every Son whom he receives
must to his scourge submit.
7, 8.
By his chastisement if ye bleed,
Sonne-like you have your lot:
For what Son is there whom, indeed,
the Father chastneth not.
But if ye no chastisement bear,
which all partake of here:
Then Bastards verily ye are,
and not his children dear.
11.
And now, indeed, no chastening
does, for the present, seem
A joyous, but a grievous thing,
as usually we deem.
But afterward it, nere' ^helesse,
does yield us eviden^ly,
The peaceful fruits of righteousness,
when exercised thereby.
H. 10. CHRIST his BENEFITS.
Ephesians. 1. 3. 1 Cor. 1. 30.
BLessed be God, that, of his grace,
has us so richly stored,
With spiritual gifts in heavenly place,
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
Made to us wisdom, righteousness,
and sanctifying grace,
Redemption, also, to possess
the purchased heavenly place.
2 Co. 5. 21. Ioh. 14 6. Ephesians. 2. 18.
Made also to be sin for us,
who from all sin was free:
Tha^ we the perfect righteousness
of God, in Christ, might be.
The way, the truth, and life he is,
and thorough him alone
We, by one Spirit, have access
unto the holy One.
Col. 3. 11.
Where there is neither Greek nor Jew
nor sex of great or small,
Barbarian, Scythian, bond or free,
but Christ is all in all.
2 PART.
Romans 8. 1, 2,
There is no condemnation now
to them that are in Christ:
Who by the Spirit walk with God,
not as by flesh enticed.
Because the Law of Spirit and life,
which is in Christ our Lord,
Has made us free from force of sin,
and us from death restored.
3. Gal. 4. 4. 1 Pet. 1. 8.
For when the Law was weak through flesh,
and had not strength to save,
God sent his Son of Virgin-seed,
and him to us he gave:
Whom having never seen we love,
and through belief (no less)
Rejoice with joy unspeakable,
and full of gloriousness.
Jude 25. Rev. 4. 13.
God only wise our Savior,
that on the throne does sit,
Have honor, glory, praise, and power,
for ever, so be it.
H. 11. CHRIST'S COMMISSION.
Mat. 10. 1, 8.
Whenas our Lord had called his twelve,
he gave them power at large
Against all Devils, and disease;
and thus he gave them charge:
Go heal the sick, the Leapers cleanse,
the dead men cause to live:
Cast Devils out, your grant is free,
and therefore freely give.
14, 15, 16,
Whosoever receives or hears you not,
it shall be farrmore ease
For Sodom, and Gomorha's land,
at judgment, then for these.
Behold, as sheep in midst of Wolves,
I send you forth, says he:
The Serpents wisdom therefore use,
and Doves simplicity.
2 PART.
Mat. 28. 18, 19,
Behold, all power is given me
in heaven, and in earth:
Go therefore into all the world,
and set my Doctrine forth.
Baptize them in the Fathers Name,
in every land and coast,
And in the Name of God the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost.
20. Rev. 19. 16. Gal. 1. 5.
And teach them to observe and do
what ever I Command:
And I, behold, am now with you,
and while the world does stand.
To Christ the King of Kings, therefore,
and Lord of Lords most high,
Be praise, and glory evermore
to all eternity.
H. 12. COMMUNION of SAINTS.
Heb: 12. 22, 23,
NOw are we come to Sion Mount,
the City of abode,
The heavenly Jerusalem,
where dwells the living God.
To Hosts of Angels numberless,
and to the Assembly met.
The general Church of Gods first born,
whose Names in Heaven are set.
24. Mat. 25. 32.
And unto God the judge of all
(on whom the world must wait)
And to the spirits of all just men,
made perfect in that state.
To Jesus Christ our Advocate
in Gods new Covenant Court:
Whose sprinkled blood speaks better things
then Abel's did report.
Rev. 5. 13.
Blessing, and glory, and renown,
then give we, altogether,
To him that on the Throne sits down,
and to the Lamb for ever.
H. 13. CONFESSION of CHRIST.
Mat. 10. 32. Romans 10. 10.
HIm that confesses me to men,
will I, says Christ, record*
And will acknowledge him again:
before my heavenly Lord.
For man believes to righteousness,
with humble heart alone:
And with the tongue does man confess
unto salvation.
1 Timothy 3. 16.
This Mystery of Godliness
is very great and high:
God manifested in the flesh,
the spirit did justify.
The blessed Angels saw his face,
the Gentiles heard his story:
Believed on in the world he was,
and taken up to glory.
H. 14. CONFESSION of SIN. All people, etc.
Hab. 1. 13. Dan. 9. 6.
O Lord that art of purer eye
then to behold iniquity:
We all have sinned, we confess,
we have committed wickedness.
Isa. 59. 12. Ezr. 9. 6.
Our trespasses against us show,
our sins we cannot choose but know:
For they are swolln above our head,
and are unto the heavens spread.
Luke 15. 18.
O Father we have grievously,
offended thee that dwell on high:
Unworthy, to be owned therefore,
as thy dear children any more.
Ezra 9. 13. Ezekiel. 18. 32.
Yet have thou never punished sin
So much as our deserts have been:
Nor is the death of him that dies
a matter pleasing in thine eyes.
Neh. 9. 27. Ezekiel. 13. 32.
For thou art unto anger slow,
and do with grace and mercy flow,
Thou art most ready to forgive,
therefore let us return and live.
H. 15. CONFIDENCE in GOD O Lord consider, etc.
Haba. 3. 17, 18.
ALthough the figtree shall not spring,
although the Vine no grape shall yield,
The Olive fail her fruit to bring,
nor any meat be in the field.

no beast can in the stalles be had:
Yet in the Lord my Joys shall hold,
in God my Savior i will be glad.
H. 16. The CONQUEST. All people, etc.
Deuteronomy. 33. 26, to the end.
THere is not one ('it is truly said)
like Jeshuruns, great God on high:
Who rides on heaven for thy aid,
with excellency on the sky.
The eternal God thy refuge is,
his everlasting arms thy stay:
He will thrust out thine enemies
before thee, saying, Kill, and slay.
Then Israel shall dwell safe, unmixt,
And on a Land of Corn and Wine;
There Jacob's fountain shall be sixth,
the heavens dropping on his Vine.
O happy Israel, we record,
whom like to thee does God advance,
O people saved by the Lord,
the shield of thy deliverance?
Thy excellency's Sword is he,
and all these enemies of ours
Shall be found liars unto thee,
and thou shall tread on their high towers.
H. 17. CONSCIENCE.
2 Timothy 1. 5. Prove. 4 23. Act. 24. 16.
THe end of all the Law is Love,
out of an heart unstained:
A conscience that we can approve,
and out of Faith unfeigned.
Keep, then, your heart with diligence
with all the care you can:
A conscience void of all offense
both toward God and man.
Heb. 10. 22. 2 Co. 1. 12. 1 John 3. 21.
And so draw near with upright heart,
with Faith both full and sure,
Our conscience cleans'd, our bodies washed,
with Baptism-water pure.
And our rejoicing shall be this,
our consciences attest:
For if our hearts condemn us not,
on God we boldly rest.
H. 18. CONTENTATION.
Prove. 30. 8, 9.
LOrd give me neither poverty,
nor too abundant store:
Give me to live conveniently,
and I desire no more.
Not riches Lord, nor too much weal,
lest pride should be my bane,
Not poverty, lest I should steal,
and take Gods Name in vain.
Phil. 4. 11, 12. Heb. 13. 5.
And teach me if my state be s^ant;
or if I fullness find,
To know how to abound, or want,
with a contented mind.
And let my conversation still
be void of Covetousness:
For God has said, I never will
forsake thee, in distress.
H. 19. COVENANT-GRACE. Give la^d, etc.
Isa. 55. 1, 2, 3.
HO, all that thirst and pine,
Come to the waters here:
And, ye that have no coin,
Come buy, and eat good cheer:
O Come, I say,
Buy milk and wine, yet without coin,
and without pay.
Why do ye money spend
for that which is not bread?
And labor without end,
and are not filled or fed:
Hark diligently,
And eat ye food both fat and good,
to your souls joy.
Incline your ear, and come,
hear, and your soul shall live,
And I will make you room,
and I to you willl give
My Covenant grace:
The mercies sure, which shall endure
to David's race.
2 PART. Give laud, etc.
Ezekiel. 36. 25,
Besprinkle you will I,
with water that shall cleanse:
And I will purify
your conscience, by this means;
from Idols, then,
And all excess of filthiness
I Will make you clean.
26,
I will in you create
a heart with grace refined:
I will regenerate
the spirit of your mind:
your heart of stone
I will remove, and make it prove
a tender one.
27.
My Spirit I will place
within you, and will cause
That you shall (by my grace)
walk in my Statute-Laws,
So that ye shall
Observe, with trust, my judgments just,
and do them all.

And this shall be (in sum)
the Covenant of my word,
Made good, in days to come,
to Israel, says the Lord:
My Laws will I
Put in their hearts, and inward parts,
effectually.
12.
And they shall all know me,
together great and small:
And gracious I will be
to their offenses all.
Their sins, therefore,
And doings ill, I never will
remember more.
Jer. 32. 40.
My people then shall they
be styled, and I their God,
Nor will I turn away
from doing of them good:
My fear shall be
In them so put, that they shall not
depart from me:
4 PART.
Jer. 50. 5.
They shall enquire the way
with faces Sion-ward:
Come, join ye, shall they say,
in Covenant with the Lord,
Such as shall bind
Perpetually, and never be

32. 39.
And I will give them all
one heart, and way, says God,
And fear me, then, they shall
for ever, for their good:
Their good always,
And of their Sons and little ones
in after-daies.
Ezekiel. 34. 23. Zech. 14. 9.

(A King of David's race)
and he shall feed my Flock:
Then shall there be
One Lord alone, and his Name One,
in midst of thee.
H. 20. The COUNCIL of CHRIST.
Rev. 3. 18,
I Counsel thee to buy of me,
Gold tried in the fire:
And white array to make thee rich,
and trim in thy attire.
That, in this dress, thy nakedness,
and shame may not appear:
With eye salve then anoint thine eyes,
to make thy eyesight clear.
19, 20,
All whom I love I do reprove
with wholesome chastisement:
Be zealous therefore in my way,
and of thy sloth repent.
Behold how I, most graciously,
stand at the door, and knock,
If any man attend to me,
and will the door unlock,
21, 22.
I will come in and sup with him,
and he with me, alone,
And he that overcomes with me,
shall sit upon my Throne.

Unto the Churches every where,
to build them in their Faith.

Gal. 18. 1 Cor. 3. 11. Ephesians. 2. 20.

Contrary to our Doctrine teach,

Other foundation none can lay,
then what is laid to build upon,
Namely what holy Scriptures say,
Christ being made chief corner stone.
Ephesians. 4 4, 5. 1 Co. 8. 7. Ephesians. 1. 7. To. 4. ult. 25.
One body, and one Spirit free,
one hope, whereto we have our Call:
One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism,
one God and Father of us all.
One Jesus Christ, in whom we have
Redemption, through his precious blood,
Who di'd for us, from sin to save,
and rose again to make it good.
To. 8. 34. Jo. 2. 3. Luke 24. 47. Act. 26. 18. Heb. 1. 3.
Who by the word of his command,
made and uphold's whatever is:
Who sits enthroned at Gods right hand,
and intercedeth there for his.
Repentance preached in his Name,
and free remission of our sin:
And an inheritance to claim,
among the Saints, by faith in him.
Heb. 6. 1. Act. 3. 19. Mat. 24. 35. Luke 1. 45.
The Resurrection of the flesh.
and the eternal judgment day:
When Christ his presence shall refresh,
and heaven and earth shall pass away.
Blessed are they that have believed,
for every thing, and every word
Shall be accomplished, and achieved,
that has been spoken by the Lord.
H. 22. DEBORAHS SONG.
Judge. 5. 2, 3.
SIng praise, O Israel, to the Lord,
that has avenged thee:
When as the people went to fight,
offering thmselves so free.
Ye Kings give ear, ye Princes hear,
I, even I will sing,
And sweetly raise my voice in praise,
to Isreal's mighty King.
8. 6, 7, 10,
My heart is toward the Governors,
that did their help afford:
Offering themselves so willingly,
wherefore bless ye the Lord,
'Ye travelers, and passengers,
and ye that ride in state,
And ye that yet in judgment sit,
now speak it in the gate.
11, 6, 7,
All they that are delivered
from the Archers frightfull noise:
The righteous acts of God the Lord
shall often rehearse with joys.
The Passengers were wanderers,
in bypath up and down:
And none could dwell in Israel,
but in a walled town.
2 PART.
12, 19,
Awake, awake, O Deborah,
Pise, Barak, sing a Song:
Abinoams Son, thy captives lead;
thy captives lead along.
There fought the Kings, hard by the Springs
of great Megiddoes plain:
But brought away no prize, nor pay,
to glory of their gain.
30, 20,
Curse Meroz (said Gods Angel then)
curse Meroz bitterly:
That would not help the Lord against
a potent enemy.
But there were those against our foes
that fought from heaven that day:
The Stars in course, did fight with force
against keen Sisera.
27, 31.
At Jaels feet he bowed, he fell,
he bowed, he fell down dead:
She smo^e and pierced his Temples through,
and then cut off his head.
So perish those that are thy foes,
but, Lord, let all thy Lovers
Be like the Sun, when he (at noon)
his brightest beams discovers.
H. 23. DILIGENCE in DVTIES.
Phil. 2. 12. 2 Pet. 1. 8, 10,
WOrk out your own salvation,
with trembling and with fear,
That barren ye may neither be,
nor fruitless Plants appear.
But use all Circumspection,
that ye may so find out
Your Calling and Election,
to make it out of doubt.
5, 6,
Add to your Faith the Virtuous Path,
to Virtue Knowledge knit:
With this advance sweet Temperance,
and Patience join to it.
To Patience add true Piety,
to Piety express
The Kindness that is Brotherly,
and Charitablenesse.
5, 10, 11.
Besides all this ye may not miss
of Diligence in all:
For if ye do these things pursue,
then can ye never fall.
Opening a door of large extent
(by this devout behavior)
Into the Kindom permanent
of Christ our Lord and Savior.
H. 24. The DRAGONS DOWNEALL. Ye children, etc.
Rev. 12. 10, 11.
NOw is salvation come abroad,
The strength, and Kingdom of our God
now has his Christ extolled his might,
For the accuser's made to fall,
He that accused our Brethren all,
before our God both day and night.
And him they quelled and overcame
By the pure blood of Christ the Lamb,!
and by their testimony true:
For by that double-edged-sword
(The witness of their faithful Word)
this enemy they overthrew.
12.
Nor did they spare their utmost breath,
Nor love their lives unto the death,
but boldly laid down all at stake:
Therefore, ye heavens, lift up your voice,
And ye that dwell in them Rejoice,
in this salvation to partake.
But woe to you, to you, O sirs,
The earth and seas inhabiters,
guilty of thy accusers crime:
For Satan is come down to you,
Having great wrath, because he knew
he, now, must have but little time.
11. 17. 7. 10, 12.
We give thee thanks with one consent,
O Lord our God omnipotent,
which art, and wast, and art to come:
For thou have taken unto thee
Thy great power, and Authority,
and reigned in despite of Rome.
Salvation to our God therefore,
Wisdom, and blessing evermore
to him that on the Throne does sit:
And to the Lamb be glory bright,
Thans giving, honor, power and might,
Amen, say we, and so be it.
H. 25. The EASY YO^E. Have mercy, etc.
Mat. 11. 28.
COme to me, says the Lord,
All ye that are oppressed,
And grieved within, by weight of sin,
and I will give you rest.
Take on you my sweet yoke,
and learn of me the Art,
For meek am I exceedingly,
and of a humble heart.
So shall your souls find rest,
not to be had elsewhere:
My yoke alone's an easy one,
my burden light to bear.
H. 26. Against ERRORS and HERESIES.
Gal 5. 1. Ephesians. 4. 14,
STand steadfastly in liberty,
where with ye are made free:
And in the yoke which Christ has broke
no more entangled be:
Nor childishly transported by
loose Doctrines various wind:
Through their deceit that lie in wait,
beguiled souls to blind.
15. 1 Th 5. 21, 24.
But speaking truth in love thereof,
(and not by error led)
Grow up and spring in every thing,
in him which is the Head.
Prove all things, and to good things stand,
Shun all that seems ill:
Faithful is he that calls thee,
who also will fulfill.
2 PART.
Col. 2. 8. 2 Cor. 11. 19.
Beware lest by Philosophy,
and vain deceit in^ic't,
Ye follow men's traditions,
which are not after Christ.
For Heresies must needs arise,
and sects with you be sound,
That such as be from error free
may be approved sound.
2 Pe^. 3. 17, 18.
Be careful then lest wicked men
should draw you to digress
And therewithal you strangely fall
from your own steadfastness.
But grow apace in heavenly grace
and knowledge of our Lord:
To whom always be given praise
of all with one accord.
H. 27. ESAIES SONG of THANKSGIVING O L. Consi. Or, All People, etc.
Isa. chapter 12
LOrd, I will praise thee now this day,
though thou wast angry with me sore,
Thine anger now is turned away,
and thou my comforts do restore.
Behold, God is my Savior strong,
I will confide as not afraid:
For great Jehovah is my song,
also my strength and saving aid.
Therefore by means of this supply,
possessed with joy and great delight,
Ye shall draw water plenteously,
out of the Wells of saving might.
Then shall ye say, Oh praise the Lord,
call on his Name, declare his deeds
Among the people, and record
how far his noble fame exceeds.
Sing to the Lord the sweetest Hymns
of solemn praise with joy and mirth:
For he has done transcendent things,
and this is known in all the earth.
Oh thou that do in Sion dwell,
cry out and shout, for thou do see,
The holy One of Israel
is mighty in the midst of thee.
H. 28. ESAIES TRIVM'PHANT SONG. Ye children, etc.
Isa. 26. 1, 2, 4, 5,
WE have a City very strong,
God sets salvation all along,
for walls and Bulworks every where:
Now open ye the gates for them
Of righteous Jerusalem,
which keep the truth, to enter there.
And since the Lord Jehovah is
The Eternal rock of strength to his,
in his great Name for ever trust:
He gives the proud the overthrow,
He lays the lofty City low,
flat to the ground, and to the dust.
8, 10, 11.
Yea, Lord, in thine own judgments way,
We waited for thee every day,
our souls desire is to thy name:
But let thy favor be declared
To wicked men, they will not regard,
nor learn Religion by the same:
But most unjustly will transgress,
Here in the Land of uprightness,
and will not see Gods Majesty:
But they shall see, and see with shame,
And feel, as foes, thy fiery flame,
for envying our felicity.
2 PART.
Isa. 16. 18, 12,
Lord we have been with child in vain,
And we have been in grievous pain,
and as it were brought forth the wind:
For by our power we have not wrought,
The least deliverance can be thought,
in all the earth in any kind.
Nor have the dwellers on the earth
Fallen by the power that we put forth,
but by thy strength are undertrod.
For Lord, thou will ordain, at last,
True Peace for us, because thou have
wrought all our work in us, O God.
20, 21.
O come, my people, enter thou*
Into thy secret chambers, now,
and shut thy doors about thee fast:
And hide thy self now as it were
But for a little moment there,
unti^^ the wrath be overpast.
For lo the Lord comes from his place,
To punish this ma^ignant race
for wickedness that they maintain:
The earth shall also now disclose
The blood shed of our barbarous foes,
and shall no more conceal her slain.
H. 29. EXAMPLE of SAINTS.
Ephesians. 5 1, 2. Heb. 6. 12.
BRethren, be followers of the Lord,
as Children dear and true:
And walk in love with one accord,
as Christ has loved you.
And be not slack through negl^gence,
but followers of their spirit,
That through Faith and Patience
the Promises inherit.
13. 7. Mat. 5. 16.
Whose Faith likewise do ye pursue,
considering the end,
And blessed issue whereunto
their conversations tend.
And let your light so shine to men,
that your good works discri'd,
May cause your heavenly Father, then,
to be much glorified.
H 30. EZEKIELS IN FANT. Ye Children, etc.
Ezekiel. 16. 3, 5, 6,
THus says the Lord to Israel,
Thy birth, and birthplace konw I well,
of Canaans cursed land to be:
And in the day when thou wast born,
Thou wast cast out to open scorn,
there was no eye to pity thee.
And when I saw thee (passing by)
Polluted in thy blood to lie,
Behold it was the time of love,
When in thy blood thou didstremain,
I said to thee, and said again,
Live, Infant, now born from above.
8, 11, 14.
Then over thee my skirt I spread,
Thy nakedness I covered,
I swear to thee, and made thee mine:
With ornaments I did thee deck,
I put a chain upon thy neck,
And Bracelets on those hands of thine:
And thy renown for beauty, then,
Went forth among the heathen men,
that praised it with one accord:
For (true) it was a perfect dress,
Through my exceeding comeliness,
which I put on thee says the Lord.
H. 31. FAITH PRAISED.
Heb. 11. 1, 2, 13,
FAith is the substance of those things
which once we hope to get:
And the assured evidence
of things not seen as yet.
By it the Elders have obtained
a good report and fame:
And died boldly in this Faith,
before the Promise came.
6. Romans 4. 3.
But without Faith and confidence
(for which the Scriptures call)
It is a thing impossible
to please the Lord at all.
For he that comes to God must trust
that God is God most high:
And the rewarder of them all
that seek him diligently.
Gal. 3. 7, 9.
Know then that they that are of Faith,
are all of Abraham's seed:
And blessed with faithful Abraham,
that are of faith indeed.
H. 32. FAITH PROVED.
Jam. 2. 14, 20,
What profit's it, my Brethren dear,
if any person says,
That he has faith, and has not works,
is that a saving Faith?
But will thou know, O thou vain man,
that faith by works unknown,
Is not a living faith, but dead,
it being all alone.
26. Gal. 5. 6.
For as the body is but dead,
the which no breath supplies:
So Faith, that is not perfected
by works, is dead likewise.
And neither circumcision
availes with God above:
Nor yet uncircumcision,
but Faith that works by love.
H. 33. GODS Glittering SWORD.
Deuteronomy. 32. 39, to 43.
I Kill, says God, and make alive,
I wound, and heal, alone,
And there is none with me can strive
to rescue any one.
For I lift up my hand on high,
to heaven above, and say,
Behold I live eternally,
and am without decay,
If once my hand with judgment close,
and whets my glittering Sword,
With vengeance on my hateful foes,
I Will execute my Word:
I Will make mine arrows drunk with blood,
my Sword shall flesh devour,
The slain and captives shall be food
from the first onset hour.
Rejoice ye Nations with his land
to whom he will be good:
And (while his foes shall feel his hand)
avenge his servants blood.
H. 34. GOVERNMENT.
2 Samuel 23. 1. Deuteronomy. 16. 20. 2 Co. 4. 4. (...)* 2 Chr. 19. 6. Ps. 82. 1.
THe Prince that rules over men
must be exceeding just:
And Gove^n in the fear of God
that puts him in trust.
Because the judgment is not man's,
but Gods (the King of Kings)
Who sits among these earthly Gods,
to judge of all these things.
Romans 13. 1. 5. 1 Timothy 2. 2.
And every soul must needs submit
unto the powers supreme:
And, not for wr^th, but conscience sake,
be subject unto them.
And pray for Kings and Rulers all,
that we, through their defense,
^ay* live in Peace, and Godliness,
with all good conscience, (...).
2 Cor. 5. 10.
For we must every one appear,
and personally ^ome
Before the judgment ^eat of Christ,
there to receive our doom.
Accordingly as every man
has in the body done:
And as the work is good or bad,
So shall his sentence run.
2 PART.
1 Th. 5. 12. 13. 1. P^. 4. 10.
Obey those Rulers over you
that warn you in the Lord:
And, for their work sake, prize them much
that preach to you the word.
As each man has received the gift
let him discharge his place:
As good and faithful Ministers
of Gods abundant grace.
1 Th. 5. ^4. 2 Th. 3. 6, 14. 1 Timothy 5. 22.
Warn the ^^ruly, help the weak,
Support them lest they fall:
C^mfort the feeble minded ones,
be patient toward all.
Withdraw from the inordinate
to shame them for their sin:
And no way be partakers of
the sins that such live in.
Heb. 12. 15, 16. 1 Cor. 14. 26, 33.
And let no root of bitterness,
no person vain and vilde,
Spring up among you troubling you,
and many be defiled.
Let all be done to edify,
for God's the God of Peace
In all the Churches of the Saints,
to make disorders cease.
2 Cor. 13. 11. Romans 13. 8.
And live in Peace and Holiness,
whereto ye have your call:
And then the God of Love and Peace
shall still be with you all.
And owe to no man any thing,
but one to love another,
For it is the Laws accomplishing
to be a perfect Lover.
2 PART.
Ephesians 6. 1, 2, 4.
Obey your Parents in the Lord,
ye children, as it is fit:
This is the first Commandment,
with promise made to it.
Parents, provoke not unto wrath
your children, in their youth:
But bring them up in fear of God,
and nurture of his truth.
5, 6, 9.
Servants obey your Masters will,
with reverentiall fear:
Not with eye-service, pleasing men,
but as Christ's Servants dear,
And, Masters, do your Servants right,
knowing you have on high
A Master, who has no respect
of persons partially.
Rev. 1. 7. 22. 12.
Behold, he comes in the clouds,
whom every eye shall see:
And every man shall have reward
so as his works shall be.
H. 35. GOVERNMENT of the TONGVE.
Jam. 1. 36. Mat. 12. 36.
IF he that seems Religious,
does not his Tongue refrain,
That man's Religion, verily,
is exercised in vain.
For, su^e, of every idle word
that any man shall say,
He is to give account thereof
at Gods great Judgment Day.
5. 22. Jam. 3. 2.
Rash anger shall be judged a sin,
contemptuous speech goes higher:
And he that says, Thou fool, shall be
in danger of hellfire.
But not to sin in word nor tongue
does restifie and tell
A perfect man, and one that can
rule all the body well.
H. 36. The HARVEST. Have mercy, etc.
Mat. 9. 37, 38.
THe Harvest, truly, sirs,
is very great to view*
But lo, the saithfull Labourer^
are but a very few:
Pray ye the Lord therefore
whose own the Harvest is,
To send out laborers good store
into this field of his.
Joh 4. 35, 36. Phil. 4. 17.
That he that does engage
to sow and ^eap, or ^ither,
May have eternal life for wage,
and both rejoice together.
And that our fruit amount
(as we desire and pray)
Abundantly to our account,
in that great Harvest day.
H. 37. The High and Lofty ONE, O Lord consider.
Isa. 57. 15*
THus says the high and lofty One,
Inhabiting Eternity,
Whose Name is Holy, be it known,
I dwell in holy place on high.
Also with him that is contrite,
whose humble Spi^^t sighs and groans:
To cheer the humble in my sight,
and cheer the heart of contrite ones.
16. 66. 2.
For, still contending with the ^^ail,
and keeping anger unallay'd,
The spirits would before me fail,
and those poor souls which I have made.
But unto him will I besure
To look with favor, says the Lord,
That is in spirit meek, and poor,
and trembles at my holy word.
H. 38. HVMILIATION.
Hos. 6. 1,
Come now, and let us search and try
the ways that we have trod:
And turn again unfeignedly
unto the Lord our God:
For he has torn and put to pain,
and he has made the wound:
And he will bind it up again,
and make us whole and sound.
3. Jam. 4. 9,
After two days he will revive,
and raise us up the third:
And make us in his sight alive,
that felt so sharp a sword.
Be then afflicted, weep and mourn,
(repentance to express)
Your laughter into mourning turn,
your joy to heaviness.
10. Mic. 6. 9. Joel. 2. 13.
Hear him that smites and the rod,
humble your selves and stoop,
Cast down your selves in sight of God,
and he shall raise you up.
For he is gracious, merciful,
and unto anger slack:
Of kindness great, and one that will
his judgments soon call back.
H. 39. Against IDOLATRT.
1 Cor. 10. 14, 22. 2 Cor. 6. 1^,
FLee fast from all Idolatry,
from Idols keep you free*
Provoke we God to Jealousy?
are we more strong then he?
With Belial can Christ accord?
or can these things unite
The house of Idols and our Lord,
the darkness and the light?
15, 16, 17, 18.
Unrighteousness, can that combine
with righteousness to dwell?
Or can the true Believer join
with any Infidel?
Be therefore separate and clear,
and all uncleanness ^ee:
And ye my Sons and Daughters dear,
and I your God will be.
Rev. 3. 4.
For but a few are exquisite,
and keep their Garments fair:
And these shall walk with me in white,
for worthy Saints they are.
H. 40. The Jew and Gentiles ^ALL,
Romans 11. 26. 15.
THere comes a Deliverer

To turn away ungodliness
from Jacobs Family.
For if the world be reconciled
by casting them away,
Much more shall their return be stild
life from the dead, that day.
26, 27, 16.
And then all Israel shall be saved,
(as Scripture does declare)
Because the Gifts and Calls of God
without repentance are.
For if the first-sruits holy be,
the lump is holy too:
And if the root yield sancti^ee,
So shall the branches do.
2 PART.
Romans 11. 32, 33.
Yet now has God adjudg'd the Jews,
by unbelief to fall,
That he might this occasion choose,
to show his grace to all.
O depth of riches infinite!
and wisdom of our God!
His judgments O how past our sight!
his Tracts O how untrod!
34, 35, 36.
For who has known the mind of God,
or lent his counsels aid?
Or who has given unto him,
and it shall be repaid?
For of and thorough him are all,

To whom be praise of great and small,
for evermore, A men.

OH who has heard of such a thing,
As now Gods power to pass does bring?
or who has seen such things as these!
For shall a land (can any say)
Be made to bring forth in a day?
Are Nations born at once with ease?
Before that Sion traveled,
She presently was brought to bed,
and brought forth Sons by heavenly aid,
Before she traveled she brought forth,
Before her pain she brought the birth,
and of a sweet man-child was laid.
54. 1. 66. 9.
Break out, O barren Church, and sing,
Thou that did (once) no children bring,
let joyful Songs take up thy life:
Thus says the Lord of thine estate,
The children of the desolate
are more then of the married wife.
For shall I bring it to the birth,
And then not bring the children forth,
says the Almighty Sovereign Lord?
Or shall I cause to bring forth some,
And then untimely shut the womb,
thy God, O Sion, spoke this word.
2. PART.
Isa. 66. 10, 11, 12.
Rejoice ye with Jerusalem,
And let her Lovers (all of them)

Rejoice, I say, lift up your voice,
Be glad with her, and much rejoice,
all ye that mou^ned for her sake.
That ye may suck, and take your fill
Of Consolatious, which distill
in plenty, from your Mothers breasts:
Then shall ye suck (dan^'t on her knees)
Milk out, and much delighted be
with her abundant gloriousness.
54. 7, 8. 62. 4. 60. 4, 8.
Though for a very little space
Angry I was, and hid my face,
and thou wast termed desolate:
Yet will I gather thee again,
With kindnesses that shall remain,
and bear an everlasting date.
Destruction shall no more be heard
Within thy land, nor wasting ^eard,
nor violence be in thy ways:
But thorowout thy borders all
Thy walls salvation they shall call,
and give thy gates the Name of praise.

Hearken, O people, and give ear,
My righteousness is drawing n^er,
my saving health I will disclose:
My arm shall judge the heathen men,
The Isles shall wait upon me then,
and on my power shall they repose.
Enlarge and spread thy tents in space,
(And curtains of thy dwelling place)
lengthen thy cords, and stretch them far:
And men shall break their Swords and Spears.
To pruning hooks and plowing-shares,
nor shall they any more learn War.
11. 6. 49. 23. 60. 20, 22, 20.
The Wolf and Lamb shall jointly feed,
The Leopard with the Calf and Kid,
the Lion and the youngling fat:
Thy Nursing-Fathers Kings shall be,
Queens Nursing-Mothers unto thee,
they shall bow down before thee flat.
Thy Sun shall never more decline,
Nor yet thy Moon desist to shine,
for Gods thy everlasting light:
A little one shall thousands bring,
Strong Nations from a small one spring,
and all thy people shall be right.
4 PART.
Isa. 66. 12. 60. 4. 66. 17,
Behold (says God) I will extend
The Peace of Israel far-an-end,
that like a River it shall seem:
Then shall the glorious Dignitee
Of the converted Gentiles be
like to an overflowing stream.
Thy Sons shall come from far and wide,
And (to be nursed at thy side)
thy Daughters from the earths far ends.
Then will I sweetly comfort them
That dwell in my Jerusalem,
as one whom his dear Mother tends.
14, 24. Psalm. 149. 5. Isa. 35. 10.
Which when ye see your hearts shall joy,
Your bones shall flourish wondrously,
like a sweet herb that freshly grows.
Then shall the hand of God be known
Toward his Servants every one,
and his displeasure toward his foes:
For lo, their worm shall never die,
Their fire shall burn perpetually,
and not be quenehed night nor day:
But Saints shall shout upon their beds,
Eternal joy shall crown their heads,
sorrow and sighs shall ^ice a way.

THere is not any in the earth,

A righteous man, that still does good,
and does no sin commit.
For, verily, in many things
we sin, and trespass, all:
Let him therefore, that thinks he stands,
be careful, lest he fall.
Gal. 6. 1. Ephesians. 4. 32.
And if, by imperfection,

Restore him, ye spiritual ones,

And kind and tenderhearted be,
forgiving mutually,
As God for Christ his sake forgave
all your iniquity.
2 PART.

But there the throne of God shall be,
and Christ the Lambs high throne:
And there his servants shall be free
to serve the holy One.
And they shall see his blessed face,
and his most glorious Name
Upon their sore heads shall have place.
his Image to proclaim.
5.
And there there shall ensue no night,
(as if their day were done:)
Nor have they need of candlelight,
or shining of the Sun.
For God the Lord (from whom it springs*)
shall give them light on high:
And they shall reign, as crowned Kings,
to all Eternity.
H. 44. JVDGMENT DAY FOREWARNED.
Joh. 5. 28, 29.
THe day and hour is drawing nigh,
when all the dead must hear
The voice of him that is most high,
and shall forthwith appear.
All they to sure salvation
whose works are good and right:
And they to condemnation
in evil that delight.
Prove. 12. 28. Romans 6. 23. Gal. 6. 8.
For life is found in righteous ways,
no death can be therein.
But death the certain wages pays
of all unpardon d sin.
All they that sow to sinful flesh
corruption shall inherit:
But endless life shall them refresh
that sow unto the Spirit.
1 Cor. 15. 58.
Be steadfast, Brethren, now therefore,
and always be unmoved:
Abounding now and evermore,
in works of God approved.
Because ye know his holy word
does make the Promise plain,
So that your labor in the Lord
can never be in vain.
2 PART.
Luke 21. 34.
Be careful lest, at any time,
you should, by your excess,
Surcharge your souls with surfeiting,
or shameful drukennesse.
And lest your heart be overcome
with weight of worldly cares:
And so, that day, the day of Doom,
'oretake you unawares.
1 These. 5. 2, 3. Luke 12. 47.
Because the day of Christ will come
like as a thief by night:
And when they say, Peace, Peace will be,
shall sudden vengeance lite.
He that did know his Masters will,
and not himself prepare
To do according to his skill,
full many a stripe shall bear.
37, 38, 44.
But blessed are those Servants all
that watch with wakefull mind:
Whom Christ shall at his coming call,
and in this posture find.
He shall come forth assuredly,
and set them at his board:
And make them Partners in the Joy
of their advanced Lord.
H. 45. JUSTIFICATION.
Romans 8. 33, 34.
IT is the Lord that justifies,
who therefore shall condemn?
It is our Savior Christ that died,
or rather rose again.
Who also is at Gods right hand
ascended up on high:
And makes intercession there
for us continually.
Heb. 4. 16. Col 3. 17.
Now therefore let us boldly come
(in certain hope to speed)
Unto the throne of grace, for grace
to help in time of need.
And let all things we speak or do
be in the name of one:
To God the Father giving thanks
through Christ our Lord alone.
HYMN XLVI. THE LAMBS SONG.
Rev. 15. 3, 4.
THy works are great and marvelous,
Lord God the Almighty one:
Thy ways are true and righteous,
thou King of Saints alone.
Who shall not fear thee, O most high,
and glorify thy Name?
For thou alone for sanctity
deservest laud and fame.
For all the Nations of the earth
shall come and worship thee:
Because thy judgments are set forth
so plain for us to see.
HYMN XLVII. LONGING after CHRIST, Ye children, etc.
Joh. 6. 32, 35. c. 7. 38.
THe bread of God (so truly called)
That gives l^fe unto the world
is he that down from heaven came:
And with this sweet celestial bread,
Lord, let us be replenished,
and give us ever of the same.
For he that (as the Scripture says)
Lays hold on Christ by lively faith
shall never thirst or hunger more:
For by that says, and feeding so,
out of his belly there shall flow
of living waters plent^ous store.
Rev. 22. 17, 20. Cant. 8. 14. Jam. 5. 8.
The Spirit and the Bride say, Come,
And let not him that hears be dumb,
but call to come with eager strife:
Come all that thirst, and take your fill,
Take freely whosoever will
the water of eternal life.
Make have, my love, and be not slow
Be like the nimble Heart or Roe
tracing upon the mountains spic'd:
And I, behold, come speedily,
The coming of the Lord draws night,
Amen, so come, Lord Jesus Christ.
HYMN XLVIII. LOVE of GOD.
Jo^. 3. 16. 1 John 4. 9. Joh. 3. 17.
SO greatly God did love the world
that freely he did give
His only and begotten Son
that we through him might live.
God sent him not into the world,
the world for to condemn,
But that he might be manifest
a Savior unto men.
Rev. 1. 5. J^h. 3. 16. Rev. 21. 24.
Who loved us and gave himself
for our eternal good,
And washed away our scarlet sins
in his own precious blood.
And whosoever trusts in him
shall never perish quite,
But he shall have eternal life,
and live in endless light.
Luke 2. 24.
To God therefore that dwells on high
be praise and glory still,
On earth be true tranquillity,
and unto men good will.
2 PART.
1 John 2. 3. c. 5. 3.
Hereby we know undoubtedly
that we do love the Lord,
By keeping with fidelity
the precepts of his Word.
And this is, sure, the love of God,
if we his Laws fulfill;
Nor do we count his Laws a load,
but do them with good will.
4. 19. Ephesians. 1. 4. 1 John 4. 10, 19.
We love him for he first loved us,
and chose us in his Son,
That we should be adopted thus
before the world beg^n:
Herein is love, not ours it is
but his (whence our's begins)
In sending that sweet Son of his
a ransom for our sins.
Rev. 5. 13.
To him that sits upon the throne,
and to the Lamb therefore
Be glory, strength, dominion
and honor evermore.
HYMN XLIX. Against LOVE of the WORLD.
Mat. 16. 26. Col. 3. 2.
WHat shall it profit any man
The world to purchase whole,
And thereby miss the certain bliss
of his immortal soul?
Oh set your strong affections then
on things that are above:
And let no worth of things on earth
be motives of your love.
1 John 2. 16, 15.
All in the world is pride of life,
and lusts of flesh and eyes:
Which do not from the Father come,
but from the world they rise.
Love not the world nor things thereof,
if any love so low,
The perfect love of God above
in him can never flow.
17.
These worldly things all pass away
and perish altogether:
But to fulfill Gods holy will
makes to abide for ever.
HYMN L. MARRIAGE.
Heb. 13. 4.
THe due estate of Marriage
(as Scripture does assure)
Is honorable every where
the bed preserved pure)
But harlots and adulterers
that v^olate this thing,
By practice of unchastity,
will God to judgment bring.
1 These. 4. 4. Col. 3. 19, 20.
Then let us every one know how
his vessel to possess,
In honorable dignity,
and spotless holiness.
And, husbands, dearly love your wives,
giving no bitter word:
And, wives, submit obediently
to them, as to the Lord.
1 Pet. 3. 3, 4.
And your adorning let not be
in an external way,
Of plaited hair, and wearing gold,
or putting on array.
But of the heart, and hidden man,
where incorruption lies:
And of a meek and quiet soul,
which God does highly prize.
1 Cor. 7. 39. 1 Pet. 3. 7.
And be not yoakt unequally,
but only in the Lord;
Honoring the wife (the weaker Sex)
according to the Word.
And live together lovingly,
as heirs of grace of life:
That disagreements hinder not
the prayers of man and wife.
Mat. 22. 30.
And in the resurrection, where
none are in marriage given,
Ye shall be like the Angels there,
triumphant Saints in heaven.
HYMN LI. The MEDIATOR. All people, etc.

ONe God there is, and one alone,
and Mediator none but one;
The man whom we Christ Jesus call,
who gave himself full price for all.

If any sin, we have, on high,
an Advocate to quali^ie,
Jesus the just, whose blood was spilt
to exp^ate our ha^o^s guilt.

Blessing, and glory, and renown
to him that on the Throne sits down:
And to the Lamb of God therefore
be praise and honor evermore.
HYMN LII. MERCIES. All people, etc.
Micah 6. 18. to the end.
WHo is a God like unto thee,
that pardons all iniquity:
And from their sins does disengage
the remnant of his heritage?
He does not still retain his wrath,
for mercy is his pleasing path:
He will return again, he will,
and have compassion on us still.
Isa. 43. 25.
He will subdue our trespasses,
as drowned in the deepest seas:
And, for his own name sake on high,
he blots them out of memory.
Thou will perform thy truth and grace,
To Abraham and Jacobs race:
As thou have to our Fathers told,
and sworn it from the days of old.
HYMN LIII. MERCY and TERROR mixed. All people, etc.
Nah. 1. 2,
JEalous is God and does revenge,
he does revenge with fury strange:
He will take vengeance on his foes,
and he reserveth wrath for those.
3,
Yet is the Lord to anger slow,
but of great power to overthrow:
And he will not at all acquit
the wicked that repent no whit.
6. Hab. 3. 5.
Before his fury who can stand,
who can abide his angry hand?
The Pestilence before him rolls,
beneath his feet go burning coals.
Nab. 1. 5.
The mountains quake, the hills do melt
when as his presence is but felt:
The earth is burnt at sight of him
the world and all that dwell therein.
Isa. 14. 27. Neh. 9. 17.
His judgments none can disanull;
but yet our God is merciful:
Thine anger, Lord is, slow of pace,
thy kindness great, and rich thy grace.
2. PART. All people, etc.
Nah. 1. 7, 8.
The Lord is good, a Tower to his
when as the day of trouble is:
And them that trust in him he knows,
but darkness shall pursue his foes.
6,
And with an overrunning flood
he will consume the place that stood:
Like fire his fury pours down,
The rocks by him are overthrown.
9,
Against him what do you intend?
the Lord will make an utter end:
Affliction (for so great a crime)
shall not rise up the second time.
10,
Folden as thorns although they be,
and drunken with prosperity,
They shall be very suddenly
devoured as stubble fully dry.
15.
O Judah keep thy solemn feasts,
thy mountains bring good news of peace:
No more shall sinners pass through thee,
but utterly cut off shall be.
HYMN LIVE. Against MERIT.
Luke 17. 10. Phil. 2. 13.
When you have done the best you can,
say thus with humble thought,
Unprofitable are we all,
and do but what we ought.
For it is God that works in you,
he works both will and deed:
And of his mere good pleasure, too,
does all your power proceed.
Ephesians 2. 8, 9. c. 3. 21.
And ye are saved by grace, through faith,
wrought by the holy Ghost:
Not of your selves, nor of your works,
lest any man should boast.
To him let all the Church therefore
ascribe, with one accord,
All praise and honor evermore,
through Jesus Christ our Lord.
HYMN LV. MORAL PRECEPTS. Pressed with Arguments.
Mic. 6. 8. Psalm. 37. 28. Col. 3. 25.
THe Lord has showed thee, O man,
what God requires as good:
Do justly, love compassion,
walk hum^ly with thy God.
Because the Lord loves equ^ty,
his Sa^nts he will not leave:
And he that deals injuriously
shall sutably receive.
Mat. 5. 7. Jam. 2. 13. Luke 14. 11.
And mercy to the merciful,
the Lord will still express:
But judgment shall with rigor ^all
upon the merciless.
And God does still resist the proud,
but gives the humble grace:
Self-humbling then, shall honor men,
self-honouring shall abase.
2. PART.
Jam. 5. 12. Ephesians. 4. 25. Rev. 21. 8.
Swear not by heaven, nor by earth,
nor any oath at all:
Lest into condemnation,
by such offense, ye fall.
Put lies away and speak the truth,
for every wilful liar
Must sure partake of that broad lake
which burns with brimstone-fire.
Romans 13. 13. Heb. 12. 14.
Shun ^urfeiting and drunkenness,
and do not lead your l^fe
In chambering and wantonness,

and holiness together:
Without which grace there is no man shall*
behold Gods face for ever.
3. PART.
Ephesians. 4. 31, 29. Romans 12. 21.
All malice, wrath, and bitterness,
and clamor put away:
And be not overcome with ill,
but let the good bear sway.
And let no talk come from your mouths
corrupt in any case:
But such as serves to edify,
and teach the hearers grace.
Ephesians. 5. 3, 4.
But fornication, avarice,
and what pollutes or taints:
Amongst you let not once be named,
as it becomes Saints.
Nor filthiness, nor foolish talk,
no^ unbeseeming jests
(Which things are not convenient)
but rather thankfulness.
4. PART.
Rom 12. 10, 15. Ephesians. 2. 4. Gal. 6. 2.
By kind affection mutually,

Rejoice with them that do rejoice,

And heed not your own things alone,
but each for other care:
And, to fulfill the Law of Christ,
each others burden bear.
Romans 12. 16. Mat. 7. 1, 2.
Mind not high things but condescend
to men of low estate:
And be not wise in your own eyes

Accordingly shall God reply,
and deal to you again.

and will the wrong repay.
Jam. 5. 9. Joh. 7. 24. Phil. 4. 5. Romans 14. 4.

to whom we stand or fall,
6. PART.
Ecc es. 5. 4, 5 Heb. 13. 16.
When thou have vowed a vow to God,

forget ye in no wise:
For God is pleased exceedingly
with such like sacrifice.
Phil. 4. 8. 1 Cor. 4. 5.
And all things honest, just, and true,
and such as sweetly please:
For virtue, praise, and good report,
think on such things as these,
Until the secrets of all hearts,
be published all abroad:
And then shall every one of us
have his due praise of God.
HYMN LVI. More spiritual PRECEPTS.
Prove. 3. 5, 6. Mat. 22. 37. 1 These. 5. 15, 16.
TRust in the Lord with all thy heart,
love him with all thy might:
In all thy ways acknowledge him,
and make him thy delight.
Pursue good things, rejoicing still,
and pray continually:
Quench not the Spirit any way,
despise not prophecy.
Romans 12. 11. Heb. 12. 28. Joh. 6. 27.
With fervent spirit serve the Lord,
and (having grace) draw near
To worship God with reverence,
and godly filial fear.

But for the food that does endure
to everlasting life.
Mat 6. 33.
And seek Gods Kingdom first of all,
his righteo^snesse pursue:
And then shall all the other things
be added unto you.
HYMN LVII. MORTALITY and IMMORTALITY.
Isa 40. 6, 7,
All flesh is grass, and soon must yield,
for all the goodly show,
Which is but as a flower in field
that some short time does grow.
The gras does wither and is gone
the flower does fade and pass;
Because Gods Spirit blows thereon;
the people sure is grass.
8. 1 Cor. 15. 53,
The grass does change, the flower does fade
at one rebuking blast;
But lo! the word our Lord has said
for ever stands fast.
The corruptible must put on
a state that cannot die;
The mortal must be clothed upon
with immortality.
54. 56, 57.
The saying then fulfilled shall be
recorded of this thing,
O grave where is thy victory!
O death where is thy sting!
The sting of death sin needs must be,
the Law the strength of sin,
But thanks to God for vic^o y
through Christ our Lord herein.
HYMN LVIII. MORTIFICATION.
Col 3. 5. Romans 6. 12. c. 8. 13.
YOur earthly members mortify,
and let no sin bear sway,
Or in your mortal body reign
wh^le ye the lusts obey.
For if ye serve the flesh ye die,
but if that, by the Spirit,
The bod^es lasts ye mortisie,
then shall ye life inherit.
c. 6. 16. c. 13. 14.
For his ye are, whom ye obey,
whether of sin to death;
Or else of righteousness to life,
after this mortal breath.
Put on, then, jesus Christ the Lord,
and for the fleshes ease
Make no provision, nor regard
the lusts thereof to please.
2. PART.
Romans 8. 7. c. 12. 2.
The carnal mind is enmity
against the living Lord:
Not subject, neither can it be,
to his revealed word.
Be changed therefore by minds renewed,
that ye may understand
What pleasing good and perfect things
the Lord does here command.
chapter 8. 6. chapter 6. 11, 8.
Because to be of carnal mind
is death without release:
But if spiritually inclined,
it savours life and peace.
Then count your selves as dead to sin,
to God (in Christ) alive:
Because if we be dead with him*
we trust we shall revive.
HYMN LIX. MOSES Song. All people, etc.
Exodus 15. 1.
NOw sing unto the Lord will I,
for he has triumphed gloriously:
The horse and rider (both of these)
his hand has cast into the Seas.
5, 6,
The depths devoured them every one,
They sank to the bottom as a stone:
Lord thy right hand with power shines bright
thy right hand crushed the enemy quite.
7,
In thy great excellence, O God,
thou have those rebels under-trod.
Thou sentest forth thy wrath whereby
they were consumed as stubble dry.
9,
The enemy thus proudly spoke,
I will pursue and overtake,
The spoil says he, I will divide,
my lust shall so be satisfied.
10,
Then did thou blow with blustering force,
The sea returned to its course;
And (covering them) became their graves,
They sank as lead in mighty waves.
11,
Among the gods, who is like to thee,
Who like thee shines in sanctity*
Fearful in praises, as exceeds,
And doing rare and wondrous deeds.
HYMN LX. Against OPPRESSION and RAPINE.
Prove. 4. 14, 15, 16.
Go not with wicked men, my son,
Go not with them, I say,
Their crooked paths avoid and shun,
And come not near their way.
For if they do no wicked deed,
They take no rest at all:
Their sleep departs, unless they speed
Of making some to fall.
Mic. 22. Prove. 4. 17. 2. 13.
They covet fields, and violently
They take them for a prey;
Oppressing Town and Family,
Because they bear the sway.
They eat the bread of wickedness,
And drink the wine of strife;
They leave the paths of Righteousness
To lead a brutish life.
Isa. 59. 7, 8.
Destruction and unhappiness
Are ever in their ways;
And do not know the way of peace;
For still their Judgment strayes.
They make them crooked paths of sin,
from which they cannot cease:
And whosoever walks therein
shall never know true peace.
2. PART.
Prove. 1. 10, 1^, 13,
My son let sinners ticing thee
be constantly withstood;
If they say, come, let us agree,
let us lay wait for blood:
All precious substance we shall find,
to make us rich and great;
And with the spoil of every kind
shall fill our house complete.
14, 15, 16, 18,
Cast in thy lot among us now,
let us have all one purse;
Refrain my son, and go not thou
with them in this lewd course.
For unto rapine they run fast,
but lo, their laying wait
Shall be for their own lives at last,
and their own blood the bait.
19, 31.
The projects which they prosecute
shall pay them home one day:
And they shall eat the bitter fruit
of their own cursed way.
Such ways are his, whoever strives
his hands with blood to stain,
To take away the owners lives
for greediness of gain.
HYMN LXI. The Passion and Compassion of Christ.
1 Pet. 3. 18. c. 2. 24.
LO Christ has suffered for us all,
the just for wicked men;
That he might bring us unto God
now reconciled again:
Who bare our sins in his own flesh,
upon that cursed tree,
That we should live to righteousness
and dead to sin should be.
Isa. 53. 6, 3.
All we like sheep have gone astray,
each took his course to fall:
And God has laid the load on him
to answer for us all.
A man of sorrows sure he was,
and he has born our grief:
Mean while we hid our face from him,
and gave him no relief.
Joh. 10. 11.
Lo this is that sweet Shepherd, then,
so infinitely good,
That for his sheep laid down his life,
and spilt his precious blood.
2. PART.
Joh. 15. 13. Romans 5. 7,
A greater love then this has none,
nor none can comprehend,
Then that a man should stake his life
and lose it for his friend:
For scarce will any die for him
that lives most righteously,
Yet happily for a special friend
some one might dare to die.
18. chapter 14. 9.
But God commends his tender love
toward us in this wise:
In that Christ Jesus died for us
when we were enemies.
And therefore did our Savior die,
recover and revive,
To be the Lord both of the dead,
and those that are alive.
Heb. 13. 15.
By him therefore give we to God
the sacrifice of praise;
(The grateful fruit of thankful lips)
blessing his name always.
HYMN LXII. PATIENCE.
Jam. 1. 4. Heb. 10. 36.
LET Patience have her perfect work,
that ye may be entire,
And nothing wanting in your grace
which God does here require.
For ye have need of patience,
that, having done his Will,
Ye may receive the Promises
which God shall then fulfill.
c. 6. 19. Rom 5. 4. 5. 2. Co. 4. 17.
For Patience works experience,
Experience works hope,
And hope shall never make ashamed,
but set the gate wide open;
And lo! our light affliction
which is but transitory,
Works for us a more excellent
eternal weight of glory.
2 Timothy 2. 12. Jam. 5. 12.
For they that suffer with the Lord
shall reign with him full sure:
Therefore, behold, we count them blessed
whoever do endure.
The Peace of God and PRAYER.
All people, etc. or O Lord consider.
HYMN LXIII
Phil. 4. 6, 7.
IN nothing be perplexed with care,
but call on God for every thing:
And with thanksgiving in your prayer
to him your s^pplications bring.
And, lo! the peace which God imparts,
past understanding to record,
Shall safely keep your minds and hearts,
through Jesus Christ our only Lord.
HYMN LXIV. PERSEVERANCE.
Heb. 3. 12, 13.
TAke heed my brethren, lest there be
in any of you all
An heart of infidelity,
whereby from God to fall.
But still exhort with mutual heed,
while it is called to day,
Lest any one be hardened
by sins deceitful way.
14. chapter 10. 23. 1 These. 5. 24.
For we partake of Christ (no doubt)
if we by faith sit fast,
So that our confidence hold out
unshaken to the last.
Let Us hold profession fast therefore,
not wavering in our faith,
For faithful is the promiser,
and will do what he says.
Rev. 2. 10.
Be faithful to the death (says he)
persisting in my way,
And I will surely give to thee
a Crown of life that day.
HYMN LXV. The PORTION of the little FLOCK.
Luke 12. 32. 1 Cor. 2. 9.
Fear not O little flock and few,
for it is your fathers pleasure,
To give the Kingdom unto you,
that has eternal treasure.
Eye has not seen, nor ear has heard,
what things God has above,
Beyond the thoughts of man, prepared,
For them that do him love.
1 Timothy 4. 8.
For godliness availes to all,
having the promise sure
Of this life which is temporal,
and that which does endure.
To God the Father, and the Son,
and holy Ghost therefore,
Eternal honor let be done,
henceforth for evermore.
HYMN LXVI. The POWER of PRAYER.
Jam. 1. 5. Mat. 7. 11,
IF any of you wisdom wants,
ask of the Lord alone,
Who liberally to all men grants,
and yet upbraideth none.
For if that ye which evil are
can give good things to yours,
Much more your heavenly Fathers care,
his suppliants assures.
7. Jam 1. 6. John 16. 24.
Ask therefore and be sure to have,
and seek and ye shall find:
But ask in faith what-ere ye crave,
and not with wavering mind.
But if ye ask, and shall believe,
God will thereto agree:
Ask therefore that ye may receive,
that sull your joy may be.
HYMN LXVII. Reasonable Service.
Romans 12. 1. 1 Cor. 6. 19,
PResent your bodies to the Lord
a living sacrifice:
A holy offering unto him,
and pleasing in his eyes.
This is a service which ye owe,
and reasonably due:
For ye are not your own, ye know,
but Christ has purchased you.
20. chapter 10. 31.
Now therefore glorify the Lord
(Dear brethren every one)
Both in your bodies and your souls,
for they are Gods alone.
And whither eat or drink ye do,
or ought else, all your days,
Let all be done, by each of you,
to Gods renown and praise.
HYMN LXVIII. Recovery of the Church. Have mercy, etc.
Mic^ 7. 8, 9.
Rejoice not over me,
O thou mine enemy:
For, when I fall, the boast is small,
so soon arise shall I.
And when I sit me down
in darkness desolate:
The lord will be a light to me,
in that distressed estate.
And I will therefore bear
the Lords most just displeasure:
Since I have been enticed to sin
against him in such measure.
Until the Lord be pleased
my cause to undertake:
And, at my suit, shall execute
his judgment for my sake.
For verily the Lord
will bring me forth to light:
And will express his righteousness
apparent in my sight.
HYMN LXIX. REDEEMING of TIME.
Eccles 12. 1, 7.
REmember thy Creator now,
in these thy younger days:
Before the year and day draw near
when pleasure quite decays,
Then shall the dust return to earth,
to earth from ^hence it came:
The spirit then goes back again
to God that gave the same.
13, 14.
Now let us hea^ the end of all,
that Scripture does declare,
Oh fear the Lord, and keep his word,
which should be all our care.
For every work, both good and bad,
with every secret thing,
That here have past, from first to last,
will God to judgment bring.
Ephesians. 5. 15, 16.
See that you walk exactly then,
and not as fools but wise;
And still redeem your precious time
because bad days arise.
HYMN LXX. REDEMPTION. Out of the Songs of the blessed Virgin Mary, of
Zacharias, and ^ld Simeon.
Luke 1. 46, 47, -- 50,
MY soul does highly magnify
the Lord of Sovereign power:
My spirit joys exceedingly
in God my Savior.
For holy is that Name of his,
and lets great grace to fall
On them that fear him, every where,
through generations all.
51, 52,
The things that his right arm has wrought
have showed his strength full well:
Scattering the proud in that high thought
wherewith their hearts did swell.
Yea, he dethrones the mighty ones,
and plucks them from their seat:
And them that be of low degree
he has made high and great.
53, 54, 55.
He fills the hungry with good things,
the rich sends empty away:
And to his servant Israel brings
soul-saving help this day,
Calling to mind his mercies kind,
to our forefathers told,
With Abraham, and his seed to stand
for ever, as of old.
2. PART. Out of the Song of Zachary.
Luke 1. 1. 68, 69.
The Lord the God of Israel
we praise with one accord:
For visiting and redeeming us
the people of the Lord.
For he has thus raised up for us
salvations surest horn:
Which, in his servant David's house,
is, of a Virgin, born.
70, 71, 72,
As holy Prophets all foretold
should come to pass for man:
And by their mouth he spoke of old,
since first the world began.
From hands of those our hateful foes
that he would set us clear:
And so perform the mercy sworn
unto our fathers dear.
73, 74, 75.
His holy Covenant (still the same)
to be remembered thus:
His oath to father Abraham,
that he would grant to us,
That safely we (from foes set free)
might walk in fearlesse ways
Of holiness and righteousness,
before him, all our days.
3. PART. Out of the Songs of Simeon and Zachary.
Luke 2. 30, 31, 32.
And now, O Lord, our eyes have seen
thy saving health and grace,
By power divine prepared to shine
before all peoples face.
And as a light to shine full bright
where blindfold Gentiles dwell:
And to be made the glory of
thy people Israel.
c. 1. 77, 78.
The knowledge of salvation,
that God might thus give in:
Unto his people making known
the pardon of their sin.
All through the love of God above,
so tenderly let fall:
Whereby the dayspring from on high
has visited us all.
79. ch, 2. 14.
From darkness and the shade of death
to grant us glad release:
And give us light to guide our feet
into the paths of peace.
To God be glory now therefore,
in heavens highest place:
Let peace on earth be poured forth,
to men good will and grace.
HYMN LXXI. REFORMATION. Give laud, etc.
Hag 2. 6.
THus says the Lord of Hoasts,
but yet a little while,
And I will shake all coasts,
yea, every land and Isle,
yet once again,
I shake all these, heaven, earth, and seas,
and all the main.
7,
All Nations I will shake
the long desired day
Which does all Nations take,
lo, that shall come, I say,
And (for all Coasts)
This house I will with glory fill,
says God of Hoasts.
9,
The glory of this last
far greater ^^all it grow,
Then of the Temple past,
the Lord of Hoasts says so,
And, in this place
(It is the Lord of Hoasts his Word)
I will give peace.
Zach. 4. 6, 7. Ha. 2. 22.
Yet not by might nor power,
but by my spirit alone:
Says God of Hoasts our Tower,
the strength of all in one:
for who art thou
O mountain great (the Empires seat)
to hinder now?
Zach. 4. 7.
Before Zerubbabel
thou shall become a plain:
The stone that does excel
(the head-stone of the same)
His hand shall fit,
And bring it out with general shout,
grace, grace to it.
Heg. 2. 22
The hand that first began
to lay the groundwork low:
The hand of that same man
shall finish it also,
In spite of Kings:
For who are they that slight the day
of smaller things.
HYMN LXXII. Regeneration.
J^h 3. 5. Gal. ^. ^5.
EXcept a man be born again,
of water and the spirit:
He cannot any way attain
salvation to inherit.
For circumcision serves none
(the privilege is small)
Nor serves uncircumcision,
but a new creature's all.
2 Cor. 5. 17. Jam. 1. 18.
Behold a man in Christ, therefore,
and a new creature view:
Old things are past, and come no more,
and all things are made new.
By his own will and word has he
wrought our regeneration:
A kind of first-ripe-fruit to be
of all his whole Creation.
HYMN LXXIII. REPENTANCE.
Isa. 59. 1, 2,
GOds arm is never shortened,
but it can reach to save:
His ear not dull, or wearied
to hear us what we crave.
But from you, do your sins divide
your God that was so near,
And cause the Lord his face to hide,
so that he will not hear.
Ezck. 18. 13. 2 Chronicles. 30. 9.
Lay therefore your transgressions by,
Repent and turn, says he,
And so your great iniquity
your ruin shall not be.
Because the Lord is full of grace,
ready to pardon sin:
And will not hide away his face,
if ye return to him.
Luke 15. 7, 10.
One sinner that returns again
makes Angels joy exceed,
More then do ninety-nine just men
that no repentance need.
2. PART.
Jer. 3. 13. 1 Job. 1. 9.
Acknowledge how ye have transgrest
against the Lord your God:
And only let it be confessed
what bypath you have trod.
For if we do our sins confess,
faithful and just is he
From sin and all unrighteousness
to cleanse and set us free.
Prove. 28. 13. Joel 2. 13. Neh. 9. 17. Ez. 18. 32.
For he that hides his sins shall fall,
they prosper but a space:
But to confess and leave them all
shall with the Lord find grace.
For he is unto anger slow,
and ready to forgive:
And does abundant kindness show,
wherefore return, and live.
Exodus 34. 7.
For he reserves compassion
for thousands that come in:
Remitting all transgression,
iniquity, and sin.
3. PART.
Isa. 55. 6, 7,
Seek ye the Lord unfainedly,
now while he may be found;
Oh call on him while he is nigh
with mercies that abound*
Oh let the wicked leave his lusts
(the way that sinners take)
And let the man unrighteous
his sinful thoughts forsake.
-- chapter 1. 18.
And turn again unto the Lord,
while mercy now takes place,
And to our God so richly stored
with gifts of pardoning grace.
For though your sins were crimson-like,
as red as scarlet (full)
I (says the Lord) will make them white,
as white as snow or wool.
Rev. 1. 5, 6.
To him that thus has loved us,
and cancelled all our score,
In that pure flood of his own blood,
be praise for evermore,
HYMN LXXIV. REPROACH for CHRIST.
1 Pet. 4. 14, 16.
IF that ye be reproacht for Christ,
happy are ye, and blessed:
The Spirit of God and glory great
upon your souls shall rest.
On their parts he is ill spoken off,
but glorified on yours:
Therefore let no man be ashamed
that Christianly endures.
Mat 5. 11, ^2.
Blessed are you when men revile
and speak each evil word
Against you falsely for the sake
of Christ your Sovereign Lord.
Rejoice and be exceeding glad,
considering the reward,
How great it is in heaven above,
for suffering Saints prepared.
2. PART. Phil. 2. 5, 7.
Let that good mind be in you all
that was in Christ our Lord:
Who being in the form of God,
the true eternal Word,
Yet made himself of no repute,
to death did condescend,
And came not to be tended on,
but to observe and tend.
Phil. 2. 9, 10. Heb. 9. 28.
Therefore God gave to him a Name
above all names most high:
That every knee should bow to him,
and every tongue comply.
Who came to take our sins away,
once, by his own oblation:
And shall appear, the second time,
without sin, to salvation.
HYMN LXXV. RESURRECTION. All people, or O Lord Consider, etc.
1 Cor. 15. 20, 21, 22.
NOw Christ is risen from the dead,
as whom no bands of death could keep:
And is to be acknowledged
as the first fruits of those that sleep.
For as by man came death to reign,
so by a man to rise again:
And as by Adam all men die,
by Christ came immortality.
Col. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4.
If ye be risen then with Christ
set all your heart on things above:
And be not any way enticed
on earthly things to set your love.
For ye are dead to things abroad,
and your life hid with Christ in God:
When Christ who is our life appears
ye must shine with him in the spheres.
HYMN LXXVI Against REVENGE.
Romans 12. 19. Luke 6. 27. Mat. 5. 44,
Dear Saints, avenge not your own selves,
nor let sierce wrath incense:
For vengeance, says the Lord, is mine,
and I will recompense.
Love ye your very enemies,
and them that curse you, bless,
Do good to them that use you ill,
with hate and spitefulness.
45.
And people persecuting you
curse not, but bless them rather:
That ye may be children true
of your celestial father.
For he does cause his rain to ^all,
and lets his Sun to rise
On good and bad in general,
just and unjust likewise.
HYMN LXXVII. The SABBATH.
Isa. 58. 13,
IF from my holy Sabbath Day
thou turn away thy foot:
And do not by thy pleasures stray,
my Sabbath to pollute.
But call the Sabbath a delight,
the holy of the Lord:
And thine own carnal pleasure slight,
in thought, in deed, in word.
14.
Then shall thou joy in God alone,
with sweet and sacred mirth:
And he shall make thee ride upon
high places of the earth.
With father Jacobs heritage
the Lord shall feed thee fat:
For thus does Gods own mouth engage,
and thou may trust to that.
HYMN LXXVIII. SAGRAMENT of the SUPPER
Cant. 1. 1, 2. c. 2. 5.
LEt those life-breathing lips of thine
be joined, O Christ, to me:
Because thy love excels wine,
and all the Saints love thee.
With flagons of refreshing joy,
and comforts from above,
Stay me, O stay me powerfully,
for I am sick of love.
2. 4, 3.
Into the house of Banqueting,
he brought me to be fed:
Love was his banner flourishing
with honor ore my head.
Beneath his shadow I was placed
with very great content:
His fruit was sweet unto my taste
(his Word and Sacrament.)
5. 1.
O friends, said he, (preferred on high)
eat well of my good cheer:
And drink, yea, drink abundantly,
my guests to me most dear.
2. PART.
Cant. 5. 16. 2 Cor. 5. 20.
My Savior, my beloved one
is mine, and I am his:
Chief of ten thousand he alone,
pure red and white he is.
Made sin for us that knew no sin,
that so we might be made
The righteousness of God in him,
by whom the price was paid.
Cant. 8. 7. chapter 1. 4,
Stronger then death his love is found,
not to be bought with goods:
Nor quenched with waters, nor be drowned
with whatsoever floods.
O draw me, my dear Savior,
with those strong cords of love,
And then will we go after thee
as fast as we can move.
We will record thy love, O Lord,
above the joy of wine:
The Virgins fair that spotless are
do love thy name Divine.
3. PART.
1 Cor. 5. 7, 11.
Lo Christ is sacrificed for us,
(our Passover from heaven)
Now therefore let us keep the feast,
not with old lumps of leaven:
Not with the leav'n of wickedness,
or leaven of malice led:
But keep it with sincerity;
and truths unleavened bread.
chapter 11. 29, 28.
Who eat and drink unworthily
their own damnation earn:
Because they want a spiritual eye
his body to discern*
Our hearts (with care) examined,
let us be st^rred up
To eat of this celestial bread,
and drink this sacred cup.
26.
To eat this bread and drink this cup
holds forth a Savior slain,
So often as we celebrate,
until he come again.
4. PART.
1 Cor. 10. 16.
The cup of blessing which we bless
is it not understood
The sweet communion to express,
of Christ our Saviors blood:
The bread we break (the holy loas)
do we not all accord
To call it the communion of
the body of our Lord?
17,
For we though many are one bread,
and in one body join:
For all of us are jointly fed
with that one bread divine.
The living bread is he on high
that down from heaven came;
And he shall live and never die
that eats of the same.
Mat. 26. 28.
The blood of the new Testament
we sweetly taste herein,
Which was for ^s and many spent,
for pardon of our sin.
5. PART.
1 Job. 4. 10. chapter 5. 6.
Herein is love, not ours to God,
but his to us most large:
In sending down his only Son
our great debts to discharge.
Lo! this is he that came to us
by water and by blood,
And not by one of them alone,
but both ways to our good.
Jo^. 17. 17. Acts 13. 39.
Therefore he sanctified himself,
to lead us into truth;
That he thereby might sanctify
us also, as he does.
By whom we may be justified
from sins both great and small,
From which set free we could not be
by Moses Laws at all.
1 These* 1. 10.
He saved us from the wrath to come,
at that most dreadful day:
And was so good to shed his blood
to wash our sins away.
6. PART.
Mat. 21. 9. Rev. 5. 9.
Hosanna to King David's son,
Hosanna to the Christ,
That in the Almighties Name does come,
Hosanna in the highest.
For thou wast slain, and art alive,
redeeming us to God,
From every Nation, Kingdom, Tongue,
by thy most precious blood.
1* Pet. 1. 18. 1 These. 1. 10. Rev. 1. 5.
Corruptive things, as silver is,
and gold redeemed us not:
But the dear blood of Christ our Lord,
a Lamb without a spot.
Even Jesus Christ, who saved us
from storms of future wrath:
Whose love to wash our sins away
made his own blood the bath.
5. 13.
To him that on the Throne sits down
and Christ the Lamb, therefore,
Be blessing, glory, and renown,
and power for evermore.
HYMN LXXIX. SANCTIFICATION.
Ephesians. 5. 14. chapter 4. 17, 18,
A Waken thou that sleep'st in sin,
and stand up from the dead:
And Christ shall let his light break in
whereby thou shall be led.
Then walk not as some Gentiles walk,
in vanity of mind:
Estranged from the life of God;
because their hearts are blind.
19, 20, 21.
Who being past the sense of sin,
let loose to all excess
Of ^^nton and unclean desires,
and that with greediness.
But ye have not so learned Christ,
if ye by him were taught:
And as the truth in Jesus is
have learnt him as ye ought.
22. chapter 5. 11.
The old man that ye do put off,
which is corrupt and vile,
In sinful lusts of former life,
which did your souls beguile.
And have no fellowship at all
with works that shun the light:
But rather such unfruitful works
reprove in open sight.
2. PART.
Ephesians. 4. 24, 23. chapter 5. 8, 11.
Cast off the old man with his deeds,
and put ye on the new,
Made after God in righteousness,
and holiness most true.
And be renewed in heart and soul,
and walk as sons of light:
And prove what things the Lord allows
as pleasing in his sight.
2 Timothy 2. 19, 22, 21. R^m.
And as it is meet, let every one
that names the Name of Christ
Depart from all iniquity,
and by no lust be tic'd.
The purging of our selves from these
will evidently produce
Vessels to honor sanctified,
meet for the Masters use.
Romans 6. 22. 1 Timothy 1. 17.
And being thus from sin made free,
Gods service to attend,
The fruit to holiness shall be
Eternal life the end.
Now to the true eternal King
not seen with humane eye:
The immortal only wise true God
be praise perpetually.
HYMN LXXX. SALVATION SHINING.
Tit. 2. 11, 12,
GOds grace that brings salvation
has shone to every eye:
Teaching us worldly lusts to shun,
and all impiety.
And that we should live soberly,
and in a godly way:
With rigteousnesse, and equity,
while in this world we stay.
13, 14.
That blessed hope still looking for,
and glorious drawing near,
When that great God our Savior
Christ Jesus shall appear.
Who freely gave himself for us,
for our dear sakes to die:
That we might be redeemed thus
from all iniquity.
-- 1 T. 6. 17. Rev. 5. 13.
To purify to his own Name
(from whom this grace proceeds)
A people of peculiar claim
and zealous of good deeds.
Unto the King of kings therefore
that on the throne does sit:
Be honor, glory, praise and power
for ever, so be it.
HYMN LXXXI. SCRIPTURES.
Job. 5. 39.
SEarch Scriptures, for ye hope thereby
eternal life to have:
And those are they that testify
of him that came to save.
Romans 15. 4.
For what of old is registered,
was for our learning penned,
That we, by Scriptures comforted,
might hope unto the end.
2 Pet. 1. 21.
The prophecy came not of old
by man's own private will;
But holy men of God foretold
by heaven-inspired skill.
Isa. 8. 20.
Then to the Law and Testament,
for they that speak not right,
And as this word does represent,
in them there is no light.
2 Timothy 3. 16, 17.
For Scripture's sacred verities
came all by inspiration;
Able to perfect, and make wise
in all things, to salvation.
HYMN LXXXII. The SECRET REVEALED.
1* Cor. 2. 7, 8, 14.
GOds wisdom in a mystery
we speak to perfect men:
But not the wisdom of this world,
nor what is known to them.
For man while merely natural
receives not what we press,
The things of God spiritual
he counts foolishness.
-- Prove. 24. 7. Mar. 4. 11.
Too hard for him to know or learn
(for naturals too high)
And such as nothing can discern
but a spiritual eye.
But unto yo^ (dear Saints) it is,
touching the things of heaven,
To know that kingdoms mysteries,
to them it is not given.
Jude 25.
To God our Savior only wise
be all the praise therefore,
Dominions, Thrones, and Dignities,
Amen, for evermore.
HYMN LXXXIII The SECRET UNREVEAL'D.
Romans 12. 3. Deuteronomy. 29. 29.
BE wise unto sobriety,
as God has given faith,
And dealt to each man diversely
the measure that he has.
The secret things that are decreed
belong to God alone:
But to our selves and to our seed
the things that are made known.
1 Timothy 6. 17.
Now to the blessed Prince of might,
the chief of Kings and Lords,
Who only dwells in endless light,
which (...) affords,
Whom no man can behold and see,
nor ever did see yet:
To him all praise and glory be
for ever; so be it.
HYMN LXXXIV. SOULS under the ALTAR. Give laud, etc.
Rev. 6. 10.
HOw long, O Lord, how long,
thou holy one, and true,
Ere thou avenge our wrong,
and judge, with judgment due,
Them that have spilt
Our blood on earth, and poured it forth,
with haino^s guilt.
Luke 18. 7, 8.
And shall not the most high
avenge his own Elect,
Which night and day do cry,
and pray to that effect?
Though he bear long,
I tell you, he will speedily
avenge their wrong.
Romans 8. 36. Psalm. 44. 23, 24.
But we are killed thus,
all day for thy dear sake,
As sheep they count of us
which they for slaughter take.
O God arise,
Why do thou, yet, our griefs forget,
and our sad cries?
2 These. 1. 6, 7,
But with the Lord, ye know,
the thing is just, and due,
To render wrath and woe
to them that trouble you.
But you, that thus
Afflicted are, shall surely share
sweet peace with us.
-- 8.
When Christ shall come abroad,
in flaming fire from heaven:
And they that know not God
shall have their portion given
Of vengeance meet:
Because that they would not obey
his Gospel sweet.
HYMN LXXXV. Spiritual SHEPHERDS.
Acts 20. 28. 1 Pet. 5. 4.
TAke heed ye Shepherds to your charge,
to feed, with wholesome food,
The flo^k which God has purchased
with his own precious blood.
And the chief Shepherd coming down
from heaven at his great day
Shall crown you with a glorious Crown
that never fades away.
Zach. 11. 17.
But to the Idol shepherd woe,
a sword will God assign
To cleave his arm and his right eye
that leaves the flock to pine.
His Arm, to nothing withered,
clean dried up shall be:
And his right eye so darkened
as not at all to see.
HYMN LXXXVI. The STRAIT GATE.
Mat. 7. 13, 14.
O enter at the narrow gate,
^or wide is that of sin:
And broad the way that leads astray,
and many go therein.
Because the gate to life is strait,
and all the way thereto:
Is (as I say) a narrow way,
and they that find it few.
Luke 13. 24, 30.
Strive then to hit the narrow gate,
the right way to attain:
For not a few (I say to you)
shall strive, and strive in vain.
And there are first that prove the worst
and last (...) first pr^pare:
For in (...) are many called,
but few (...) are.
HYMN LXXXVII. Suffering and Self-denial.
Mat* 10. 34* 21,
THink not, says Christ, that I am come
to send all peace on earth:
But (through malicious minds of some)
a sword must I send forth.
The Father shall the son ^etray,
the daughter her own mother:
Brethren shall brethren seek to slay,
set one against another.
26, 30, 28.
Yet fear not men in these affairs,
nor have them in such dread:
For God has numbered all the hairs
that grow upon your head.
Who kill the body, fear not them,
that then no more can do:
But him that can to hell condemn
both soul and body too.
2. PART.
Mat. 10. 39, 38. Luke 14. 27, 33.
He that does find his life, shall be
at loss of it thereby:
And he that loses it for me,
shall find it gainfully.
And he that leaves not all to loss,
to follow after me,
Nor for my sake takes up his Cross,
my follower cannot be.
Mark 10. 29, 30.
But whosoever lays down all at stake,
forsaking friends and lands,
For me, and for my Gospel sake,
to follow my commands.
An hundred fold shall he regain,
although with persecution
And afterward a life obtain
that fears no dissolution.
HYMN LXXXVIII. Temptations succored.
Heb. 4. 15.
SUch an high Priest we have nor, now,
as is not touched at all
With sense of such infirmities
as on his Saints do fall.
But suffered such temptations
as we our selves fall in:
And was in all points like to us,
but yet excepting sin.
c. 2. 18. 1 Cor. 10. 13. Isa. 40. 31.
In suffering such temptations
the tempted he can aid:
And no temptation takes you,
but what on Saints is laid.
But God is faithful verily,
who will not suffer you
To be assayl'd above the strength
which ye shall still renew.
But will, in all temptations,
provide and order so,
That ye may have a way to escape,
and strength to undergo.
HYMN LXXXIX. The TREE GOOD.
Prove. 21. 27. Mat. 7. 16, 18.
THe sacrifice of wicked men
is hateful to the Lord:
And offered with a wicked mind
is then much more abhorred.
For ^igs of thistles cannot grow,
nor grapes of thorns be had:
A bad tree cannot bear good fruit,
no^ yet a good tree bad.
chapter 12. 35, 33.
From the good treasure of the heart
good men bring forth good things:
And from the evil treasury
bad fruit the bad man brings.
Now therefore let the tree be good
the ^ruit will then be so,
And make the tree an evil one
the fruit the same will show.
3. 10.
And now is the Axe laid to the root,
and therefore every tree
That brings not forth good wholesome fruit
cut down, for fire, shall be.
HYMN XC. TRINITY.
1 John 1. 7. Joh. 6. 57. Luke 11. 13.
THree witnesses there are above,
and all these three are one:
The father, Son, and sacred dove,
one Deity alone.
The living father sent the son,
who by the Fathers lives:
And unto them that ask of him
the holy Ghost he gives.
1 Cor. 12. 4, 5,
Diversities of gifts indeed
there are that he bestows:
But from one spirit all proceed,
who does them so dispose.
And his administrations
great difference afford:
And diverse operations,
but one Almighty Lord.
6, 2 Cor. 13. 14.
All these in great variety
from his good hand do fall:
But one adored Deity
that works all in all.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and love of God, therefore,
And comforts of the holy Ghost
be with you ever more.
HYMN XCI. The VINEYARD.
Isa. 5. 1, 2, 3,
A Vineyard my beloved had,
placed in a fruitful hill:
He fenced it, and plackt out the stones,
and planted it with skill.
Choice Vines he set and built therein
as wine press and a Tower:
Expecting it should bring sweet grapes,
and lo, it brought forth sower.
5, 6,
And now I Will tell you what I Will do
to this my Vine-yard-soil:
I will break down the hedge thereof,
and leave it to the spoil.
I Will lay it waste, unprun'd, undig'd,
for briars and tho^ns alone:
I also will command the clouds
to rain no rain thereon.
7.
The Vineyard of the Lord of Hoasts
the house of Israel is:
The men of Judah are the plant,
that pleasant plant of his.
And when he looked for judgment done
behold great cruelty.
And when he looked for righteousness,
behold a doleful cry.
HYMN XCII. Unity and love of BRETHREN.
Col. 3. 12, 13.
PUt on, Beloved, as Gods Elect,
bowels of mercies kind:
Long-suffering, meekness, sweet respect,
and humbleness of mind.
Forbearing one another long,
forgiving one another:
If any have received wrong
done by his Christian brother.
14. Ph. 2. 2. Ephesians. 4. 3.
As Christ forgave you so do ye
your brethren that transgress:
And chiefly put on charity,
the bond of perfectness.
Of one mind, and one judgment be,
and let all discord cease:
Keeping the Spirits unity
in sacred bonds of peace.
2. PART.
1 Pet. 1. 22. Heb. 12. 1. 1 John 1. 16.
See that ye love with fervency
and with an heart most pure,
And let this love so brotherly
perpetually endure.
For God (we know) is perfect love,
and whosoever dwells herein,
He surely dwells in God above,
and God most high in him.
3. 14. Romans 13. 8.
And hence our change is understood
from death to life above,
Because we love the brotherhood
with true and perfect love.
Owe nothing then to any man
but one to love another:
For he is a perfect Christian
that is a perfect lover.
HYMN XCIII. VOCATION.
1 Cor. 12. 2. Tit. 3. 3.
YE know that we were Gentiles once,
and carried away
To Idols, and dumb vanities,
as we were led astray:
And sometimes disobediently,
and foolithly we swerved,
By diverse lusts and vain delights,
which we our selves have served.
1 Pet. 2. 9.
But a peculiar people now,
a chosen generation,
A royal Priesthood are we made,
and called an holy Nation.
That we should show the praises forth
of him that called us
From darkness great to greater light,
that is most marvelous.
1. 16.
As he therefore that called us
is holy, so must they
That are to his profession called,
be holy every way.
2. PART.
Ephesians. 2. 11, 12, 19,
Remember you were al^ens
from Isreal's Commonwealth:
And strangers from the Covenants
which promise saving health.
But now are ye that were far off
made nigh by Christ his blood:
And fellow Citizens with Saints,
and of the house of God.
20, 21, 22.
Built on the sure foundation
laid down in holy writ:
And Christ himself head cornerstone,
who makes the building knit,
In whom, together built, ye grow
into an holy place,
An habitation of the Lord
by his sweet spirit of grace.
Romans 8. 16.
Which spirit witnesses with ours,
and testimony bears,
That we are made the sons of God,
and if his sons, then heirs.
3. PART.
Jam. 2. 5. 1 Cor. 1. 26,
Hearken, beloved brethren dear,
your call ye plainly see,
How God has chose the poor on earth
full rich in faith to be.
Not many mighty men are called,
not many wise and learned,
Nor yet in many noble men
this calling is discerned.
27. Mat. 11. 26.
But God has chose weak foolish things,
and such as men despise,
To bring to naught, and to confound
the noble, great, and wise.
We thank thee, Father, Lord of all,
that have these things concealed
From many wi^e and prudent men,
and them to babes revealed,
1 Cor 1* 29, 31.
Even so, O father, since it was
thy ^leasure and drecree:
That, ^n thy sight, no flesh on earth
might glory, but in thee.
HYMN XCIV. Wisdoms EXHORTATION. Have mercy.
Prove. 1. 20, 21.
LO, wisdom cries out,
she cries in the streets,
She utters her zealous breath
where all the concourse meets.
In opening of the gates
of Cities populo^s,
She calls, and cries, with words most wise,
exhorting sinners thus.
22, 23.
How long, ye simple ones,
will ye delight in folly;
And scorners in so vile a sin
and fools hate knowledge wholly.
Turn you at my reproof
behold I will pour forth
My Spirit to take hold on you,
I Will show you words of worth.
2. PART. Have mercy* etc.
Prove. 4. 5, 7, 8. chapter 3. 15, 17.
Get wisdom, O my Son,
with all the care thou can:
She is of all things principal,
and most to be advanced.
Of greater price then pearls,
and all desired treasure:
Her paths and ways have all the praise
of perfect peace, and pleasure.
18, 14, 16, 18.
A tree of ^ife to them
upon her that lay hold:
Her Merchandise of greater price
then silver or then gold.
Her right hand length of days,
her left bears wealth and honor:
And happy he (where ere he be)
that lays fast hold upon her.
HYMN XCV. The whole ARMO^R.
Ephesians. 6. 10, 13, 14,
BE strong, my brethren, in the Lord,
and in his powerful might:
Put on your soul his armor whole,
to make you stand in fight.
Stand therefore, having girt your loins
with truth, which ye profess:
And having done the breast plate on
of perfect righteousness.
15, 16,
And with the preparation of
the Gospel of our God,
(The Gospel of his peace and love,)
let both your feet be shod.
And chiefly take the shield of faith,
that so your valiant hearts
May quench thereby, most powerfully,
the wickeds fiery darts.
17, 18.
The helmet of salvation take,
and that two-edged sword:
(The sword of his good spirit it is,)
to wit Gods holy Word.
And always in the spirit pray,
with all requests and prayer:
And watch thereto (what ere ye do)
with constancy and care.
HYMN XCVI. The WILL for the DEED.
2 Cor. 8. 12. Mat. 10. 42.
IF there be first a willing heart,
the Lord the same accepts:
And what one has takes in good part,
and pardons our defects.
Cold water only, one small cup
to a Disciple spared
For that names sake, is sure summed up,
and shall not miss reward.
20. Romans 8. 26. Ephesians. 3. 20,
Nor will he quench the smoking stax,
nor break the bruised reed:
Till judgment have a sure dispatch
with victory to speed.
And though we know not how or what
to pray for as we ought,
His spirit helps our wants in that,
beyond our speech or thought.
21.
To him in all the Church therefore
be glory yet again,
Through ages all for evermore,
by Jesus Christ, Amen.
HYMN XCVII. The WORD Preached. All people. etc.
1 Cor. 10. 4. Heb. 4. 12.
THe weapons of our warfare here
have nothing carnal placed therein:
But mighty thorough God they are,
to pull down all strong holds of sin.
Gods word is such a powerful one,
sharper then any two edged sword:
It parts the marrow from the bone,
and is an heart-discerning word.
1 Pet. 2. 2. Jam. 1. 20.
Then, shunning guile, and malice lewd,
destraction, and hypocrisy,
As babes new born desire the food
of Gods pure word to grow thereby.
And let us set all sins apart,
with meekness to receive and have
Gods Word ingrafted in our heart,
which is of power our souls to save.
HYMN XCVIII. The WORKER of Grace.
2 Cor. 3. 5. Phil. 2. 12.
WE have not the susficiency,
and power of our own,
To think so much as one good thought,
as of our selves alone.
But all our whole susficiency
does of the Lord proceed:
Who works in us most graciously
both the desire and deed.
Jam. 1. 17. Romans 9. 16.
For every good and perfect gift
proceeds from God above:
With whom there is no varying,
nor shadow of remove.
It is not then of him that wills,
nor him that runs the race,
But all our good on us distills
from God that shows grace.
^ude 24, 25.
To God therefore the only wise,
our Savior, strength, and stay,
Be Thrones, Dominions, Dignities,
for evermore, we pray.
HYMN XCIX. The World and the Church.
1 John 5. 19,
WE know we are of God most high,
for we are born of him,
And this whole world most generally,
lies soaking in their sin.
And, lo, the Son of God is come,
and we the same have known:
And he has thus instructed us
to know the faithful one.
20. Rev. 5. 13.
And we are in him that is true,
in jesus Christ his Son:
This is the true God (known to you)
and endless life begun.
Blessing, and power, and praise, therefore,
to him be altogether,
That sits upon the sacred Throne,
and to the Lamb for ever.
HYMN C. Worldly CARES forbidden.
Mat. 6. 31, 25, 32.
O Take no thought solicitons
what you should eat or drink:
And wherewithal you should be clothed
be never toiled to think.
Is not the life much more then meat,
the body then the clothes?
And that your need of these is great
your heavenly father knows.
26, 28, 29.
The sowles that neither sow nor reap,
nor into barnes do gather,
Consider how they are supplied
by your celestial father.
Think how, in fields, the Lilies grow,
that neither toil nor spin:
Yet made that glory no such show
that Solomon lived in.
3^, 25.
And, su^e, if God so cloth the grass
(cut down when at the height)
Shall he no^ then much more cloth you,
O ye of little faith?
Take ye therefore no thoughtful care
for present life, I say,
What ye should eat, or drink, or wear,
for bodily array.
32. 1 Pet. 5. 7. Jude 25.
For after all these things abroad
the greater do pursue:
But cast ye all your care on God,
for he takes care for you.
God only wise our Savior
have all the glory (then)
Dominion, Majesty, and Power,
for evermore, Amen.
FINIS.
