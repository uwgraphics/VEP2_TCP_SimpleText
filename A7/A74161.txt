blazon of the Commonwealth
By the Protector.
A PROCLAMATION For putting the Laws in execution for setting Prices on Wines.
WHerras by the Statute made in the eight and twentieth year of King Henry the
eight, for prizing of Wines, It is provided, That the Lord Chancellor, Lord
Treasurer, Lord President of the Kings most Honorable Council, Lord Privy
Seal, and the Lords Chief Justices of either Bench, or Five, Four or Three of
them, shall have Power and Authority by their Discretions to set the Prices of
all kind of Wines as in the said Statute is expressed; His Highness the Lord
Protector taking notice, That for want of the due putting the said Statute in
execution, the prices of Wines have been of late years raised to excessive
rates, to the great wrong and injury of the people; For redressing therefore of
the said Evil, and preventing the same for the future, and to the end the
Merchants, and others, concerned herein, may have timely notice hereof, His
Highness (by the advice of His Council) has thought fit to publish and
declare, and does hereby publish and declare His pleasure herein; And does
hereby enjoin and require the persons authorized by the said Statute, and all
and every of them to take care, That the Laws and Statutes for setting the
prices of Wines be from henceforth duly put in execution, and the said prices
set accordingly. And His Highness does straightly charge and command all Justices
of Alssize, Majors, Justices of the Peace, Bailiffs and other Officers and
Ministers of Justice, to whom the same does or shall appertain, to take care,
That the Laws and Statutes for preventing the abuses in and about the Sale and
Uending of Wines, be from time to time duly observed, and the Offenders
punished according to Law, as they and every of them will answer the contrary
at their perils.

Given at White Hall this 20. day of July 1655.
