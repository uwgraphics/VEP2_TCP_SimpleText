MEN to this lower world four parts assign,
Since Neptune's Trident, purchased a fourth Tin
All by their Representatives here meet,
And by dumb Signs, each other kindly greet.
Europe Elected Speaker, takes the Chair,
Laws of one common Voice enacted are.

God builds a Babel in your lips again.

To his Friend the Author Of the UNIVERSAL CHARACTER, Upon his design.
BUt can it be? then let no envious breath,
So rare a project Criticize to death;
Then let the world, with common votes decree,
That this for common good Enacted be:
This is no Empsons project to ingross,
Trading for private gain, and public loss;
No gain for Publicans from hence, nor fear
We should of Dutch, or Spanish Plantiffs here.
This a design that sets forth like the Sun,
For universal good, its course to run;
Here Logarithmes, 'yond what Napier finds,
That teach by Figures to Uncypher minds,
And make our hands officious to help out,
Of tongues confusion, made at Babels rout.
Now minds may quit their self-disguising dress,
Of French, Dutch, Spanish, for a free converse,
While hands speak for our tongues: But ah! my friend
Will our divisions agree to attend,
Alas, confounded in our selves, we hate,
We love, we cherish, excommunicate
Divisions, and all divided be,
'Bout all that should reduce to unity;
Were I a Poet (Poets wonders do)
I might from stories make a charm or two,
To open men's ears attention to engage,
To this thy project by a fair presage.
A King of Egypt once, to make conclusion,
Which was the Common tongue, before tongues Confusion,
Put children to a Goat to Nurse, then tried
What they could speak, Beck, Beck, they only cried,
As if they meant to say, it was but vain
To try what was; but to retrive again
One common speech should be thy work O Beck,
Say Poets did they not this work fore-speak?
When nonsense Babel-building spoiled they say,
Each builder ran to his sack in which his pay,
His garlic and his utensils did lie,
They though confounded yet united cry,
Give me my Sack since when Sack is the name,
Alone that in all tongues remains the same,
A common pawn to give us hope to see,
When common thoughts of private gain, might be
A means to help us senses to unite
Into one tongue, again at least to write
The same; that diverse Languages no longer may,
Upon our trading such Embargoes lay,
Sure if the world do but its profit mind,
(Twere strange it should not) thou success wilt find
How ere it prove, an honorable fall,
From rare attempts, leaves nobl'st scars of all.
Nath. Smart. M. A.

To my intimate and ingenious Friend, Mr. BECK, upon his UNIVERSAL CHARACTER,
serving for all Languages.
SPeech is the Index of the mind: Lo, here
The Index of Speech; the dumb Interpreter;
The Iliads in a Nut-shell; Tongues in Brief;
Babel reversed; The traveller's Relief;
Ferry of Nations Commerce; here you may
Pass known, to all the unknown parts. -- Away,
Post me this letter to some Spanish Don,
To the Cham, or Seignour, or to Prester-John;
They all now know my Sense, or here is the key:
The Chart of Dialects, right Cosmo-graphie.
The Heavenly Orbs and we commune just so,
We all their matters by Learned Figures know.
Great Bacon's Soul, my Friend, divides with thee,
He found the Plat, and Thou the Husbandry.
More there have talked on it too. So I hear say
Of the North passage. But who cuts the way?
Nature, that framed so rare an one of thee,
Thought thee most fit for this Epitome:
The Galaxie of Languages; where pack
A thousand lights of words, all in one track.
Mithridate with-the-score-of tongues, recall
Thy pains, and praise; now here is one and all.
'Twere strange if this Prophetic year, which brought [1656]
Such Expectation, should have nothing wrought:
Now see another Deluge come, and then
The world, as was of old, new-fac'd again;
Languages swallowed up, the Ark a flote,
Carrying within't something of every note.
Launch forth my Friend. But stay, make a short stop,
Let me be dead before this see the Shop,
Should thy plot take, my Beck, I fear henceforth,
To loose my Library as nothing worth.
Jos. Wait, M. A.

To the READER.
THis last Century of years, much has been the discourse and expectation of
learned men, concerning the finding out of an Universal Character, which if
happily contrived, soas to avoid all Equivocal words, Anomalous variations, and
superfluous Synonomas (with which all Languages are encumbred, and rendered
difficult to the learner) would much advantage mankind in their civil commerce,
and be a singular means of propagating all sorts of Learning and true Religion
in the world: Such a Character being to be Learned in as few weeks, as the
Latin tongue usually requires years to be perfect in, which is the only
Language many ages have in vain labored to make common, but has proved
attainable to few, save such as have dedicated a great part of their lives to
the study of it.

For the remedy of which evil, the Invention of some easy Character has been
judged necessary, which might be as a Clew to direct us out of this Laborinth
of Languages. And Invitations have been made to such an Enquiry from the
Ficcius L. Bacon. D. Wilkins
Learned, abroad and at home, who have demonstrated the possibility thereof,
and the probability of the worlds ready acceptance of it; which will forget its
old practice, if it refuse any benefit, though it uses not to be sollicitous of
thanking the Author.

The Egyptians of old, had a Symbolical way of writing by Emblems, and
Pictures, which might be read by other Nations instructed in their Wisdom, but
was so hard to learn, and tedious in the practice, that Letters soon justled
them out of the world. Besides, most of their Hieroglyphics were so
Catachrestical, (the Picture showing one thing to the eye, and a quite
different sense imposed upon it) that they justified the Painter who drew a
misshapen Cock upon a Sign-board, and wrote under it, [this is a Bull]

That the Chinois have a general Character, which serves themselves and their
Neighbors, though of different Languages, is affirmed by some that have been
there, and brought home some scraules of it, which are such for their fashion,
that an European with his one Eye (which they afford him) would think they shut
both theirs (they so much boast of) when they drew the shapes of those
Characters; there being no proportion or Method observed in their form, which
causes them to spend many years, beginning in their Childhood, in learning of
it, and that may be the Reason none of our Travelers have been able to bring
away any competent skill in that way of writing. All which inconveniences, I
trust, will appear in a great measure, avoided by the present Character
commended to the practice of the world, which will be evident to such as read
over the Grammatical directions, the fundamentals whereof, in an Hour or two,
may be perfectly Learned; by observing whereof (without further study) the
Reader may make present use of the following Alphabetical Dictionary, taking
out the Characters of any things or Notions, he would express, or expounding
to himself any thing written in this Character, and so save the charges of
hiring Interpreters: Besides, avoiding the danger of being mis-understood, or
betrayed by Truch-men, misrelating his Expressions to Foreign Ears.

I need not forewarn any from attempting to imprint the Dictionary in his
Memory, which were to go about the making of a Rope of Sand. But to expect
within a few Months, a small Treatise, in the nature of Comenius's Janua, set
forth with the Vulgar Language on one side, and the Character on the other, by
which a child of ten years old, learning five sentences a day, may in four
months space be perfect in the whole Character. An elder Industry may double
the number, and consequently in half the time be master of it, for it having
less then five thousand words, they will be comprehended in 500 sentences,
allowing ten words to a sentence, one with another.

It is a Character will fright no Eye with an unusual shape, there being nothing
more generally known among men, all looking upon the figures, and reading them
in their own Language, for the uses of Arithmetic, and also, for secret
Writing, it is the most common Character whereby men endeavor to hide their
Conceptions from an intercepting hand.

Meditating whereof, it pleased God to suggest to me, that it might be improved
to an Universal use, which thought, has many years strugled within me, but
endeavoring to suppress it, I have been made somewhat sensible of David's
experience, that the breast is a bad hearth to rake up fire in. I refer the
Consideration of these things, to the Judicious, and the success to God, whose
Gospel, if by this means it be more propagated in the world, by an opportunity
of discovering the Glorious Truths thereof, unto such from whom hitherto it
has been locked, I shall judge this pains of mine happily bestowed.

To his Ingenious Friend upon his Universal Character.
YOu have unti'd the Riddle, Sir, and purged
Those knotty doubts, Curiosity ere urged,
While by your Art the miracle is brought
To us from Pentecost, and we are taught
By your Character, that the Tongues which set,
Like fire of the Speakers, the Hearers intellect
Enkindled too; since thus while what you write
In ours, by Parthian, Mede, and Elamite,
Is owned their dialect: nor stick you hear,
But nobly you confute too, those severe
Censors of English speech, wh' object the want
Of Grammar in it, and out do that vaunt
Of sweet tongued Sidney, who 'bout to refel
That Cavillation, wittily did tell.
We that way were reprieved from Babels Curse,
Not learning speech at School, but from the Nurse;
But you in this your Art do show, that we
Have Grammar too, and speak it nat'rally
Well, should this Age neglect it, loud tongued story,
Checking their silence, will ring out your glory.
Ben Gifford.

The Scheme of the Art, which is to be learned by heart after the Grammar is
read over.
NOuns are known by the Letters p, q, r, x, set before the Arithmetical figures.

Instead of Cases, the Vowels, a, e, i, o, u, are set after the Nouns and
Participles, Consonants.

The Feminines are known by the Letter f, added to the Syllabical Cases.

The Vowels a, e, i, beginning a Syllable, and having the Consonants, b, c, d,
f, g, l, set after them, express the three Persons of the Pronounes, and the
Six Tenses of the Verbs.

The Consonants, l and m, prefixed to those Syllables, make the Imperative, and
Potential Moods.

The Infiitive present being writ with plain figures, without any letter or
mark before them, is made the Theme, or Root of all.

The Passive Voice is distinguished from the Active, by a line drawn over the
head of one of the figures.

The Plural Number is known by an [s] set after the figures.

Numbers are distinguished from words written with the same figures by a cross.

Derivative Adverbs, have the letter t, set before their figures.

Whatsoever Syllable begins with s, or t, is a Conjunction, or Syllabical
Composition.

CHAP. I.
THe Grammar of this invention has four parts, Orthography, Etymology,
Syntaxis, Prosody.

Orthography shows with what Character every word is to be written, they are
ten, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 0, with a letter or syllable set before, or
behind each word for, distinction of parts of Speech, Cases, Numbers, Genders,
Persons, Tenses, Compositions, Conjunctions, of which the second part of
Grammar teaches.

The Points of distinction of words and clauses in a sentence, are the same
with those of common use; viz. comma [,] which in this Art must be put at the
end of every word, to prevent the confounding of the figures.

The middle of a sentence, if it be long, may be marked with a colon [:] but
the end of a sentence must have a full period [.]

When a Question is asked, put an Interrogation point after the last word of
the Question, thus [?]

A point of Admiration is added as a sign of a wonder [!]

Also, when two words are drawn together, a line is put betwixt them, called
Hyphen [-] as sin-revenging, grace-confirming.

A Parenthesi is used when any words are put between the parts of a sentence,
thus marked ()

CHAP. II.
ETymology teaches the differences of the parts of speech and the forming of
them.

There are seven parts of speech: Noune, Prononn, Verb, Participle.

Adverb, Conjunction, Preposition.

Note, we reckon the Interjections among the Adverbs, as do the Greek
Grammarians.

A Noun is a word, signifying a thing without difference of time, as life,
sweet.

Note, whatsoever word in our English tongue has the particle [a or the,]
before it is a Noune, as [a man] the house:] a Noun is either a Substantive, or
an Adjective.

A Noun Substantive, is that which of it self is sufficient to express its
signification, without the addition of another word, as [man, strength.]

A Substantive is either Proper, or Common.

Note, all proper Names of Men, Countries, Cities, Rivers, etc. found and
signify very like to all Nations, they may be writ in the usual letters, so
that we need not devise Characters for them, but common Nounes have in most
Languages as many several Appellations, as there are several Languages in the
world, to remedy which confusion this Character is invented.

An Adjective is that which requires a Substantive to be joined with it, to
show its signification, as when we say (white) we must add or understand (milk
or snow) or some other Substantive.

Nouns have two numbers, the singular which signifies one, as a book, and the
plural which signifies more then one as (books).

There are two Genders. the Masculine, and the Feminine, the Masculine as [a
man] the Feminin as [a woman] living substances, only didinguish Gender.

Other Nouns both abstract, and Concrete, as (coldness cold) need no
distinction of Gender.

Observe diligently several sorts of Nounes, by the letters which distinguish
them as follows.

p. Noun Subst. personal male p 3, a man abater, or he that abateth, personal
female.

p f p f 3 a woman abater, or she that abateth.

r Noun Subst. real as r 3, an abatement 3.

x Substantive, Active, as (x 3) an abating, or the action of abating, which is
more plain in the words (arming the Active Substantive) and arms the Real
Substantive, the one signifies the action of arming, and the other the Weapons
themselves.

q A Noun Adjective has a (q) set before its Character, as q 317 bold.

There is one declension, or manner of declining of Nouns, which indeed are all
Aptotes, and vary not their Character, but have the five vowels instead of
Cases set after their Characteristica letter.

Singulariter Nominative an Abater. p. 3. Genitive (of) an Abater p a 3. Dative
to an Abater p e 3. Accusative (a or the) Abater p i 3. Vocative (o) Abater p o
3. Ablative (from an) Abater p u 3. The Feminins add f, to the vowels, as Nom.
pf 3 Genesis paf 3 Dat. pef 3 etc.
Pluraliter Nominative, the Abaters p 3 s. Genitive, of the Abaters p a 3 s.
Dative, to the Abaters p e 3 s. Accusative, the Abaters p i 3 s. Vocative (o)
Abaters p o 3 s. Ablative, from the Abaters p u 3 s.

Note, that the letter s, set behind the Character, is a token of the plural
number.

Note, the Nominative and the Accusative Case, differ not in signification,
only the Nominative is set before the Verb, and the Accusative after it. But if
the Nominative be put after the Verb, it will serve as well, (as in the Latin
and Greek Nouns, the Nominative and Accusative are often alike.)

Note, the signs, or prepositions, in, with, through, by, etc. have several
marks which must be taken out of the fifth Chapter of Compositions, and set to
the Nouns and Verbs in composition.

Note it is unnecessary to vary Adjectives, by Case, or Gender, as our English
tongue does not, and the Latin and Greek in many Aptotes.

It is therefore convenient that the sign of the Case be prefixed to the
Substantive, and that the adjective be put after the substantive; but such as
are curious may decline them like Substantives, adding the vowels to their
letter.

Nouns are capable of degrees of comparison, as q 317 Bold.

Comparative, q q 317 Bolder, or more bold.

Superlative, q q q 317, Boldest, or most bold.

All numbers are written with their usual Characters, only that they may be
known from the words written with the like figures, a cross must be set above,
under, before, or behind the figure, as 3 plain, signifies to abate.

The Substantive numeral Cardinal, a tray (as ternio) r 3 +. The Adjective
Cardinal three q 3 + The Adverb Cardinal thrice t 3 + Appertaining or belonging
to three as tertian. tuc 3 +. The Adjective ordinal, third + 3 The Adverb
ordinal, thirdly t + 3 The Distributive, three by three 3 + Compounded with
fold, as threefold or treble. + 3

The Character of Arithmetical Fractions are retained.

CHAP. III. Of a Pronoun.
A Pronoun is a part of Speech, used in showing or rehearsing.

The Pronouns being very few, but of most frequent use, are all set down hear:
The principal, are the three Primitive Persons, I, thou, or you, and he, which
are expressed by the Vowels, a, e, i. and these Pronoun Vowels set before the
letters they are compounded with, which in Verbs and Participles are, b, c, d,
f, g, l. For when the Vowels are put after the letters p, q, r, x, they
signify the Cases of several sorts of Nouns, as was taught in the former
Chapter.

Pronouns are declined just like the Nouns.

Pronouns have no Vocatives, but thou, and my, and our.
Singulariter Nominative, I a Genesis of me p a a Dat. to me p e a Accus me p i a
Ablat. from me p u a Pluraliter Nominative, we a s Genesis of us p a a s Dat. to
us p e a s Accus. us p i a s Ablat. from us p u a s

And so is e, and i, declined, etc.

The Derivative Pronouns are distinguished from their Primitives by an (h) set
before them, in composition with Nouns: They are thus written, My, or mine
Abatement, har 3. Thy Abatement, her 3. His Abatement, her 3. whose Plurals are
Our, Your, Their, as our Abatement hars 3 your Abatement, hers 3 their
Abatement, hirs 3.

Demonstrative Pronouns are (This, and That, or It, and Self, or Same) which
are thus written.

Sing. This Abatement, hor 3. Plu. These Abatements hor 3 s, which is sometimes
called [it] as huac 3 I abated it.

There is also that Personal, as hup 3 That abater, and [This] personal as hop
3. This Abater.

When a word is compounded with [self, or same] as I my self, the same man] it
must have the letter z set to it as a z I my self.

The Relative [which or who, and what the Interrogative,] is known by the
Consonant [v] set after the Pronoun, it relates unto as [av I which.]

The Relative is thus declined, Nominative, which v. Genesis whose, or of whom va.
Dat. to which, or to whom ve. Accus. which, or whom vi. Ablat. from which or
whom vu.

Note, some times [That] signifies [which] as (he that loves, or which loves)
and then it has the same Character. But sometime [that] is a Conjunction, as
[speak that I may hear] for whose Character consult the Dictionary.

Note, When [soever] is compounded with a Relative, then the v may be doubled
(as in Latin quisquis) whosoever. [w]

CHAP. IV. Of a Verb and Participle.
A Verb is a part of Speech which signifies to do, to suffer, or to be. It has
two Voices the Active and the Passive; whatsoever signifies to do, is called
Active, [as to beat] that which denotes suffering, is called Passive, as [to
be beaten.]

Note, Verbs Neuter, as [to Be] set alone, are declined like the Active, which
Verb [Be] in our English tongue prefixed to Participles, forms the Passive
Verbs, as I am beaten, I was beaten, I shall be beaten, etc.

All Verbs have one General Conjugation in both voices, and four Moods, and six
Tenses or Times.

The Indicative Mood affirms or denies any action, or passion, as [I abate.]

The Imperative Mood commands, entreats, or exhorts as [abate thou.]

The Potential Mood has these signs, may, can, might, could, would, or should,
set before the Verb, as [I may abate.]

The Infinitive Mood signifies to do or suffer, without any difference of
Number or Person, and therefore is written with plain figures, and in this Art
is made the root from whence all the other words are derived, as [to abate 3.]

The Tenses of Verbs follow.

Note, instead of Impersonals in English, the pronoun [it] is before Verbs, as
[it pleased God] their Character is hu before the Tenses Characteristical
letters, as hub 3 it abateth.

Note, Verbs are capable of being compared, as the Nouns were, by doubling and
trebling their Tenses Characteristical letter, as Present Positive b 3 abateth
Compositive bb 3 more abateth Superlative bbb 3 most abateth.

And so for all other Tenses.

A Participle is a part of speech, partaking of the nature both of a Noun, and
a Verb; from a Noun it borrows Gender and Case, from a Verb Tense and
signification.

There are six Participles, three of the Active, and three of the Passive
signification. The Active are these; Participle of the present Tense, abating,
boi 3^ Participle of the perfect Tense, he which has abated, doi 3 Future
Tense, about to abate, or he that will abate, goi 3 Passive. Participle of the
present Tense, abated, or he that is abated, boi 3^ Preterperfect Tense, he
which has been abated, doi 3^ Future, to be abated hereafter, or he which will
be abated, goi 3


Note. the Participles may at pleasure be made of any Tense of the Indicative,
or Potential Mood.

They are declined as the Nouns and Pronouns were before.

CHAP. V. Of Adverbs, Conjunctions, and Prepositions.
AN Adverb is a part of speech, joined to Verbs or Nouns (whence some call them
Adnouns) to qualify their signification, as [I justly punish, wilfully blind.]

Adverbs are known by the letter r, set before their Character, as t 3 abatingly

Most derivative Adverbs in English, end in ly as [wisely, foolishly.]

They may be compared by doubling, and trebling their letters, as t 3 tt 3 ttt
3.

A Conjunction, is a part of speech, joining words and sentences together, as
[and, if,] they are few, but of frequent use, and therefore they are expressed
by Monosyllables set before the words they couple with, are to be found in the
Dictionary, and in the last leaf of the Book they are set all together.

A Preposition is a part of speech, set before other parts, as [for, against,
with,] and because the Latin Prepositions are in common use in most Vulgar
Languages, by reason of many words borrowed from the Latin, as [Postscript,
Subscribe, etc.] therefore we have retained such of these Prepositions as are
generally known, yet for the help of the Vulgar, their signification in English
is set before them in an ALPHABETICAL Order.

Above Supra. About Circa. Again Re According to Juxta. After Post. Against, or
[ant] as Antagonist Ant, or an. Among Inter Away, or a, as to avert, or turn
away, or from u. Before, or ante, as antedate Pre. Before, or in presence, as

colloquy.] Con Concerning, pri Counter, or countermand, or contra, signifies
against, ant or [an] Down, Sub Dis, as dislike, Dis Ex, as [to extract]
signifies from, or of, or out of, ex Except, or [saving] or besides, Preter Far
from, precul For, or Pro, as Proconsul, pro For, or before, pre From [the sign
of the Ablative case, u Forth, ex In, in Into, in Inter, as [intermit] inter

Of [signifying pertaining to a thing] is a sign of the Genitive Case, as the
wisdom of God.

[Of] sometimes signifies [from] as, he received money of me, that is, from me
u (Of) sometimes signifies (by) as (smitten of God, Cum Over, signifying above,
as over my head, Supra Over or beyound, as cross over the river trans Out, or
out of ex Per, as to perspire per Pre, as to premise pre Privily clam Re, as
restore Re

Note, (Re) must be set after the word it is compounded with, to distinguish it
from Re the sign of the Dative Case, of real substantives. All other
prepositions should be set before the word they compound.

On, or upon super (on this side) cis on the other side, trans

(To) the sign of the Dative Case.

(To) before a Verb, is a sign of the Infinitive Mood present.

Together Con Toward Erga Under Sub Up, (as go up) supra (Up) sometimes
signifies (out,) as he drinks up the wine ex Upon, or on S per Unto, the same
as To. With, signifying together, as (he dined with me. Con Sometimes (with)
signifies (against,) as (to withstand) (he fought with me ^nt (With)
instrumental, as he fought with a sword Cum (Without) negative, as without
money no (Without) as without the Town; Extra Within Intra

For Expedition in Writing, in Imitatation of the Learned Tongues, Observe
these Compositions.

Desiderative -- (na) as na 3 to desire to abate.

Imitative -- (ne) as ne 3 to abate in Imitation.

Inceptive -- (ni) as ni 3 to begin to abate which the English sometimes
express by (grow,) as I grow old.

Negative -- (no) as no 3 not to abate.

Factive, or Causative -- (nu) as nu 3 to make or cause to abate.

For other Compositions, look the last leaf of the Book.

CHAP. VI. Of Syntaxe.
SYntaxe is the joining together of two, or more words in a sentence, and this
is either Concord, or Government.

There are three Concords, the first, between the Nominative Case and the Verb;
the second, between the Substantive and the Adjective; and the third between
the Antecedent and the Relative (which,) and that when it signifies which,
whose, and whom.

To know all which, note, when you have a Verb Adjective or Relative, ask the
question who, or whom, what? and the word answering to the question, in that
sentence and proposition, shall be the Nominative to the Verb, the Substantive
to the Adjective, and the Antecedent to the Relative, as in this Example; (I
love the Great God which made me: If the question be asked, who loves? the
answer is, I, and that gives the Nominative Case to the Verb.

Secondly, if the Substantive to great be demanded, the Answer is, God;

And Thirdly, the answer to the Question, who made me? shows the Antecedent to
the Relative which.

Note, Howsoever the words in a Sentence be placed for Elegancy, or the Idiom
of any Language, they must be reduced to a plain Grammatical order, that their
Syntax or construction may be known. And therefore it is advised such as
practice this Character, would write plain and orderly, according to the
directions.

Note, Nouns and Verbs being indeed Aptotes, affix the signs to them as has
been taught, and there can be no mistake in this writing.

If two, or more Nouns come together, belonging to one thing, the latter is put
in the same Case with the former, (as Jesus Christ, the Lord our
Righteousness; here Christ, and Lord, and Righteousness, are all the
Nominative Case, by Apposition to Jesus.

Note, In the English Tongue an 's put to the Singular Nunber, is a sign of the
Genitivc Case set before the word that governs it, as (my Fathers Friend) is
Equipollent to the Friend of my Father.)

Note, The sign of the Tense, by the English, is sometime set before the
Nominative Case to the Verb, especially in Questions, as (does your Father
live?) shall I abate?) let me abate; but in this Character the sign of the
Tense must be always set to the Verb; as al 3? shall I abate? lab 3 let mc abate.

CHAP. VII. Of Prosody.
PRosody teaches how to speak and pronounce this Character, for which purpose
one Common Name must be given to each figure, and those are Ten Monosyllables
borrowed from the English names of the figures, which are thus to be pronounced.

on, 1, too, 2, or[to]tre, 3, for, 4, or[fo]fi, 5, sic, 6,

[and in the Plural Number 6s six.]

sen, 7, at, 8, nin, 9, o. 0.

Note, When the Consonants prefixed to the figures, are set alone without
Vowels to spell them with, they are thus to be pronounced; be, cee, dee, fee,
gee, lee, me, nee, pee, qee, ar, soi, tee, vau, we, xee.

Note, when two Vowels happen together, which must be pronounced as two
Syllables, Grammarians set two pricks over their heads, which they call
Diaeresis, as [pii him.]

Note, the Vowels (to prevent foreigners mistake, who pronounce them
differently from us) must be thus pronounced a, as [man,] e, as [the,] i,
ending a syllable, as [35 trefi] to be pronounced as the word [eye.] i, before
a Consonant is short, as (lip) O, ending a word, as [Crow] 34 trefo, o before a
Consonant, sounds short, as [upon,] 12, onto, u, as [under.]

The Dipthong oi, to be pronounced as [boy.]

The Passive mark of figures, as ab 3^, must be pronounced, ab lintre.

For the Accent, or syllable to be raised in each word, observe.

First, If a word be of two syllables, the Accent is in the first, as 34 trefo.

Second, If the word be a Polysyllable, the Accent must be in the Antepenultima
or last syllable but two, (if the Penultima, or last but one have a Vowel next
after it) as 3481, treforaton, but if the Penultima have two Consonants
following it, the Accent must be on it as 3812 treatonto.

For other Polysyllables liberty may be taken of pronouncing them, as shall
seem most pleasant to the ear, as 347 may be pronounced trefosen, or trefosen.

Numerals cross must be called Cruce, as 3^ the cruce tree.

Note this Character thus pronounced, will sound like Greek, having diverse of
its sweetest Cadencies, and is capable of Rhetorical, and Poetical figures.
Look an example of writing and speaking the first Commandment, at the end of
the Book.

Take notice that the Grammar and Dictionary is already Translated into the
French Tongue, for the use of that Nation, other Languages will be hastened.

If any foreigners, shall please to Publish this Character in their own
Countries, in their Native Tongues, I desire the same course may be taken,
which we have observed in the French; viz. That a double Index be made, one of
the Figures in their order set before the words, and another of the words
placed Alphabetically before the Character.

And that care be taken no alteration be made of the Figures. And what
additions shall be judged necessary of words omitted in this Edition, that they
be propounded to public debate, whether necessary or no, and being
Demonstrated to be such, they may be taken in by public Consent in after
Editions.

Note, If you would find any derived word in the Dictionary, which you will
know by putting [to before it, as [sodden,] comes from to sees and by the
Grammatical directions supply marks of Derivation.

Note, The same Character is applied to most words of the same signification,
and therefore when the order of figures seems disturbed in the Dictionary,
know, those figures were set before or after to some word of the same sense:
And that they may be the better distinguished, those repeated figures are of a
lesser size then the other.

Note, Not only proper names need no Character, (as was observed before) but
also many Apellatives, Terms of Art, as [Antithesis,] officine Medicines, as
[Mithredate] and Diverse Plants and Animals, as Arecca, Bonasus etc. have but
one name in most Languages, and therefore we have spared annexing Characters to
them.
