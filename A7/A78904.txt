HUNTINGTON 15. Martii. 1641.
His Majesty's Message to both Houses of Parliament, upon His removal to the
City of York.
HIs Majesty being now in His remove to His City of York, where He intends to
make His Residence for some time, thinks fit to send this Message to both
Houses of Parliament.

That He does very earnestly desire, that they will use all possible industry
in expediting the business of Ireland, in which they shall find so cheerful
a concurrence by His Majesty, that no inconvenience shall happen to that
Service by His absence, He having all that Passion for the reducing of that
Kingdom, which He has expressed in His former Messages, and being unable by
words to manifest more affection to it, then He has endeavored to do by those
Messages (having likewise done all such Acts as He has been moved unto by His
Parliament) Therefore if the Misfortunes and Calamities of His poor Protestant
Subjects there shall grow upon them (though His Majesty shall be deeply
concerned in, and sensible of their sufferings) He shall wash His hands before
all the World, from the least imputation of slacknesse in that most necessary
and pious Work.

And that His Majesty may leave no way unattempted, which may beget a good
understanding between him and his Parliament, He thinks it necessary to
Declare, That as he has been so tender of the Privileges of Parliament, that
he has been ready and forward to retract any Act of his own, which he has
been informed has trencht upon their Privileges, so he expects an equal
tenderness in them of his Majesty's known and unquestionable Privileges
(which are the Privileges of the Kingdom) amongst which, he is assured it is a
fundamental One, That his Subjects cannot be Obliged to Obey any Act, Order,
or Injunction, to which his Majesty has not given his consent: And therefore
he thinks it necessary to publish, That he expects, and hereby requires
Obedience from all his loving Subjects, to the Laws established, and that they
presume not upon any pretense of Order, or Ordinance (to which his Majesty is
no Party) concerning the Militia or any other thing, to do or execute what is
not warranted by those Laws, his Majesty being resolved to keep the Laws
himself, and to require obedience to them from all his Subjects.

And His Majesty once more recommends to his Parliament the substance of his
Message of the twentieth of January last, that they compose and digest, with
all speed, such Acts as they shall think fit, for the present and future
establishment of their Privileges; The free and quiet enjoying their Estates
and Fortunes; The Liberties of their persons; The security of the true Religion
now professed in the Church of England; The maintaining his Majesty's Regal
and just Authority, and settling his Revenue; his Majesty being most desirous
to take all fitting and just ways, which may beget a happy understanding
between him and his Parliament, in which he conceives his greatest power and
riches does consist.

Imprinted at York by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1642.
