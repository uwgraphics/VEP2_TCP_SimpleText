THE HOLY Breathings OF A Devout Soul, IN MEDITATIONS, CONTEMPLATIONS, AND
PRAYERS.

Printed for Josh. Conyers, at the Anchor and Bible, in Cornhill. 1695.

TO THE READERS.
GOod Readers and Friends, such you are to me, however I am or may be unto you;
what God shall cause me here to write, as a Preface, or Apology, is not for my
self at all, but for you all, that is, all for you: I seek not my self herein,
(God forbid) and God forbid I should have a thought, or any itching to speak,
to make you speak in the behalf of me, who am a poor man, a nothing but sin,
(as I am in my self) therefore not fit to be mentioned, no other than to be
lamented, as I am in my self, and God to be praised and glorified, as I am in
him, brought home to him, living in him, and for that I find and know that he
lives in me. I have not, nor I shall not (I trust through Grace) ever
henceforth, go above to speak or write my self, but him that has called me,
and as he shall enable me, and show forth himself in me, and unto me; for I
desire to forget my self with my whole heart, unless to humble me, and to exalt
the honor and praise of my God, who has not only created me, but saved me,
his I am, and his praises I will speak. Wherefore all ye that shall come to see
these lines, and this following discourse, I trust that you shall see the Power
of God accompanying them, and owning them for his own words and works, and if
you find them not on your own Spirits to be his, disown them and me; but I dare
you so to do, whoever you be. Read them I willingly would you did, and, Ah,
would to God it were (all your Portions) to read them with a double Portion of
his Spirit and Presence, which I had when I writ them, that he that gave them
me, would doubly thus give them unto you, then I am sure you would never forget
his loving kindness, nor cease to publish his praises; you would I am sure be
never weary telling others the Love of God to your Souls. O God, that art all
purity, brightness, love, mercy and goodness, compassionate, I most humbly
beseech thee, the Souls of all those that thou have appointed to work on, by
this thy Work; it is, O God, thine not mine, I acknowledge it, I confess it, I
here proclaim and publish it, and do for it desire to speak loudly thy Eternal
and everlasting Praises: fill them all, O God, with thine all, with thy
heavenly overflowings, wherewith thou have so abundantly and frequently filled,
feasted, solaced and satisfied my Soul; breath into them, O God, thine own
sacred breath, and set their affections in a holy flame, that they may burn in
Love and Obedience to ^hy divine and holy Commandments, and ever desire to live
in them, and never to live out of them, and let this heavenly holy fire of thy
Love, consume all other Love that is in them, that is not from thee, nor
according unto thee, that they may be all made holy, as thou art holy, pure as
thou art pure, and perfect as thou art perfect, that shining in thy brightness,
all that see them may know them to be thine, and behold thee in them, and they
in thee: feast them, O God, as thou have feasted me, fill them with ^hy self as
thou have often filled me, give them and make them partakers of all those
heavenly gifts and graces, which thou have many times manifested, and given
unto me: show them, O God, show them thy Kingdom, Power and Glory; overcome
them, Ah overcome them with thy ravishing beauty, dart into their hearts ^ beam
of thy Divine Light, that they may ^ee all things (in some measure) that are in
thee, O Lord, that are in thee, that they may know ^hee as thou art to be
known, and labor to pu^ifie themselves as thou art pure. Ah Lord, ar^ay them
all with the most beautiful and trans^endent glorious Robes of the
righteousness of Jesus Christ, thy dearly beloved Son, that hav^ng put him on,
thou may for ever own them for thine own, and love them with that pure,
perfect and surpassing Love wherewith thou love them, and give them I most
humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ, thine own holy Spirit to direct them to
walk obediently and faithfully henceforth in all the ways of thy Commandments,
to the praise, honor and glory of thy most holy and most glorious Name, the
Edification of the Brethren, and the comfort and consolation of their own
Souls, in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ, that when he shall appear at his
second coming in glory, they may also all of them appear with him.

Dear Friends, I know that God has not given me what he has given me, for my
self alone because that what of it has been already communicated unto others,
he has with the blessing of his own Spirit, made it a spiritual Blessing unto
them; wherefore I have good reason to believe (besides the persuasion of diverse
goo^ Christians) that it will also find acceptance (among you especially) for
whose sakes I do wha^ I do, that is make it public; wherefore if i^ should
meet with any so desperately critical, o^ devilish, as to censure it or me, let
him, o^ them know, that as I fear not, so I care not whatever they say or do
either against the one o^ the other, because I know that God knows bot^ my
heart and my thoughts hereon, and that enough to give me boldness to go on to
do it, an^ ^so to rejoice in the doing of it, because he has and does persuade
^e, that this my labor shall ^ot be in vain, in the Lord. And whoever thou ^rt
that any ways censurest it or me, I shall as ^eartily pray to God for thee and
thy Soul, that God censure thee not for it, but convince thee and convert thee,
even as if thou were a part of any very self, and as if my well-being did
consist ^n thy well-being; for be thou whatever thou ^rt, though I hate thy
sin, and be off(...)d at it, ^et I truly and in all faithfulness love thy self
and thy Soul, and would with my heart that it ^o so well with thee as it does
(through the free Grace, Love and Mercy of God in Jesus Christ) with ^ne. And I
shall continue to contend with God ^n the behalf of thy Soul, and the pardon of
thy ^ns, as for my own. I know what it is to be ^ great sinner; and I also know
(through the ^nfinite and incomprehensible Love of God) what ^t is to be
washed, cleansed, pardoned, justified, ^anctified and saved from all sin, and
to be (in Christ) without spot, or wrinkle, undefiled. And therefore I cannot,
(in humility I speak it) but as God, love all Souls with true and unfeigned
Love, heartily praying and desiring that none might perish, but that all might
come to partake of everlasting life, to enjoy for ever those heart and Soul
ravishing joys that God has prepared and laid up for all those that truly
love him.

I intend not to speak any thing touching the method, nor to crave the excuse
of any for any thing that may not savor with them. I know from whom I have
received it, and he I am sure will patronize and protect it, and bless it in
some measure, I hope, unto all that shall read it but whatever success it find,
I shall find I am sure all that I seek for, which is peace within during this
life, and honor, glory and immortality in the World to come, which, good Lord,
grant for Christ his sake unto all those that love thee, an^ wait for thine
appearing: And thus, dear hearts, I leave you to the guidance of the goo^
Spirit of the Lord, to direct you in all your thoughts and words, that they and
all your actions, as well as mine may be now and always acceptable in his
sight, who is our Strength an^ our Redeemer, to him who is able to keep you
from the hour of Temptation, and to preserv^ you blameless unto the hour of his
coming, commit and commend you, remaining,

In London, Anno 1654.
IN the Name of the most Holy, Glorious and blessed Trinity, God the Father,
God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost; one God blessed for ever, to whom be given
and ascribed, as all due is, and to none else, Honor, Glory, Power, Might,
Majesty, Dominion and Thanksgiving, by me and by the whole world of his Elect,
Now and for Evermore, Amen, Amen. So be it, Lord, so be it.
THomas Arundell, the poorest, vilest, basest and unworthiest of all the
servants of the living God, altogether unworthy of that most Worthy, Glorious
and right Honorable Title, but trusting on his mercy and free Grace to be made
worthy, through the merits and worthiness of Jesus Christ, and in him to be
accounted worthy; Does in all humility of heart most humbly beg and implore his
Divine Majesty, in Jesus Christ, to inspire, bless and assist him with his holy
Spirit, that he may here following set down only the sincere breathings and
longings of his soul in truth and sincerity of heart, and that he may grow
daily from one degree of grace unto another, from step to step, until he come
to that height and fullness of measure of holiness, appointed by God in Jesus
Christ, who is the Fountain, the Ocean and the fullness of all Happiness and
Blessedness, being God equal with the Father, Blessed for ever and ever.

A Prayer.
O Most Holy, most Glorious, Eternal, incomprehensible Lord God, full of Grace
and Truth, Maker and Giver of all things both in Heaven and in Earth, from all
Eternity unto all Eternity, thou art, and there is none besides thee, God
blessed for ever and ever: Thou give, O Lord, freely, fully and continually,
and art never weary nor repentest, all our springs are in thee and from thee,
thou can not increase nor diminish, whatever is done for or against thee: Ah
Lord my God, give me so much of thy self, as I may be like unto thee in all
things by grace here, and in glory hereafter; that I may steadfastly,
faithfully, heedfully, carefully and circumspectly do thy whole and holy will
on earth, until I come to glorify thy Name in Heaven.

O Lord conform my will unto thy most holy and most blessed will, that I may
serve and please thee by all my thoughts, words and actions, not turning aside
to the right hand of pleasures, or to the left hand of profits. Let thy most
holy and most blessed Spirit teach me, lead me, guide me, and so direct and
govern me, that the thoughts of my heart, the words of my mouth, and the works
of my hands may be now and always acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my Strength
and my Redeemer.

O Lord that searchest all hearts, and triest the Reins, pondering all our
actions, be pleased in Jesus Christ to look down upon me, poor vile sinful
dust and ashes, the greatest of sinners, and the very worst of the worst of
men, and for his sake wash away all my iniquities, and purge me from all my
sins and my transgressions, known or unknown, secret or revealed, past, present
and to come, and for the merits of that most dear and precious blood of thy
dear and only Son, which was (I believe) shed for me on the Cross. O Lord grant
that I may appear blameless and spotless before thy Throne of Grace and Justice
at all times when I come before thee, that thou may have delight in me, and
in all the works of my hands, and may according to thy good promise
graciously hear and answer my petitions and requests, which I most humbly and
unfeignedly desire may be framed in my heart by thy holy Spirit, that they may
be according to thy holy mind and will, and find acceptance through the
mediation and merits of thy dear, only and beloved Son Jesus Christ the
Righteous.

And grant, O most merciful and loving Father in Jesus Christ my Redeemer,
that I may set down from time to time the only Dictates of thy holy and most
blessed Spirit unto my poor Soul, not any head-notions, but my very hearts
frame and only desires and motions; that they may both then and ever after
refresh, rejoice, glad and comfort me, and cause me to bring forth fruit to
newness and amendment of Life, for the honor and glory of thy great Name; and
grant that I may ever renounce all merit or worthiness in my self for the very
least of all thy mercies, even for the crumbs that fall by thy providence from
the Childrens Table.

Sure I am the more light I have from thee, O Lord my God, I shall the better
and clearer see my own darkness; the more I have of thy wisdom, the better I
shall see the foolishness of all worldly wisdom, and the errors of my own
ways; the more I have of thee, the less I shall have of my self; the more thou
shall be pleased to give me, the less I shall confess I deserve, and the more
thou shall be pleased to lift me up, the lower I will cast my self down: Ah
Lord God, teach me to know my self that I may hate my self; teach me to know
thee rightly, not in the History only, but in the mystery also; not only
without, but also within, that I may love thee in fear, and fear thee with true
unfeigned sincere spotless love: wean me, O Lord, from the World and the
World's loves, let me dye to the World and to all things in it, that I may live
to thee. Ah take me from the world, ere thou take the world from me; fit me
for thy self; ere thou take me to thy self: let my last days be my best days,
and my last thoughts my best thoughts; let me not live one moment longer than
to do thee service, and let that only be my aim and my end, let thy work be my
wages, and thy wages my work. O Lord God in Jesus Christ, I most humbly beseech
thee to perfect and accomplish that good work which thou have begun in me, for
all my hope, trust and confidence is in thee, that thou will never leave me nor
forsake me; Ah Lord, do not leave me to my self at any time, for I shall undo
in one moment all thy doings, so great is my skill, power, strength, mind and
will to all evil, against all good. But O my God, do thou continue to restrain
my will and constrain it to thy will, and to the faithful and entire obedience
of all thy Laws and divine Commandments. Write thy Laws of grace in my heart,
and thy Statutes in my mind, by the finger of thy holy Spirit, and suffer me
never through any temptation to depart from them, but let them be a lanthorn to
my feet and a light unto my paths, to lead, guide, direct and govern me in the
ways of righteousness and holiness, that I may live the life of the righteous,
in the midst of this crooked, froward and perverse generation. Ah Lord, suffer
not the mountains of my sins, nor the Rocks of unbelief to hinder thy mercies
from descending into my Heart by thy holy Spirit, nor my Prayers from ascending
up unto thee by faith. Let thy mercies draw me, and thy judgments drive me,
that I may run and not grow weary, that I may walk and not faint. Be, O Lord,
my God, I most humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ, a savor of life unto life
to my Soul, and of death unto death to my sins, and let thy holy and most
blessed Spirit of grace, that knows thy whole, holy and sacred mind and will,
lead me, teach me, direct me and instruct me in all the things I shall take in
hand to do; and give me, O Lord, I beseech thee, those things, and those things
only that may draw me nearer and nearer unto thy self, to make me thine and
only thine, that I may be wholly thine, holy thine, always thine, and ever
thine, that living here in thy fear, I may dye in thy favor, and after death
be made partaker of Eternal Life, through Jesus Christ my blessed and alone
Savior and Redeemer, for whom I desire ever to bless thee as the Lord my
Righteousness; and to whom with thy glorious, holy and sacred Majesty, thy
eternal and blessed Spirit of grace, be given and ascribed by me, and all
thine, as all due is, Honor, Glory, Power, Might, Majesty, Dominion and
Thanksgiving, Now and for Evermore,

Amen.

of my hands, be ever acceptable in thy sight, who art my Strength and my
Redeemer.

SPIRITUAL MEDITATIONS, Being the Gifts and Dictates of GOD's SPIRIT; OR, The
Hearts Frame and Language, that desires to be made Spiritual, and to live
spiritually.
1. O God my God, who art all things, and give all things freely, willingly,
abundantly, and continually, therefore of thee in Jesus Christ do I humbly ask
all things.

2. Give me thy self, O God, and I will confess that I have all those things I
ask.

3. For unless thou give me thy self, I esteem that I have nothing, though
thou keep nothing else from me.

4. I know that there is no perfect perfection here, and therefore we cannot
live without sin; but O most gracious and most merciful Father, lay them not
to my charge, but bury them all, past, present, and to come, in the grave of my
blessed Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ.

5. I will ever seek thee, O God, whom my soul loves, desire thee only, and
lay hold and depend on thee alone.

6. Let, O God, the things of the world be unto me, as I was unto thee (whilst
I was in the world, out of thee) even as a menstruous cloth, and filthy rags.

7. Thy mercies, O God, are the hid Treasures which my heart seeks, and
longs to enjoy.

8. Thy love, O Christ, is much sweeter to my taste, than the honeycomb, and I
desire it much more than gold, yea above all the worlds treasure, good, and
glory.

9. I am sure I shall be able to rejoice, in and under any, yea all
afflictions, if thou do not afflict me, O my God and my Father in Jesus
Christ, with thy absence.

10. He is in heaven though on earth, that does truly love thee, and only love
thee; and heaven is in him, because thy love is in him, because thou love
him; thy love, O God, being the Heaven of Heaven in Heaven, the best of Heaven.

11. Do unto me, O God, what thou will, and do but only tell me that thou will
it.

12. Were I in hell for thy sake, that is, absent from thee, I could and would
rejoice, ^or it is my Heaven to please thee, my God, who have and do so much
delight me.

13. Let me be but esteemed in thy eyes, Oh my Jesus, my sweet, my dear, and
pre^ious dear delight, and I shall not value, ^ut contemn all the ill looks of
all others eyes.

14. I had much rather be a Paul, a Job, or a Lazarus, than a Solomon; be
ignominious all my days and honor my God always, than be honorable all my
days, and dishonor my God but one day.

15. Of all afflictions, O God my God, let not sin be my affliction, afflict me
not with sin, for sin.

16. A wounded heart, a heart wounded with sin, who can bear?

17. What burden so intolerably heavy as the burden of one sin only, if the
Lord lift it not up with one of his fingers?

18. I ask nothing in Heaven or Earth, but God in Christ.

19. God in Christ is all things; for all things out of Christ are to me
nothing, he is my joy and my Salvation.

20. I had much rather, methinks, be ever afflicted, than never afflicted
(whilst on earth.)

21. Though by thy free grace, O God, thou have in love and mercy brought me
home unto thee, yet thou have used affliction as the means, therefore do I love
and k(...) the Rod, because thou have appointed it.

22. I love affliction, because it was the hand by which thou did, O God,
lea^ me out of affliction, that is out of sin.

23. I love affliction, because by it thou have taught me to love thee, yea so
to love thee, as I love nothing in comparison o^ thee, but all things in
subordination to thee

24. I love affliction, because in it I saw thee in me, and my self in thee.

25. I love affliction, because by it I saw that thou did love me.

26. I love affliction, because it taught me to love thy Statutes, to choose
them, embrace them, and delight in them.

27. And I will love affliction, because it will keep me in the ways of thy
Statutes.

28. I love afflictions, because they are lovely, and sent from thee the God of
Love, to me in Love.

29. I love afflictions, because thou have sanctified them to me, and me by
them.

30. I love affliction, because since that I was deeply afflicted (for sins) I
have not been afflicted with sins triumph, nor with reign.

31. I love afflictions, because thou have made them, O God, unto me lovely.

32. I love afflictions, because thou have ever sweetened them unto me by
Sanctification.

33. I love afflictions, because by them ^hou have taught me how to bear
afflictions.

34. I love afflictions, because by them ^hou have taught me how to afflict my
self, that is my flesh for sins afflictions.

35. O my God, give me what afflictions ^hou wilt, so by them thou suffer me
not to ^fflict thee, who, I know, never took'st pleasure to afflict me.

36. If I had not known afflictions, me^hinks I had never sought to learn to
know ^hee, nor thy knowledge.

37. If I had not been undone, I may justly ^ear I had been for ever undone.

38. Give me, O Lord, as many sanctified afflictions as thou please, for then
in the midst of them I am sure I shall please thee.

39. O Lord suffer not any affliction to afflict me with murmurings or
repinings, which I am sure will afflict thee.

40. I desire ever to praise thee, O Lord, ^or that I never had affliction in
the flesh, to ^y remembrance, but it brought me comfort in the Spirit.

41. So that I may say (through grace) ^y afflictions have been my best and
choicest ^enedictions.

42. So esteeming them, give me, O Lord, his grace, to esteem them as tokens
and ^gns of grace.

43. O Lord make me ever thankful f^^ all these thy afflictions which deserve
much thanks.

44. O Lord I heartily thank thee for the thou have made my heart such, as it
do truly thank thee for them.

45. Give me grace, O Lord, to will the Will, and to submit to all thy Wills
will.

50. O Lord, I am willing to do any wo^^ so it may be thy work.

51. Thy glory, O Lord, is my only lo^ing, my only joy, delight, desire, aim
and en^

52. O Lord let me never be ashamed do thy work, though never so mean in eyes
of Men, let it be always beautif^ honorable and glorious to my eyes, he^ will
and affections.

53. Give me Christ, O God, on any ter^ and conditions, and I will confess them
be honorable terms, and conditions adv^tagious and glorious.

54. I had much rather hay Commun^ with Christ (in a Dungeon) than be adorned
and ever possess all Solomon's outward glory in a Palace.

55. Communion with Christ will, I am sure, make me content in all places and
conditions.

56. In Christ, I am sure, there is fullness of joy, and all true peace and
comfort, though without any of all the worlds comforts.

57. In Christ there is all pleasure, though in the World frowns, disgrace and
displeasures.

58. In Christ there is true light, though in the World dark Dungeons.

59. Thy smiles, O Christ, my Christ, are my Heaven, and thy frowns let me
never know, for I fear them as the worst of Hell.

60. Let me enjoy that Heaven, and I care not for all other Hells.

61. Ah sweet Jesus, let thy will be my will, that my will may be always
according to thy will.

62. Let nothing, O Lord, satisfy me, but my assurance of being in thee, and
thou in me.

63. Let me always, O Lord, meditate on thy love and mercies in loving me.

64. Ah suffer not any thing in this world of this world to content or delight
me, unless thou be in it, my sweet Jesus.

65. O Lord grant that as often as I do sin, I may sigh and sorrow for sin, and
earnestly desire to sin no more.

66. Grant that I may set all my affection^ and love on thee (my dear Savior
and Sovereign Lord, who art the Father's Glory the Heaven of Heaven in Heaven.

thy hand, though heavy on me.

68. Ah Lord be thou always all my thoughts, all my joy, and the only and al^
the rejoicing of my heart.

69. Grant that I may always love thee O my Lord, more than my Life, yea tha^
the life, that is, the Salvation of my Soul.

70. Grant, O Lord, that I may not so much, by much, labor for the joys o^
Heaven to my self, as to do thy will or earth in love only to thy self.

71. Grant, O Lord, that all my solac^ may be in uprightness of heart to serve
thee

72. O Lord give me grace, that whilst am on Earth, I may labor to do thy will

with thee the Spirit of Grace, my sole comforte^ and only comfort.

74. Grant that I may will nothing but the will, O thou my Father in Jesus
Christ which art in Heaven.

75. I had rather have thy smiles in Hell, my sweet and dear Jesus, if it could
be, ^en thy frowns in Heaven.

76. I had much rather, if it could be, be Hell and obey God, then in Heaven
and against him.

77. O God, give me, I most humbly be^ech thee for Jesus Christ his sake, those
^ings, and those things only, both for soul ^d body, on earth, that may prepare
me, ^d make me fittest for Heaven.

78. I had much rather choose death, ^en choose to sin.

79. Though I cannot live without sin ^re, yet whilst I live here, suffer me
not, O ^od, at any time to consent unto sin.

80. I do believe that Christ Jesus is my Je^^s and my Christ, and that he
makes inter^ssion for me every moment, and ever will, ^en to my very last
moment.

81. I had much rather enjoy affliction ^ith enjoying thee, O my Savior, then
all ^anner of prosperity if thou do not pros^r it.

82. As long, O God, as thou give me ^ead, water and grace, I will
acknowledge ^t I have sufficient, meat, drink and ray^ent, yea that I fare
deliciously, and am ^ayed more gloriously, then if I were with ^rple scarlet
and fine linen.

83. To do thy work, O God, is the wag^ I desire, and which will and shall ever
content me.

84. Ah Lord, I praise thee for that tho^ have given me a heart to be willing
to pa^ from all things most willingly, so I might part from all sin also.

85. Dispose of all things as thou will, ^ God, do but only leave me thy self
in po^session.

86. All good thoughts come in love, ^ God, from thee, to me, but woe me,
m^serable me, for that all evil thoughts com^ from my self in hatred to thee.

87. Good Lord, make my heart and a^ my thoughts such, that I may be only suc^
and always such as thou would have n^ to be.

88. Do thou, O Christ, live and reign b^ thy power and might in me, that the
might power and reign of Sin may be cast out me.

89. Let not the things of the Worl^ put thee, O Lord, out of my mind, nor s^
out of my heart to abhor it.

90. Give me, O Lord, grace and pow^ to Conquer and cast out all worldly lusts
a^ affections out of my heart, that there be place for thee, and thee only to
dwell i^ my sweet Jesus.

91. Grant, O Lord, that I may esteem the ^orlds gifts without thee, my
S^viour, as ^e Devils gifts, that will destroy me.

92. Grant, O Lord, that I may ever be^eve and esteem my best duties and
perfor^ances (as from my self) to deserve no^ing but shame and confusion, being
but as ^lthy rags, and a menstrous cloth, and ^at I am less and less worth at
the best, then ^e least of all thy mercies.

93. Nothing but thy blood, O Lord, can ^ash me, nothing but thy death could
satis^ie for me, nothing but thy resurrection can ^aise me, and nothing but thy
living, can ^hake me live.

94. Let thy blessed Ordinances, O Lord, be more delightful to me then my meat
and drink, and sweeter to my taste then the honey and the honeycomb, let them
much more please me then the pleasures of Egypt, which ^re but for a season.

95. I had much rather have nothing of ^he world, and hate it, then all the
world and love it.

96. I had rather be the poorest in the world, then the richest, as for my own
good and profit alone.

97. I am more afraid of honor then of dishonor, of riches then of poverty,
of high degree, then of low degree, of applause, then of contempt or scorn, of
health the of sicknes^, and of my life then of my death yet I know that God is
all, and in all these therefore I will fear neither, for I know tha^ that which
he gives is the best, and I sha^ profit best by it.

98. Ah that I had so much grace, as to b^ always able to meditate on the love
an^ sweetness that is in my Savior, I would not leave that blessed condition
of Communion with him, (one hour) to gain all tha^ the world has to give.

99. Surely, If I could always think o^ my Savior, I would willingly always
thin^ on him, I would not only have him in a^ my thoughts, but I would have him
be a^ my thoughts.

100. One moments Communion with the Spirit of grace, were to be preferred
incomparably above all the pleasures and sweets o^ sin, though their end were
not bitter, bu^ sweet.

101. I would willingly lose all that ^ have of the world, if so be I could
lose the thoughts of it likewise.

102. I would much rather have not any thing of the world, and be not of the
world, then have all it has, and be of it.

103. I cannot be poorer then to have the world, and love it; nor richer, then
to be without the world, and hate it.

104. Though I cannot remember what I ^ould, yet I remember well, I never did,
or I do not do what I would.

105. I had rather say nothing then my ^wn words, when I speak by Prayer, or
any ^ther way unto God.

106. Oh blessed Spirit, Sanctify my ^houghts and my words, when I take upon
^e to speak unto the People of God.

107. Oh sweet Jesus, present, I most humbly beseech thee, my prayers, and my
self unto thy Father, that he may receive and accept of both, through thy
merits and mediation.

108. O God, my God, give me grace so ^o live as I may be always ready,
willing, and rejoice to dye; let thy time be my time, whether it be sleeping or
waking, on thy day, or on ours, whilst I am doing thy work or mine own, thy
time and thy will ^e done, O Lord, not mine.

109. O Lord let me never leave sighing ^or sin, till I leave sinning.

110. Let sin, O Lord, be much more bitter unto me after repentance, then it
was sweet before repentance.

111. Let me, O Lord, esteem any death much sweeter, then the bitter life of
any sin* though it live but a moment in me.

112. Give me, O Lord, any afflicti^ unless that which I cannot bear, (sin.)

113. Let me live so long here, O Lord till I am utterly dead to all sin, and
sin de^ to me, and then, Lord, take me to thy s^ when thou will, that I may
live for ever thee and with thee.

114. O Lord, though thou give me p^verty and Contempt with the grace of
content, I shall be as rich and as honourab^ as I desire.

115. Take my thoughts, O Lord, from the World, and then take the world from me
as soon as thou will.

116. Give me, O Lord, so much grace love thee, that it may extinguish all oth^
loves that are in me.

117. Make me, O Lord, thy Servant, a^ let me know it, and I will never desire,
n^ ask any other Honor or Condition.

118. I would much rather have Christ me, and doubt it, then not in me and
b^lieve it, rather such true sorrow, then su^ false joy.

119. If Christ were not in Heaven, would not desire to be there, my desi^
should be, to be where Christ should be.

120. Let me so love thee, O Lord, as may always fear thee, and so fear thee, ^
I may ever unfeignedly love thee, let the^ ^wo graces be never severed from me,
nor I from them.

121. Let no sin keep me from thee, but ^et every, and all sins drive me unto
thee; for I know that thou art a God, pardoning all Sins and Blasphemies, all
iniquities and transgressions of such as repent, and resolve to do so no more,
and I know that thou art my God, and Father in Jesus Christ.

122. Love me then so, O Lord my God, I humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ, as
to keep me unspotted, that is from sinning against thee, either in thought,
word or deed, wittingly, or willingly.

123. Let thy Mercies, O Lord, my Lord and my good God, so draw me, and thy
Judgments so drive me, as I may never be at rest nor quiet, until I come to
have quiet rest between thy breasts, my dear, my sweet and saving Jesus.

124. Let me, O Lord, so think on the world, as to hate it more and more, until
thou give me so much grace so to hate it, as to think on it no more.

125. Let me not, O Lord, live so long as to desire to be younger to live
longer.

126. But let me rejoice in my age, for that I am nearer the death of Sin, and
the life of Eternal Glory.

127. Make me, O Lord, not only such as I desire to be, but such as thou would
have me to be, which is, I trust, to be ^ with thee and in thee.

128. I desire, O Lord, not only to what I would be, but what I should be.

129. It is in thee, O Lord, to give things, for thou art all things, therefore
thee do I humbly beg all things.

130. Let me not live one moment long after I have done the work of my Genera^
on, that is, not live for my self, but ^ thee, O Lord.

131. Let my will, O Lord, be only to ^ thy will, to will thy will, and to
submit thy wills will.

132. Let me be wholly thine, holy thin^ only thine, always thine, and ever
thin^ here in thy Kingdom of Grace, and herea^ter in thy Kingdom of Glory.

133. I had much rather have the punis^ment of Sin and not sin, then the evil
Sin and no Punishment.

134. Ah how sweet is it to want the worlds sweets, and in its want, to find n^
want, but even in want most to abound.

235. O Lord, thou know I desire no so much the world, as to have my
thought^ and affections taken from the world.

136. Could Heaven and Eternal life b^ purchased, for to choose and commit on^
^n willingly) I would not purchase nor ^ave it on that condition, but rather
de^end on the love and mercy of God, in Je^s Christ.

137. I am sure God is my God, because ^e has given me a heart to fear him in
love, and to love him with fear and trembling, to ^ejoyce in his Statutes, to
desire to do his ^ill universally, and to depend and trust ^n his sure mercies
and faithful promise in jesus Christ.

138. I am sure God did ever love me, because I am sure he does now love me,
and therefore I am sure he will ever love ^e, for where he once loves, he ever
lo^eth, and did ever love.

139. I am sure God loves me because ^e has given me a heart to hate all sin
uni^ersally with a sincere and perfect hatred, ^oth in thought, word and deed.

sin^ere, sound and unfeigned repentance, from and for all sin, esteeming all

my ^ongings and desires are to do all his will.

142. I am sure God loves me, because find his Yoke easy, and his burden
light.

sincerely desire to love him, a thousa^ thousand times more then my own self.

145. I know God loves me, because love him most for himself.

146. I know God loves me, because desire nothing so much, as to be his

to love, and has made me to hate what I loved, and to love what I hated.

153. I know God loves me, because I love all things for his Glory, all things
in subordination to him, who is all things.

154. Ah sweet Jesus, give me so much love to love thee here on earth, as thou
lovedst me when thou were here, for I cannot self love thee enough, nor soon
enough.

155. Ah that I had ever loved thee, and never loved sin.

156. Ah Lord, give me this great grace of love that I may forget all other
love, forsake all other love, and hate all other love, that shall in the least
hinder my love to thee or lessen my loving of thee, for my soul desires only
to love thee.

157. Thou only art lovely, Ah my sweet Jesus, and my only beloved.

158. O Lord my God, let my love to thee increase, as my life shall decrease.

159. And as I draw nearer to thee, let me, O Lord, find thee more lovely, and
more and more to love me.

160. Let me so love thee, O Lord, my Lord, as I may love thee only, serve thee
only, fear thee only, and b^ delighted, r^vished, and comforted in and with thy
love.

161. With thee, O Lord, I leave my s^ as a token of my love, A^ give me thin^
and let us never change.

162. The love, O Lord, I have for thee^ confess I had from thee, it being now
in m^ O let us both abide, and let me dwell thee.

163. Let it never be separated from thee nor me, but of two let us be made on^
and never more be alone.

164. My whole desire, O Lord, is to ^ thy will, it is to thee, and to remember
the

165. O Lord, lead me by thy holy an^ blessed Spirit, that I may never be led
astra^

166. Let me not, O Lord, do any thing b^ my self, as for my self, but all
things by the self, and for thy self.

167. Be thou always with me, that I man never be without thee, O most holy an^
blessed Spirit, my Sanctifier, that I may b^ all; and always sanctified.

168. Let me love thee, O Lord, more for thy Service sake, then for my Souls
sake.

169. Let me desire and long for Heaven more to do thy will, then to have my
will^

170. O Lord, if thou were not in Heaven I would not desire Heaven, but my
desir^ should be, to be with thee.

171. O Lord, let the same desires be i^ me whilst I am on earth, as shall be
in me^ when I am in Heaven.

172. The desire of my heart and soul, Lord, thou know is only to thee, and
^ thee, and to be always guided by thee.

173. Increase this holy desire in me, O ^rd, until my soul and body shall be
filled ^th thy blessed fullness.

174. O sweet Jesus, dwell in me ever, ^d go not out of me never, for when I
^ve thee, Lord, I have all that I desire ^d crave.

175. I am most willing and ready to ^se my life to preserve thee, O Lord, but
^t to preserve my life to lose thee.

176. O Lord, what thou have given me, which is all, take when thou will, and
in that manner thou will.

177. Make, O Lord, thine own Conditions ^ith me, I will make none with thee,
but ^ obey thee, and serve thee on thine own ^rms.

178. Teach me, O Lord, to know my ^lf as thou know me, and to hate my ^lf
for Sin, as thou lovedst me when I was ^ my Sin.

Sin as from ^y wrath, O great God.

180. With thee I desire to leave and give ^y self, O sweet Jesus, receive me,
and ac^ept of me.

181 O Lord go with me where I an^ go, tha^ I may be always with thee, n^ from
^hee, nor do any thing without the

183. I fear Sin much more then the thor of Sin.

184. Sin is my worst, my greatest, my strongest Enemy.

185. Give me Grace and strength sweet Jesus, to conquer Sin, and I shall fear
all other Enemies

186. Had I but one sin unforgiven, thou should, O Lord, make me my ^ Judge,
I should, and could not do ot^ wise, then condemn my self for ever ^ Hell.

187. I desire ever to magnify, la^ praise, and extol thy glorious name, O L^
God, for making Jesus Christ my Judg^ whom thou have appointed also to be my
(...)vocate.

188. Were I to choose, I would cho^ no other for both.

189. For sure I am, I cannot lose ^ cause, if he plead it, nor be condemned,
judging me, who was judged and co^demn'd for me.

190. He dyed for me, and therefore shall not see that death.

191. He has paid my ransom, and there^re I must be acquitted.

192. He has suffered, and therefore I all ever reign.

193. He wore a Crown of Thorns, that might ever wear a Crown of an Eternal ^d
incomprehensible weight of Glory.

194. He is risen and has led Captivity ^aptive, that I might be delivered for
ever ^t of all Captivity.

195. He is ascended up on high, and ^erefore I am sure he will lift me up unto
^m.

196. He is gone to prepare a place for ^e, therefore I am sure I shall be for
ever ^ell placed.

197. He is sat down on the right hand ^f God, and has convinced and
conquered ^ll my accusers and enemies, therefore I shall in quiet rest, and
perfect peace, sit ^own with him, and by him.

198. He has all power and Authority ^iven him by God, therefore I am sure no
^ower shall or can hurt me.

199. He has provided a place for all his Children and Servants, therefore I
will not ^e afraid nor fear.

200. He has promised, and he is faithful, therefore I will believe and not
doubt, but rejoice.

201. O Lord, let me fear nothing but ^ nor love nothing but thy ^ear

202. My love, O Lord, to thee, is su^ thy love to me.

203. O Lord, put the vail of thy fea^ fore my eyes, and my heart, that I ^ not
sin against thee by neither.

204. Ah Lord God, suffer me n^ more to doubt of thy love, seeing thou ^ so
freely, and willingly given the Son of love, even thy dear, only, eldest, natu^
and beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to dye me, and in my place and stead.

205. Ah sweet Jesus, Be thou pleased to take up thy abode in my heart, and
dwell there, as I may always find the there, to comfort me, and to direct ^ how
to walk well pleasing unto thee; ^ me always hear thee, speaking to me, ho^ I
shall do every thing I take in hand to d^ so that all my thoughts, words and
deed may tend only to thy honor and glory, t^ Credit of the Gospel, the good
of other^ and the eternal Salvation of mine own So^

206. Ah Lord, give me grace in all ^flictions, to consider that it is much less
the I deserve, and that thou might justly ha^ sent them on me sooner.

207. Hell, O Lord, I confess is only m^ desert, what less thou give me, is
mo^ ^n I have or can deserve, and less punish^nt then the least of my Sins has
deserved.

208. Therefore in all Conditions I desire ^less thy name, and to praise thee,
with a ^nkfull, contented and rejoicing heart.

209. Let, O Lord, all thy afflictions teach and tell me that thou art mindful
of ^, and that they are friendly, yea Father-Visitations, and Tokens of thy
Fatherly ^e love in Jesus Christ.

210. O Lord, suffer me not to sell my ^tion in Heaven, for any Portion of
earth, earth, the Honors, Riches, or Pleasures ^ereof.

211. Let even this Portion, thy service ^d work, O God, be preferred by me,
and dearer to me then all things of this world.

212. A Christian once in Christ, united him, cannot be taken out of him, no
more ^n the same water cast into the Sea can taken out again; for he is become
a part Christ, even as the drops that fall into ^e Sea, are forthwith a part
thereof.

213. Seeing then thou have made me one ^th thee, received me a little drop
into ^y self the Ocean of Blessedness, and of goodness, happiness and felicity;
My ^eet Jesus, I am sure I shall never be sepa^ted from thee.

214. Let me, O God, so live the remainder. of all my life here on earth, as
that ^ may not be ashamed to be called my ^ and to give me eternal life
hereafter in ^ven.

215. O sweet, glorious and glorifie^ sus, inhabiting Eternity from all Eter^
look not on me as I am in my self (wit^ thee) but as one in thee, even as a
m^ber of thy blessed self.

216. Love me, O Lord God, ^ thine own love, even with that love i^ sus Christ,
wherewith thou love thine ^

217. When, O Lord, I have thee (the alone) I have what I desire, yea and all I
desire; for thou art all, and the only sire of all my desires.

218. Give me, O Lord, thy self, tho^ without any thing else, and I will never
thee any thing else.

219. But though thou do, O God, ^ me all things else, (and not thy self) I ^
account it even as nothing.

220. Having thee alone (My dear Je^ I have all things, and having not the^
have nothing that I truly love.

221. Give me then thy self, and ^ shall content me, but unless thou do ^ me
thy self, I am resolved never to be ^tented.

222. Give me then so thy self, O L^ ^o art my Delight, as I may do all things
^ thee, and nothing at all without thee.

223. Give me so thy blessed self, as I may ^ays enjoy thee, beholding thy
glorious ^e, and the light of thy blessed Counte^ce, and may hear thy most
sweet and ^mfortable voice, to comfort, revive, ^d refresh me.

224. Be thou, O Lord, mine all, and let ^e be thine all.

225. Though I much fear, and would ^t commit any sin, yet I am not at all a^id
of all the Sins I have committed.

226. Though I know that God hates all ^s, yet I much rejoice that I was made a
^ner.

227. Though I know that God justifies ^e ungodly, yet I would not be ungodly.

228. Though I know that grace does a^ound more then sin, yet I would not sin
^at grace may abound.

229. Did I doubt of the pardon of my ^ns, to have their pardon, I would not
^hoose willingly to commit one sin.

230. Ah Lord, do not only pardon all ^y sins, but give me grace to sin no more.

231. Let me, O Lord, be ^s unwilling to ^ve in sin, as to dye in sin.

232. Let me fear as much the commit^ing of any sin, as the punishment of all
my sins I have committed, fear sin before ^mitted, as the punishment after
commi^ yea fear sin more then the punishme^ sin, choose the punishment and not
sin, ^ther then sin, and have no punishment.

233. Let me hate sin most, because sin, and therefore most to be hated.

234. Let me hate sin, as much after ^ doned, as before, and before commit^ as
after.

235. Let me, O Lord, hate sin, as t^ love a sinner that would not sin.

236. Let me be, O Lord, as unwil^ to commit sin, as thou art willing to part
them when committed.

237. Let me even be as unwilling^ commit any sin, as thou, O Lord, ^ willing
to pardon all Sins.

238. Let me, O Lord, die to all ^ that I may live to all grace.

239. Though, O Lord, I know t^ thou pardonest all sins and transgressio^ yet
suffer me not willingly to choose, ^ commit any sin, nor consent to any
Tr^gression.

240.
Let sin dye that grace may live,
Let grace live, that sin may dye^
241. Let Sin dye in me, that thou ma^est, O Lord, live in me.

242. Let me dye to sin, that I may, Lord, live to thee.

^43. Let me, O Lord, dye to Sin (whilst ^e, that I may not dye in sin, (when I
am ^.)

^44. Let me, O Lord, so dye here to ^ that I may not dye hereafter for sin.

^45. O Lord, let me so dye, as I may not ^ Eternally.

^46. Let sin, O Lord, be rooted out of ^ that I may be rooted in thee, and ^
in me, my sweet and saving Jesus.

^47. Let me, O Lord, be so rooted in ^, as I may never be rooted out of thee.

^48.
Let me, Lord, take such deep root,
That I may bring forth much fruit.
^49.
Let my Root be such in thee,
That my fruit be much to me.
Let my fruit be such to thee,
That the Fruit be like the Tree.
^50. Let, O Lord, my death to Sin appear, ^he appearance of the life of grace.

^51. Let me, O Lord, so live, as I may ^er dye but to Sin.

^52. Let me, O Lord, so live to thee ^, as I may ever live with thee, and in ^
hereafter.

^53. Were not thy work, O God, the ^rk of my Salvation, yet would I prefer it,
^ do it, before that of my Salvation.

A Prayer.
AH most blessed, Incomprehensible and ^nal Lord God, Glorious in Hol^ fearful
in Praises, doing wonders; the ^vens are not pure in thy sight, and yet tho^
graciously pleased in Jesus Christ to look d^ and to dwell in poor Man, who is
sinful ^ and Ashes; thou live only in the highest ^vens, and in the lowest
hearts, the one is Kingdom of Glory, the other of thy Grace, ^ Lord, make my
heart so low in my own estee^ it may be so high in thine, that thou may ^ it
thy delight to dwell in it for ever; Ah ^ when I consider all that thou have
done for ^ and all that I have done against thee, I a^ shamed and confusion
seems to cover my fac^ Vail, having, O Lord, transgrest all thy and just Laws,
and broken wilfully, willi^ knowingly and presumptuously all thy Di^
Commandments from the first to the last, ^ the greatest to the least, as well
by Comm^ as Omission, as well by Actual sin, as Orig^ sin, knowingly as well as
ignorantly, both ^ fully and willingly on thy days, as well a^ our days, in thy
house as in other houses, in^ing thy work, as in doing my own work, in^ties, as
well as out of duties; praying sins, ^ sins, meditating sins, Sermon sins and
Sa^ent sins, so that my repentance must be re^ed off, and my Prayers Prayed
against, e^ my sighs and groans have need of tears ^ash them, and my very tears
of doubled ^.

How, Lord, have I made thy holy things un^ unto my self, and turned thy graces
into ^tonness, and quenched the motions of thy ho^irit by wilfulness! how, Lord,
have I trea^d up wrath against the day of wrath unto my ^ soul, and made thee a
savor of death unto when thou come as a Savor of life! how ^e I, Lord,
hated to be reformed, and turn^rom thee, when thou came running toward in
love and in mercy! how have I cast thy ^ises behind my back, and trampled thy
pre^s under my feet! how many times have I ^ken my Promises, Vows, and
Covenants ^e with thee in my straights! with how much ^e eagerness and
earnestness, have I served ^ sinful Lusts (then thee) in thy services, my ^d
Lord God! and how much more pains ^e I taken for earthly things then for
hea^ly! how much more delight some have these ^gs below, and the remembrance of
them ^en unto me) then the things above! how ^ch sweeter has sin been to me
then grace, ^^ how have I bent my will against thy great ^^ holy will in all
things! how willingly and how fast, O Lord, did I run in the ways ^ternal
destruction! and how, good Lord, ^ I vehemently delighted and labored, to ^
others to commit the same sins, and to d^ same things! how easily and how
willingly ^ believe the suggestions of the Devil, and ^ what willingness have I
left thy work, ^ how often, good Lord, to do his, nay, w^ is yet worse, how
often have I tempted him tempter to tempt me unto sin, when I knew ^ the wages
of sin was death, even Temp^ Spiritual and Eternal, for body and soul, d^ my
very utmost to destroy both!

But what, O Lord, are all these sins* those I do not, to those I cannot
remember, ^ that both for greatness and multitude; yea w^ are all the sins I
have committed, to the would have committed, had not thou in l^ and in
mercy, O most gracious, loving, ^ most merciful Father, in Jesus Christ ^
strained me) and come in continually unto help and succor, even when I was
altoget^ helpless and succourless! thou did, O Lo^ own me when I would not
own thee; thou di^ run after me when I did my utmost to run fr^ thee; thou
did, O Lord, continue knocki^ when I would not open to thee, and wert'st
^tented, such was thy endearing loving love ^ to me, to stand at the door of my
heart wi^ out, until thy locks were wet with the dew^ ^aven, and when I was
most pitiless, then ^'st thou most pity me, and took'st me from ^ self, and out
of the power of all my adver^ies, and did enter with forceable possession ^o
my heart, there to lodge, sup and dwell ^ ever, though thou foundest it to be
more un^an then a dunghill: and is not this enough ^cause all the Creatures in
Heaven and Earth ^ stand amazed, and with wonder and a^ishment to admire the
condescension of so great God as thou art?

Ah Lord God, what could I more desire, nay ^at could thou do more for me
then thou have ^e, to bring me out of the death of sin to the ^ of grace, out
of the suburbs of Hell, into ^ suburbs of Heaven; methinks, Ah me ^ks, I may
truly say, out of Hell it self, ^ Heaven it self; such a vast difference there
^ such a blessed and glorious change there is ^eady, blessed and ever
magnified, and prais^e thy ever blessed, great and most glori^ name of Jehovah,
my strength and my ^tion.

Thou have not only, O Lord, delivered me ^ of the paws of that roaring Lion
(the ^il) who had almost devoured me, but have ^en me of thine own power and
strength, to ^ come him, to trample him under my feet; ^ to despite him to his
very face, thou have ^vered unto me his falseness and malice and the wickedness
and the deceitfulness of my ^ deceitful wicked heart th^^ did thus be^ me.

Ah Lord, what can I, such a poor wretc^ I am render unto thee for all thy
benefits, I a worm, and no man, the greatest, and ^ chiefest of sinners, the
very worst of the ^ of men; O Lord accept of what I have to g^ thee, of these
two poor mites my soul and b^ true, O Lord, I confess and acknowledge ^ they
are not worthy to be put into thy ^ Treasury, but if thou will be pleased to
st^ on them, the glorious Image of thy Son J^ Christ, I am sure they will pass
for our ^coyn in thy Heavenly Court, and thou ^ own self wilt esteem them of
thy peculiar T^ sure: O Lord, set me as a seal upon thy ^ and let thy love be
settled upon mine, t^ may be out of love with all, that I may be^ly in love with
thee, and let all my men^ and faoulties, be but as instruments to act holy and
blessed motions.

Ah Lord God, good as great, and gre^ good, when will thou by thine Almighty
p^utterly destroy and root out all sin out of me, ^ shall the time, O Lord,
come, that it sha^ Crucified unto me and I unto it, when shall time come that I
shall see it no more, when the time come that thou will, O Lord, giv^ a final
Victory over it, and totally destr^ ^hen, Lord, shall come that blessed day
where^ I shall not sin, when I shall put off sin as an ^ garment, and never
more put it on, when ^ tears, fears, sighs and groans for sins, ^ll be expelled
and extinguished, when thou, O ^rd, my sweet and blessed Jesus, shall only be ^
all and my all.

But grant, good Lord, though sin be in my ^rt, that my heart be not in sin,
and though ^ rule over me as a Tyrant, let it, Ah let it ^ver reign in me a
moment as a Sovereign, ^d though I cannot live without sin, yet, good ^rd, for
thy goodness sake, let me live without ^senting unto, delighting in, or
approving of ^y sin whatsoever, either in thought, word or ^d, but let there be
always, and continually in ^, a heedfull, watchful, careful, circum^ct care;
though temptations fall on me, let ^ not fall into temptation, but deliver me
^m all evil, O thou my Father which art in ^aven, and cause me to work out my
Salva^n with fear and trembling, and to labor ^re and more to make my calling
and election ^e, before I go hence, and be no more seen.

And knowing, Lord, that thou have in the ^ndance of thy love and mercy*
provided for ^ a Kingdom which cannot be shaken, let me ^ve grace in my heart
to come before thee, and worship thee, the true God, w^^h reverence ^d godly
fear, that I may always run and not grow weary, and walk and not faint, w^ O
Lord, all thy Laws of grace in my h^ and thy Statutes of Love in my mind, by
finger of thy holy and blessed Spirit, that I never go astray to the right hand
of pleas^ or to the left hand of profits; wean me, O L^ from the world, e're
thou take me out of world, and whilst I do live in the world me be dead to it,
and to all the things of which are the honors, riches and plea^ thereof, the
lust of the flesh, the lust of the and the pride of life, and give me those the
and those things only, which may make thine, and only thine, that I may be al^
thine, and ever thine.

Teach me, O Lord, to use the world ^ I used it not, that I may not abuse it,
my nor thee who have given it me to use, but ^ abuse, give me, O Lord, I humbly
beseech in Jesus Christ, grace to be always min^ of my last end, and of the
reckoning the must make before thee, the judge of He^ and Earth, take away all
my doubts, ^ and cares, for the things of this life, that I cast all my care on
thee, who carest for for the earth is thine, and the fullness t^ of; grant, O
Lord, that I may know ho^ want, and how to abound, and to be al^ content in all
conditions; knowing that things shall be for my greatest good, and ^ugh
affliction be in the night, yet joy shall me in the morning; grant, O Lord, I
beseech ^ee, that my last thoughts may be my best ^ughts, and my last days, O
Lord, my best ^ys; grant, O Lord, that I may be willing lose all to gain thee,
and to esteem it no loss ^t great gain; grant that I may be willing to ^crease,
that thou may, O Lord, increase, to and and to be spent for thee and to
follow ^ee the Lamb of Righteousness, wheresoever ^ou go; grant that I may
be as willing to ^ear the Crown of Thorns, to obey thee here, the Crown of
Glory to praise thee hereafter; ^d grant, O Lord, that I may be as willing
suffer for thy glory, as to reign with thee in ^ory, and that I may desire
Heaven much ^ore for thee, then thee for Heaven.

Ah Lord, I could be content with Mary to ^t at thy feet, and to wash them with
my tears, and to stand behind thee, being altogether a^amed to come before
thee, how willingly, ^ Lord, how willingly do I with Jeremy wish, that my head
were a Fountain of water, that ^ine eyes might gush out Rivers of Tears; and Ah
that I could with David weep continually, with Magdalen abundantly, and with
^e^er bitterly, that I might give my soul no rest, ^ntill I come into thy
blessed Arms, the bles^ed, joyful, saving Ark of Rest, which shall ^or ever
cause me to float and swim above all the storms and tempests of sin and Satan;
^ grant, O Lord, that having past the tim^ my Pilgrimage here in thy fear, I
may dye in favor; unite me, O Lord, I most humbly seech thee, so nigh unto thy
self, that I may made bone of thy bone, and flesh of thy fle^ make me a member
of thy Mystical body h^ that I may be for ever a member of thy g^rious body
hereafter.

Ah Lord God in Jesus Christ, I beseech ^ to sanctify all afflictions and
Temptations ^ me, and lay no more upon me at any time in ^dy or mind, then thou
shall in thy goodn^ and for thy glory enable me to bear; and t^ not thy holy
and blessed spirit the Sanctifier ^ the Comforter from me; be thou my help
want, my strength in weakness, my joy sorrow, my comfort in grief, my riches in
verty, my palace in Prison, my home in ^nishment, my health in sickness, and my
life death, let my blessedness in thee, O Lord, come to see my cursedness out
of thee, let thy ^verflowing fullness cause me to see my emptin^ thy beauty my
ugly deformity, thy light darkness, thy glory my ignominy, thy riches ^
poverty, thy obedience my disobedience, thy p^fection my imperfection, thy
holiness my un^liness, thy glory my shame, thy wisdom my for thy strength my
weakness, thy goodness ^ badness, thy Heaven of happiness and blessedn^ Hell of
unhappiness, and wretchedness, thy things, my nothing.

Ah sweet Jesus, that came down from Hea^n on Earth, to lift me up from Earth
to Hea^n, thou took'st my nature on thee to make me ^taker of thine own holy
blessed, and divine ^ture, thou becamest the Son of Man, to make ^ the Son of
God; thou becam'st, O Lord, my ^ra, an Heir of Misery, to make me an Heir of
^ercy, yea Coheir with thy self of Heavens ^eat glory and eternal Happiness,
Felicity and ^lessedness, which is thy Father, Self and holy ^rit, three
Persons but one God; thou were, sweet Jesus, Lamb of God, Son of God, ^ade a
Curse, that I might be made a Blessing, ^ou would dye once, that I might
likewise dye ^t once, and then live with thee for ever and ^r ever; thou did,
O King of Glory, wear a ^rown of Thorns, that I might wear a Crown ^ Glory;
thou were lifted up on the Cross to ^t me up unto thee, thine arms nayl'd
abroad, ^ show how willing thou were to embrace me, ^y feet nailed together, to
show thy willing^ess never to go from me, thy head hang^g down to show thy
willingness to kiss me ^ith the kisses of thy mouth, of thy love for ^ver; thy
heart opened with a Spear, even to ^t me in there; thus did thou show by the
Crown of Thorns on thy head, the height of thy love; by the nayling of thy
feet, the lei^ of thy love; by the spreading abroad of thy a^ the breadth of
thy love; and by the openin^ thy side, the shedding of thy hearts blood, depth
of thy love. O blessed God, O most ^sed love, there is no God like unto thee,
nor there ever love like unto this thy love; ^ did, O Christ, thou did,
suffer thy Fa^^ frowns, that I might have his smiles; thou di^ O Christ, thou
did, drink up the dregs of Father's wrath, even Vinegar mingled ^ Gall, that
I might sweetly solace my self drinking to thee the bottomless bottom of
endless love; thou did, O Christ, my Savi^ thou did, bear all my sins,
that I might ^pear without sin; thou did, O Christ, my deemer, thou did
shed all thy heart blood wash me from the filthiness of my own bl^ and from the
guilt of this thy blood-sheddi^ thou had, O Christ, thou had, thy F^ much
more glorious than the Sun, defaced ^ spittle, that mine might shine even as
the gloriously in glory, though not so gloriously gl^ous; thou had, O Christ,
thou had thy b^ whipped, that by thy stripes I might be heal^ thou were, O
Christ, thou were thus woun^ that by thy deadly wounds I might be ^ Cured; O
love infinite and incomprehensible ^yond degree, an offended God dies, to set
off^ing man free.

Ah Love that surpasses all understanding, ah ^odness that surpasses all
love, that were in love ^ercy and goodness pleased to do this for me, not ^hen
I was a friend, but an enemy, not when I ^as in Covenant with thee, but when I
was ^t of Covenant, not when I loved thee, but ^hen I hated thee, not when I
was lovely, but ^veless, not when I was holy, but unholy, not ^hen I desired
it, but when I desired it not, not for ^king it, but when I asked it not, not
for having ^ne any thing for thee, but even then, when I ^d all that I could
against thee, not when I ^as thy Servant, but a Servant of the Devils; ^d all
this, O God my God, that thou did^st, ^as not for thy advantage, but for mine,
not ^r thy good, but for mine, not for thy honor, but ^r mine, not for thy
glory, but to bring me to ^ory; and all this thou did, looking for no^ing
again; thou love me only because thou ^ould'st love me: Ah height, length,
depth, and ^eadth of love, that an offended God should ^e, and woe, and pray
and pay, and promise, and give, and dye, and live to reconcile, in^ch, honor,
magnify, and exalt, offending ^an, poor despicable man, vile, wretched,
^orthless man, nothing man, that can be fitly ^mpared to nothing, but to
nothing less than ^e drop of a bucket, or the dust of the bal^ance.

O Lord, let these thy wonders of mercies, and wonderful compassions, cause me
ever to ad^ and adore thy love and kindness, thy kind lo^ thy goodness, and thy
greatness, and to cry ^ Lord, what is man, that thou art so min^ of him, and
the Son of man, that thou so gardest him, as to visit him, to magnify h^ to
dwell in him, to delight in him, to m^ him thy delight, to set thy heart upon
him to him good, even according to all the good t^ is in thy heart, having
prepared for him Kingdom, which cannot be shaken, a King^ of Glory, an eternal
and incomprehen^ weight of glory where is joy, all joy, unspe^able joy, and
Rivers of pleasures for ever mo^ where is no right, but all is day, yea the L^
himself is the l^ght thereof, where is no gr^nor sorrow, nor care, nor fear,
but all te^ shall be wiped away, and there shall be no m^ sorrow, nor sighing,
but all joys, and sing^ of praises and Hillelujahs with the Ang^ls ^ Saints,
beholding the Lord of glory, yea ^ glory of the Lord, seeing him face to face
he is, and knowing him as he is to be know there is no Canaanite in that
Heavenly Countr^ no Cain to kill, no Sodomite to vex, no Ishm^elite to scoff,
no Esau to terrify, no Shimei curse, no Herod to persecute, no Rabsheke^ to
rail, no Judas to betray, this Heaven is ^bove all Molestations, and
perturbations, and ^ for term of years, but for ever.

Ah most holy, most great, and most glorious lord God, bring me I most humbly
beseech thee ^ thine own good, due, and appointed time, ^at I may behold thy
beauty, and thy glory, and ^e light of thy right blessed, and most blessed, and
glorious countenance, which may by the right aspect shining on me, cause me
likewise to shine brighter than the Sun, and my ^ul and body together to be
made perfect, pure, and holy; as thou, O God, art, though not so ^olily pure
and perfect, and that both being ^nlightned with thy heavenly wisdom, may be
^ade to know the stability thereof, and be as^red of thine eternal and
everlasting love, and ^iving in me for ever, and for ever.

Grant these things, O my God, and my Father in Jesus Christ, and what ever
else thou ^nowest to be needful or expedient for me, both for soul and body,
and all for the merits of thy Son and my Savior, thy Christ, and my Jesus, for
whom my Soul shall ever bless and praise ^hee, as the Lord my Righteousness,
and to whom, with thy glorious Majesty, and holy spirit of grace, the
Comforter, and the Sanctifier, be given by me, and by all thine, as all due is,
and to none else, honor, glory, power, might, Majesty, dominion, and
thanksgiving, now and for ever more, Amen.

1. Contentment though in Poverty, the best, the surest, and the greatest rich^

2. Let me not set thee a time, O ^ God, but wait on thee for all things in ^
time.

3. And when thy time shall come to s^ me forth, let me run and not grow wea^
and walk, and never faint.

4. Send me, O Lord, whither thou w^ and to do what thou will, I am willing^
go, and be, and do whatever thou s^ command, though to spend, and to ^ spent
for thee.

5. And wheresoever, O Lord, thou she place me, I shall not account it my abid^
place, no longer then it shall be thy pl^sure that I there abide.

6. Being with thee, my God, where e^ it be, I shall be, I am sure, where I
would ^

7. And being in thee, my Savior, a^ thou in me, my condition, I am sure, w^
well please and content me, what ever be.

8. Ah Lord, who would, or who shou^ desire to live here in the flesh, being he
c^ not live and not sin, it is not subject to the Law, neither indeed can be.

9. And who would not, or should not ^ willing to die, to kill sin, that sin
mig^ dye, and be destroyed for ever totally.

10. Yet I am content to live, though I do ^, thy grace, O my God, being
sufficient ^ me.

11. I had rather be on earth for thy sake, ^d to do thy will, than to be in
Heaven, ^ my own sake only, and only to have ^y own will.

12. For is it not to be in Heaven, even ^ do thy will on earth, as it is done
in ^eaven, it is a Heaven on this side Heaven, ^ earthly Heaven, or a Heaven on
earth, ^ich, good Lord, give and grant me, un^l thou give me what thou have
promised ^e, which is thy blessed self in Heaven, who ^t the Heaven of Heaven
in Heaven.

13. Where then soever, when, and how ^ng soever I live or die, I shall through
thy ^od grace, live and die contented, and ^ost joyfully.

14. How willingly, how willingly Lord, ^ould I leave this world, and all the
things ^ it, if they were all mine, to live with ^ee, for I know thee, O Lord,
I know ^ee, (and for which I most heartily thank ^ee) that thou art much better
than all ^ings, yea all things compared to thee are ^thing, and all things out
of thee, that is without thee, can be fitly compared to no^ing, but to nothing.

15. And yet, Lord, thou know how willing I am to live in this world, to for
thee.

16. Thou know, O Lord, how i^ more willing I am to dye then to live, ^ yet,
Lord, thou know how I striv^ live, that I may not dye.

17. Give me grace, O my God, so live, as I may dye daily, and to dye da^ that
I may ever live.

18.
Let me so live as I may live ever.
Let me so die, as that I die never
Let me die but once, that I live for e^
Let me die that once, that I die nev^
19.
Come then, O Christ, and set me f^
That I may go and live with thee:
Then shall thou be unto me gain,
And free me from Eternal pain.
20. When I do any thing that is g^ it is against the will of the flesh, and ^
I do any thing that is evil, it is against will of the spirit.

21. To will good, is many times ^ sent with me, but how to perform it, I k^
not at any time, how, (of my self) but ^ I know, that he that gives grace to ^
will also give grace to do, for both to ^ and to do, is from the good will of
Go^

22. When I do any thing that is go^ that is from the good Spirit of God in ^
but when I do any thing that is evil, the ^m the evil spirit of sin which is in
me, ^d tyrannizeth over me.

23. All the will I have to good, is from ^ good will, my good God, but all the
^l I have to evil, is from my own evil ^l.

24. Ah Lord, how hard do I find it to the ^sh to do what I should, nay what I
^uld; and how easy, Ah Lord, how easy, ^ do that which I should not, and
would ^t!

25. Do thou therefore, O Lord, I most ^mbly beseech thee, work in me both to
^l and to do, according to thy good ^l and pleasure.

26. That as to please thee, O Lord, is ^ desire of my will, yea my wills only
^sire, so not to please thee, my God, I ^d rather, yea much rather dye than
will, ^th my will willingly.

27. Let thy holy will, O God, be my ^ole will, and thy whole will be made holy
^me, by doing it wholly and holily, by the ^werful assistance of thy holy
Spirit.

28. To will thy will (O God) with my ^art, is thy will, O Lord, written by thy
^f in my heart.

29 Let then thy will be in my heart, ^t with my heart, I may both will and ^
thy good will, my good God.

30.
When with my heart I think on the
Then from all sin my heart is free
Let then my heart still think on the
That from all sin I may still flee^
Lord, take my heart, and make it t^
That to no sin, it may incline.
31. The best of our best is so bad our all is worth nothing at all.

32. If then our best good be so bad holy things so unholy; Ah Lord, how holy
is our unholiness, and how bad evil is our worst evil, the evil of our things.

33. It is not my studious care, bu^ care, O Lord, of my study, that m^ both my
study and care prosperous advantageous.

34. It is from thee, O Lord my that I have all that I have, Ah give this mercy
also, to be as willing to it thee back when thou will have it, was willing to
receive it when thou g(...) it.

35. When man speaks to man, it take no effect, but when God speaks to
(whatever he speaks) it shall take effe^^

36. Let, O Lord, thy speaking to and in me, be effectual for the be and not
for the worse of my Soul savor of life unto life, and not of d^ death, of life
to my Soul, and of death ^y sins.

^7. I had rather hear and learn one thing the wisdom of God, than a thou^
thousand from the wisdom of men.

^8. Let all thy truths in me, O God, be firmed to me, by the powerful wisdom
working of thy holy Spirit.

^9. God's voice brings me always joy, comforts my sad heart; but man's voice
seth me always grief, and saddens my ^ul heart.

^0. I had rather be ever alone with God, ^ want all other things, than be one
day ^out him, to have and gain, and keep other things besides him.

^1. For when God is in me then am I in ^ven, but when God is not in me, then I
in Hell; for thy presence to me, Lord, ^o me Heaven upon earth, and thy
ab(...)ce, O Lord, Hell upon earth.

42. It is thy self, O Lord, thy blessed that I desire, and not the desires of
other desires.

43. When I have thee, Lord, I have all desires, and yet when I have thee not,
^o not, because I cannot desire thee.

44. So impotent am I, as not able to ^l or desire my own good, so poor a
^etch, as not (of my self) ^o wish my self rich so much a slave, as to be
content, yea willing and delight to, ever to be a slave, yea the worst of
slaves, even to my own sinful lusts, although I know they will (if lived in)
drown me for ever in the pit of Eternal destruction, from which, good Lord,
ever deliver me as thou have delivered me, keep me out as thou have hitherto
kept me out, and preserve me to my lives end, as thou have preserved me from
the beginning, that I may ever live to thee, for thee, and to praise thee ever,
and for ever.

45. Thou have in mercy, O God, my God, brought thy self, thy ever sweet,
blessed, gracious, and most glorious self to me, ah bring my self in love, and
obedience home unto thee.

46. My words, Ah my words, I know well, are but words, and the breathings of a
sinful man, but thy words, O my Lord, I well know also, that they are the
breathings of a holy God.

47. Grant, O God, my God, that all my words may breath out sorrow for sin, and
thy words breath in me the assurance of the pardon of sin.

48. For whose sins, O Lord, thou forgivest, thou also forgettest; whom thou
pardonest, thou will save: for where thou love, thou live, and wilt, I am
sure, ever live there in love.

49. To be taught by thee, O God of wisdom, is to be well taught, make me, O
Lord, make me, I beseech thee, as willing to learn of thee, as thou art willing
to teach me.

50. And give me grace, O God, to retain what I shall learn of thee, that I may
forget what I have learnt of my self, and the world.

51. If Earth's sweets are so sweet to earthly minds, as they prefer it to the
sweet of Heaven; Ah how sweet are Heavens sweets to Heavenly minds, and how do
they prefer it to all the sweets on earth.

52. How much sweeter, O my God, is the honey of thy word to the taste of my
inward man, than the Honeycomb of the world to the taste of my outward man.

53. I had much rather say nothing then my own works, do nothing then my own
words, and have nothing then all my own desires.

54. Ah Lord God, give me grace to live in Heaven whilst on earth, by doing thy
will on Earth, as it is done in Heaven.

55. They are not the words of the mouth but of the heart, that are agreeable
and well pleasing to thy heart, O my God, the searcher, the tryer, and the
knower of all hearts.

56. He that has his heart right, all things that he does and does not, are
right dear, and precious in thy sight, and according to thy heart, O God, the
giver and maker of all hearts.

57.
When I sleep, O God, thou art still by me,
And when I wake, I am still with thee:
So that whether I sleep, or whether I wake,
I am sure, O Lord, thou do me never forsake.
58. To believe in God, is to know God, to know him is to love him, to love him
is to fear him, and to fear him is to serve him, and to serve him is to obey
him, and to obey him is to do his will, and to do his will is to give up our
wills to his will, and to give up our wills to his will is to rejoice in all
things that he does and wills, and to rejoice in all things that he does and
wills is to have a heart according to his own heart.

59. It is not what I do, or can do, but what I would do, that best pleases
thee, my God, who gives both to will and to do.

60. O Lord, let not what, or any thing of that I do, please me, until I am
sure that it please thee.

61. O Lord, suffer me not to seek my own delight, but let my delight be to
delight thee, who art the delight of my soul, and in whom only my soul
delights.

62. If thy back parts, O Lord, do so much rejoice my heart here on earth, how
shall thy face cause me to rejoice in Heaven, where I shall see thee face to
face, and know thee as thou art to be known!

63. And seeing it is my only grief on earth, that I have offended thee my God,
by sin, it shall be my only joy in Heaven to praise thee, for that thou art not
offended with me for my sins.

64. Give me, O my God, for Christ his sake, thy Kingdom and thy Glory, that I
may give thee honor and glory, for ever, in thy Kingdom of glory.

65. And till that day shall be, give me grace, O my sweet and saving Jesus, so
to watch and to wait, that when thy Kingdom shall come, I may rejoice and say
thy will, O Lord, be done, and so enter into the joy of my Lord, even into the
Lord of my joy.

66. To do thy will, O God, is all the thoughts and desires of my heart and
will, and in doing thy will, is all the joys, delights and ravishments of my
willing heart, thus made willing through thine own good will.

67. I know well, that it is thou in me, my dear and sweet Jesus, that causes
my desires to desire thee, and the heart of my soul, to hunger and thirst for
thee, and also that gives me boldness to speak unto thee.

68. O Lord, I desire nothing but what thou will, and all that thou will, I
willingly would, and willingly would nothing but what thou will.

69. I had rather do thy will, O my God, on earth, for thy self, and thy sake,
then be in Heaven for my own self, and my own sake, thy service is dearer to me
then my soul.

70. I had much rather do the least work for God, then have the greatest good
and benefit for my self.

71. Whatsoever, O Lord, thou will have me to be, do and suffer, that I
willingly would be, and long to do and suffer, and to have, and no other.

72. Will thou, O Lord, have me poor, afflicted, persecuted, banished, evil
spoken of, tormented, tempted; all these, Lord; and what else thou will, so
thou come with them, I shall rejoice in them, and most willingly receive them.

73. It is not, Lord, what I desire only, bu^ what thou have ordained, that I
only desire.

74. I know and am assured, that thou will, O Lord, sooner cast the earth into
the Sea, and remove the Heavens, then take any of thy love from those whom thou
love.

75. For seeing sin (cannot) nor shall not, separate us, Lord what shall, what
can?

76. It is fixed on thy own love, O Father, in Jesus Christ, thy Son most
lovely, and therefore unchang^able, unmovable.

77. It is from thy great Love, O my God, that I find thee lovely, but thy love
is greater, for that I love thee, and yet more great that I love thee only, but
more great then all, it is, that thou have ever loved, and wilt ever love me.

78. Ah love that passes all degree, the offended dies to set the offenders
free.

79. It is thy mercy, O God, that I am not past mercy, that I contemn not
mercy, that I know mercy, that I value mercy, that I prize mercy, that I seek
mercy, that I hope for mercy, am assured of mercy, and that I desire the same
mercies for all others that are not past mercy.

80. To will thy will, O God, is to do thy will when we would as willingly do
it, (be it what it will) as we will it.

81. To serve thee best and most, or to do thee, O God, most and best service,
is in most submitting to thy will, be it what it will.

82. It is not the work of the hand, or of the head, but of the heart, that is
according to thy heart, and most delights thy heart, O my God, the maker, and
the giver of all good hearts.

83. To wait is better then to work, if thou show us not what work is thy
work, and what work we shall do.

84. Let me not, O God, ever ask any other condition, than my present
condition, and always submit to thy will in my condition, as often as thou
shall change my condition, and esteem every change the best change, yea and a
changing for the best.

85. And let cheerfulness witness my contentedness, and my contentedness be
shown by my cheerfulness.

86. Ah Lord, my Lord, if thou did not at times afflict me, how often should
I, Ah how often should I afflict thee.

87. But I mightily desire to magnify and praise thee, O my God, for that I
find when affliction comes on me, thou come with it, and do always
abundantly comfort me, yea my greatest comforts have been, when thou seem as
if thou would afflict me, that is even in affliction.

88. If affliction should go from me, I fear I should go from all good, which
is from God.

89. Afflict me, O Lord, so much as thou will, and so often as thou please,
so that in it, I afflict not thee.

90. In affliction I fear, but out of affliction, Ah Lord, I confess I am
careless, Ah too too careless.

91. Affliction makes me, O Lord, to run to thee, to cry aloud after thee, and
to importune thee for thy presence, but out of affliction, I go softly, I speak
softly, and know not how to beg with importunity.

92. If the outward Man receive such joy and delight in the Creature, and by
conversing with them, Ah what joy, delight and ravishment does the inward Man
receive, having Communion with God, and enjoying his dear Creator.

93. If earth, and the things below, be able to satisfy any, surely, surely,
Heaven, and the things above, shall be able, and will satisfy all, for every
one there shall enjoy God, who is all, and in all.

94. Seeing Heaven on Earth is so sweet, Ah how sweet is Heaven in Heaven, or
the Heaven of Heaven, which is our God.

94. And seeing Heavens joys are so great on earth, Ah how greatly great are
they in Heaven.

96. Ah sweet, most ravishing sweet Jesus, let me enjoy them so here, that I
may long to be dissolved, and to be in Heaven to enjoy them there, Ah to enjoy
thee, thee, there.

97. Seeing one drop or ^ast of them is so delitious, Ah how deliciously, and
delightfully are they fed, that feed on them continually, and shall feed on
them for ever and ever.

98. Grant, O my God, that sins sweets, be to me bitter, and Heavens bitter, be
to me sweet, and that I may always prefer Heavens bitterest, to sins sweetest,
and never to find any sweet in the sweets of Sin.

99. I had rather see Christ with spiritual eyes, then in the flesh, with the
eyes of the flesh, and to have him in my heart then in my arms.

100. Christ only can make us spiritually hungry, and he only can feed us with
the bread of life, from him we have our spiritual thirsting, and he, he only
can give us to drink of those living waters, the fountain of life, being in him
only.

101. Were there as many worlds to be offered me, as there would be minutes
from Eternity to Eternity, I would not, nay, praised be God, I could not, give
my hope and my interest in my Jesus, to enjoy all their riches, honors and
pleasures, unto all Eternity.

102. For by how much is he above all things, and more worth then all things,
by so much, yea by so much more, do I value my interest in him above all
things, for all things to God, can be fitly compared to nothing, but to nothing.

103. For God is all things, and I am sure of him, and therefore I have all
things sure.

104. He that believes in Christ, loves him, and he that loves him, fears him,
and he that fears him, obeys him, and he that loves, fears, obeys, and believes
in him, must and will walk as he walked.

105. We can both will and do our own wills, which are evil, but we can neither
will nor do thy will, O God, which is all and only good.

106. Give me then grace, O God, the God, and giver of all grace, to deny my
own will, to hate and forsake my own will, that I wholly and perfectly do thy
perfect and holy will.

107. Let me then, O God, my God, so will to do, as I may only do thy will, for
my whole will is, that thy holy will be done on me, and in me, that I may do
thy will here on earth, O thou my Father in Jesus Christ, which art in Heaven.

108. Give me then thy self, my sweet Jesus, that I may please thy self, for
without thee, I shall be still my self, and displeasing still to thee.

109. For I am all evil, and thou, O God, art all good, I am all Hell, and thou
art all Heaven, Ah thou my God, that can do all things, turn my evil unto
good, that my Hell may be brought into thy Heaven.

110. Joy in fear, and by reason of fear, for every man has a double fear,
till he have perfect love, that casts out all fear.

111. Fear causes me to doubt; and fear causes me to believe, fear brings
me grief, and fear brings me joy; fear casts me down to Hell, and fear
raises me up to Heaven, fear causes me to distrust, and fear causes me to
trust, fear affrights me with sadness, and fear comforts me with rejoycings,
for if I did not fear, I might justly be afraid, if I did not fear the want of
grace, I might justly fear I had no grace, if I did not fear falllng, I fear I
should fall indeed; But though through fear I am many times afraid, yet I would
not be without fear, though I should be always afraid, for fear causes me to
put away fear, and not to fear fear, nor to be afraid of fear, through fear I
trust, I believe, I rejoice, and I hope I shall be for ever brought out, and
freed from all fear.

112. Happy is the man that fears always Prove. 28. 14.

113. Ah Lord, my God, that art most faithful, and most true, make me, I most
humbly beseech thee, in Jesus Christ, truly faithful all my life, that I may
be faithful even unto the death, and then for ever to enjoy thy gracious
promise of that Crown of life.

114. Make me faithfully obedient unto thee in all things, O Lord, all my life,
that at death, I may receive thy faithful promise of that Crown of glory and
life, that I may ever live to glorify thee, O Lord, of all glory, by an
Eternal and Everlasting life.

115. Any thing of all that man can do, (as man) God will not accept, but all
things that God does man should accept, and likewise know and believe, that he
does all things, and therefore ought accept all things.

116. Man's best all, all man's best, is worse then all, but Gods least all, the
least of God, is above all, and more worth then all.

117. When I have thee, my God, I have all, yea all that I would have; But Ah,
when I want thee, when I have thee not, when thou art absent, and seem to be
departed, or but estranged from me, I want all, am without all, and possess
nothing, even nothing at all, though I have even all other possessions.

118. Let my all, O Lord, be all in thee, That thou may be all unto me.

119. I am much more offended, that I have offended my God, then I am afraid,
that my God is offended with me.

120. I much more fear my sins to come, then my sins past, because my fear for
my sins past, is already past, but my fear is always present, for my sins to
come, yea it is my only fear, and that which affrights me only.

121. When I consider and ponder, on the much joy that I enjoy, to the little I
deserve to enjoy, and yet that this much, is little, to that which I hope, and
believe, I shall enjoy. Ah how my heart is filled and ravished with unspeakable
joy.

122. All glory be given to thee, O God, the God and giver of all gifts, of all
grace, and of all glory, Amen, Amen.

In Bourdeaux, Anno 1656.
O Lord God, I most humbly, and most heartily beg and beseech thee, be thou
graciously pleased in love and in mercy, in and through Jesus Christ, to be
with me thy poor and unworthy Servant, here in this place, where thou have by
thy Providence brought me at all times, as thou have been with me in all other
places, at other times, that thy power and thy might may be seen in me, and thy
holy and blessed spirit, leading, guiding, governing and directing me in all
things that I shall take in hand to do, that I may by grace walk upprightly in
the midst of this crook^d, froward and perverse generation; and that they
seeing my good works, that is thou, O God, working in me, they may glorify thy
great and holy name, O thou my Father in Jesus Christ, which art in Heaven.

Ah Lord, suffer me not here following, to write my own words, but thine, not
seek my self with selfish love, but thy self with true sincere unfeigned love
to thy self, not mine honor, but thine honor, not my praise, but thy praise,
not my glory but thy glory, my souls salvation, and the good, benefit and
advantage of others: and all I beg, and what else thou know to be needful
for me, for Jesus Christ, my blessed, only, alone Savior, and Mediator, and
and Redeemers sake, Amen.

A Prayer.
O All holy, Almighty, Infinite and Incomprehensible, wise, glorious, gracious,
good, merciful, patient, sweet, lovely, loving and most blessed, and ever
blessed Lord God, thou art not only holy, but holiness it self, not only wise,
but wisdom it self, not only good, but goodness it self, not only merciful but
mercy it self, not only patient, but patience it self, not only sweet, but
sweetness it self, not only love and loving, but love it self, not only strong,
but strength it self, not only powerful, but all power it self, not only
great, but greatness it self, not only mighty, but Almighty, and might it self,
not only blessed, but blessedness, all blessedness it self, not only happy, but
possessing all happiness, making all happy that are happy, being happiness it
self; all good, O God, is in thee, and comes forth from thee, thou containest
all things, being all things, all things being in thee, but art contained by
none, thou art what thou will be, and therefore willest what thou will, it is
thy honor and thy glory that thou art what thou art, all thy doings are
wonderful and like thy self, holy, just, and true, thou art all things, do
all things, and give all things, freely, willingly, abundantly and
continually, never repenting, repining, nor upbraiding, glorious thou art in
holiness, fearful thou art in praises, doing wonders; all thy works do praise
thee, Ah let me thy unworthy; unnatural disobedient, sinful and wretched
Creature (in my self) out of thee, do the same, every moment, and all the
moments of my life, by all my thoughts, words and actions, both at home and
abroad, that thy power, O God, and thy might, even thine Almighty power, may be
always seen in me, and show forth to thy glory, that thou abidest and dwell
in me, so that all that shall behold me, may love thee, and long for thee,
running after thee to obtain thee, and so by enjoying thee, may likewise praise
thee.

O God, I know that thou do all that thou will, and willest all that thou
do, thou art as willing as able, and as able as willing, as great as good,
and as good as great, nothing can hinder thee, nothing can deprive thee of
being what thou art, for before any thing was, thou were, all things have their
all from thee, thou art the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, it
is the greatest and the chiefest joy of all the Angels and Saints in Heaven and
on Earth; that thou art what thou art, and that they belong unto thee, and that
thou art pleased to own them for thine own, thy glory is their glory, thine end
their aim, thy will their wills, their chief desire to be is to please thee, O
God, to please thee, and to adore thee, without thee we know we can do nothing,
nor should be nothing, thou O Lord God, art our all, and our all, for all our
springs are in thee, and from thee.

And now, O Lord God, I come at this time before thee to speak a word unto
thee, but I find my self as unable as unfit, and as unfit, as unable, being
empty of all good, and full fit, and ready, for any, or all evils, such, O
Lord, thou know, is my wretched and miserable nature, averse unto all that
is good, and prone unto all that is evil, but thou, O my God, in Jesus Christ,
that art all good, and able to do all good, fill, O Lord, fill I humbly beseech
thee, my empty heart, with thy self, even with thy fullness, that I may speak
unto thee thine own words, and not mine own, for mine own words, would be but
words, but mere words, but thy words, even thine, O God, are works, and work I
know effectually: thou do not hear us for our words sake, because they are
but the words of men, not for our works sake, because they are but men's works,
nor for our own sake, because we have forsaken thee, but for thy great names
sake, O Lord, which is thy self, and therefore for thine own sake thou hear
us.

Ah Lord God, let me then so hear thy voice as my soul may live, and so live as
to praise thee, O Lord, is to live, yea to live in thee, to thee, and for thee,
which to do, Ah Lord, thou know is the desire I have to live; Ah great God,
be thou then graciously pleased, in the abundance of thy great goodness, to
speak a word in season, unto this dull, dead, senceless heart of mine, that I
may be so ravished therewith, as I may forthwith come out of my self, fly from
my self, hate, loath, and abhor my self, in dust and ashes, cause me, O Lord,
to consider my self as indeed I am, which is a little creeping clay, speaking
earth, a worm, and no man, vile, sinful, wretched, and abominable from the
Crown of the head, to the sole of the foot, there is no whole part in me, I am
more Leprous then Gehazy, much more unclean then was Mary Magdalen, more blind
in soul then Bartemeus was in body, more lame to run after thee, O Lord, in thy
ways, then was Mephibosheth in his feet, my soul runs with a greater flux of
Sin, then was the Hemorish Issue, and more then thirty eight years, O Lord,
thou know all these diseases have been upon me, Ah Lord, my Lord, and my
God, be thou therefore pleased in love and mercy to look upon me with one of
thine eyes, and heal me, and thou shall do as great a work as in curing them
all, I know, and am assured that thou have so great a skill, that if thou will,
thou can with a word forgive the one, and heal the other.

Ah wonder of wonders! yea too too wonderful to believe, but by those whom
thou dwell in, that thou will dwell and delight to dwell in such a heart,
but all such know, O Lord, through the power of thy goodness, and the working
of thy holy spirit in their hearts, that nothing is hard for thee, O God, to
do: but all things are as easy as possible, thou bring light out of
darkness, and turnest evil into good, with the word of thy mouth, for he is
only worthy, whom thou in favor accountest worthy.

Seeing then, O Lord God, that it is thy good will and pleasure, to do so much
for me as thou can do, which is to give me thine own self, be thou, Ah be
thou pleased in the riches of thy mercy and free grace, to accept of my self,
not as a recompense, O Lord, for this thy great gift, but as an Acknowledgment,
that I have received so great a gift from thee, and that therefore I am no
longer, nor no more, mine own, nor any others either in Heaven or on Earth, but
thine own, O Lord, and thine all, and I most humbly, and most unfeignedly
beseech thee from the bottom of my heart in Jesus Christ, that it may so
continue, and be, unto all Eternity, and that I may not henceforth, think,
speak, or do, any thing by my self, from my self alone, without thee, O Lord,
but that all my thoughts, words and actions, may be wholly guided and governed
by thee, to do all things agreeable to thy holy will, and according to thine
own heart, who art the heart of my heart, the life of my life, and the Soul of
my Soul, for by thee only and all one, I live, move, and have my being.

Give me then grace, O Lord God, that I may so love thee, as to adore thee, so
fear thee, as not offend thee, so delight in thee, as that thou m^yest be my
only delight, so obey thee, as to be obedient unto the death, so honor thee,
as to walk humbly before thee, and give up my self unto thee, let me so run
after thee as to obtain thee, and get a blessing from thee, which may be a
blessing unto me in life, in death, and after death, that by receiving from
thee daily grace, I may give thee daily glory.

Ah Lord, thou know how my heart seeks to find thee, that I may enjoy
thee, who art, and who only art the joy and rejoicing of my heart, that I may
love thee, fear thee, adore thee, praise thee, prize thee, and give my self
unto thee, who have given thy self for me, and to me, O Lord, thou art all
things, and give all things unto all Creatures, all things have their all
from thee, who art all in all, in all things; thou art, O Lord, brighter and
much more glorious then the Sun, for the glorious brightness of the Sun, is
from the brightenss of thy glory, the Heavens have their beauty from thy
beautifulness, the Earth and the Sea, their plenty and fullness from thy
plentiful fullness, all the Creatures have all their strength from thy strength,
and man his power, might and wisdom to govern them, and all things under the
Sun, from thine Almighty power and wisdom.

Ah most glorious Lord God, who art thus glorious to behold, how can I, Worm,
behold thy glory, or thee, O Lord, the Lord of all glory, I confess and
acknowledge, that I am not able of my self, to know my self, my vileness,
wretchedness, emptiness and nothingness, how then, O Lord, am I able to know
thee, or to consider thee as thou art in thy self, and how much thy goodness
exceeds my badness, thy wisdom, my folly, thy strength my weakness, thy fullness
my emptiness, thine Almightiness my nothingness, and yet how content am I,
though nothing, or less worth then nothing, yea to be turned even into nothing
for thy sake.

But seeing, O Lord, thou have in thy great goodness, love and mercy, made me
thine, make me now, O Lord, even what thou will, and sent me whether thou will,
I am ready and willing to go, and be, and do and suffer, yea to spend, and to
be spent for thee, for thou know, O Lord God, if I desire to live, it is to
live to thee, in thee, and for thee, to praise thee, and for thy praise, for to
praise thee is to live, and this to do only, is the only desire I have to live,
for when I have thee, Lord, I have all that I desire and crave, thy presence
being my Heaven on Earth, and thy absence my Hell; having thee, O Lord, I have
my all, but wanting thee, I want all that I would have, thou only art able to
content, to satisfy, and to please me, but nothing but thee, nothing out of
thee, nothing besides thee, O my God, yea all things besides thee, cannot give
me any true pleasure, delight or contentment, O give me then so thy self, my
sweet Jesus, as I may be always with thee, never without thee, that I may
wholly give up my self unto thee, to be more holy like unto thee, that my heart
may be according to thine own heart, and that thou may delight thine heart,
O Lord, to set thine heart upon me, and to make me thy delight, thy joy and thy
Crown of glory, and to love me, and to do me good, even with that goodness of
heart, with thine own goodness, wherewith thou love thine own, that my will
may in all things be conformable, and made subject to thy will, to will all
that thou willest willingly, and to nill all that thou nillest with the same
willing will.

And grant, O Lord, that mine eyes may be always open to behold thee, mine ears
to hear thee, my mouth to praise thee, mine arms to embrace thee, my feet to
run after thee, and my heart heartily to love, honor, fear and adore thee, so
that all my members and faculties, both in soul and body, may be as instruments
only to act thy motions, that I may be out of love with all, that I may be only
in love with thee, who art all love, and only lovely, my dear, my sweet and
saving Savior Jesus.

Ah Lord God, make me willing to give my self up unto the that did so
willingly give up thy self for me, and to be made like unto me, that I might be
made like unto thee, thou rejoyced'st, O Lord, to come down from Heaven on
Earth, to lift me up from Earth into Heaven, to live a mortal life on Earth,
that I might live an immortal life in Heaven, to dye on Earth, to free me from
Eternal death, and to give me Eternal life; thou were, O Lord, made subject to
all infirmities on Earth, to confirm and make me for ever free from them, in
Heaven, seeing then thou were, O Lord, willing to come to me in blood, even
through thine own blood, to wash me out of my blood, and to make me for ever
clean; Ah Lord, wash not my hands and my feet only, but my head and my heart
out also, even my bloody heart, that has delighted so much, and so often, to
make thy innocent heart to bleed, yea to shed the last drop of blood that was
in thy heart.

Thou would, O Christ, thou would wear an ignominious Crown of Thorns
here on earth, that I might wear a glorious Crown of Glory hereafter in Heaven;
thou would, O Christ, thou would be whipped, that thy stripes might heal
me; thou would, thou would, O Christ, be bound to loose me, and set me
free; thou would O Christ, thou would be accursed, that I might be for
ever blessed; thou would, O Christ, thou would have thine arms nailed
abroad, to show the breadth of thy love, thy feet nailed to show the length of
thy love, and thy head pierst with Thorns to show the height of thy love, and
thy heart opened with a spear to show the depth of thy love; Ah breadth,
length, height and depth of love, that such a God would be thus wounded to heal
such a man as I am, thus accursed to make me blessed, thus bound to make me free,
thus made an heir of misery, to make me an heir of mercy, thus to drink the
dreggs of his Fathers Divine wrath, that I might for ever drink in the streams,
and of the Ocean of his Divine love, Ah love beyond degree, an offended God
thus dies, to set offending men free.

And thus has God, the Lord, my Lord, and my God, freed me from Eternal pains,
and given me hopes here, and assurance hereafter of Eternal joys, he has
brought me out of the neither Hell, into the upper Heaven of grace here, which
shall be glory hereafter, he has freed, he has freed me from Eternal death,
and purchased for me Eternal life, he has broken, he has broken the chains of
sin, by which Satan held me, and led me captive at his will, and does lead me
forth by and with the chains of his Eternal and everlasting love, enabling me
through grace to do his own holy will.

And what, Lord, shall I render unto thee, for all these thy benefits, thou
Lord, know my unabillity and my poverty, I am, I am I confess so poor, yea
so despicably poor, O Lord, as I have nothing to pay thee, nor can pay thee
nothing, but what thou shall give me, give me then, O Lord, what thou will have
me to give thee, give me, Oh give me I humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ,
love to love thee, fear to fear thee, faith to believe in thee, to depend on
thee, and to roll my self upon thee, hope to trust in thee, and joy to rejoice
in thee, with joy unspeakable; Ah Lord God, give me thy self, yea all thy self,
that I may give thee all my self, and though I do, I confess, already owe thee
mine all, yet I would willingly owe thee yet more, and though I have nothing to
pay thee, yet I desire, and heartily desire to owe the more, to be more
indebted unto thee, for I delight to be thy great debtor, yea and would be thy
greatest, and so I confess I should be, though thou should neither give, nor
forgive me any more, then thou have already forgiven, and given me; Ah Lord, I
know, that for all thy gifts of grace, mercy, pardon and forgiveness, that thou
expects only an acknowledgement, that I am thine all, and that I owe thee my
self, and mine all, the freedom Lord, Ah Lord, the freedom, all the freedom,
all the freedom that I desire, is to be thy Prisoner, never any man desired so
much to be let out of Prison, as I do to be put in, never any slave desired so
much to be free, as I do to be bound unto thee, O God, my God, unto thee, unto
thee my God, never any man desired so earnestly to pay his debts, as I desire
to be further, and to be more indebted; give me, O Lord, I beseech thee more
and more, that I may every day, yea every moment of the day, all the days of my
life, unto the very last moment of the last day of my life be receiving, that
when this life is ended, I may live an Eternal life, to pay thee Eternally
praise and thanksgiving.

Be thou then, Ah sweet Jesus, be thou always in me, that I may always be in
thee stand by me continually, that I may always stand upright and walk
uprightly, and never fall, go with me, that I may never go from thee, abide, O
Lord, abide ever in me, that I may ever abide in thee, act in me, O Lord, act
ever in me, that I may ever act for thee, speak, O Lord, speak continually in
me, that I may continually speak for thee, work for me, O Lord, work always for
me, that I may always work for thee, live in me, O Lord, live always in me,
that I may always live to thee, and for thee, Ah Lord, do all for me, do all
for me, that all that I shall henceforth always do, may be all for thee, that I
may choose not my own will, but thy will may be my choice; Ah Lord let me know
thy blessed voice, that I may always answer thee at thy blessed call, whether
it be by night or by day, as Samuel did, and say with him, and with his heart,
speak Lord, for thy Servant hears, and with holy David, for my heart is
ready, and with heavenly Paul, what Lord, what will thou have me to do.

Write, O Lord, I humbly beseech, thy holy and divine laws of grace in my
heart, that with my heart I may delight in them, and thy Statutes in my mind,
that all, even all my mind may be still on them, that they may be a savor of
life unto life to my soul, and of death unto death to my sins; let thy
Commandments, O Lord, be no more grievous unto me, but joyous, that I may ever
find thy yoke easy and thy burden light.

Let thy word, O God, feed me, yea let me feast on it as on marrow, and
fatness, let it refresh and comfort my heart as with Wine on the Lees, yea as
Wine well refined on the Lees; let it be sweeter to my taste then honey, yea
then the Honeycomb; Ah Lord, let my heart be set on it, and much more delighted
with it, then with gold, yea, then with much fine gold, or precious pearls, let
it distill into my heart to ravish it; Ah Lord, let it so ravish me, as all my
senses may be filled and delighted with its sweetness: Let me, O Lord, hear it
attentively, understandingly and feelingly, as thine own word, which thine own
mouth has spoken: that my mouth may be filled with thy praises, yea that I may
trumpet them forth louldly and sweetly, let mine eyes always look upon thee, O
Lord, from whence my salvation comes, to behold thy beauty, thy glory, and thy
blessedness, as in thy Sanctuary, that my feet may run in the ways of thy
Commandments, and not grow weary, and walk, and not faint; O Lord let me sit
under the shadow of thy branches continually, for thy fruit is very pleasant
unto my taste; there is none in Heaven, O Lord, that my soul desires as thee,
nor in all the earth in comparison of thee; Ah how does my soul and my heart
long to be where thou art, even where thou art, O God in Heaven thy dwelling
place, glading and rejoicing the hearts of all those that behold thee,
beholding the brightness, the sweetness, the loveliness, and the lovingness of
thy most glorious, most beautiful, and most blessed countenance, which to see
is life, yea, much better than life; Ah Lord, bring me then home unto thee,
even to my long desired home, that I may ever enjoy thee, and live in thee my
joy, in whom my soul only delights to live, for with thee, I know is all joy,
unspeakable joy, fullness of joy, and at thy right hand, O God, are pleasures
for ever more, such as eye has not seen, ear has not heard, neither has it
ever entered into the heart of any man, at any time to conceive.

Ah Lord God, I well know and believe rejoycingly, that thou know all
things, and therefore know well, how my heart and my soul pants for thee,
longs for thee, coveteth for thee, and most ambitiously hungreth and
thirsts after thee, Ah Lord, when shall that blessed time be, and the day
come, that I shall be altogether emptyed of my own emptyness, and filled with
thy fullness, be stripped of my own rags, and clothed with thy glorious robes,
be found out of my self in thee, be made partaker of thine own Holy and Divine
nature, which is perfection, and glory, in glory, yea perfect glory, then shall
I be no more mine own, but thine own, yea thine all, so that all that I shall
do, shall please thee well, and be right well pleassing unto thee, for then I
shall no longer do the evil which I would not, and which I hate, but the good
which I would, and which I love, yea the good, and all the good that thou, O
God wilt, and which thou love; it shall not then be present with me, only to
will, but to do also, even all thy holy and whole, and perfect will, I shall
then no longer desire to be stripped of any thing that is in me, because, O God,
my God, thou shall be all in me, and only in me, then, and there, I shall no
longer mourn for my unholiness, nor pray for more blessedness, but all tears,
fears and cares, shall be all done away, my unworthiness here, shall through
thy worthiness, O sweet Jesus, be accounted worthy, my unrighteousness,
righteous, my disobedience, obedience, and my imperfection, perfect, full, and
entire perfection, through that ever blessed, most blessed, and only, and all
blessed perfection, that in the thee, who art God, blessed for ever and ever.

Ah, who would not then for a while feed on crumbs, that he may eat of this
bread, and at last sup at this feast; Ah, who would not, who would not be
content to hunger a while, to be brought to this banquet of heavenly dainties;
who would not, Ah, who would not be content for a little space to sit
grovelling on the ground, and be covered with dust and ashes, that he may at
last sit at this Table? who would not, Ah, who would not stay a while without
with patience, being assured at last, yea, and ere long, to be brought in into
the brides Chamber? Ah, who would not, who would not be poor for a while to be
made thus rich for ever? Ah, who would not, who would not be content to be
contemptible for a little space, to be thus honored, and made truly honorable
for ever? Ah, who would not, who would not be right well content to be banished
for a while, to be thus brought home in triumph gloriously to abide in his
Fathers house for ever? who would not, Ah, who would not be well content, and
rejoice to be a stranger, and a Pilgrim for a little while in a strange land,
to have such a possession for ever? who would not, Ah, who is there that would
not be in a storm for a while, to enjoy for ever such a calm? who would not,
who would not want the delicacies of Egypt for a while, to have the delicacies
of Heaven for ever? who would not, Ah, who is there that would not refuse to be
called the Son of Pharaoh's Daughter for a while, to be the Son of the Eternal,
living, loving, blessed God for ever, and for ever? Ah, who would not, who
would not willingly and cheerfully suffer with the Children of God for a while,
for a little space, to reign with the Children of God for ever? who would not,
Ah, who would not willingly be clothed with rags for a while, to wear for
ever such glorious robes? who would not, Ah, who is he that would not be
Crowned with Thorns for a moment, to be Crowned with such a Crown of glory for
ever? Ah, who would not, who would not bear the Cross here till death, that he
may for ever wear the Crown of immortal life? Ah, who would not, who would not
suffer with Christ here, to reign with Christ for ever hereafter? Ah, who would
not, who would not be despised among men, to be cherished among Angels? Ah, who
would not, who would not suffer as Lazarus did, to reign as Lazarus does? Ah,
who would not, who would not suffer as a member of Christ's mystical body here,
to be a member of his glorious body for ever hereafter? Ah, who would not, who
would not live the life of the righteous here, to live for ever and ever with
the righteous hereafter, not in the bosom of Abraham, but in the bosom of
Abraham's, Isaac's and Jacob's Gods?

In the mean time, O Lord, give me grace, courage and strength, to run that
good race, to fight that good fight, that thou have set before me perseveringly
unto the end, that I may as willingly wear the Crown of Thorns here for thy
sake, as the Crown of glory hereafter for my own sake; that I may be as
willingly under temptation here, as to be freed from temptation hereafter; that
for thy sake, O Lord, I may as willingly be contemptible here, as honorable
hereafter, that I may as willingly suffer, O Lord, for thee here, as reign with
thee hereafter, and that in all sufferings my only joy may be, that I shall for
ever enjoy thee.

But, Ah, Lord God, what am I, and what is there in me, and therefore what am I
able to do for thee, or to render unto thee, for this thy love, which far
surpasses the love of Women, Men, or of Angels? as there was never sorrow like
to thy sorrow, so there was never love like to thy love: true it is, O Lord,
for all this thy love, thou requirest nothing, but love again. Ah, how fain
would I love thee, but I cannot as I would, how much less then is it, then I
should? when I would do good, evil is present, and I do the evil many times
which I would not; but do not, cannot do the good which I would; to will is
many times present, but how to perform I know not, but thanks be unto God,
through our Lord Jesus Christ, though with my flesh I serve the law of sin, yet
with my mind, I serve the law of God; Grant then, O sweet Jesus, and give me
grace, that I may love thee, as thou have loved me, and do for thee, as thou
have done for me, and to this end make my heart upright before thee, even
according to thine own heart, that it may no longer be mine own, but thine own,
that I may be only thine, wholly thine, holy thine, always thine, and ever
thine, that thou in me, and I in thee, may from sin be ever free.

Teach me, O Lord, so to number my days, that I may apply my heart unto Wisdom,
that I may be always mindful of my last end, and of the reckoning that I must
then make before thee, the Judge of Heaven and Earth; Ah Lord, suffer me not
any longer to walk after the devices of mine own decitfull evil heart; but
grant, O God, by thy power I may have power to do, and walk uprightly before
thee in all thy paths, and that I may never more swerve, nor turn aside out of
the way of thy Commandments, either to the right hand of pleasures, or to the
left hand of profits.

Give me grace, O Lord God, I most humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ, to see
mine own badness, and thy goodness ready, and willing to make me good, that I
may see mine own emptiness, and thy fullness ready to fill me, mine own
nakedness, and thy robes to cover and cloth me, mine own sinfulness, and thy
righteousness to make me righteous, mine own cursedness, and thy blessedness to
make me blessed, my own deformity and ugliness, and thy beautifulness to make
me beautiful; my own slavery, and thy freedom, and freeness to make me free,
mine own unworthyness, and thy worthyness to make me worthy, mine own
insufficiency, and thine al-sufficiency, mine own demerit, and thy merit, mine
own disobedience, and thine obedience, mine own nothingness, yea, altogether
nothing, and thine Almightiness, yea, altogether all things, for in thee are
all things, from thee come all things, and by thee, O God, all things are and
were created.

I do most unfeignedly confess, O Lord, that I am unable and unfit to speak
unto thee, and as unworthy to hear thee speak unto me, for in me, that is in my
flesh, there is no good: I am all evil, only evil, and continually evil, but in
thee, O God, dwells all good, for thou art all good, only good, and
continually do good, without thee I can say nothing, think nothing, nor do
nothing that is good; suffer me not therefore, O Lord, I beseech thee, to speak
in my own wisdom, for that would be but the wisdom of words; but let me, O
Lord, speak in thy wisdom, which will be the words of wisdom, and Wisdoms
words: Let me not, O Lord, go forth in my own strength against any Temptation,
for I am so weak, I should be overcome, and fall into any Temptation, but let
thy strength, thy power, thy might and thy love, O Lord, be seen in my
weakness, to strengthen me, and by thy power, powerfully working in me, I may
overcome and trample under my feet, all the strength and power of all my
adversaries and enemies, Devils lust, worlds lusts, and self-lusts.

Ah Lord God, suffer me not to go from thee, for thou have the words of Eternal
life, thou art the word, and the life, yea, Eternal life, he that has thee,
has life, and shall not see death, nor taste of death, because he is past from
death to life, but he that has not thee, O Lord Christ, is dead already,
because he lives in sin, for he that lives in sin, is dead, though he lives.

Ah Lord, I confess that the Well of thy mercy is much deeper then Jacob's
Well, and yet sure I am that such Children, yea such Infants as I am, can draw
water from thence, even the water of life, even such water as gives another
life, a better life, which is an immortal and eternal life, a life that shall
never see death, being hid with Christ in God.

Ah sweet Jesus, let me have thee in my heart, which is much better then to
have thee as Simeon had in his arms, my arms might let thee fall out of them,
but my heart cannot, I had rather, yea, much rather see thee with the eyes of
true saving faith, then of sense, or with the eyes of the flesh: for thine
enemies, O Lord, saw thee with fleshly eyes, and yet hated thee, spit on thee,
reviled and mocked thee, whipped thee, persecuted thee, and crucified thee,
bearing false witness against thee, and believed not in thee, notwithstanding
all the miracles that thou did, but all those that see thee, O Lord, by the
eyes of faith, will believe in thee, and say of thee, unto thee, as Thomas did,
my Lord, and my God, they will so love thee, as they will Crucify themselves
and their bosom sins, hate themselves, and their own ways, persecute
themselves, and crucify all their own sinful fleshly, worldly, devilish lusts
and affections, and live as new Creatures, in the world, as if they were not of
the world, using the world, as if they used it not; Ah happy, yea, thrice happy
are they that are in such a case, for they have the Lord for their God.

Ah poor lost I, poor forgotten I, poor forsaken I, poor undone I, poor
miserable I, poor nothing I, despicable poor I, until thou O my sweet Jesus
did come to my help, to my succor, to find me, to save me, to comfort me,
to enrich me, to deliver me, to set me free, and bring me out of the chains of
sin, Hell, and death, by which I was held, and led Captive, and did most
graciously bring me into thy self, and gave me thy self, and loved'st me as
thy self, doing for me, O God, what thou could do, making me like thy self.

Ah Lord God, thou know all things, I well know, thou know my heart, and
what more can my heart say unto thee, thou only, O Lord, art the searcher, the
tryer, and the knower of all hearts, thou know, O Lord, I know well that
thou know, how much my heart rejoices, because thou know it, O Lord, I
most humbly beg and beseech the in Jesus Christ, to search and try me, even all
the Corners and Crannies of my heart, and what evil is still in me, O Lord, I
humbly entreat thee to destroy, with an utter and total destruction, that it
may be said of it, it is not; Let sin, O Lord, as the House of Saul, grow every
day weaker and weaker, and grace as the house of David, every day stronger and
stronger; O Lord perfect that good work of grace, which thou have in the
abundance of thy love begun in me, until thou have in love made it, and brought
me into perfect glory; and all this I beg of thee, O Father, in Jesus Christ,
and what else thou know to be needful or expedient for me, both for Soul and
Body, in life, in death, and after death; for Christ I shall ever bless thee,
and to him, with thy glorious Majesty, and holy Spirit of grace the comforter,
and sanctifier, do I render from the bottom of my heart unfeignedly, as all due
is, and unto none else, honor, glory, power, might, Majesty, dominion, and
thanksgiving, now, henceforth, and for evermore, Amen.

1. If our comfort and joy be so great to enjoy the Company of one imperfect
Saint on Earth, Ah how great shall our joy and comfort be, to enjoy for ever
that innumerable Company of perfected Saints in Heaven, but how much more, and
more great shall our joy be, and to our eternal comfort, to enjoy God the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost, that made them thus perfect, and Saints!

2. If we rejoice so much here on earth to see one, or some few friends in the
flesh that we think love God; Ah how shall we rejoice when in Heaven, to see so
many Millions of Millions in the body and Spirit, whom we shall know indeed,
that they love him in deed, and in death?

3. If men then on earth delight our senses, Ah how shall God in Heaven with
delight ravish our hearts?

4. Ah Lord, let me then still so have thee within me, though on earth, that I
may say with Jacob, I have all.

5. If men on earth be able to give great gifts, and their gifts be so greatly
esteemed (though but earth) Ah, how greatly should we esteem that great gift of
that great God, when he gives us himself, who is as good as great, and as great
as good.

6. If earthly joys do then sometimes rejoice a Heavenly heart; Ah Lord, how
shall, and how does that heart rejoice, when it is filled with heavenly joys,
yea, when he shall be involved, taken in, and swallowed up, into the joys of
Heaven.

7. And if momentany and earthly joys can give us joy any moment, surely
Eternal Heavenly joys shall make us to rejoice evermore.

8. And if hope fill us with joy unspeakable, surely fruition shall make us
flow over with fullness.

9. And if the thoughts of what we know not, satisfy us so much, surely when
we shall know them, to be sure, we shall be fully satisfied.

10. And if faith in believing be so great, as it brings Salvation, Ah how
great shall that Salvation be, when it shall be above, and beyond, that is,
more than faith!

11. And if to do the will of God on earth imperfectly, delight the Soul so
much, that there is no delight to him like it, he prefers it above his daily
food, and all other delights in the flesh; Ah what delight shall that soul have
in Heaven, where he shall always, and perfectly do his whole and holy perfect
will!

12. And if God be so well pleased with us here, for our weak and imperfect
desires after grace, Ah how well pleased will he be with us, when he shall have
made our imperfect grace, full, and perfect Glory!

13. And if God delight so much in us whilst we are here below imperfect and
sinners, Ah how much and how greatly will he delight in us above, when he shall
have made us holy, and perfect Saints!

14. And if our joys be so great to see God here, and his Glory darkly as in a
glass, with fleshly eyes, Ah how great shall our joy be, to see him gloriously,
and all his glory in Heaven, face to face, with spiritual eyes, yea with the
eyes of his own Holy Spirit!

15. And if our Joys be so great to hear of him here, with the hearing of the
ears, Ah how great shall they be to be with him hereafter, and to hear himself,
with an understanding heart?

16. And if then our Joys be so great, to enjoy him here on earth, and but in
part, imperfectly, Ah how great shall our joys and delights be, to enjoy him in
Heaven, not in part, but in perfection, perfectly, fully, wholly, and holy as
he is!

17. And if our Joys be so great here on earth, in the midst of fears, Ah how
great shall they be in Heaven? where we need fear no fears, for that there are
no fears there to fear.

18. And if our Joys be here on earth so great, though surrounded with many
sorrows, Ah how great shall they be in Heaven, when and where all sorrows shall
be all done away, and turned into fullness of Joy!

19. And if our Joys be so great among so many displeasing displeasures, even
here ^n earth, Ah how great shall they be in Heaven, when and where all
displeasures shall all be done away, and our pleasures be for evermore!

20. Ah fill me then, O my good God, with thy blessed most blessed self, and
thy Joys alone, that in thee only I may rejoice.

21. If the nether Springs on Earth be so sweet, Ah how delicious and sweet,
yea sweetly delicious, O God, are the upper Springs of Heaven in Heaven.

22. If thy left hand mercies O God, be so delightful, and do so much delight
and please us, Ah how much more shall those of thy right hand delight us with
pleasure.

23. If his footstool favors be so great, and we esteem our selves greatly
favored by them, to have them. Ah how great in favor, yea what great
favorites shall we be, when we shall enjoy in Heaven the favors of his Throne,
and sit on Thrones by him.

24. If to see a glimpse of his glory, beauty, and brightness here on earth, do
so ravish us with delight, joy, and admiration, so as we could and would always
be content to behold it; Ah how then shall our hearts be ravished, with that
ravishing fullness of his bright beautiful glory, when we shall in Heaven
behold all his glory, as he is in his Kingdom of glory, with all his glorious
Saints and Angels; from whose beautiful brightness and glory they have all
their glorious brightness and beauty, and are made thus gloriously beautiful
with surpassing beauty and glory; being in all things made like unto him.

25. If then his glory be so sweet in the bud, what is it in the branch; but Ah
then, how much greater and sweeter is the Tree that has so many branches!

26. If then so great and sweet on earth, Ah how greatly great and sweet in
Heaven!

27. And if our delights be so great in seeking thee, O God, here below on
earth, Ah how incomprehenslbly great shall they and will they be, when we shall
have found thee where thou art above in Heaven!

28. And seeing, O God, thou give us such wages her whilst we offend thee, Ah
how great shall they be, yea what is there but thou will give us, when we shall
offend thee no more, but always please thee.

29. And seeing our Heaven is so sweet on earth, or our earthly Heaven so
sweet, which is but to see thy back part by Faith darkly as in a glass, Ah how
sweet, yea how much sweeter shall our heavenly Heaven be, or our Heaven in
Heaven, which is to know thee, as thou art, O God, to be known, and see thee
clearly and plainly even face to face.

30. And seeing thy love, O God, is so great to us here, as it constrains us
to love thee, Ah how great shall it be to us there, when without constraint,
our greatest joy and pleasure shall be, to adore, and love thee!

31. Ah Lord God, that know my heart, thou know that all the desires of
my heart, yea that the soul of my soul, and the heart of my heart desires to
love thee only, and to serve thee with all my whole heart.

32. If thy name, O Lord, be so great, and fearful, unto those that know thee,
and that know that thou love them, Ah how fearfully great, and greatly
fearful, shall it be unto those that know thee not, but yet know thy greatness,
and how greatly thou hate them!

33. All Glory, only Glory, and continually Glory, be given unto God, the God
and giver of all gifts, grace, and Glory.

A Prayer.
THe Scope, Sum, Contents, and my intent, in this following Prayer, is, to
beseech the Lord to be always graciously present with me, to watch over me, and
to give me in Jesus Christ, and for his sake, merits and worthiness, his own
holy and blessed Spirit, to lead, direct, guide and govern me in all things
that I shall take in hand to do, to change my old heart, and give me a New,
that I may glorify him by a holy life, and conversation all the rest of my
days; and especially, in this place, where I have so much, so often, and so
grievously sinned against his great and holy name, and walked contrary unto him,
serving the Devil, and obeying his lusts, worlds lusts, and self lusts, casting
his holy and divine Commandments behind my back, and trampling his Precepts
under my feet, and that he would be pleased with me, to bring home all his
Elect suddenly, into his Kingdom of grace here, and of glory hereafter, that
his whole and holy will may be done by us here on earth, as it is done in
Heaven, until he shall be pleased through the infiniteness and
incomprehensibleness of the riches of his free grace, love, and mercy in Jesus
Christ to bring us into the Holy of Holies, the Heaven of Heavens, even into
his blessed self, there for ever and for ever, to sing that ever blessed ditty,
sweet, Angelical, and Eternal Song of Hallelujah, of Praise, Thanksgiving, and
Glory, unto his ever blessed, most great, gracious, and glorious name. So be
it, Lord, So be it.

O Lord God of Heaven and Earth, most high, most great, and most glorious, the
Creator, Preserver, and Governor of all things, who have created all things by
the word of thy power, by thee only they are, and were created, thou willest
all that thou do, and do all that thou will; thou, O God, that art the only
God, for there is none else, there is none besides thee, the God of Abraham, of
Isaac, and of Jacob, that wast with the Children of Israel in Egypt, and on the
Red Sea, with Moses in the Wilderness, with Joseph in Prison, with Daniel in
the Lions den, with the three Children in the fiery Furnace, and with Abraham
in a strange Land; be with me also, O God, in Jesus Christ, be with me also thy
poor unworthy Creature and servant in this strange Land, sinful place, and
Nation, whither thou have by thine accustomed good and gracious Protection, and
Providence, again called and brought me; Ah let not, O Lord, my former, many,
frequent, great, and grievous sins (committed here in this place chiefly) be
brought to thy mind, or had in remembrance of thee any more, and so cause thee
to hide thy glorious face and presence from me, and take away thine Holy
Spirit, and give me up to a Spirit of delusion, and to mine own hearts lusts
and affections, which I take to be, O Lord, the sorest and the greatest of thy
Judgments upon earth in this life; but rather, Ah rather, O Lord, show forth
thy goodness, and thy compassion unto me, miserable sinner, vile wretch, sinful
abominable dust and ashes, a worm and no man, yea the very worst of the worst
of men.

O Lord, I most humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ, and for his sake alone, to
pass by and forgive all my former iniquities, transgressions, blasphemies and
sins, by nayling them to his Cross, who was crucified for them, that they might
not crucify me, by burying them in his grave, who died for them, that they
might not put me to death, and was buried, that they might never rise in
Judgment against me, to terrify me here in this life, or to condemn me in the
life to come.

Ah my good Lord God, for thy great goodness sake, grant, that here, where I
have so much, so often, and so frequently disowned thee, and blasphemed thee, I
may own thee and praise thee, and thou own me for thine own, that here where I
have so much and so often dishonored thee by my wicked, devilish and sinful
life, serving and even giving my self up to serve Devils lusts, Worlds lusts,
and self lusts, I may honor thee, by despising, and trampling them under my
feet, and serving thee in thy ways of holiness and righteousness, all the days
of my life, that here, here, O Lord, where I have despised thee, I may adore
thee, that here, O Lord, even here, where I have walked so contrary unto thee,
I may henceforth walk well pleasing before thee, that here, here, O Lord, where
I have hated thee, I may henceforth and for ever show forth my love to thee,
and for thee, that here even here, O Lord, where I have so much and so often
grieved thee, I may take heed and carefully endeavor to glad thee, by all
things that I do, speak, or think, that here, even here, O Lord God, where I
have caused thee to mourn, I may cause thee mightily to rejoice, that here,
even here, O Lord my God, where I have so often and so cruelly crucified thee,
I may without remorse or compassion, crucify all those sinful lusts and
affections that did it, that here, even here, O Lord, where I have so much and
so often put thee to open shame, by my sinful, filthy, abominable, devilsh life
and conversation, I may openly, frequently, and mightily, applaud, praise, and
glorify thy holy, holy, most holy name, that here, O Lord, even here, where I
have done so much, yea all that I could against thee, I may with all my power,
might, strength, heart, will and affections, do all, even all that I can for
thee, that here, even here, O Lord, where I have in all things, at all times,
and in all places, deserted, dishonored, and disobeyed thee, Ah Lord, my Lord
now, and my God, grant I most humbly and unfeignedly beseech thee, that I may
in all things, at all times, and in all places and companies, serve, honor and
obey thee, by night and by day, sleeping and waking, on thy days, O Lord, and
on our days, in thy house, O Lord, and in all other houses, at thy Table, O
Lord, and at all other Tables, in and by all my thoughts, words and actions.
Grant, O Lord, that here where sin has so much abounded, grace may much more
abound, and grant I also most humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ, that those
that have seen me grow up in all sin, may see sin destroyed in me with an utter
and total destruction, and separation, and my growth i^ all grace may appear.
Grant, O Lord, that those that have been tempted by me, and sinned by my
example, may by my example fly sin, and sins Temptations, and be brought home
with me unto thee, to serve thee, and that here where I have served Satan, and
been an instrument in his work. Grant, O Lord, I beseech thee, that I may
despite him to his face, and by thine Almighty power, I may trample all his
powerful temptations under my feet, showing forth, O Lord, that thy Kingdom,
power and glory is in my heart, by my doing thy will here on earth as it is
done in Heaven, by crucifying and mortifying all sinful lusts and affections,
the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, for he that
is born of God, must and will overcome the world, and depart from all iniquity.

Grant, O my God, in Jesus Christ, that here where I have been a member of
Satan, I may be a member of Christ my Savior, bone of his bone, and flesh of
his flesh, a member of his mystical body of grace here, and of his glorious
body, in glory hereafter; that here, even here, O Lord, where I have been a Son
of Satan, a Child of wrath, I may be an adopted Son and Child of God, an heir
of Heaven, and Coheir with Jesus Chsist, of that Kingdom, life and glory,
which he has provided and prepared for the Saints in life, where, their God
will not (I trust) be ashamed to be called my God, nor their Father to be
called my Father.

Inflame, O Lord, my heart with hearty and sincere zeal in thy service, that I
may not do thy work faintingly, droopingly, drousily, nor negligently; but
faithfully, circumspectly, willingly, cheerfully, obediently, and perseveringly
unto the end of my days, that thou, O Lord, my Lord, and my God, may be at
all times, in all places, and above all things, my joy, my Crown of joy, and my
rejoicing, my ultimate end, aim, and desire, my supreme, sovereign, principal,
chief, and superior good, my lot, my portion, and mine inheritance for ever.

And to this end, suffer me not, O Lord, I humbly beseech thee, to walk in my
old ways and paths of sin, but in thine, O Lord God of holiness and
righteousness, not according to mine own sinful and deceitful heart, which is
all evil, only evil, and continually evil, but, O God, according to thine
heart, which is all good, only good, and continually good, that thou may so
delight me, that all my delight may so delight thee, and make thee, O Lord God,
my only delight, love me, O Lord, in Jesus Christ, that I may love thee, honor
me, that I may honor thee, magnify me, that I may magnify thee, live in me,
that I may live in thee, do all for me, that I may do all, and be all for thee,
that I may not henceforth, O Lord, speak mine own words, but thine, not think
my own thoughts, but thine, not do mine own works, but thine.

Ah Lord, for Jesus Christ his sake, I humbly beseech thee, suffer me not to be
led into any temptation, so as to prevail over me, but though temptations fall
on me, I may not fall into them, though sin do remain in my heart, my heart may
not remain in sin, deliver, O Lord, from all evil, for thine is the Kingdom,
the power, and the glory, O thou my Father in Jesus Christ, which art in Heaven.

Be a wall of fire and of water round about me, O my God, continually, to keep
and preserve me from all mine Enemies and Adversaries, the Devil, the World,
and the Flesh; be, O Lord, a City of refuge unto me, that I may ever hide my
self in thee, for then I shall be safe and sure to be free from all danger, be
thou, mine all, for all my springs are in thee and from thee.

But what is man that he should be clean, and the Son of man that is born of a
woman, that he should be righteous? Behold he puts no trust in his Saints,
and the Heavens are not clean in his sight, how much more abominable, and
filthy is man, that drinks up iniquity, as the Ox drinks up water, and
rusheth into sin, as the horse rusheth into the battle? But, ah my God, how
much more wretched am I, how much more unclean, filthy, and abominable am I,
than any that was ever born of a woman, I that have delighted in sin, as the
Drunkard in wine, as the wanton in his mate, how have I chosen sin, prized sin,
embraced sin, coveted sinning, and sought it as for hid Treasures? it has been
sweet to my taste, as the honey and the honey Comb, but, O Lord, I know, and am
assured, that with thee there is mercy, O teach thou me to fear thee.

For thou art, O Lord, become my Portion, and thou have made me thine
inheritance for ever, I prize thee, O Lord, much above gold, and the most
precious pearls, thy Countenance is most amiable; Ah how delightful are thy
ways, and how pleasant a thing it is, O Lord, to walk in the paths of thy
Commandments, and to keep thy Statutes: these things, O Lord, thou know are
only desirable unto my soul, and it longs only to be found in thee. Who,
Lord, who can, or is able to express, the ravishments of that heart that
possesses thee; who, Lord, who is able to express the joy of him that enjoys
thee? Ah how does he, as it were, run over with fullness of blessings that is
filled with thee, even with thy blessed self, who art the Fountain, the Ocean
and the Original of all blessedness, felicity and happiness? Ah Lord, how truly
may he say that has thee, as Jacob did, that he has all, though he should
want all other things? he that has thee, has all things in the want of all
things, and he that wants thee, wants all things, even in the possession of all
things: for what, O Lord, what are all things without thee, and what does he,
Ah what can he want that has thee, who art all things, yea much better than
all things? for he that has thee has life, yea, Eternal life, and is past
from death, death has no more dominion over him; but he that has thee not, is
dead, though he lives; for he that is in thee, O Lord, is from all sin free,
he that is born of thee, O God, sins not, sin has no more dominion over
him, because thy seed of holiness, which is sanctifica^ion, remains in him,
such a one has overcome the world, and that wicked One, with all the Powers of
the Kingdom of Darkness, Sin, Hell, Death and the Devil, he that is in Christ,
is Crucified to the world, and the world unto him, he is departed from all
iniquity, he has Crucified the flesh with the lusts and affections thereof, he
makes no longer provision for the flesh to satisfy its Lusts, for such, they
know that his Servants they are whom they obey, whether of sin unto death, or
of Obedience unto Righteousness.

Ah blessed, ever blessed, and only blessed and happy condition, to be thus
born again of God, and to sin no more, to be a member of Christ's mystical body,
bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, such shall be as assuredly Members of
his glorious Body, for they that are betrothed unto him here by grace shall be
hereafter married unto him in glory.

Ah Lord God, I am sure thou know my heart, and that though it is not what
it would be, or should be, yet thou have (for which I desire ever to praise
thee) in grace and mercy, made it such, as it heartily desires and longs to
be what it should be: but, O Lord, I know, that here is no perfection, and that
therefore it cannot be here; Ah Lord, I most humbly beseech thee in Jesus
Christ, in thine own good, due and appointed time, bring me home to that long
wished for, and blessed home, that I may be ever blessed in thee, and with
thee, who art God blessed for ever, and ever.

Ah Lord my Lord, thou know how willing I am to leave all for thee, lose all
to enjoy thee, trample all under my feet, and hate all for thy sake, yea, spend
and be spent for thee, and to follow thee the Lamb of Righteousness in all
places whither thou will go, even as a chaste Wife gives her self unto her
Husband, and delights to love, honor and obey him, and longs for his
presence, when he is absent, that she may lie in his bosom, and be embraced in
his arms, esteeming all things toys, and trash, to his love; even so, Lord,
thou know that my heart desires and longs to be espoused unto thee in
Heaven, made one with thee, knit and glued unto thee, that I may be thine for
ever, and be embraced in thine arms, and lie in thy bosom, living as thine,
and thine only, unspotted and unblameable, holy, O Lord, as thou art holy.

Heaven, O Lord, is Heaven, because it is holy, yea, because thou art there
that art holiness therefore, yea, therefore is Heaven Heaven, and Heaven holy,
and such a holy Heaven as it is: to those that are there, a thousand years seem
but as one day, so sweet is its enjoyment, and one day seems as a thousand
years, so great is their comfort of enjoyment; and therefore, O Lord, and to
praise thee, do I long to be dissolved from this body of sin which is death,
that I may live in thee, and with thee in holiness, which is Eternal life; for
this, O Lord, thou have taught me to know, and therefore my soul rejoices,
that holiness is the only felicity and chief happiness in Heaven, for that
makes us only like unto thee, who art the Heaven of Heaven in Heaven.

Grant therefore, O my God, in Christ, and for his sake, that I may, whilst
here below in the flesh on earth, seek after, labor for, and endeavor to
obtain that measure and degree of holiness, that my earthly Heaven may be a
Heaven in part, though not a perfect Heaven, and that I may from day to day,
grow and increase, from one degree of grace unto another, until I come to enjoy
that measure and fullness, that thou have, O Lord my God, in the infiniteness
and eternity of thy love, goodness and mercy, through thy free grace in Jesus
Christ, reserved, provided and appointed for me, out of thine own abundant and
overflowing fullness, for with thee is fullness of joy, and at thy right hand are
pleasures for evermore.

Ah Lord, for thy Mercies sake bring me unto that fullness, that I may for ever
rejoice in that joy which brings such peace as passes all understanding,
which eye has not seen, ear has not heard, neither has it ever entered into
the heart of man to conceive; Ah Lord, bring me into that Heaven, and in the
mean time let Heaven be in me, for holiness is Heaven, and Heaven is holiness,
therefore the more holiness is in us, the more Heaven is in us, yea, the
happiness in Heaven, which is God himself, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, three
persons, but one God.

Grant, O Lord, I most humbly beseech thee, that I may do the work of my
generation and lawful calling, prudently, wisely, justly and uprightly,
faithfully, obedientl^, circumspectly, cheerfully, willingly and perseveringly,
both before thee, O God, and before all men, giving every man his due, and
doing unto all men as I would they should do unto me, without respect of
persons, and let me always value and esteem these things below, as low things,
as temporal inferior good things, as common mercies, of the left hand of the
footstool, the nether Springs, even such, O Lord, as thou give unto all,
even unto the evil and wicked, as well as unto the good and righteous, as thou
make the Sun to shine, and the rain to fall, alike on all, it being no Token
either of thy Hatred, or of thy Love.

Let me therefore, O Lord, have power through grace, to use them as if I used
them not, and to live in this World, as if I were not of this World, making no
provision for the flesh to satisfy the lusts thereof, but that I may overcome
the World, by despising of it. And give me not the things of the World, O Lord,
I beseech thee, till thou have given me a heart, to use them according to thine
own heart, even as likes thee best; and grant, O Lord, that I may be always as
willing to leave them, as to receive them, and to give them back unto thee when
thou please, and in thine own way, as thine, O Lord, and not as mine,
blessing thee for the leaving them with me any time, but most especially for
the well using of them during that time, considering that their well using will
turn to my Eternal profit, and their abusing of them to my Eternal loss: Ah
Lord, let the eyes of my understanding be enlightened, and always open, to see
the many perils and dangers in possessing them, as well as their nothingness,
whilst I shall possess them, and that worldly bliss consists more in possessing
of little void of fears, than of much subject unto danger, and that it is much
the sweeter condition, to want the Worlds sweetness than to have them, if in
their want we find no want, and to esteem always that best which God gives,
because he having promised will make it work for the best. Come on me then what
will come, I doubt not, Lord, but I shall find it as I have hitherto found it,
to be for my good, and coming from a God of Love to me in love, and therefore,
O Lord, I will love both thee and it, and esteem every change the best change,
yea and a changing for the best, and if at any time my condition should not
please the flesh, sure I am it will always please the Spirit, if it please not
at any time the outward, it will always please the inward man, if it please not
the old man without, it will please the new man within; for, Lord, thou
know, if my condition should at any time displease me, and I could change
it, yet I would not, if by so doing I should displease thee; for thou know I
desire to please thee, not my self, the Spirit, not the flesh, the inward not
the outward Man, the New not the Old Man, for I would not have what I would,
but, O Lord, that only that thou will, be it what ever it will, deny me not, O
Lord, I most humbly, most earnestly and most unfeignedly beg, and beseech th^e,
in Jesus Christ, for thine own dear and holy names sake, deny me not this one
thing, whatever it cost me, but let my life, and my death, my place of abode,
and condition be such as may, O Lord, bring thee most glory, as may glorify
thee most, O God of all Power and Glory.

And that seeing I served thee not, O God, my Creator, in the days of my youth,
grant I beseech thee, that I may serve thee freely, cheerfully, willingly and
joyfully, all the rest of my days, unto the very last hour of my life, that I
may henceforth live the life of the righteous, and that my last end may be like
his. Ah Lord, let all the rest of my life to come be so spent, as it may
witness a continual sorrow for my life past, that having lived here in thy
fear, I may dye, O Lord, my God in thy favor, that having lived here the life
of Grace, I may ever hereafter live with thee, O my sweet Jesus, the life of
Glory, in thy Kingdom of Glory, with the Father and the Holy Spirit.

O Lord, that tryest the heart and searchest the Reins! thou know all my
thoughts, as well as ponderest all my actions, and therefore thou know how
much my heart rejoices, because that thou thus know it, and because thou
have made it such as it is; not that it is, O Lord, as it would or should be,
but because it willingly would be what it should be; and that it would do, and
be as wilingly any thing that it wills, as it wills it: So it be, O Lord God,
according to thy most holy, righteous, good and blessed will.

And now, O Lord God Almighty, Maker, Giver and Preserver of all things; I most
humbly beseech thee to hear me in Jesus Christ, for all Kingdoms, Nations and
People in general, and in particular, over the face of the whole earth; gather
O Lord in much mercy, gather thine Elect together from all the ^nds and corners
of the World; Jew and Gentile, Turk and Infidel, bond and free, male and
female, young and old, rich and poor: Ah Lord be thou pleased, in the greatness
of thy compassions, to pour out thy Holy Spirit upon all flesh, and to write
thy holy Laws of Grace in their hearts, and thy Statutes of fear in their
minds, by the finger of thine Holy Spirit, that every one may know who is the
Lord, and the power of his might, that all flesh may be converted and brought
home unto thee, that their souls may live and not dye eternally.

Remember, O Lord God, thine ancient Covenant with Abraham thy Friend, and pity
our elder sister the Jews; suffer them not, Ah Lord! suffer them not longer to
wander as Sheep without a Shepherd, but bring them home, Ah Lord, bring them
home to thy fold and to thy flock, and be thou the Shepherd and life of their
Souls; Open, O Lord, the eyes of their understanding, that they may know thee
the true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou have sent, that they may behold him
whom they have crucified by their sins, and may mourn as one mourns for his
only son, and be in bitterness as for a firstborn; have they stumbled that
they should fall? (God forbid) but rather through their fall Salvation is come
unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them unto jealousy; Now if the fall of them
be the riches of the World, and their diminishing the riches of the Gentiles:
how much more, O Lord, their fullness; and if the casting away of them be the
reconciling of the World, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from
the dead? for if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy; and if the
root be holy, so are the branches; because of unbelief they were broken off;
and if they abide not still in unbelief, have thou not promised, O God, to
graft them in again? and seeing thou were, O Lord, pleased to grast us into the
good Olive Tree, that were wild by nature; Ah when, Ah Lord, when will thou
graft in again these into their own Olive Tree, which be the natural branches?
for blindness is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come
in, and so all Israel shall be saved; as concerning the Gospel, they are
Enemies for our sakes; but as touching the Election, they are beloved for the
Fathers sake; for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. Bring in
then, O Lord, bring in then the fullness of us the Gentiles, that the number of
thine Elect may be accomplished, and that Man of Sin destroyed, with an utter,
total and eternal destruction.

Break, O Lord, the Power of the Turk, and all thy Churches adversaries;
destroy the pride of Rome, and root out Antichrist, O Lord, I beseech thee, out
of all our hearts; and permit not that any of thy children be led away by
Errors, Heresies, Sects, or any false worship; but let thy Word, O Lord, and
Gospel be preached and taught throughout the whole Earth, in purity and
sincerity, as thy Word, and with the powerful assistance of thine own Holy
Spirit; Ah Lord, cause it to work efficaciously on the hearts of all hearers,
that they may hear it with fear and trembling, even as thine own Word, and by
it be convinced of sin, of righteousness, and of Judgment: and to this end, O
Lord God, be thou pleased to give a double portion of thy Holy Spirit unto all
the Ministers thereof, that they may preach it in the power of the Holy Ghost,
not fearing the face of Men being confidently assured, that their work and
labor shall not be in vain in the Lord.

Ah Lord, in much mercy propagate thy Gospel where it is planted, and be thou
pleased to plant it where it is not; and send forth faithful Laborers into
thy Vineyard and Harvest; for thou know, O Lord God, that the Harvest is
great, but the Laborers are few. Ah Lord, suffer not, I most humbly beseech
thee in Jesus Christ, that the wild Boar of the Wood pluck up the Roots, nor
the little Foxes to cut off the branches; but blast, O Lord, all the designs
and machinations, that are any where hatching against thy Church and People,
and bring them to naught, and cause their Enemies, which are thy Enemies, to
fall into the Pits and Snares which they have laid for them: do good, O Lord,
to thy Sion, and build up the Walls of thy Jerusalem; do thine own work in
thine own good, due, and appointed time, and let thine own arm, O Lord, bring
us Salvation.

In a more particular and most special manner, O Lord, I humbly beseech thee in
Jesus Christ, be mindful, and have mercy upon the Land of my Nativity; Pardon,
O Lord, the Nation and particular sins thereof past, present, and to come, of
Magistrates, Ministers and People; our sins, O Lord, of blood, our sins of
unthankfulness, ingratitude and rebellion against thee our God; our sins of
covetousness, which is Idolatry; our sins of Pride and Hypocrisy; of selflove,
and hatred of our brethren; our sins of gluttony and drunkenness; of
uncleanness, of malice, wrath and revenge; our sins of profanation, and
persecution; our sins of blasphemy and toleration, against thy self, O God, and
Christ; against thy holy Law and Gospel; O God, that art the Judge of Heaven
and of Earth, pardon, O Lord, pardon, I humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ,
England's sins, for they are great, and enter into a Covenant with them, and be
thou their God, and make them thy people, that they may serve thee for ever,
and for ever; and thou may henceforth delight in them, to live amongst them,
and never more to be wroth with them. Settle, O Lord, I beseech thee, a
faithful Magistracy over us; Judges as at the first, and Counselors as in
the beginning, that Justice may run down our streets as a mighty River, and
righteousness as a great stream; that the cause of the Poor, the Widow, and the
Orphan may be heard, and Justice done without respect of Persons; that there be
no cries in our Land, nor no complaining in our streets; Give, O Lord, boldness,
zeal, courage and faithfulness unto all the Ministers thereof, that they may
not seek the praise of Men, but the praise, honor and glory of thee our God,
and that they may be ready and willing to lay down their lives for the truth,
and be faithful unto the death, choosing rather, much rather, affliction and
persecution for thy sake and the Gospels, than to dwell in the Tabernacles of
the wicked, and to serve the lusts of Men. And to this end, O Lord God, give
them I humbly pray thee a double Portion of thy holy Spirit, which thou gave
unto thy faithful Servant Elias, to lead, guide, govern, and direct them, in
the ways of all truth and righteousness, that they may not at all fear him,
which can only kill the body, but him (which is thy self) O Lord, who having
killed the body, can cast the Soul into Hell; O Lord, open their eyes that
they may see thee and thy strength and power on their side, and therefore may
not fear the power nor the policy of their Enemies, how great soever it be to
the eyes of Men, for they are but men, mere Men, whose breath is in their
Nostrils, a little creeping clay, speaking earth, Worms of six foot long, whose
hearts thou turnest as the rivers of Waters, and changest them as thou
please, and that nothing is, or can be done by them, but what thou please,
and suffer to be done. Cause them, and all thy people to know, that having
thee on their side, and for them, they need not fear who be against them, for
none ever fought against thy power and prospered; and that though thou do
usually use means, yet thou can, O God, we know, (if thou so please) do thy
work without means, yea and against means, and that there is no means so
contemptible but thou can, O God, our God, make effectual, even to the
pulling down of strong holds, as thou did the Walls of Jericho, at the noise
of Rams Horns; it is as easy with thee to do what thou willest, as to will it,
all things are as easy as possible; let us not then, O God, fear any power, no
nor all powers, having thee the Lord for our God, before whom all the Nations
of the earth, are as the drop of a bucket, and as the dust of the balance.
Thou hold, O God, the Ocean in the hollow of thine hand, and the earth is
upheld, and stands fast by the power of thy might; give us then, O Lord God,
such fear as may cause us to love thee, and such love as may cast out and
destroy all fear, for thou only, who art God only, art to be feared only.

Ah Lord, look down graciously, and in mercy, upon poor afflicted Scotland and
Ireland, stir up thy self, and come and save them, even now, now, when there is
no help for them nigh at hand; O Lord, be thou their help, and help thou them,
and give them grace to put their trust in thee, that thou may be their help
and deliverer: of three Nations make us, O Lord, one people, that we may be
knit together with the bonds of love and unity, serving thee, O Lord, with a
perfect heart in holiness and righteousness, all the days of our lives. And
though, O Lord, thou have delivered them into our hands, and given us power
over them; Ah Lord, suffer us not to do other unto them, than we would they
should do unto us, and that we lay not on them too heavy burdens to bear.

Bless, O Lord, I beseech thee, all my kindred and acquaintance in the flesh.
Ah Lord, I know that thou know all their soul and body cases; Ah be thou
pleased in Jesus Christ, to come into their help, and give them deliverance:
make, O Lord, make their hearts below their conditions, and then make their
conditions what thou will, lay no more, O Lord, on them, than thou shall be
pleased to enable them to bear, and then lay on them what thou will; Ah Lord,
cause every thing to work together for their good, let them always see and
acknowledge, that thou punishest them far less than their iniquities deserve,
and that all afflictions whatsoever come from thee, but the procuring cause is
in themselves: make them, O Lord, as willing to wear the Cross here, as the
Crown hereafter, to suffer for thee here, as to reign with thee hereafter. And
though, O Lord, they be poor in the world, let them be rich in grace; though
they be contemptible in the world, let them be honorable in thy sight; be
thou, O Lord, their Portion, and make them thine inheritance: and grant, O
Lord, I beseech thee, that their last days may be their best days, and their
last thoughts their best thoughts, that they may be thy faithful, humble and
obedient Servants, unto their lives end; living the lives of the Righteous,
that they may be like them both in death, and after death. Be thou with them, O
Lord, in all places, and at all times, that they may always sit under the
shadow of thy wings, and that the fruit of thy word may be pleasant unto the
taste of their souls; let them through grace delight to walk in the ways of thy
Statutes, and let thy Commandments be their daily talk; suffer them not, O
Lord, to go astray from thee, either after the pleasures or profits of the
world, but enable them all through grace to walk uprightly and circumspectly
before thee unto their lives end.

Be mindful and merciful, O Lord, unto all the Sons and Daughters of
affliction wheresoever dispersed, wheresoever scattered on the face of the
whole earth; bring home, O Lord, all that are banished, deliver all Captives,
and set free all Prisoners, that every one may sit under his Vine, and rejoice
under his Fig Tree, eating in peace the fruits of their labors; visit, O Lord,
the sick, comfort the comfortless, bind up the broken heart, heal the wounded
heart, give life to the dead heart give the grace of faith unto the doubting
heart, and of hope unto the despairing heart, speak peace, O Lord, unto the
disconsolated and afflicted heart, give understanding, memory, sense and reason
unto the distracted heart, and those amongst them, whom thou do intend, O
Lord, and have appointed to take unto thy self, let them see thine arms of
love, in mercy, open and ready to receive them; let them hear, O Lord, thy
sweet and comfortable voice, speaking peace unto their Souls, and saying, Sons
and Daughters, be of good cheer, your sins are forgiven you; wash them, O Lord,
with thy most dear, and most precious blood, and sanctify them with thy holy
spirit of grace, that they may appear spotless and unblameable before thee,
whiter than Snow, purer than Wool, finer than Gold, and brighter than the Sun,
and make them, O Lord, more than Conquerours: and those, O Lord, whom thou do
intend to restore unto their former health and strength, give them grace to
lead new lives and to become new Creatures, that others seeing their good
works, may glorify thee, O God, our Heavenly Father, in Jesus Christ.

Ah Lord God, look with much mercy I humbly beseech thee, upon all those every
where, that suffer for the Peace of a good Conscience, because they will not
sin against thy truth; keep them, O Lord, as the Apple of thine eye, that
nothing come nigh to hurt them, nor to affright them; let them depend on thy
mercies, fear thy judgments, and lay hold on thy gracious promises, give them,
O Lord, courage and strength to fight that good fight, and to run that good
race that thou have set before them, that they may be always-willing and ready
to give up their lives unto the death, and then from thee, O Lord, they may
receive the Crown of Eternal life.

And those, O Lord, that suffer for an evil Conscience, because they have
sinned against thy truth, let them not always mourn as men and women without
hope, but pour down, O Lord, in much love and mercy pour down thy holy and
blessed spirit the Comforter, into their hearts, that may speak peace unto
their Souls; even that peace that passes all understanding; let not the
Mountains of their sins, O Lord, nor the Rocks of unbelief hinder thy mercies
from coming down out of Heaven into their Hearts, nor their Prayers from
ascending up unto thee by faith; but cause them, O Lord, to know, that thou art
a God, pardoning all Iniquities, Transgressions, and sins; yea, all Blasphemies
wherewith they have blasphemed: Ah Lord, show them the light of thy gracious
and glorious Countenance, and lead them in the way everlasting, that they may
never more swerve nor go astray from thy Divine and Holy Commandments.

Bless, O Lord, all that are traveling by Sea, or by Land, and bring them to
their Ports and Places in safety, defend them from all Pirates and Robbers that
seek to do them hurt or wrong, and from all other perils and dangers, pitch thy
tents, O Lord, round about them, and keep them even as thou keep thine own.

And lastly, O Lord, I most humbly and heartily beg and beseech thee in Jesus
Christ, to pardon and forgive all mine Enemies, all the world over; love them,
O Lord, that hate me, bless them that curse me, do good to them that seek to do
me evil, forget and forgive all that they have done or would have done against
me, and change their hearts from evil unto good, that they may no longer walk
after the deceitfulness of their own evil Hearts, but may do all things for the
time to come in truth and sincerity, according to thine own heart, O Lord God,
that thou may own them for thy own, and give them hearts, O Lord, to forgive
me whom I have wronged, whether it have been in thought, word or deed, either
unto high or low, rich or poor, young or old, and grant, O Lord, that I may
fear and do so no more, but as thou have been unto me a sin-pardoning God, so I
beseech thee be unto me a sin-preventing God, that I may not as the Dog, return
to his Vomit, nor as the Sow to her wallowing in the mire again, but that I may
always henceforth set thee, O Lord, before mine eyes, and be attent unto the
motions of thy holy spirit, and never to forget thy exceeding bountiful and
merciful dealings toward me, and that love in Jesus Christ, wherewith thou
have loved me, and that I may remember that it is impossible for those who were
once enlightened, and have tasted of the Heavenly gift, and were made partakers
of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God, and the Powers of the
World to come, if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto Repentance,
seeing they Crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to open
shame; for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the
truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sin, but a certain fearful
looking for of Judgment, and fiery indignation, which shall devour the
adversaries; for having, Lord, by thy grace and mercy escaped the pollutions of
the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, grant
that I may not again be entangled therein, and overcome, and so my latter end
prove worse, if worse it can be, than was my beginning; Ah Lord God (should
such be my case) which God forbid, it would be much better for me that I had
never known the way of Righteousness, than after the knowledge of it, to turn
from thy holy Commandments delivered unto me.

Ah Lord God, my Lord, and my God, in Jesus Christ, thou know my weakness,
frailty and impotency, that I cannot of my self, as of my self, think a good
thought, that I am prone to all evil, and averse to all good, to will indeed is
many times present, but how to perform I know not; there is still, O Lord God,
a law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and leading me Captive
into the law of sin; Ah Lord, when, when, O Lord, when, shall that time come,
and that blessed, most blessed, and glorious day dawn and appear in my heart,
that the root and branch of sin be totally rooted up, and utterly destroyed,
and grace confirmed, and grow up more and more, until I come to be a perfect
man in Christ Jesus, that I may still more and more hate the evil which I do,
and love the good which I do not and cannot do: that it may be no longer I that
sin, but sin that dwells in me, and that by the assistance of thy grace and
holy Spirit, I may walk well pleasing before thee, doing thy work and thy will
here on earth, as it is done in Heaven, living the life of grace here, and of
glory hereafter, the life of the Righteous, that I may dye their death; Ah
Lord, give thy self to me, that I may give my self to thee, live in me, that I
may live to thee, own me for thine own, that I may own thee for mine all,
give me, Ah give me, O Lord, much grace, that I may give thee much glory, daily
grace, that I may give thee daily glory, continually grace, that I may give
thee continually glory, that I may be all thine, O Lord, only thine, always
thine, and ever thine, and all this I most humbly and unfeignedly beg of thee,
and whatever else thou know to be needful or expedient for me, both for my
soul and body, for the name, and for the worthiness of Jesus Christ, thy Son
and my Savior, to whom, with thy Glorious Majesty, and Holy Spirit of Grace,
do I render and give with my whole heart, as all due is, and unto none else,
Honor, Glory, Power, Might, Majesty, Dominion and Thanksgiving, now,
henceforth, and for evermore, Amen, Amen.

34. If the love of Creatures be so lovely unto us, and we esteem and love them
most for their love; and this their love does many times sweetly satisfy and
ravish our senses: But how then are our hearts set on fire with Love, when we
have within us, the fiery hot burning Love of a Loving God; yea, of a God of
Love, whose Love is so lovely, as it knits our hearts in Love unto him, and our
greatest Love unto him is, from his own Love, because he has so loved us, as
to give us hearts to love him, even according to his own heart.

35. If our Joy be, according to the measure of Love which we enjoy from the
Creature whom we most love; Ah how great, yea, incomprehensibly great shall our
joy be, when we shall know and feel, that we are beloved above measure by the
Creator, who makes the Creature thus lovely, and gives him Love thus to love
him.

36. If our Love many times be so great unto the Creature for the Creature,
that we do not, and it seems to us that we cannot love him so much as we would,
and do desire to do, and we crave and desire chiefly his Love, that we may yet
love him more, and this from and because we love him so much, and for that our
senses can be only satisfied with his Love, and by loving of him; for we love
him most for his Love, and his Love does cause us to love him more, whom we
love so much, yea whom we love most.

37. But Ah how great then, yea how wonderfully great is the love, O Lord, of
thy Children and Servants unto thee, when they know that they are beloved by
thee, whom they most love, and must love most (for thy Love) thy Love being
most worth, worth most, and therefore do they despise all Love and things
lovely in the Creature, to purchase thy Love, O God, who art the Creator of all
Love, and things lovely; they love thy Love most, O God, because they know and
feel that thy Love only, causes them to love thee more, whom notwithstanding
they do already love most, and for that nothing but thy Love, can satisfy them
with sufficient love, to love thee sufficiently; for to love thee is to live,
and they could not live if it were not for thy Love, and therefore are they
ready and willing always to dye for thy Love, and to witness and show forth
their love, with which they love thee.

38. If then the love of the Creature be so great for the Creator, that it is
more, above and beyond any love in the Creature, for the Creature, yea it is so
great, as it cannot be uttered, it being and proceeding from the Creator's own
Love, that the Creature has this love, and that he loves thus his Creator.

36. But Ah then, how incomprehensible and great is the love of the Creator,
for, and unto us his Creatures? in that he gives us so much of his love, (as
to love him) and such condescension is in him, as he delights to be beloved
by them, who out of his love do so much hate him, and love only what he hates;
alas, alas, what can we, poor we, say of him, whom we know not, but by himself,
and from himself, and love not, but from his love; Let us then, Ah let us then
admire, and in humility ever adore this his love, with which he has so loved
us, as to make us like himself, in love, which is to be all love, loving others
as our selves; for even as his love only causes him to love us, so likewise
does this his love in us, cause us thus to love him, and thus to love one
another with the same loving love, and all that we may be all one and the same,
in love, in him, to him, and for him, who is the love of our love, the cause of
our loves love, the subject of our love, the object of our love, which we only
desire to love, and the joy of this our joyous love, and the aim of our end,
and the end of our aim, is, to live and love unto the end, in this loving love;
that is that our love may never know end, as his never knew no beginning, nor
never shall know end, and this is, and such is the great love of our God, yea
the incomprehensible love with which he loves us, being such, and so great, as
we cannot comprehend its greatness; it cannot enter into us, therefore we shall
enter into it, neither can we sufficiently express ours for him, which flows
only from his, from himself, who is only and alone in himself, perfect love,
and he alone can only create and give perfect love, to love perfectly; none but
himself, from himself, of himself, can then thus love perfectly, or give
perfect love, to love perfectly thus.

40. It is then thy love in me, O Lord my God, that causes me to love thee.

41. Inflame then my cold, benumbed, icy, frozen heart, with the fiery hot
burning flames of this thy burning hot love, O my God, that my heart may
continually as Moses's bush, and the Seraphims, still flamingly burn, but never
consume; for it is by this, and from this divine fire that comes from thy holy
Altar, O Lord, that my soul lives, and out of it it cannot.

42.
Let me then, O Lord, ever burn,
That I may ever live; for why?
Ah if I should not still burn thus;
I am sure I should eft soon dye.
43. Ah Lord my God, and my Father in Jesus Christ, I desire to praise thee
ever, for that thou have not only forgiven me all, but given me all, thou have
not only given me a pardon for all my Iniquities and Transgressions, and
forgiven all my sins, but have also forgotten that ever I sinned.

44. Thou have not only given me such a pardon, as never to remember my sins
any more, but with the pardon thou have, O Lord, given me thy love, and thy
self, so as I shall ever live in thy self, to love thy self ever, and to offend
thee never.

45. Thy love, O my God, and heavenly Father, is far greater unto me, than
David's was for his beloved Son Absalom, though he loved him better than his
life, and willingly would have died for him; yet when he forgave him his
murder, he would not have him to see his face in Jerusalem. But thy pardon, O
King of Kings, is with such abundance of love, that thou have been pleased, in
love to come down thy self from thy Throne, and thy dwelling place in thy
heavenly Jerusalem, unto me, on this earthly Geshur, to show me thy most
amiable, most glorious and most blessed face, and to cause the light of thy
Countenance to shine upon me, that I might not be afflicted, because thou
know right well, that it were much better for me that thou should take my
life from me, than hide thy face from me; for what were or would be my life
unto me, if I did not (O my Father) see thy face in Jesus Christ; yea thou
know that my life is nothing unto me, if I see not always thy face, for thy
presence is my Heaven on Earth, and thy absence my Hell.

46. Ah what love is this, O my God! wherewith thou have and do love me, to
pardon such a rebellious murderer as I am; not for slaying an incestuous Amnon,
but an innocent Jesus, the Son of thy love, thine eldest only Son, in whom thy
Soul delighted only.

47. Thy Love, O God, my God, is such, that thou have not banished me, but
brought me back, and though I did fly from thee, yet thou thy self did in
love run after me, and broughtest me back, yea such is thy love, that thou have
not unthroned me, but inthroned me, and made me not only an heir, but coheir
with thy Natural only Son and my Savior, not only of a Crown and Kingdom,
honorable and glorious, but of a Kingdom and Crown of honor and glory, and
not for a mortal life of time, but for an immortal life, out of time, for ever
and for ever.

48. Ah Lord God, how did thou love me when thou did deliver me, take me
off, and free me, from my own love, from loving my self with self-love, that
is, loving my self more than thee, and were p^eased in love, and out of the
abundance of thy love, which is incomprehensible, and unconceivable, to cause
me to choose thy, love, to prize thy love, to desire thy love, and to rejoice
in thy love, esteeming nothing else lovely, or desirable.

49. They that love as they ought to love, that is True love in loving God, or
loving God truly.
rightly, and truly love God, first, and most, he is their ultimate end, the
end of all their aim, and the aim of all their end, is to love him; they love
him for all that is in him, for that they know that he is all holy, all just,
and all good, and they love him chiefly, that is, most of all, because he is
God, that is, because he is what he is, even such a God, as he is; they adore
his greatness, as his goodness, and fear his goodness, as his greatness; they
prize his mercy at the highest value, and value his Justice at the highest
price; they admire the knowledge of his Wisdom, and as much the Wisdom of his
knowledge; they stand amazed at his might, and are confounded at his power;
alike they wonder at his highly lowness, and lowly highness; that God would be
made man, and that a man should be still God; they are ashamed for that he
would be like them, and they abhor themselves, that they are (notwithstanding)
so unlike him, they therefore long for holiness, knowing that it is the
greatest and chiefest happiness, it making them like unto him, holy as he is
holy, pure as he is pure, and perfect as he is perfect, though not so
perfectly, or purely holy.

50. All such as love God thus, love themselves (for True love in loving ones
self or loving ones elf truly.
him) that is, would himself, for himself, his love to love him, his fear to
fear him, his honor to honor him, his knowledge to know him, his wisdom to
please him, his goodness to be good, his justice to be just, his holiness to be
holy, his greatness greatly to exalt his power, and his might to be mighty in
power for him, his mercy to be merciful, as he is merciful, for being by him
Created for himself, unto good works, they would that all their works were
good, and all for him, to live to him, in him, and for him, for ever and for
ever: thus if they love themselves, it is for him, it is to be his and to do his
will on earth (whilst on earth) as they shall in Heaven, when in Heaven.

51. And all such, are all True love inloving ones Neighbor, or loving ones
Neighbor truly.
full of true love for all their Neighbors; and their Neighbors are all Men,
far and near, Jew and Gentile, bond and free, all have their love, they love
all, their condition makes no condition with them, they desire, and seek, and
pray for their happiness, as for their own, they mourn for them many times,
when they do not mourn for themselves, yea they weep much and often in secret,
for their secret as well as for their open sins, they are ashamed on their
behalf, because they choose not the way of life but still walk, walk on still
in the ways of death, they have no Enemies, but all are their friends, their
dear and beloved, yea dearly beloved friends, such as hate them, they love;
such as curse them, they bless; such as speak evil of them, they pray for, and
that God would lay none of their sins to their charge, they account happiness
to them, even as their own happiness, and rejoice with them when they do
rejoice, yea, they would many times willingly and cheerfully part with their
joys, their best joys, even their spiritual joys, for their sakes, that they
might enjoy them, they would be content, to be as it were in darkness, sorrow
and sadness, that they might be in the light, see the light, and rejoice in the
light of God's Countenance, they would that they did enjoy these joys here, to
be brought home by any means, to enjoy them for ever hereafter, for those that
love God whom they never saw, must do, and can do no other, than love their
brethren whom they see daily; and those likewise whom they never saw, because
they are also their brethren.

52. Such as love not God rightly (which is to love him False love to God, or
loving God falsely.
as God) love him for the Loaves, not for his love, for themselves, not for
himself, for themselves alone, or chiefly, and not chiefly, which is alone for
himself, they love him because they have need of him, his love is lovely, not
because it is in him, or because it is his love, and for that it makes him thus
lovely, as to be only lovely and desirable, but they love his love, because it
is in him for them, they love him for Heaven, much more than Heaven for him,
they do not love him because he has so loved them, as to make them lovely, and
forgiving them of his own love, to love him in and with true love, it is not
love that they truly love, or value, as it is love, but as it is profitable, a
love bringing profit, it frees from pain, and gives ease, it keeps from poverty
and makes rich, because it delivers from dishonor and disgrace, and graceth
them, and brings them much honor, because it lifts them up above others, and
for that others are set below them, they are the head, and others are but the
feet, and because they have power over them, and they obey their power, going
where ever they bid them, coming when ever they call them, and do what ever,
and all that they command them; if God continue to give them thus his gifts,
and all that their hearts desire, they will prize his love, and desire his
love, and choose his love, and delight in his love, and love his love, yea, and
serve him for his love; but it is with an eye-service, having an eye to this
recompense of reward in the flesh, and for the sake of the flesh; they love not
God as he is God, and because he is God, all good and only good, but because he
is a God tha^ does them this good, which he so much loves, likes, prizeth,
chooses, and prays for, were he not thus good unto him, he would not think
him good, nor believe him to be good, thus are they fleshly, carnal, loving the
things of the flesh, the things they see and enjoy, and not the things which
they see not, nor cannot see, which they enjoy not, nor cannot be here enjoyed,
but should hope for; it is not a Heaven in Heaven, nor a Heaven coming down from
Heaven, but a Heaven on earth, an earthly Heaven, yea, a Heaven of earth, that
they desire, choose and pray for, and would that it were ever, yea, ever and
for ever their Heaven, thus it is not God that they love, because he is God, but
it is themselves, themselves they love as God, chiefly, most of all, beyond all
things, and above all things, and therefore they love not God at all, because
they love him not as God, who is the supreme, chief Sovereign superior, and
only good, happiness, felicity, peace, rest, riches, honor, pleasure, joy and
blessedness.

53. This is false Love (though it be for our selves) False love to ones self,
or loving ones self falsely.
when we love our Selves only, that is chiefly for our selves, for our own
sakes, such desire Heavens joys to enjoy them, because they are the greatest
joys, it is not Heaven for God, but God for Heaven, that they would, and that
they mind, they love the wages, but not the work, the Crown, but not the Cross,
to reign with Christ, and as Christ does, but not to suffer with Christ, and as
Christ did, to wear his Crown of Glory, but not his Crown of Thorns, to live as
he does, but not as he did, to be his Servant in Heaven, but not his Disciple
on Earth, to have the recompense of Reward there, as a good and faithful
Servant, but not to serve him here, as a Son or a Servant, they would willingly
have their own will done, both on Earth and in Heaven, but not his on Earth, no
not for Heaven; they would believe in him, but not suffer for him, they would
live with him there, but not dye with him here, they fly many times from sin,
because of the pain, woe, grief and torment it will bring, they fly from the
punishment, not from the sin, they hate not sin, as it is sin, and because it
is Sin, for many times they love the sin, which they commit not, which they
dare not commit; and so they many times do good, but not because it is good,
and for that it is the Command of God, their delight is not to him, nor his
ways, nor to the keeping of his Commandments, but their delight is ^o delight
themselves, the end of all their aim, and the aim of all their end is to please
themselves; and therefore if at any time they do good, it is to do good to
themselves, it is not for God's sake, nor for goodness sake, but for their own
sakes, for many times they do what they would not do, and seem to love what
they do not love, and to hate what they do not hate, they prefer the flesh, to
please the flesh, and to enjoy fleshly pleasures, before the pleasing of God,
and the enjoying of God, and spiritual pleasures, they prefer Communion with
the Creature, before Communion with the Creator, and their own low base ends,
before his high, holy, great and glorious ends, how dully, droopingly, faintly,
feebly, coldly and sluggishly do they go about Gods work, and service, any
thing that concerns his honor and glory, what icy, frozen, benumbed, dead
hearts have they thereunto, though in the doing of all this, it is to do for
themselves, to work for themselves, and to serve themselves, but how, Ah how
jollily, cheerfully, lively, nimbly, quickly, ardently and hotly do they go
about the things that no whit at all concerns God, but themselves, how stoutly,
strongly and vigorously, do they wrestle for the world and the things of the
world, and to have a blessing of increase on their works, and labor for the
flesh, but how? ah how faintly, cowardly and feebly do they wrestle with God in
duties, in prayer, meditation, hearing and reading the word of God, as if they
would not that blessing, or at least cared not for it, thus God's work, and
Soul work is to them of little concernment, and when they do mind the Soul and
Heaven, it is because of its happiness, they then seek God for Heavens sake,
but never Heaven* for God's sake, and even then when the Lord sends a fair
wind, with the breath and spirit of his grace into their hearts, to hasten them
forward, to their place of rest, and to make them to sail over the floods and
tempests of tentations, and waves of opposition, yet then, Ah then, so selfish,
fond, stupid and ignorant are they, as they hoyse up all the Sayls they can, to
go against this sweet, new, fresh gale; they row and tug and toil to go back
from their Port, from their Haven and Harbor, which is so near them, desiring
not to come so soon to their journeys end, they desire not so soon to end their
journeying, travel, and pains in the flesh, they prefer this travel and toil,
and care, before that peace and rest, and ease and joy, and though this all,
all this, be but vanity, and brings nothing but vexation of Spirit, yet so
contrary, are they to God and his ways, that they will none of them, as long as
they can these, they gladly and willingly will put off that day, for this, nay
though God do at times show some of them Heaven, as he did Paul, and they
behold things utterable, and, with Peter, see the glory of the Lord, which is
unconcivable; yet these foresights, and fore-tasts, being taken from them, or
they from it: Ah how soon do they forget that ever they saw any such thing, how
soon, how gladly, willingly, and cheerfully, do they return to Egypt, the place
of their Captivity, and joyfully and heartily feed on the Garlic and Onions,
yea on the husks that Swines feed on, so much love they have to themselves, as
they forget God, and that they were Created for him, and unto good works to
please and serve him, such then as thus love, or love thus, are self-lovers
only, or chiefly, and therefore not right or true lovers, because they love not
God rightly, therefore not truly, for he is to be beloved first of all, most of
all, beyond and above all, he being our only, chief, supreme, Sovereign,
superior, and best good, all good being in him, and flows only from him he
containing all, and being contained by none.

54. But as for me, O Lord, as for me, I know, O Lord, I know, that there is
none in Heaven but thee, nor in all the earth in comparison of thee, a
Doorkeeper, O Lord, a Doorkeeper in thy House, do I much prefer, choose and
embrace, rather than to dwell in Tents or Tabernacles with the wicked, with
those that know thee not, and that fear thee not, I much rather, Ah Lord thou
know, that I had much rather be afflicted, and choose and prefer banishment,
poverty, contempt, disgrace, imprisonment and death for thy sake, and the
Gospels, as thy Servant, rather, yea much rather than to enjoy all these
pleasures in the flesh, these fleshly pleasures, with the wicked: any life, O
Lord, and any death, yea that life, and that death, in that place and
condition, as may bring thee most glory, do I most humbly and unfeignedly beg,
in Jesus Christ, and for his sake; Ah Lord God, I have me unto thee, I desire
to fly into thee, and to be found ever in thee, yea though thou should make
all my life, as Paul's and Peter's were, when they saw and enjoyed in part,
those blessed joys prepared and laid up for the blessed, yea though I could
always see Heaven open, as Stephen, and thou, O Lord, my Jesus, and my Christ,
standing at the right hand of God, should not, would not my heart, heartily say
with Simeon, Lord now let thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen
thy great Salvation; would it not cry out, none but Christ, none but Christ,
and come, Lord Jesus; Ah come quickly, and take me to thee, to be ever with
thee; for though to me to live were Christ, yet to dye would be great gain.

55. Such and all such love falsely, as love their Neighbors False love to our
Neighbor, or loving our Neighbor falsely.
for themselves only, for the good they do them, and for the benefit and
advantage alone, which they receive from them, were it not for this good, they
would not care for them, nor think of them, nor pray for them, nor wish or
desire any blessing on them, if they do at any time do them any good, it is for
the good that thereby they hope will accrue to themselves, either of praise or
profit, otherways they would rather, yea much rather, their loss than their
gain, their dishonor than their honor; and they would delight more, much
more, to hear an evil than a good report of them, and were it not that they
want them, or may want them, that they stand them in stead, they would rather,
yea much rather dis-serve them, than serve them, hurt them than do them good;
and though with their mouths they bless them, yet in their hearts they curse
them, envying the very happiness, that they pray for (on their behalf) they
love them for their gifts, not their gifts for them; yea they love their gifts,
but not the givers of the gifts; they love their gifts, not because it comes
from their love, but because they are lovely, that is, because they stand them
in stead, they have need of them, they should be in want, if they did want
them, if they had them not, they do not praise God on their behalf, and pray
for a double blessing on them, for this their blessing of them; if they wish or
desire an increase of their substance; and a blessing on their labors, it is
because they hope they will increase in doing them good, in giving to them of
their substance, a blessing of their labors, a part and portion of their
profits; and if they do not do so, such will curse and not bless, and would if
they could, take from them all that they have, or seem to have; for their love
is self-love, love only to themselves, for themselves, therefore false love,
loving falsely.

56. I had much rather have no portion in the World, than have the World for my
portion.

57. For I am sure the World never did, nor never will make any rich, and as
sure that it has, and will make many, Ah too too many poor.

58. For many that have had, and yet shall have, great Portions of this Worlds
good, have, nor shall have none of the good of Heaven for their Portion: it is
hard for a rich man here to be rich there.

59. And many that have no Portion in this World, of this World, have God, and
shall have God for their sure and everlasting Portion in the World to come.

60. Ah happy, yea thrice happy man, that has such a Portion there, though he
have none here, what ever be his condition, he is in a blessed condition, for
he shall be ever blessed, blessed for ever and ever.

61. But Ah miserable man, who art only miserable, that has no Portion there,
what ever Portion he has here, yea though he abound in Corn and Wine and Oil,
and all this Worlds good and glory.

62. Give me, Ah Lord, give me any Portion in Heaven, though but to be a
doorkeeper; if I may but see thy face, and hear thy Voice, I care not, though
it be with the loss of all Portions here, both of riches, honors and pleasures.

63. If thou give me here, O Lord, but food and raiment, how mean soever it
be, I will be content therewith, and heartily thank thee, and if thou give me
none, I will thank thee for the time past, and believe I shall want none for
the time to come, and that shall content me.

64. Ah if the want of the World be so sweet when in its want we find no want,
how sweet then, yea how much sweeter is Heavens fullness? where is all fullness
of all things, and therefore no want at all of any thing.

65. Ah how much better is it, and how much greater gain, to lose this Worlds
all, and gain Heaven, then to gain this Worlds all, and lose our part of
Heaven, which is Heavens all, yea all Heaven.

66. The Worlds loss with Heavens gain, I shall not account any loss, but all
gain, yea the greatest gain I can get; but Heavens loss, with all this Worlds
gain, I shall not account any gain, but a great loss, yea the greatest that I
could, or can sustain.

67. He that loses Heaven loses all, but he that gets only this Worlds all,
gets nothing, even nothing at all.

68. I will and always will account all losses gain (to win Christ) and all
gain losses if I lose Christ.

69. Let Christ then be my gain, and I care not what losses I sustain.

70. For this Worlds felicity is certain but a moment, but the felicity or
infelicity of the World to come, is not uncertain any moment, but certainly
good or bad from the first to the last moment, which last moment will be always
alike, as far off, as it was the very first moment, being ever, ever.

71. Give me then, Ah Lord God, that endless good, felicity and happiness,
which is like thy self, shall never change but endure for ever, and not that
which is like my self, subject every moment to all change.

72. Ah Lord, thou know I would willingly, most willingly change thus, my
life for death, and then my death for life.

73. That is my life of Sin, for a death to sin, to put all sin to death, and
then death, for eternal life with Christ, who is my life.

74. Thou know, O Lord also that I would willingly dye to live, and live to
dye.

75. That is to dye to sin, and live to grace, live in all grace and dye to all
sin, that to me to live may be Christ, but to dye gain, yea that my life may be
hid with Christ in God.

76. I would willingly, O Lord, have thee mine all, that I may give thee mine
all, and reserve from thee nothing at all.

77. All Lord, All, I most willingly and unfeignedly give thee, Ah that thou
would receive all, and refuse nothing at all.

78. For all, Lord, that is mine is thine, that is, all that is good; for the
bad I renounce, and give back also to him that gave it.

79. All the World is nothing, being all perishable, therefore can be to
nothing compared, but to nothing.

80. Ah what a pity is it, that any man should be so sickle, as to love such
fickle things, as are these below, which to day are, and to morrow are not.

81. For is any thing lesser, worser or lighter than vanity; if any thing be,
or can be, or if this Worlds things be any thing, it is it, which is so much
vanity, and so full of vanity, and therefore the more, the lesser worth, the
worser, and the lighter, be all nothing, but all vanity.

82. The more there is of a bad thing, the worser, and the lesser too, is the
thing, (that is to goodness.)

83. Well therefore may it be said of the best of this Worlds, of this Worlds
best, as the old Woman said unto her daughter, arise, Daughter Vanity, and come
to thy daughter Vanity, for thy daughter Vanity has another daughter of Vanity.

84. Ah fruitful, but cursed fruitful Womb, that brings forth so much cursed
fruit, full of Vanity.

85. How much better were it, that thou were barren, than thus to bear.

86. Vanity is in the getting, Vanity is in the keeping, Vanity is in the
spending, and there is Vanity for the most part, in giving of this Worlds
Vanity; So that all in this World, even all this World, is Vanity, yea all
Vanity and Vexation of Spirit.

87. Ah vain foolish man that labourest so hard, that hazardest so much, for
that which at the best is so vain, being so full of Vanity, and, which is
worse, vexation of spirit.

88. If then its best be so bad, what is its worst? if its all be worth nothing
at all, why will thou then be such a fool? as to labor for that which is not,
and to spend thy time, thy dear, most dear, and most precious time, for that
which will not, for that which cannot profit thee.

89. Let then, Ah let then the morrow care for it self, care thou, O man, Oh
careless man for thy self, that is, for thy better self, which will make thee
ever happy, or else thy carelessness, ever miserable, miserable for ever.

90. Be not, Ah be not so careless, to put off thy care till to morrow, seeing
there is a change every moment; but fear still, Ah fear thou still, that change
which a day may bring forth.

91. Let the World take its own, make sure what is thine own, (if thou will so
have it) which is Christ Jesus, and all his merits, and say truly and boldly, I
will have none but Christ; I care for none but Christ, nor to know nothing but
Christ and him crucified; be then contented if thou have him, and be not
contented what ever thou have, if thou have him not.

92. For all other things give discontent. and bring with them Vexation of
Spirit; but he gives alone all true contentment, and brings with him the peace
of the Spirit.

93. If then our peace in believing bring so great joy, that it passes all
understanding; Ah how great shall our peace and joy be, when it shall be above
believing, that is, when we shall possess the God and giver of all peace, who
is our rest and peace, yea our peaceable rest, and he will augment our
understanding as much as our peace, and yet our peace shall surpass ours, and
all others understanding.

94. And if our joy be so great when we believe the certainty thereof, Ah how
great in possession, when we shall know certainly with the most certain and
sure knowledge of God, that it shall be ever most surely sure, and certain.

95. If then these things below be able to satisfy any, a moment, surely the
things above, (above all things) shall be able, and will ever, ever will
satisfy all, for all there, shall enjoy all God, who has all things, and is
all things, and more than all things, and he gives himself unto all, being all
in all, and over all, and above and more than all.

96. Ah Lord God, the searcher, the trier and knower of all hearts; thou
know, O Lord, thou know my heart, and therefore know right well, what
my heart heartily, chiefly and principally desires, above, beyond and more
than all things, which is thy dear, thy sweet, and precious, most precious,
sweet and dear self. Ah let me so have thee, as never to be without thee, and I
will never more ask any thing more of thee; fill me, Ah fill me so with thy
blessed fullness, as that I may never more be emptied of thee, but may
continually receive from thee grace for grace, daily grace to give thee daily
glory, much grace to give thee much glory, continually grace to give thee
continually glory Give, Ah Lord, give so thy self to me, as I may ever give my
self to thee, to be all thine, always thine, only thine, and ever thine; Enter,
Ah Lord, be thou pleased so to enter into me, as I may enter into thee, my Joy,
O my Lord, even into th^e, who art the Lord of my Joy, espouse me, Ah espouse
me here, O Lord, by grace, that I may be hereafter for ever married with thee,
unto thee, in glory: Reign, rule, bless, guide, govern, direct, protect,
preserve and defend me from all evils, perils and dangers, that I may enjoy
those blessed, great, gracious, holy and glorious promises, which thou have
been pleased from time to time to make unto me, that I may live and living dye,
that I may dye and dying ever live, to the praise, honor and glory of thine
ever blessed, Eternal, most holy and most great, most sacred and most glorious
name, so be it, Lord, so be it.

97. Heaven is Heaven, because it is holy, yea because, O Lord God, thou art
there that art holiness, therefore is Heaven Heaven and Heaven holy, yea such a
holy, and therefore blessed Heaven as it is, so as to those that are there, a
thousand years seem but as one day, so greatly sweet is its enjoyment, and one
day seems as a thousand years, so great is their joy in its enjoyment, and
holiness is the chief joy, felicity and happiness in Heaven, because it makes
them all like unto thy self; O all Heavenly God, who art the Heaven of Heaven
in Heaven, being the holiness of Heaven, and therefore Heavens chief joy,
felicity and happiness.

98. If earths sweets are so sweet to earthly hearts, as they desire nothing
but earth, that is the things on earth; Ah how sweet then are Heavens sweets to
a Heavenly heart, and how shall, Ah how shall Heaven ravish their hearts with
joy and contentment, when that their hearts, souls and bodies shall be in
Heaven, and all filled with Heaven, that is with all holiness and blessedness,
even with God himself, the ever blessed and holy God, then shall they be all
holy, all Heavenly, yea all, a holy Heaven, being holy as God is holy, but not
so holy.

99. If earth then, or earthly things on earth, be able to satisfy any on
earth, surely Heaven, and the things in Heaven, shall be able and will satisfy
all in Heaven, for that all there shall enjoy all that is there, even all God,
Father, Son and Holy Ghost, who is all, and in all.

100. And therefore by how much God is above all things, and more worth than
all things, by so much, yea so much more, do I value my interest in him above
all things; for having him sure, I have all things sure, I am sure.

101. Ah when I enjoy that true joy, of enjoying that true Communion with the
true God, though here on earth, me thinks I am not on earth, but in Heaven, and
yet I know all this is but an earthly Heaven, (though a Heaven.)

102. But how then, Ah how then does my heart rejoice with joy unspeakable,
knowing that the time will come, and is ever near at hand, when I shall ever
enjoy Heavens true joys, which is God himself, the joy of all joys, yea all
joys that are true.

103. O Lord, thou know that the Heaven which my soul desires on earth, is,
to do thy whole, holy, and blessed will on earth, as it is done in Heaven.

104. I desire to live, O God, and give my heart unto thee,
That have in love and mercy, given thine own unto me.
105. Ah Lord my God, let me so hear thy blessed, most blessed voice, that my
soul may live, and so live, as to praise thee: for to praise thee is to live,
yea to live in thee and for thee, which to do, is the desire I have to live.

106. Give me then power, O God, that have all power in thy self, that I may
fight powerfully, against all my powerful Enemies, and by the power of thy
might, which is an Almighty power, I may tread and trample all their powers
under my feet.

107. Give me, O Lord, give me such fear as may cause me to love thee, and such
love as to fear thee, and to cast out all fear.

108. Meditation is the heart of the heart, the soul of the soul, which is the
strength and life of all devotion.

109. When in meditation God has spoken peace unto thy soul. Ah then, do thou
by thanksgiving (with thy heart) praise, laud and him extol.

110. He that will have Heaven on earth, must meditate on Earth of Heaven.

111. To have God abide with us, we must by meditation abide with him.

112. To have God live in us, we must with full purpose of heart, and
endeavors of life, live to him.

113. To have God dwell in us, we must open our affections, which is the door
of our hearts, to let him into our hearts, and continually feast him with true
and unfeigned love, loving none but him, in comparison of him.

114. To have God love us, we must love him, that is, make him our choice,
above and beyond all other things, choosing him for our chief, and superior
good, that is beyond, above and more, than all other things, he must have all
our hearts, that is, our hearts more than all other things.

115. To have God delight in us, our Delight, End and Aim must be to delight
him, that is, by walking wellpleasing unto him all the days of our whole lives,
as Christ did, yesterday, to day, and for ever.

116. To have God direct us how we shall walk, we must be careful and heedfull
to walk as he does, and shall direct us.

117. To have God preserve us, we must believe in him, trust on him, depend and
roll our selves upon him.

118. To have God maintain us, we must cast all our care upon him, for the
earth is his, and the fullness thereof.

119. To have God sustain us, and be our help, we must hope only in him, for he
will fail us never, and not put any trust in Princes, or in the Sons of Men,
for in them there is no help, their breath goes forth, they return to the
earth, in that very day his thoughts perish.

120. To have God be all ours, we must be all his, that is, in thought, word
and deed, and not think our own thoughts, or speak our own words, nor do our
own works, but do all to the praise of his holy, holy, holy name.

121. He that would live with the Lord in Heaven, must live to the Lord on
earth.

122. He that would have the Lord, to be his Lord, and his God, must serve,
honor and obey him as his Lord, and fear, worship and adore him as his God.

123. He that would reign with the Lord Christ in Heaven, must be contented to
be arraigned for him as he was for us on earth.

124. He that would sit with him there in glory above, must be content to sit
with him, that is as he did, in contempt here below.

125. He that would rejoice with him there, must be contented to sigh, and
grieve and weep and mourn as he did here.

126. He that would have all things with him there, must be content, (if he
will so have it) to have, as he had, nothing here.

127. He that would be received by God his Father there, as by his Father, must
do his will, as Christ did here, that is as his Son.

128. He that would wear an incorruptible Crown of glory, for ever there, must
be content, if he will so have it, to wear a Crown of Thorns, as he did here.

129. He that would have an Eternal weight of glory there, must be content, and
rejoice under Eternal ignominy here.

130. He that would have all things with others there, must be willing to do
all things for others here.

131. He that would have Christ for his Jesus there, to save him, must believe
in him as his Jesus Christ here, that is, as the way, the truth, and the life,
unto. Eternal life.

132. He that would have him there his advocate, to plead his sinful, bad
case, must here plead for, and in behalf of his blessed good case.

133. He that would have him as a judge to acquit him there, must judge and
condemn himself here.

134. And he that would not be condemned with the world there, must not with
the world, and as the world does live here.

135. And he that would not be cast out with Reprobates there, must have no
Communication or Conversation with them here.

136. And he that would not be of the number of the Devils Goats there, must
come unto Christ's flock, and be of his Fold, and of his Sheep here.

137. And he that would live with the Righteous there, must labor after
Holiness and Righteousness here.

138. And he that would be sure to dye their death, to put it out of all doubt,
must live their life.

139. And he that would enter into his Masters and Lords joy there, must be the
joy of his Lord and Master here, that is his well-doing, good and faithful
Servant.

140. Seeing then that these things, O Lord, shall surely be, make me, through
grace, such a Person as I ought to be.

141. Now seeing that holiness is Heaven, and Heaven is holiness, Ah Lord, make
me all holy, that I may be all Heavenly; let holiness always dwell within me,
that Heaven may be always within me, and that I may be always in Heaven.

142. And seeing, O Lord, that our desire chiefly to be in Heaven, is to be
free from all sin, and to be holy as thou art holy; Ah let me labor for, and
long after holiness on earth, yea, and to be so holy, that though I am on
earth, I may be also in Heaven, and Heaven in me.

143. And seeing that the more holy we are, the more heavenly we are, and the
more like unto thee, O most heavenly, and most holy Lord God, that is
throughout holy, in Spirit, Soul and Body, grant that though I am here below on
earth (and earth) I may in holiness be like unto thee above, who art in Heaven,
and art Heaven.

144. Ah Lord God, that have fitted and prepared Heaven for me, prepare me for
it, that I may enjoy thee all, who art my all, and my only Joy.

145. And seeing none shall enjoy thee in Heaven, but those that enjoy thee on
Earth, Ah Lord, let me so enjoy thee here, that I may long to be dissolved, for
ever to enjoy thee there, yet not for mine own sake only, but for thine own
sake (good Lord.)

146. Ah Lord, let my joy be so full of thee here on Earth, as I may always
long to be filled with thy fullness of joy in Heaven, and to enjoy fully those
pleasures that are there at thy right hand, and shall endure for ever more.

147. Yet, O Lord, I humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ, to make me still
patient to wait, until my blessed change shall come, and that I may always
say, thine, O Lord, thine, and not my will be done.

148. Ah come Lord Jesus, come when thou will, and as thou will, either at
midnight, or at the Cock crowing; for though I do long for thy coming to take
me hence unto thy self, yet I would rather, O Lord, thou know, that I had
rather abide here, to do thy will, and for thy sake on earth, than to leave thy
will undone, and to be in Heaven for my own sake.

149. Ah Lord, my Lord, and my God, I confess, that thou have in the abundance
of thy goodness, love, and mercy, done so much for me, in bringing me out of
Hell, and assuring me of Heaven, that even all that I can imagine to do, to
lose, or to suffer, is so little, so too too little, as I could wish, yea and
do wish, that I could do more, and suffer more, to witness that my little will
is great (or desires) and would be great willingly.

150. Ah Lord, I know, and am well assured, that thy goodness is so great, and
thy greatness so good, for the sake of my soul, that my soul longs to be
great in goodness, to do great good things, for thy great goodness sake.

151. Ah Lord God, seeing what thou have done for me, is to assure me of thine
Eternal Love and Mercy in Jesus Christ, give me I beseech thee, grace, that I
may not turn thy gifts of grace into wantonness; but for this thy Love,
wherewith thou have loved me, grant that it may be a strong and firm obligation
unto me, to depend upon thy Love, and to be assured that thou will continue to
do as thou have begun, that is, continually continue to love me.

152. For seeing none but thy self, O Lord, could do the things that thou have
done; that is, to love me, such a loveless, yea vile wretch (as I am in my
self) I will therefore be bold to say, surely the Lord will ever love me,
because he does thus love me, and has ever loved me thus.

153. Ah suffer me not then, O Lord God, holy, just and true, to depart from
thee, by setting up any other God in my heart, or my heart to love, choose, or
esteem any other good, than thy self, who art only good, all good, and able
only, to do me all good, and to make me to do all good.

154. Ah Lord God, in thine own good time, accomplish and finish the good which
thou have begun to work in me, by causing me to depart from all evil.

155. And suffer me not, I humbly beseech thee, for thine own great, holy and
dear name sake, to go astray from those holy, holy, holy ways, which thou have
set before me, and written with the finger of thine own Spirit on my heart.

156. But grant, O Lord, that my Soul may continually be ravished with the
pleasantness of them, and to delight to sit always under the shadow of thy
branches, for thou know, O Lord, thou right well know, how sweet and
delightful the fruit of thy Word, and the knowledge of thy ways* is to the taste
of my Soul.

157. And therefore, and to praise thee, does my Soul long to come into thy
house, to behold thy beauty and thy glory, as in thy Sanctuary, and to hide my
self under the shadow of thy wings, that no evil may come nigh me to hurt me.

158. Ah Lord, thou that have wrought in me holy desires to do thy whole and
holy will, give me grace to teach and instruct others, and to tell them how
willing thou art, to teach all sinners to come out of their sins, and to direct
them how to walk well pleasing unto thee, and to lead them by the hand, that
they slip not.

159. Ah Lord, suffer me not to do as do the men of the World, to labor to
heap up, and gather these things that profit not, and to leave behind me, much
of these low earthly outward things, that endure but for a season; but let me
rather cast off these garments bespottted in the flesh, and follow thee naked,
and gather up and distribute those true and heavenly riches, which shall make
the Soul glad and rich, and honorable for ever, that my heirs may be heirs of
Heaven, and not of Earth.

160. Ah Lord, Let all the Worlds all be all unto me, as I was unto thee, when
in it and of it (even as a menstruous cloth) and my all not worth any thing at
all.

161. Ah Lord, suffer me not to mind earth any more with an earthly but with a
heavenly mind, and that my heart may be always there where my true, only, and
everlasting treasure is; and that I may live in the World, as if I were not of
the World, and use these things below, as low things, even as if I used them
not.

162. Ah Lord, suffer me not to mind these things my self, which I teach, and
labor to have others forget, and not to mind, and so save them, but perish my
self.

163. Ah Lord, full of grace, give me grace to show forth unto all, that all my
covetings, ambition, and longings are for the things above, and not for these
things here below, and that these things here, are fit, and only fit, for such
as have their hearts, and affections here.

164. Ah Lord, sure, yea most sure it is, that those that are risen with thee,
will seek the things that are above, even where thou sit at the right hand
of God, and that those that do it not, are not yet risen, but lie dead in the
grave of their sins.

165. Ah Lord, suffer not the World to deceive any, that their Souls may not be
deceived, and they perish for ever in their sins.

166. But bring them all home, Ah Lord, bring them all home, unto thy self, and
betroth them all to thy self here by grace, that thou do intend to marry unto
thy self hereafter in glory.

167. Ah Lord, I confess it is not my study, nor my care, nor yet my careful
study, nor my studious care, that teaches me wisdom, so as to know thee, or to
learn what thou know; but it is thy self, O Lord, it is thy self, that
give me that wisdom to know thy self, and learning to know what thou know;
for who but thy self has that wisdom to know thy self, or learning in himself,
from himself, to learn what thou, O Lord God, know.

168. Ah teach me then so, O my good God, that art Israel's teacher, that I may
tell henceforth, Devil, World and Flesh, that I will no more be taught by them,
nor follow their teachings.

169. I know, O Lord, I know that the teachings of men, no nor all men's
teachings, are not able to teach me to know any good, but I know that thy
teachings, O God, are able to teach me all good, and how to do all good.

170. I will rejoice therefore in what my God can do, because he can, and
therefore I know assuredly that he will do all the things for me that shall be
for my good.

171. And therefore I will not fear what men can do against me, no nor Devils
neither, for they all can do nothing at all, that can hurt me.

172. But all my fear shall always be to fear thee, O Lord, who art my Lord,
and my fear; for to fear thee truly, brings me true joy, yea unspeakable joy.

173. For to fear thee, as we ought to fear thee, is to keep thy Commandments;
to keep thy Commandments with fear, is the whole duty of man.

174. Ah Lord God, I know, that thou do not hear us for our words sake,
because they are but the words of men, nor for our work sake, because they are
but men's works, nor for our own sake, because we have forsaken thee, but for
thy great names sake, which is thy self, and therefore for thine own sake, O
Lord, I know that thou do only hear us.

175. Ah Lord, my Lord, my God, and my all and my only good, Let me always so
speak unto thee, by thee, as thou may always hear me, and so hear thee, as I
may always love and fear thee, yea make thee all my fear and my love.

176. The Spirit of the Lord, or the fruits of the Lord's Spirit, is, love,
joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance,
lowliness of mind, humble, patient, bountiful and rich in good works; forgiving
and forgetting all injuries and wrongs, bears reproaches and scandals
rejoycingly, does hurt nor violence to no man, escheweth all evil, and
follows hard after all good, with full purpose of heart, and endeavors of
life; serving the Lord, constantly, frequently, circumspectly, obediently,
willingly, cheerfully, rejoycingly and preseveringly; has peace with all men,
loves all men, with brotherly kindness, and does all good possible to all men,
especially unto those that are of the household of Faith.

177. He that has the Spirit of the Lord, he is faithful and valiant for the
Lord, fighting his battles, courageously, cheerfully, gladly, rejoycingly and
preseveringly unto his lives end, he does not his work negligently, nor
slothfully, but diligently and willingly; for his work is his delight, his meat
and drink, yea his Heaven on Earth, is, to do his Lords will on Earth as it is
done in Heaven, he desires no other wages for his work, than his work, he
would continually do his work, for his works sake, for his yoke is easy to
him, and his burden light.

178. He that has the Spirit of the Lord abiding in him, he is no talebearer,
tatler, or busy body; he medleth not in other men's matters, condemns no man,
hates no man, wrongeth no man, does violence to no man, speaks evil of no
man, thinks evil of no man, but always worst of himself.

179. He that dwells with God's Spirit dwells quietly, and peaceably,
because all things are to him all alike, for he knows that all things come
from God, his God; that his Providence orders all things, and therefore he
knows that all things shall always work altogether for his good, yea his very
sins, which God hates, and only hates, and which he himself hates above all
things, and more than all things; yet these are not for his worse, but for his
better, and for the increase of his joy, comfort and rejoicing, in the Lord,
who brings him out of darkness into light, and turns his evil into good;
for God is now become his God and his Father, and loves him as his Son, and
therefore will not see his iniquities, nor transgressions, but passes by all
his sins, looking on him not as a pardoned sinner, but as a son that never
sinned, God sees his best, but will not see his worst, his good but not his
evil, his love to him and for him, but not his hatred against him: God so
delights in him, that all that he does, and does not, delights him; because
he knows the thoughts of his heart, and desires of his Soul toward him, and
for him; therefore he esteems, takes and accepts, of what he would do, as
if he did what he should do.

180. He that has the Spirit of God in him, is made holy, he sins no more,
he is sanctified throughout, in Spirit, Soul and Body, his Heart, Will and
Affections serve the Lord, always; though with his flesh he serves the Law of
sin, yet with his mind he serves the Law of God; he hates all the evil which
he does, and loves all the good which he does not; so as sin, yea all sin is
become unto him so exceeding sinful, as he would not sin, either in thought,
word or deed, to have grace abound in him, no nor glory neither; it is no
longer therefore he that sins, but sin that dwells in him, for he hates
all sin with a perfect hatred, and he so loves holiness and righteousness, as
he longs after it, he seeks for it as for silver, and searches for it as
for hid treasures, it is become his whole and only end and aim, he has no
other ambition, he coveteth nothing else, he desires much grace, that he may
give God much glory, daily grace, that he may give him daily glory, continually
grace, that he may give him continually glory.

181. He that has this Spirit of God in him is led in the ways of all truth
and holiness, which is everlasting life and happiness; and he has overcome the
World, and that wicked one, he is departed from all iniquity, in thought, word
and deed; he has crucified the world, with all its lusts and affections, and
the world is crucified unto him, he seeks no longer to please the flesh by
satisfying the lusts and affections thereof; he serves not God, for the loaves
only, but he seeks more after Heaven for God, than God for Heaven, for to
honor, obey, please and serve him, is Heaven to him.

182. This Spirit helps his infirmities, teaches him heavenly Wisdom, so as
to know what the mind and will of God is, and to discern the great mysteries of
his Salvation, and to know God in the Spirit.

183. This Spirit assures him of his Eternal Election, being the Divine and
Eternal purpose of God: by Jesus Christ we have an access by one Spirit unto
the Father.

184. This Spirit witnesses unto him that has it, his effectual Calling, his
Adoption, Justification, Sanctification and Glorification; and makes him to cry
Abba, Father, and to come boldly unto his glorious Throne of grace, and
gracious Throne of glory; and to say with Thomas, my Lord, and my God; and with
Paul, I know whom I have believed, and whom I love, and therefore says boldly
as Peter; Lord thou know that I love thee.

185. This spirit of God leads him by the hand and directs him how he shall
walk, and tells him what he shall do, and suffers him not to go aside, either
to the right hand, or to the left, of honors, riches or pleasures; it makes
him to esteem all these things below, as earthly, low things, even as nothing,
for the whole world is much too little for him, is not enough to satisfy,
please or content him, for he looks on its all, even as nothing at all, as
dirt, dung and dross, he is content in all Estates and Conditions; for he knows
both how to want and how to abound, and with St. Paul to say, as sorrowful,
yet always rejoicing, as poor, yet making many rich, as having nothing, yet
possessing all things; for Christ is his exceeding gain, his Heavenly riches,
his true treasure, he has now learnt to know Christ, and him Crucified, and
therefore rejoices only in the Cross of Christ, and says, I have none in
Heaven but thee, nor in all the earth in comparison of thee, Christ is now only
his all, and his all to him to live is Christ, he minds none but Christ, nor
nothing but Christ, and what he has done for him; he so loves and delights
in him, as he is become all his talk all day long, and his meditations and
songs in the night, if he sleeps; yet he talks with him, so that sleeping as
well as waking, he desires to have him in his thoughts, and never to have his
thoughts off from him, and his sleep he accounts not sweet, if he have had no
Conversation with him by Communication; and as soon as he is awake, he is
before his eyes, and he presently recollects, and recounts his mercies, and
delights in that he owes him more and more: for though he owes him so much,
yet he longs to owe him as much more, and though he cannot pay him any thing,
yet he is not ashamed every moment to ask him all things, and nothing less than
all things, which is himself, will content him, and though he have his word and
promise for it, yet he will have his seal also, and when he has both sign and
seal, yet he must have it daily, yea hourly, yea as it were every moment if he
could; and though he accounts that he has nothing so sure, yet he would always
have him assure him of it, not that he doubts at all of his word or promise,
but that he might always bear in mind this his sweet and gracious promise, to
sweeten all other sowers of afflictions and temptations, and to imbitter all
other worldly and fleshly sweets; he is so wedded unto him, as he is never at
rest nor ease, if he do not always behold him, if he do not always smile upon
him, if he do not still speak peace unto him, if he do not in all places cause
the light of his blessed Countenance to shine upon him, he is so in love with
him, and so loves him, as if he could, he would willingly think of no other,
speak of no other, nor act for no other, he would most willingly spend his all;
and be all spent for him, and follow him wheresoever he goes, though it were
to be banished, imprisoned, and made the poorest, vilest, and contemptiblest of
men, yea though it should bring sickness, and death; he is much grieved for
that he has so little to lose for him, he accounts his life and all not any
thing at all, not worth the offering unto such a God as he is; that has done
so much as he has done for him; Ah when he afresh considers hereof, how afresh
does his grief and sorrow begin, and most because he cannot grieve and sorrow
as he would; he is so wounded afresh, with his new old love, or his old new
love, as now he finds nothing lovely in himself, to witness his love unto him:
he cannot do for him the half that he would do, and Ah how is he troubled that
he does, and is able to do so little for him that he loves so much; Ah how
willing is he, and how willingly would he do his whole and holy will here on
earth, as it is done in Heaven, and would be as willingly Sanctified as
Glorified, this his imperfection causes him to long for perfection, and this
his holiness in part to long to be dissolved, to enjoy for ever perfect
holiness; but though he be thus tossed on the restless waves of tentation,
trial and affliction, this spirit of God that dwells and abides in him,
assures him, that all these things are tokens of Gods love, and come from him
in love, and therefore he is content, for that he knows that his Lord and
Master Christ Jesus is touched with the feeling of his infirmities, and was in
all points like unto him, yet without sin.

186. This spirit comforts him when he is comfortless, and binds up his broken
heart, heals his wounded heart, visits his sick heart, gives feeling to his
senceless heart, life to his dead heart, faith to his doubting heart, hope to
his despairing heart, speaks peace to his disconsolated and afflicted heart,
and gives understanding, sense, memory, and reason unto his distracted heart.

187. He that has this spirit, he is grieved to see Christ dishonored by any,
and to see him blasphemed and evil spoken of, is to throw dirt and dung in his
face; men's dishonest and filthy lives and conversation, make his soul to melt,
his heart to quake, his ears to tingle, and to gnash his teeth for grief, he
goes mourning all the day long, and lamenteth with a most b^tt^r lamentation,
to hear the mockings of God and his Word, because this is to Crucify his Jesus
afresh, and to put him again to open shame.

188. For he that has this spirit rejoices to hear the name of God, and of
Christ magnified, and praised, to hear him well spoken of, causes his heart to
leap within him, as the Babe did in Elizabeth's Womb, for he loves those that
love him, and honors those that honor him, and such only he accounts his
Father and Mother, his Brothers and Sisters, that do the will of God his
Father, which is in Heaven; for he esteems only the true Christian to be
wise, and rich and honorable, though otherwise he be poor and vile, and
contemptible in the eyes and esteem of men; his very heart and soul cleaves
unto these as the heart of Jonathan did unto David, for,

189. He that has this spirit of God dwelling in him, dwells in love; and
God, the God of love in him: he loves the souls of all men as his own soul,
whether they be relations or strangers, he prays for them in secret, and
exhorts them in public, yea he weeps bitterly for all such as are not yet
brought home to Christ, but especially for such as he sees are dead in their
sins, as have eyes but see not, ears but hear not, feet but walk not, hands but
handle not, mouths but taste not; for all such as walk after the flesh, and do
the works of the flesh: for with his will he would that none did go to Hell,
and that the Kingdom of Satan were not so populous, and that he had not so many
faithful Servants, which are so faithless to Jesus Christ, and to their own
poor souls; he would that all would believe and receive Christ, that they might
be all saved, because he knows that many are interessed in every souls
Salvation, both in Heaven and on Earth.

190. This spirit opens Heavens Gates, and leads the soul into the Inner
Courts, and carries him up into the Brides Chamber, and feasts him in his
Banquettjng house, and fills and solaces his heart, not with the delicacies of
Egypt, nor with the Milk and Honey of Canaan; but with those sweet, rich,
delitious and precious, most precious delicacies that are in that Heavenly
Jerusalem, the City of the living God, where the spirit of all just men are
made perfect, they are fed continually with that rich dish of assurance, and
have the fore-tasts of those Eternal joys, which is that blessed rest prepared
for the people of God.

191. And thus this spirit causes those in whom it dwells, to rejoice
evermore, and again I say to rejoice, for can any man in whom this Spirit
dwells, who is the Sanctifier, and the Comforter, and sent us from Heaven by
our blessed Savior; (be afflicted) can any mourn whilst the Bridegroom is with
them? Ah no, surely no, for he comes with healing in his wings, he brings, Ah
he brings the glad tidings of peace and salvation to all Souls where it
comes to abide, and thus are all the Sons of God led by his Spirit, comforted
by his Spirit, ravished with his Spirit, taught by his Spirit, feasted by his
Spirit, brought home unto him by his Spirit, and made one with him by his
Spirit, for we have all access unto the Father through the same Spirit; let
this then teach us all that are acquainted with the work of this Spirit, not to
quench its motions, not to afflict or grieve this holy Spirit of Blessedness
but be always ready and willing to receive him, and entertain him, for if we
delight in him, and to abide with him, he will delight in us, and delight to
abide in us, for he will not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking
flax, but wheresoever there is the true sincere and unfeigned desires of grace,
he will give grace according to these desires, for he will never leave us
comfortless, but will come unto us, and where he has begun his work, he will
as assuredly finish it, he will never leave nor forsake us, if we do not leave
nor forsake him, but will make our weak and imperfect grace, strong and perfect
glory, for he knows all our desires, and the thoughts and imaginations of our
hearts are not hid from him, but are always open and naked before him, and he
delighted most to feed us, when we are most thirsty, and to cloth us most
richly, when we are naked, and to give us the greatest treasure when we are
poorest, and to visit us when we are most sick for his absence, and to comfort
us when we are most disconsolated and afflicted, and when we cast our selves
down, then does he delight to raise us up to the highest, and when we think our
selves worst, then does he esteem us at the best, and after our mourning,
causes us to rejoice, and wipes away all tears from our eyes.

192. Thus is this Spirit unto us all things, who brings us much more joy,
than we are able to ask, than we are able to think, it convinces our hearts of
Sin, of Righteousness, and of Judgment.

193. This Spirit gives wisdom to the simple, and teaches the ignorant
knowledge, and causes him to understand; so as Babes and Sucklings show forth
his mighty praises, for he reveals unto them, what he hides from the wise
and mighty men of the earth, and makes appear plain that their wisdom is but
mere foolishness, their strength, weakness, and their honors, but as a leaf
which the wind drives to and fro: as he was made of nothing, so in a moment he
turns to nothing, their breath goes forth, they return to the earth, in that
very day his thoughts perish, he is as the grass of the earth, and as the
flower of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is not, he is so perishable
as he can be compared to nothing, but to nothing.

194. This Spirit shows us, that those things which we see not, and cannot
see, be unto us, as if they were; and those things which we see, are, as if
they were not, because we value them not, but as Pilgrims and strangers, we
seek a Country, an habitation not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens.

195. This Spirit opens unto our sense, reason, and understanding, that which
no man can shut, and shuts that which no man can open; this Spirit declares
unto us, what the mind and will of God is for our good: and works in us a
holy conformity in all our minds, wills and affections, to be carefully
studious, and studiously careful, to walk in all well pleasing before him, it
makes us to press forward to comprehend, that for which we are also
comprehended of Christ Jesus our Lord; it works in us a fear that increases
our love, and such love as casts out all fear, it makes us to do, all that
we do (for him) and not for our selves, loving him much more for himself, than
for our own selves; and more for his glory than for our own glory; if such long
to be with him, it is to do him more, and better service; for here we can know
but in part, and do but in part, but there we shall know him as he is to be
known, and do for him all things, which were foreordained and appointed by
him, before that we were, and that is, to possess him wholly, and holy as he
is, that is, as much as is possible for us Creatures.

196. This Spirit warmeth our hearts so with his divine Love, and makes us
partakers of his divine nature, that daily we grow more and more conformable,
and like unto him, and to comprehend, and know, more and more, what is the
length, the breadth, the height of the depth of his love, to his Children and
Servants, and to be such, as eye has not seen, ear has not heard, neither
has it entered into the heart of any man to conceive rightly, the things that
God has prepared for those that love him.

197. The Spirit causes them, where it dwells, to feel what they cannot
comprehend, nor express; and it so fills their hearts with such joy in
believing, that there is no joy like unto it; this is that true bread of life,
that feeds them unto eternal life, this is that true water of life, that
causes us never more to thirst, with fear or doubtings; this is that Rock
flowing with honey, that reviveth the fainting Spirits of every true Jonathan
that tastes it with the mouth of Faith, yea this is that Heavenly Mannah, and
bread of Angels, and Saints, on which they feed and are satisfied in Heaven;
these are the Royal Robes, which Jesus Christ our Bridegroom arrayeth us with,
even his own Righteousness, and true holiness: this fills our lamps, with
that burning oil of assurance, that we shall be admitted unto that marriage
Feast, and Supper of the Lamb; this gives them all to know that their names are
written in the Book of life, and that their lives are hid with Christ in God.
So that when he shall appear at his second and sudden coming, they shall also
appear with him in glory; this causes them to hear his most sweet, and blessed
voice, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you,
before the foundation of the World was laid; this assures them that God is,
and will be their Portion for ever; this causes them to know, that they shall
all sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and that God will not be ashamed,
to be called their God, and to own them for his own, even for his Sons and
Daughters in Jesus Christ; this is that new name, which they all know that have
it, and this is that which fills them with true love to adore all his
Attributes of Justice, as well as of mercy; and for that there is a Hell for
the wicked, as a Heaven for the righteous; for their greatest joy, and glory
is, for that he is, what he is, and for that he does what he does; for all
things that please him please them, his honor is their honor, and his glory
their glory, and therefore they delight to bless, and praise, and laud, and
extol, and magnify his holy name, and this causes them so earnestly to
beseech, and beg, and pray Souls to come to Christ, and to wash and bath
themselves in this fountain of his blood, which is always open for sin, and for
uncleanness; this makes them to prize it above all works, knowing that it is
the work of the Lord, and that in it he is well pleased, and that many are
losers in the loss of a Soul, and that great is the joy in Heaven at the
conversion of a sinner; this makes them to feel what they speak, and to speak
what they feel; this makes them so willing to spend and to be spent, and to
follow the Lamb of righteousness wheresoever he goes, and to go and do, and
suffer quietly, willingly, joyfully, cheerfully and patiently, all that is
commanded them: always saying, O Lord, send me; and as Samuel, speak Lord, for
thy Servant hears; and with David, My heart is ready, and with Paul, Lord
what will thou have me to do, take all my worldly, and fleshly honors,
pleasures and delights, make me if thou will, as poor, and as contemptible, as
thou thy self wast when thou were here on earth, I am content; what thou will
and only what thou will, and all that thou will, O Lord, is the desires,
covetings, longings, and ambition of my heart, and Soul, for I have, nor would
have no other will, than thy will, and to do thy holy, whole and blessed will
here on earth as it is done in Heaven; for this, O Lord, thou know is the
Heaven that my Soul desires to have on earth: I shall rejoice to be banished,
to be trampled on, to be a gazing, and a mocking stock, to be derided and
scoffed at; any thing, Lord, let me be, and suffer, in spirit, soul, and body,
so I may but bring home poor Souls, that they may not go unto that place of
torment, but be received by thee into thy mansion of glory, to sing for ever
Halleluiahs, of praise, honor, and glory, unto thy most holy and most glorious
name, with all that numberless number of Angels and Saints, and with the
Spirits of just men made perfect; Ah who would not lose a member of his own
body, yea though it were all his members, as the blessed Martyrs did, to make
up a member of Christ's body? for who would not have his Kingdom increase, and
Satan's decrease? who would not fight for Christ against all his Enemies, and
adversaries, knowing that they are already conquered and made his footstool?
who would not labor to undeceive poor silly Souls, that go on so fast, and run
so swift in the ways of Eternal destruction, and whose feet make have to death,
and who drink up iniquity as it were water, and rush into all evil, as the
horse rusheth into the battle, and that rise early, and go to bed late, that
they may yet sin the more, and notwithstanding they commit not half the evil
that they would, they are thus ensnared to their own hurt; Ah who would not
labor to free such poor creatures, as are slaves, and drudges, and serve such
a Master as gives such wages, as is Hell, death and destruction, eternally,
both for body and soul! Ah who is not an Orator fit enough, to set forth the
ugliness and filthiness of sin, which thus defiles the heart, in which God so
much delights, and desires to dwell; and which depraves them of his most
blessed and most glorious Image, and makes them the Image of the Devil; instead
of being a member of Christ, it makes them a member of Satan; instead of being
a Child of God and an Heir of Heaven, yea Coheir with Jesus Christ, it makes
them a Child of Wrath, an Heir of Hell, and Coheir with the Devil and his
Angels, of Gods eternal and unplacable wrath and vengeance, which shall ever
burn them, but never consume them; for God himself will laugh at their great
calamity, and mock when their fear comes! Ah who would not rejoice to do such
a work, as to hinder poor Souls from having such a portion as this, and bring
them home to Jesus Christ, who is the great Doctor, who will give them this his
Holy Spirit to teach them, lead them, direct them, and instruct them, in those
things which belong to their eternal peace and Salvation, which is in all
truth, and holiness.

198. Thus are all those in whom this Spirit of God dwells, made partakers of
his own holy, and divine nature, to love the brethren, even with this true,
sincere, and free love, that they may for ever and ever enjoy that true and
free Love of God, which shall make them for ever free, from all miseries and
pains, and of all pleasures and joys, enjoying him, who enjoys all things in
himself, from himself, with whom is all joy, unspeakable joy, fullness of joy,
and at whose right hand are pleasures for evermore.

199. Thus blessed, and for ever blessed are all those, that have this blessed
Spirit of God for their Portion on Earth, which shall lead them as the Sons of
God, unto God their Father and their Portion in Heaven, who is the Portion, the
Father and the everlasting Rest of all the blessed.

200. Ah blessed condition, to be thus blessed by the Spirit of God, yea by the
God of all Spirits; having hearts so full of true love and charity, as to long,
labor, and desire, to have all others thus blessed with themselves, and as
themselves; that are so full of the Love of God, as to love all others as they
love themselves, and would have all beloved by him! Ah holy Father, increase
this thy love in the hearts of all thy Children and Servants here on earth,
that we may together go hand in hand, witnessing that the love wherewith we
love one another is from thy Love, and that we live in thee and thou in us, who
art all Love, even the God of Love, and that it is from thy Love, and the
living of thy holy and blessed Spirit in us, that we thus love, or love thus.

201. Ah Lord God, for thine own great, glorious and holy names sake, take not
this thy Holy Spirit the Comforter from me, but let it ever abide and dwell in
me, that I may always go forth before thee rejoicing, as the Bride rejoices in
her Bridegroom: for thou, O Lord, know my many weaknesses and imperfections,
and that I cannot do any thing well pleasing unto thee, without the assistance
of this thy Holy Spirit, for that my heart is all evil, only evil, and
continually evil; leave me therefore, O Lord, this thine holy and blessed
Spirit the Sanctifier, and the Comforter that I may be ever led in the ways of
all truth and holiness, which may conduct me unto thy dwelling place, which is
all peace, rest, holiness, blessedness, and eternal life, and happyness.

202. Here follows a short Admonition, Exhortation, or advice, unto all
careless sinners, that prize not this life or living of Gods holy Spirit in
them; that they would no longer quench its motions, but come out of their sins,
and taste and see how gracious the Lord is.

203. Ah poor, most poor, and most miserable man, for thou, thou only art truly
miserably poor that art Christless, though thou aboundest in Corn, Wine, and
Oil, though thou farest delicately every day, and art arraied with Purple,
Scarlet and fine linen, though thou feedest on the delicacies of Egypt, and
enjoyest all this Worlds good; the honors, riches, and pleasures thereof,
though thou lie on the beds of Ivory, and have thy Palaces bedeckt with the
Gold of Ophir, and the precious Pearls and Diamonds of the Orient; though
Princes should be thy Servants, and Kings Daughters thy Maidens, yet remember
for all this, thou shall dye, and come to Judgment, thine honor and thy riches
shall not save thee, but in the day of thy distress they shall take themselves
wings and fly away from thee, miserable comforters are all such comforts! Ah
put not, put not thy trust then on such things as in a moment, ere thou art
aware, shall be taken from thee, or thou from them.

204. Awake, awake, from the dead thou careless man, why sleep thou? arise
and Christ shall give thee light and life; why, Ah why will thou be so
obstinate, as thus wittingly, knowingly, and wilfully, to neglect so great
Salvation, and be thus idle all the day long? do thou not know that the night
is coming wherein no man shall work, and the day when thou shall say, thou have
no pleasure in them! Remember, Ah remember, thou that sleep in security,
that drinkest in iniquity as water, and vanity as with cart-ropes, that say
to thy Soul eat, drink, and take thy fill of pleasures, and to morrow shall be
as this day! Ah thou fool, when will thou be wise, may not thy Soul this night
be taken from thee, whose then shall those things be? and what, Ah what shall
become of all those thy vain pleasures and delights, thou can not carry any
of them with thee, but as thou came into the World naked, so thou shall naked
return; from earth thou came, and to earth thou shall again return; thine
honor shall not go down into the Pit with thee, nor thy money neither.

205. Deceive not then, Ah deceive not then thy self any longer, with those
vain things, which are not, that is, they are not, what they seem to be, what
they promise to be, nor what we take them to be! Serve no longer, Ah be thou
persuaded to serve no longer, Devils lusts, Worlds lusts, or self lusts; but
serve, Ah serve the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity and truth, with full purpose
of heart, and endeavors of life, that he may be still, and still, unto thee,
thy God, and thy guide, thy Sun, and thy Shield, thy peace, and thy portion, in
the land of the living. Neglect, Ah neglect no longer, nor put off no longer,
so sweet, so certain, and so great Salvation, as those that are with God enjoy.

206. Cast not, Ah cast not his holy and divine Commandments behind thy back
any more, and trample not his precepts under thy feet, and turn not his grace
of love and mercy into wantonness; Quench not, Ah quench not the motions of his
holy spirit, by which thou art sealed unto the day of redemption, but open
quickly, yea set quickly wide open the door of thy heart, and let him in, lest
he depart from thee, and swear in his wrath, that thou shall never enter into
his rest, and say unto thee as he did unto Jerusalem, seeing that thou would
not be gathered unto me, all my mercies shall be for ever hid from thine eyes:
and seeing that he would not that I should reign over him, come slay him before
me; Ah who then, who then shall be able to deliver thee from the wrath of the
Lamb, who is the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, he will tear, he will tear thee in
pieces in his anger, and break thee even as a Potters Vessel is broken; for
none shall be able to deliver thee out of his hands, nay all shall be against
thee, good and bad, Angels, Saints, and sinners; vea thine own self, shall have
indignation against thy self, thine own eyes shall look evilly on thee, thine
own hands shall tear thee in pieces, thine own, thine own feet shall carry thee
to the place of execution, thine own, thine own Conscience, shall accuse and
condemn thee, and justify Gods Righteous dealing toward thee, thus, thus,
shall thou be there forsaken of all, if thou do here forsake God, and refuse
to be led, guided, and directed by his holy Spirit, who is only able to keep
thee safe from all evil, and to do thee all, all good.

207. O man, man, Reader, whoever thou art, I pray thee, I pray thee as the
Prophet did, and say unto thee in his words, O earth, earth, earth, return,
return unto the Lord thy God, and thou shall find mercy, his hand is not
shortened, his ear is not dull of hearing, he is the same, yesterday, to day,
and for ever, it is thy sins, thy sins, and only thy sins, that separate
between thee and thy God; leave, Ah leave then but thy sins, and return unto
the Lord, and thou shall find mercy, and to our God, who is full of Compassion.
Ah taste, taste, and see how good the Lord is, and how gracious he will be unto
thee, if thou will leave and forsake thy filthy, filthy sins: though thou have
played the Prodigal, and spent the stock of his Grace on Harlots and Strangers,
in a far Country: yet, Ah yet if thou will but return; whilst he sees thee yet
afar off, he will run toward thee to meet thee, and fall on thy neck and kiss
thee, and kill for thee the fatted Calf, and array thee with the best white
Robes, even with the Royal and most glorious Robes of his own, only, natural
Son, and thine Eldest Brother, Christ Jesus, he will delight in thee, yea set
his heart upon thee to do thee good, and bring thee home to himself, and give
thee himself for thy Portion, and make thee his own inheritance for ever.

208. But I am persuaded, that thou art fully persuaded, that there is not so
much sweetness in Jesus Christ as in the World, nor his paths are not so
pleasant and delightful as the ways of sin, and therefore thou make the World
thy God, and thy Christ, and love it as thou should love God and Christ,
well, the world, and sin, and its good and pleasures thou know well; I
desire only this one thing of thee, that thou would labor to know Christ as
well as thou know the world and sin, serve him as many years as thou have
served them, and if thou do not find more sweet, more beauty, more
pleasantness, more delight, more profit, more advantage and more honor than in
the world, and sin, return then to thine old Masters again, and serve them; but
I promise and assure thee, and will freely pawn thee my soul for surety, that
thou shall gain more by serving Christ one year, if that thou do it as thou
ought, than by serving the world and sin all the days of thy lif(...) and if
thou do repent of thy bargain, I will confess that I do deserve thy curses,
and not thy prayers; thou shall find, thou shall find that his ways are not
strowed with Thorns and Thistles, as thou supposest, but with Odoriferous
Roses, and sweet perfumes, as thou supposest not; keep, Ah keep faithfully thy
Covenant with God, and he will give thee much more than thou art able to ask,
than thou art able to think.

209. Consider the service thou shall do for God, thou shall by thy life (if
Godly) perhaps bring home many to him, for thy Companions heretofore in sin,
will have more regard to thee, than unto others of the Godly, and will now
conclude, that surely, Gods ways are the most pleasant and delightsome, seeing
thou preferrest them, and choosest, and esteemest, and praisest them above and
more, and beyond all the ways of sin; and this may cause them (perhaps) to
make a trial, which if they do, there is hopes, for God will not be wanting on
his part, to show them mercy, if they desire it, and seek it faithfully, with
all their hearts.

210. If thou will then witness thy living, and being risen with Christ, seek
the things that are above, where Christ sits at the right hand of God, set
your affections on things above, not on things on the earth, let your hearts be
where your treasure is, for ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in
God; put off, Ah put off the old man with all his deeds, and put on the new man
which is renewed in knowledge, and after the Image of him that Created him, and
as the Elect of God, put on bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind,
meekness, longsuffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if
any man has a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye,
and above all these things put on Charity, which is the bond of perfectness,
and let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called
in one body, and be ye thankful, let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly, in
all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms, and Hymns, and
spiritual Songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord, and whatsoever
ye do in word and deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to
God and the Father by him: so then when Christ who is our life shall appear,
then shall ye also appear with him in glory.

211. These are, and I trust through Gods free grace in Jesus Christ, shall
ever be the longings and desires of the soul of my soul, and the heart of my
heart, for all you that shall read it, and for all the Israel of our God; and I
hope, and shall pray the Lord, in the infiniteness of his goodness to supply
all my defects with the teachings and comforts of his own spirit, who is the
only teacher, guider, leader and Comforter; Ah seek him then whilst he may be
found, and God I hope will give him thee.

212. Now the peace of God which passes all understanding, keep your hearts
and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our
Lord, and the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost,
be with you, and dwell in your hearts abundantly, to the praise and glory of
his holy name, the good of others, and the comfort of your own Souls; Now
henceforth and for ever more, Amen.

213. I had much rather be the poorest in the World, even a Job, or a Lazarus,
O Lord, for thy sake, than the richest of the World, yea than to have all the
World for my own sake.

214. For I have all that I would have, when I have all that thou, O Lord, my
God, wilt have me to have.

215. I esteem all even as nothing at all, if it come not, O Lord, from thee
(all.)

216. Alas, alas, what and how much nothing is this Worlds all, if we have not
Christ's all, that is all Christ.

217. Let me then, O my sweet Jesus, have all that thou have, and I will not
care whether I have any thing at all, of all that the World has.

218. He that has Christ for his Christ, is heir of all things, and sure of
all things, but he that has him not, is heir of nothing, but what is worth
nothing, and can be fitly compared to nothing, but to nothing, and therefore
all that he is sure of, is surely nothing, but a very nothing.

219. For what man has to day, to morrow flies away.

220. Ah Lord, my Lord, give me I most humbly beseech thee, that which will
endure for ever, and not that which perishes ever.

221. That, O Lord, that, which cannot be destroyed, and not that, O Lord, not
that which will destroy me, unless it be destroyed by thee.

222. Give me first, O Lord, give me first, a heart according to thine own
heart, and then I am sure I shall use the World, not as I would, but as thou will.

223. Were I as certain to go to Hell, (which God forbid) as I am certain
(through the merits of Jesus Christ) to go to Heaven, I would whilst I should
be on earth, walk in the ways to Heaven, and never go out of them, till God had
cast me into Hell.

224. O Lord, that know all things, thou know, O Lord God, thou know,
how I love thy Laws, and how I delight to walk in thy ways; and to keep thy
Commandments with my whole heart faithfully, thou know, O Lord, is all the
delight and joy of my heart, yea my hearts only joy and delight.

225. Blessed be God, though I have many years tasted, fed on, and lived in the
pleasures of sin, and but few years in the sweet delights and pleasures of
grace, yet I am well content, and willing to lose, to cast off, and utterly,
and for ever to forsake all sins sweets, for graces bitter, all sins robes, for
graces rags, and all sins pleasures and honors for Christ's dishonor, for I
am now henceforth resolved to be Christ's Servant ever, and sins never. Ah
never, never.

226. Blessings are in the Prove. 30. 6. Add thou not unto his words, lest he
reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
mouth, and they proceed from the heart of him that fears the Lord.

227. But curses come from him that knows him not.

228. He that is wise in his own conceit is a Fool.

229. The Righteous man blesses, and is never weary of so doing, but the
wicked curses, and is always empty as Hell.

230. Shame shall fall on him that wishes mischief to his Neighbor without a
cause.

231. But glory and honor shall be the portion of him that loves him.

232. If thine Enemy sin, rebuke him, but let not thy countenance go along with
him.

233. He that fears the Lord, no evil shall befall him, for he is kept safe.

234. Wisdom, glory, and honor is the portion of him that waits at his
Gates.

235. Behold him that loves the Lord, and thou shall see all his works to
prosper.

236. Regard not the evil of affliction on him that submits himself
thereunto, for it shall prove the joy of his heart.

237. Gladness is always i^ the heart of him that loves Righteousness, because
he fears always.

238. As honey is to the taste, so is holiness to him that loves Righteousness

239. Dwell in peace, and Gods love shall abide with thee.

240. Be watchful over all thy ways, so shall all thy doings prosper.

241. Glad the heart of the Mourner, and thou shall anoint him with sweet Oil.

242. Rejoice thou in the day of affliction, and let thy heart be merry, for
the Lord has heard thy vows.

243. Give thy self up to learn his Wisdom, and refuse not his teachings when
they come upon thee.

244. Bind them upon thy shoulders, lean upon them with thy whole might, and
they shall support thee.

245. Grieve not the spirit of thy God, who delights in thee.

246. Give thy heart to know him, so shall thou be filled with his praises.

247. Learn his ways, and go not out of his paths, for he delights to delight
thee.

248. Ah love him with thy whole heart and mind, that all thy days may be the
days of joy and gladness.

249. Where ever the Lord is, there is bountifulness and peace that passes all
understanding.

250. Lean upon him, and he shall support thee, give up all thine all, that is
thy care unto him, and he shall provide for thee things that shall never fail.

251. He that has him, has life, and shall never see death.

252. Will thou be merry, give him thine heart, let him direct it, and follow
him wheresoever he leads thee.

253. His ways are ways of pleasure, and his paths bring home to live with
himself.

254. Joy is in his Gates, and no mourners come nigh him.

255. He fills the empty, he waters the dry and thirsty ground, there is no
want where he reigns.

256. Rejoice then in the day of thy trouble, and let thy heart be merry, for
he hears all thy groanings, and will compassionate thy bewailings.

257. Let him alone, strive not, for all thy doings without him are as the puff
of a wind which is not seen.

258. He that submits to his ways, shall find his doings advantageous, for
he knows of what we are made, and all things that come from him bring joy,
where he is the giver.

259. His mercies are as the Sun, they dispel the Clouds of afflictions, and
warm the heart with the fire of love.

260. He can do what he lists, there is none can hold his strong arm, but all
must bend when he commands.

261. Trust then in the Lord, who is thy strength, and in the holy one of
Israel, who has given himself to thee, and for thee, he will provide for thee,
he will satisfy all the desires of thy soul, and cause thy heart mightily to
rejoice in his goodness, and to triumph in all, and over all things that come
upon thee, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it, and he will do it,
according to the former promises of his holy Spirit made unto thee, in the day
of thy straights and wants.

262. Praise thou the Lord, for great is his goodness toward thee, and his
loving kindness has no end.

263. This is thy Portion from the Almighty, Amen, Amen.

264. Praise his holy name, live for ever in his love, dwell in peace.

265. O Lord, I know that thou hear not my Prayers for their worthiness, but
they are worthy because thou hear them.

266. I am not worthy for any worthiness that is in me, but for thy worthiness,
O my Jesus, and my good God, that flows from thy exceeding bounty into me.

267. I know that thou do not love me, O Lord, for any loveliness that is in
me, or because I love thee, but I, love thee; O my Lord, who art my God,
because thou know me.

268. And because that thou do love me now, I know that thou did love me
ever, and therefore wilt love me ever, even unto the end, and yet I know well
that there is, nor shall be no end of thy love, it is endless for ever, and for
ever.

269. Thy love, O Lord, I know is like thy self, nay thy love is thy self, for
thou art not only a loving God, but a God of love, and therefore thy love is as
thy self, had never beginning, nor shall never have end.

270. Ah blessed love that is thus durable, and unchangable, and happy, yea
thrice happy, he that is thus beloved, being sure to be beloved ever thus.

271. If a man or woman in the flesh, has unspeakable joy, pleasure and
delight, to be divorced from one which they hate, beyond, and more than any
thing, and are instead thereof, married unto one which they dearly love, yea
which they love more dearly than any thing in the flesh.

272. Ah what joys, Ah what delights and ravishing pleasures shall they have,
and have all they that shall be, and are divorced from their old Husbands (sin)
whom they hate as the Devil, and fear, and fly from, as from Hell, and are
married unto their new, new beloved Husband (Christ Jesus) whom they love
above, and more than all things, as their lives, as their souls, yea as their
Heaven; for he is the life of their life, the soul of their soul, and the
Heaven of their Heaven, being their soul and bodies Eternal Everlasting rest,
peace, portion, happiness, felicity, and blessedness in Heaven: for,

273. There are no joys like to spiritual joys, nor sorrow like to the
spiritual man's sorrow, when he mourns under that intolerable burden of sin,
for a wounded Conscience who can bear?

274. The unregenerate man cannot love sin, and hate grace, as the regenerate
man loves grace and hates sin, for he has the love of God in him, his Image of
holiness and righteousness is renewed in him day by day, he loves all his gifts
and graces with his own love, perfectly, and so he hates all and every sin in
thought, word and deed, which is in sincerity.

275. The fleshly Voluptuous man cannot love the pleasures of the flesh, as the
spiritual man prizeth, and loves, and delights, and rejoices in the pleasures
of the spirit.

276. The Wicked cannot hate the Righteous, and the just, so much, as the just
and the Righteous love the wicked, though they detest, abhor, and hate all
their sins, for they know that a Saul to day, may be a Paul to morrow, etc.
They cannot see the inside of any, nor know their hearts, therefore they judge
none but themselves, knowing with what measure they mete, it shall be measured
to them again, they also call to mind and remember what they were themselves in
time past, how they lived after the flesh, and minded the things of the flesh,
etc. And that where sin has abounded, gra^^ shall much more abound, that it is
by free grace that we are saved, Eternal life is the gift of God through Jesus
Christ our Lord, and we are all unprofitable servants, when we have done all.

277. Sin then is opposite, capital, and grand Enemy to holiness, as hatred is
to love, as darkness is to light, as Hell is to Heaven, as the Devil is to God.

278. See then and consider how they are opposite, and take notice of their
contrary workings, and in the end, how, and by what means it is, that the good
destroys the evil, and is the Conqueror, and the greatest.

279. Sin is Eternal darkness and death, Holiness is Eternal light, and life;
sin shuts Heavens Gates, and sets wide open Hells; Holiness shuts the Gates of
Hell, and sets wide open those of Heaven; sin wounds, holiness heals; sin casts
down to Hell, holiness raises up to Heaven, sin kills, holiness causes to
live, the sinner hates God, and all good, and most of all God, because he is
good, and because he is God, yea because he is such a holy God as he is, and he
would that he were not, that sin might be, and might be free; but the Saint or
Regenerate loves all good, and hates all evil, and loves most of all God,
because he is God, a holy and a just God, all good, yea because he is such a
God as he is, and as well for that he punishes sin with Eternal death, as
because he rewards holiness with Eternal life, after he has given it with
his free grace of his free will, sin shall be ever in Hell, as well as holiness
for ever in Heaven, the sinner in Hell shall be despighted, because he lives to
sin and cannot dye, nor fly from sin, and because that God lives and thus
punishes him (with life) and will not suffer death to have power over him, he
sees death to fly from him, yea so far as it will never be nearer him than it
is, so that he shall ever live thus; the Saints rejoice to live, because they
live in God, and for God; a Saint loves God, because he has thus rewarded him,
by making him to live such a life as this, that is to his praise, and because
God was ever thus, and shall be thus ever, he knows he shall be ever so also,
death is fled from him, and shall be never nearer him than it is, he knows he
shall ever live thus, that is be thus ever with God, in God, and see him, and
know him, as he is to be known and seen, which is to possess him for ever, and
for ever.

280. Thus then holiness, and sin are Opposites, and Enemies, but holiness
destroys sin, as light does darkness; this eternal darkness of sin, must
vanish, when this eternal everlasting light of holiness does appear, thus is it
conquered and overcome, because holiness is from God, and sin from the Devil,
holiness from the Creator, sin from the Creature, holiness had never beginning
nor shall never have end; sin had a beginning, and therefore not from the
beginning; the Devil then brought sin into the World, but God who is holiness,
was so before time, before that ever the World, or the Devil was; sin then is
the lesser being from the Creature, the worser being from the Devil, holiness
the greater, being from the Creator, the better being and proceeding from him
that is all good, and gives all good to all, to make them good all, yea all
good as himself, for all the good that is in all the Creatures, in Heaven, and
o^ earth, is from his good, he fills them all, but emptyeth not himself at
all, he is still the same, still full, yea so full still, as he overfloweth
still into them from his own fullness, and they though filled full, yet do they
still receive from his fullness, without having in them any emptiness, being
always full from the very beginning that they are with him, and yet are they
continually receiving, as if they were as well emptyed, as filled; thus does
our good, gracious, loving and merciful God satisfy us, and resatiate us every
moment, giving us what we ask not, what we want not, what we know not, and
though he does thus increase his blessings by blessing us, yet does he not
suffer them to decrease in us when given us, but we retain all, hold fast all,
keep all, rejoice in all, and give him glory for all, which is what he only
requires; for this his continually giving of us all, even to give him
continually for ever and ever, all glory, for his thus ever and for ever giving
us all grace, perfect grace and glory, yea fullness of all perfect grace and
glory.

281. As on Earth we delight to have much, so nothing more delights God than
that we crave much, the more we ask, the more we are sure to have, and
therefore does he bid us to open our mouths wide, and then he promises to fill
them, and the wider they are, the sooner they shall be filled; his ways, nor
his thoughts, are not as ours, he is never weary giving, nor repents,
importunate beggars are best welcome, and those that are not satisfied with a
little, he takes pleasure to give them much; our dissatisfaction herein is his
satisfaction; our covetings cause his liberality, with our ambition to have
all, and to be denied nothing at all, he is right well pleased, and by thus
exalting him as our chief and only good, does he exalt us, and set us on such
high mountains, that we can even see not only such glory as is the glory of
this World, and the old Jerusalem, but that of his Kingdom of Grace here, and
Glory hereafter, the New Jerusalem, the City of our God, where he is sitting on
his Throne of Majesty and great Glory, unvailing himself as it were, that we
may behold him, and his unapproachable, transcendent, bright, glorious light of
Glory.

282. I would be willingly barren, even of all Spiritual comforts, if thereby I
might be made more able to bear fruit, to God, and for God, I would have no
comfort nor delight, if thereby as it were, I could and did more delight and
comfort my God, that is, I would rather Joy God, than enjoy God, by knowing or
feeling; not that I could be content to know that I were without him, that he
were not my God, God forbid; but I prefer him much before my own chief good of
Joy, his glory being my only, yea all my Glory.

283. I would rather yea much rather, do God's work here, and have no wages,
than have wages here, and do no work.

284. I had rather, yea much rather, whilst here, be always working, than
always receiving wages; for this life of time, I know, is appointed for our
working time, and our hereafter life of time, for our time of receiving wages.

285. I would whilst here, be willing to spend all my time, to do all good; for
I know, that all my hereafter time, shall be spent in receiving all good.

286. I would willingly, most willingly, work Gods work always while here, for
that, Ah for that blessed wages, which I know I shall receive from him for ever
hereafter, which is such, and so great, as eye has not seen, ear has not
heard, neither has it ever entered into the heart of man at any time to
conceive: I know that I shall enter not only into the joy of my Lord, but also
into the Lord of my joy.

287. It is wag^s great enough, and good enough to be always doing thy great
good work, O Great God.

288. I would willingly, Ah most willingly, serve the Lord most, and best of
all men, If I could, and yet I desire as much, and as willingly would, that
every man might serve him more, and please him better.

289. Ah what delight is it to that soul, that delights his God, what joy does
it bring to that heart, that joyeth his God (that is) to rejoice always in him,
for God much delights in those, yea most of all, that make him their only
delight.

290. Ah Lord, how unpleasant are all other pleasures, to those that flow from
thee, how empty, Ah how empty is all other fullness, what poverty, Ah how
beggarly a thing is all other riches, and how little, Ah how little joy does
that Soul take in all other things, that knows thee, and the Ocean of joy,
yea fullness of joy and blessedness that is, O Lord, in thee, and prepared by
thee to rejoice them, that thus wait at thy gates, and are hungar-starved for
want of it.

291. Who can, Ah who can measure the Heavens, span the Earth, empty the Sea,
count the Stars, and the sands of the Seashore, (if not) who then ca^ rightly
speak of, or tell the mercies of our God, who delights in mercy, yea whose
mercies are far above all these, and all other his works?

292. How willingly, Ah how willingly would I forget my self, to mind only my
God, and to do all his mind, to fulfill all his will, and to rejoice in all his
doings, I would love my self, my own self no more, but only my God, my God only
and ever adore, I would willingly deny my self, that is my flesh, all
pleasures, to please him, that has rivers of pleasures provided to please,
fill, and satisfy me with, even such as flow from his own right hand.

293. Ah Lord God, how much better is it to see thy sweet, thy blessed, and
most amiable face in thine Ordinances, and in duties, than the face of the most
gloriou^ Angel in glory.

294. Yea Lord, yea, thy back parts here I much prefer to see and behold than
all their faces.

295. Surely a day, yea one hour of a day is to be preferred (of communion with
thee) before the enjoyment of all things out of thee, all our days.

296. For in thee, O Lord, in thee, is all things, but out of thee is nothing
desirable.

297. All sweets but thine are bitter.

298. But, O Lord, how savoury, yea how pleasant and sweet, are thy bitter,
when thou seasonest them with grace.

299. Thy Voice rejoices, O Lord, more that Soul to whom it speaks peace,
than all the joys of the World can to any man, if he did always and ever enjoy
all their sweets, and never enjoy any of their bitter.

300. Above all things, and more than all things, my soul desires thee, O Lord
God, who art the Lord of all things.

301. Loving of God, is knowing of him; fearing of him is adoring of him;
choosing him, shows a delight in him; running after him, is prizing of him;
seeking of him, shows our longing desire for him; to hunger and thirst for him,
is embracing of him, with eager covetings; to serve him is to honor him; to
rejoice in him is to glorify him; to praise him is to magnify him, and to
worship him is to exalt him.

302. It is better and more profitable many times to be silent than to speak,
for the eagerness of our desires to speak, takes away and hinders us from
comprehending what we do hear, so as we consider not what is spoken (so much)
as what we desire and would speak.

303. But, Ah how much better is it to hear the Spirit of God speak to our
hearts, than the spirit of man to our ears, or our selves to our selves, to
consult with the spirit, and to talk with the spirit, than with the flesh,
either our own or others, though they have the Letter, yea and the spirit too.

304. For what we hear from God in the Spirit by meditation, is usually
engraven and written as it were with the pen of a diamond, on and in the heart,
by the finger of God; but the words of men, are even as man, whose breath is in
his nostrils, soon blown out, soon put out, emptyed, and brings forth nothing,
comes to nothing (being a part) of that whole man (nothing) nothing man.

305. Ah Lord God, thou know how willingly I would be deaf, and not hear any
of man's words, so I could, or were always to hear thee, and dumb to, and not
able to speak to man, so I might, and were fit and able always to speak to
thee, I would willingly be blind to all things, and see nothing of all the
things out of thee, so I could always, Ah so I could always see thee, I would
willingly most willingly lose all things, to have all thee, or to be all thine,
enjoy nothing at all, but thee O God in Christ, but thee, but thee, for
enjoying thee I shall be complete, and enjoy all things, for thou art all
things desirable, yea thou only art all my desires, being all things.

306. The greatest work we can do for God, I conceive is, to destroy sin, and
to endeavor to extinguish it, and root it out of the greatest sinners, is the
greatest work, as it is the greater glory to God, speaking as men, to forgive
many sins, and great ones, than few, and small ones, and when we are most
tempted, or enticed, then to labor most to overcome them, in our selves, and
in others; Ah then, then, the work is great and well wrought, and be sure great
shall be thy recompense of reward, if thou so live, and actest, thine own
heart is not able to conceive, be thou what thou will, how great thy wages
shall be, even here.

307. But in Heaven we shall be filled with all joy, unspeakable joy, fullness
of joy, and have no desire for any other, for any more, than those which we
shall enjoy, and yet I conceive that every moment it shall increase, by and
from the reflections on Gods most glorious and holy attributes, the Soul being
not able to comprehend them all at once, and yet she shall never at any time
desire more, nor conceive that more is or can be than she enjoys, we shall be
always so full of all, being filled with God, who is all, and therefore we
cannot be capable of emptiness, or of any want, and so by consequence of no
desire, such is the Souls blessedness, but how much more, thou only, O God, who
art not only wise, talk with the spirit, than with the flesh, either our own or
others, though they have the Letter, yea and the spirit too.

304. For what we hear from God in the Spirit by meditation, is usually
engraven and written as it were with the pen of a diamond, on and in the heart,
by the finger of God; but the words of men, are even as man, whose breath is in
his nostrils, soon blown out, soon put out, emptyed, and brings forth nothing,
comes to nothing (being a part) of that whole man (nothing) nothing man.

305. Ah Lord God, thou know how willingly I would be deaf, and not hear any
of man's words, so I could, or were always to hear thee, and dumb to, and not
able to speak to man, so I might, and were fit and able always to speak to
thee, I would willingly be blind to all things, and see nothing of all the
things out of thee, so I could always, Ah so I could always see thee, I would
willingly most willingly lose all things, to have all thee, or to be all thine,
enjoy nothing at all, but thee O God in Christ, but thee, but thee, for
enjoying thee I shall be complete, and enjoy all things, for thou art all
things desirable, yea thou only art all my desires, being all things.

306. The greatest work we can do for God, I conceive is, to destroy sin, and
to endeavor to extinguish it, and root it out of the greatest sinners, is the
greatest work, as it is the greater glory to God, speaking as men, to forgive
many sins, and great ones, than few, and small ones, and when we are most
tempted, or enticed, then to labor most to overcome them, in our selves, and
in others; Ah then, then, the work is great and well wrought, and be sure great
shall be thy recompense of reward, if thou so live, and actest, thine own
heart is not able to conceive, be thou what thou will, how great thy wages
shall be, even here.

307. But in Heaven we shall be filled with all joy, unspeakable joy, fullness
of joy, and have no desire for any other, for any more, than those which we
shall enjoy, and yet I conceive that every moment it shall increase, by and
from the reflections on Gods most glorious and holy attributes, the Soul being
not able to comprehend them all at once, and yet she shall never at any time
desire more, nor conceive that more is or can be than she enjoys, we shall be
always so full of all, being filled with God, who is all, and therefore we
cannot be capable of emptiness, or of any want, and so by consequence of no
desire, such is the Souls blessedness, but how much more, thou only, O God, who
art not only wise, but Wisdom it self know, and none else does, or can,
being not able to comprehend thee, to receive thee, or to know thee, as thou
truly art, being an invisible and incomprehensible Ocean, and Fountain of all
good, blessedness, felicity, peace, rest, joy, eternity, and eternal happiness,
thou only, O God, comprehendest all things, and have all things in thy self,
from thy self, thy self only, being all things, and yet both much more, and
much above all things.

308. I would much rather think on nothing, than on any thing out of, or
besides God.

309. To think on nothing me thinks are good thoughts, in comparison of any
other thing, out of God, and besides God.

310. Ah how sweet are those sweets, not to think, that is, to resolve and
intend never to taste more, of the bitter sweets of sin.

311. Ah how sweet a thing is it not to sin, though a man do else nothing, or
nothing else, but to keep his thoughts from sin.

312. Sinful thoughts are harsh, and hard thoughts, and cannot be savoured or
digested, but by those that live in sin, and sin in them.

313. Feed me, O Lord, feed me continually with the breathings of thy Holy
spirit, which is the true bread and water of life, the heavenly Mannah which
the Angels still feed on with joy and delight and are never weary, the blessed
solace themselves with, but do not surfeit, the Saints here below continually
hunger, thirst, gape, pant, and long after, and cannot with any other thing or
things, subject, or object, be fully satisfied.

314. To fare delitiously every day, is to feed on, and fill our hearts,
thoughts, and affections, with the Love and kindness, or the loving kindness,
of God in Christ.

315. To be arrayed gorgeously, and gloriously, is to be arrayed, with humble
and low thoughts of our selves, esteeming our own righteousness,
unrighteousness, and our very best bad enough to condemn us into Hell for ever,
but to have high heavenly thoughts of the righteousness and merits of Jesus
Christ, and that through his holiness, worthiness, and perfect obedience, we
shall be made perfectly holy, and eternally happy.

316. To be right Honorable, and truly Honored, is to be Gods children and
servants, sons and daughters to him who is King of kings, and Lord of lords.

317. To have all things, is to have Jesus Christ, for Jesus and for our
Christ, get him* Oh get him, and I am sure thou will hereunto set thy seal.

318. Will thou live happy? live to him, and for him only.

319. Will thou dye willingly, dye first to sin.

220. Will thou live eternally? live so then here as Christ thy head and thy
husband lived when he was in the flesh, doing always the will of God, his
heavenly Father.

321. Will thou always be comforted and rejoice? make thy peace with thy God,
and labor to maintain it.

322. For fear, or favor, to gain, or lose, what thou have, or may hope to
have, have a special care, and resolve, that thou consent not unto, connive at,
or love the least, or sweetest sin.

323. And if unhappily at any time thou do fall, lie not, Ah beware thou lie
not willingly in it, but rise quickly, and come out of it, by true, sincere,
unfeigned repentance, and wash and bathe thy self in tears of sorrow, grief,
and lamentation; but still hope and trust in the Lord, for he will fail thee
never.

In Bourdeaux, Anno 1657.
1. ALL they that live holily live in God, and God that is all holiness lives
in them, they dwell in him, and he in them, as sin is Hell, is Devil, is both
torment and tormentor, so holiness is Heaven, is God, is both Comfort, and
Comforter.

2. All that is good, is from God who is all good, only good, ever was, and
ever shall be, all goodness is from his goodness, yea from his overflowing
fullness of goodness they are thus filled with all good.

3. And as light brings out of darkness, dispels it, vanquisheth and overcomes
it; so Gods Love which is holiness, delivers us from all sin, dispels, conquers
and overcomes it, brings us, Ah brings us for ever out of this Hell (sin) into
this (Heaven holiness) or Heavenly holiness.

4. Love from God is made perfect, that is sincere, and this Love casts out
and overcomes all fear, causes true filial fear, which flows from true sincere
Love, yea from this Love, which is from Gods fear, or the fear of God, which is
his Love.

5. Ah Lord, I most humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ, and for his sake,
never to take thy holy spirit from me, who is my light, my life, my joy, my
rejoicing, my strength, my hope, my faith, my confidence, and my assured
assurance.

6. Thou teach me, O Lord, all that I know, and thou know well that I
desire to know nothing but that, and what thou will, and do intend to teach
me.

7. For to know any other thing, yea to know all other things, is even to know
nothing, to this one thing, of knowing thee, and Jesus Christ, whom thou have
sent, to know him not only to be a Jesus and a Christ, but our Christ, and our
Jesus in the Mystery, not in the History, in the spirit, not in the letter, not
from notions, but from motions, living, walking, reigning, ruling, overcoming,
bringing under, making subject, willingly, cheerfully, constantly, continually,
thoroughly, seriously, faithfully, ardently, gladly, and perseveringly at all
times, and in all places and things.

8. Ah how great a folly, yea what greater folly is there, than the wisdom of
men, and to learn only that which man can teach.

9. What, Ah what are all his words, but mere words, froth, scum, a scummy
froth that is as soon dead as born, short lived, quickly made, and quickly
unmade, and its making is its destruction, it grows and withers together in
growing, it is even as its maker, and it shows its maker (man) to be like it,
that is a windy puff, as the puff of the wind, man, nothing man, but vanity,
which is in it self worse than if it were not, than if it were nothing.

10. Man's greatness, power, strength, honor, beauty, wisdom, prudence, policy,
what is it, but as himself, a vanishing vapor, having nothing certain, but
that all he has is uncertain, what ever he has to day, of riches, honors, or
pleasures, to morrow all may say him nay, and take themselves wings and fly
away, and he himself (as the rich glutton) go where he shall ever stay, and
ever weep and wail this his very day, the day that ever these, or this was his.

11. Ah how much nothing then, is all things out of him, that is all things,
even our God, the God and giver of all things.

12. Yet Lord I am content, and willing to, not to be any thing, yea to be any
thing for thy sake.

13. O my soul, I charge thee henceforth, never to be afraid to lose what thou
have committed and given unto the Lord to keep for thee, fear not then neither
to lose any thing that he has given thee, and keeps for thee, which is thy
faith, thy fear, thy love, thy joy, thy hope, thy peace, thy comfort, and thine
assurance.

14. Fear not to lose thy confidence, obedience nor perseverance, for he that
has given thee this thine all, will so preserve and keep thee, that thou shall
never fall.

15. Speaking without feeling, is even as dry bones that have no taste, relish,
nor moisture, that cannot nourish, nor do not any whit satisfy or please the
spiritual appetite.

16. Me thinks to speak, not what a man feels, or not to feel what he speaks,
is as if he did not speak at all, nay me thinks he should not speak it, for it
is words only, only mere words; true, we shall be judged and condemned too for
words, but sure I am, it must be works, not words shall justify us, by faith
we are saved; now faith without works is dead, it is not the knowing Servants,
but the doing ones that shall receive the recompense of reward, and enter into
the joy of their Lord, and ever possess the Lord of their joy, knowers and not
doers shall be beaten with many stripes, blessed are they that have seen, and
have believed, but more blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
believed.

17. The just shall live by says, not the faith of words, ^o say only I
believe in the Son of God, in Jesus Christ whom he has sent, but of works, to
show that he did believe, by doing the works were Commanded him to do, which is
to fear God, and keep his Commandments.

18. But to feel what a maa speaks, and to speak that only which he feels, is
not words only, but works also, yea the work of Gods spirit, for its the
spirits work thus to work, to work his will and his work on our hearts, and to
cause us to feel, that is to know, that he works for us, and in us, and will
never leave thus working, till he has wrought out our Salvation, that is, till
he has sanctified us throughout in spirit, soul and body, and prepared and
fitted us for Heaven, as Heaven is fitted and prepared for us.

19. Ah how great a folly is it to prize any other wisdom, or to account any
other thing wisdom, then this one thing, feelingly to know, and to know
feelingly in truth, and sincerity, that Jesus is the Christ, our Christ and our
Jesus, to anoint us, and to sanctify and save us, to be unto us Wisdom,
Righteousness, Justification and Redemption.

20. O my soul, my soul, fry from all other knowledge that hinders this, as
from madness and folly, as from mad folly, and foolish madness, brutishness and
stupidity, and choose to learn, and learn to choose this one thing needful, that
is to know Jesus Christ, and him Crucified for thee, for thee my soul and body
in thy place and stead, not with the knowledge of the letter, but of the
spirit, for thus to know him is life, yea life Eternal, Eternal and Everlasting
life.

21. How willing, Ah how willing is that soul that receives any thing from God,
to lay it out for him, that is, to give it unto others; he would indeed be
always receiving, and God and his own heart only knows how willing he is to be
always giving, even as if he desired and begged for others, and not for
himself, and as it is freely given him, so does he freely, or would if he could
freely give it unto others; he will not, Ah he will not, he cannot consent to
napkin it up, or hide it, he would be thus rich, and wise, and honorable, but
it is to do good works, as it were to make others such, when others are what
they should be, he praises God much on their behalf, and rejoices with
unspeakable joy, for the glory of God is his only rejoicing, he minds in some
manner, yea and often too, more others welfare than his own, because it seems
to him that he cannot alone do what he would have done for his God; therefore
as soon as he receives this Heavenly treasure, he desires to show himself to be
the Treasurer of Heaven, to distribute it unto those that want, that lack it,
that are hunger starved, and when he meets with such, and perceives and finds
that they feed heartily, and savor it, Ah how does he bless God for thus
blessing him, and them, for thus using him as an instrument, as his hand, and
mouth, as it were to give unto them, and to help their infirmities; but he
gives it not as his own, but as his Masters goods, for he charge them
strictly to account themselves Debtors to his Lord, not to him, for he always
to all, acknowledges to have nothing but what he has received; he will by no
means hide his light under a bushel, but puts it on a Candlestick that it may
be seen, his only ambition is so to traffic with it, that it may redound to
his Masters profit and advantage (that being) he is certain he shall ever have
a well being, that is, be received into, and ever to abide in the joy of his
Lord, yea into the Lord of his joy.

22. Ah Lord, empty my self of my self; my heart of my own heart, my affections
of my own affections, my thoughts of all my own thoughts, that I may be filled
with thee, who fillest all Creatures with all the good things they enjoy; ^e
thou, O Lord, be thou all my all, all my honor, wisdom, strength, riches,
pleasures, life, contentment, and happy days; for even then when I have all
things, and have thee not, thou know, O Lord, that I have nothing, for that
I esteem them all, even nothing at all; but when I have thee, Ah when I have
thee, I have all things that I would have, that my soul desires, or can ask,
or crave.

23. Give me but thy self, O Lord, O Lord, give me but thy self, and then give
me what thou will to do, to be, or to suffer for thee; I accept, Ah I most
willingly accept of it, and promise for ever obedience unto it.

24. Though I am unable, unfit, and cannot do what I would do, yet most
willingly I would, and most unfainedly I do desire to do what I should do.

25. O Lord, I know that thou know all things, and therefore I know that
thou know how willingly I would, and how much I desire to give thee all my
life, all my labor, and all my love.

26. For there is no other thing lovely, or deserves to have our loves, but
that one thing, thy Love, O God, O God thy Love, thy Love.

27. Ah what is all man's teachings, and man's doings to that, O God, which by
thy Spirit thou teach us to know, and inablest us to do.

28. If it be so sweet, Ah if it be so sweet a thing to think of God and his
ways here on earth in the flesh, so that all earthly sweets or earths sweets
are made bitter by it, unsavory, and unwholesome; Ah how wholesome, savory and
sweet is it to walk, O Lord, in all thy ways, to do all thy will, and to enjoy
thy self, all as thou art in Heaven, where thinking thoughts, hoping desires,
and believing joys, shall be turned into possessing truths, even true
possession of all that ever we believed, desired, hoped or thought on, yea it
shall far surpass all the imaginations of our hearts, of our desires, or hopes,
being infinite and incomprehensible, as well as Everlasting and Eternal.

29. And when, O God, thou have thus filled us here, thou do at times seem to
us to be as the ebbing Sea, go back again; but that we may not remain
comfortless, thou come again unto us, into us, even as the flood, yea as the
full Sea, to show us, witness to us, and assure us, that there is no want,
decrease nor deminishing in thee, but that thou art still the same, full of
bounty, goodness, love, and willingness, to do us all good, much above what we
can ask, or think.

30. There is, Ah there is a most blessed Heaven to be had on this side Heaven,
even whilst we are on earth, which is an assurance certain, or a certain and a
sure assurance, of that Heaven of Heaven in Heaven, and this some have always
within them, at all times and places, they enjoy this unspeakable joy, but more
fully, sweetly, and particularly, at some times, when they have a near Converse
and Communion with God, then are they as it were wrapped up in God, and clothed
with him, and filled with him, and made meet and fitted by him, then Ah then do
they sing new songs of deliverance, rejoicing with unspeakable joy, that they
are thus made free.

31. That high Heaven above, is to be had here below, and we have it, when
though we are high in God, yet we are low in our selves, though we have our
hearts high, living in that Heaven above, above all things here below, yet our
affections, esteem and desire are all always weak, dull, and low, to all these
things here below, yea much lower than the lowest of things.

32. Ah did but our hearts well consider what is in Gods heart to give us, and
to do for us, surely we should and we would do no other thing than wait upon
him continually, to hear what he would say unto us, and do for us, which would
bring us more joy, joy us more than our hearts are able to hold, than we are
any of us able to think, or to conceive.

33. O Lord, thou know that I would not have all that I would have, but the
heart of my desires, yea the desires of my heart are to have only, only to have
that which is in thy heart to have me to have.

34. Let, O Lord, I humbly beseech thee, my thoughts, heart and affections, be
always laden with the loaves of thy love.

35. Let my soul always be resatiated with thy love and kindness, even with thy
loving kindness, O Lord.

36. O God in Jesus Christ, let thy former mercies always glad my heart, when
it shall either droop or faint, I most humbly beseech thee.

37. Let me not, Ah let me not wander from thee, nor thy precepts, O Lord, who
keep this close unto me.

38. Let thy Commandments be as a Chain of Gold about my neck, and as Bracelets
of Pearls on my arms.

39. Let, O Lord God, thy whole Law, which is holy, be written on my heart with
the finger of thy holy and blessed Spirit, and grant through thy grace, love
and mercy in Jesus Christ, that I may never depart from them, but always and
ever delight in them, much more than on my daily food, which thou have
appointed and ordained to feed this temporal life.

40. Let thy word, O God, be as, yea be the honey comb, to the spiritual taste
of my Soul, and resatiate and solace it as with marrow and fatness, and comfort
and glad it, as wine on the Lees, yea as wine well refined on the Lees.

41. Ah Lord God, cause my soul always feelingly and rejoycingly to say, I have
none in Heaven but thee, nor on all the earth in comparison of thee, my Jesus,
and my Christ, and let the Corn, Wine, and Oil, which are the riches, honors,
and pleasures of the World, be as dirt, dung, and dross in comparison of it.

42. Ah Lord God, what is man, sinful man, wretched, blind, despicable poor
man, that thou art thus mindful of him, and the Son of man that thou should
thus regard him, delight in him, and set thy heart upon him, to do him good,
yea to do him all the good that is in thy heart, and to make him, that is his
heart, according to thine own heart.

43. Ah wonder of wonders, that such a God should thus condescend to love such
a man, nothing man, man that is nothing, but evil, all evil, yea and
continually all evil, for there is none good, but thee, O God, O none, no not
one.

44. Bow down, O Lord, bow down my heart unto the obedience of thy Laws, and
lift it up to rejoice in the obedience of thy Commandments, to keep them, and
do them, for in the keeping of them there is life, yea eternal and everlasting
life.

45. Banish, O Lord, I most humbly and earnestly beseech thee, out of my heart,
and thoughts, the love, and the liking; unto any other Love, besides thee and
thy Love.

46. And grant that with the heart of my heart, I may serve thee in truth of
heart unfeignedly all the days and moments of my life, that I may long after no
other thing, and that thy fear may be my daily food.

47. Ah Lord, I humbly beseech thee to give out thy self unto me, that I may
give up my self unto thee.

48. Give, O Lord, give thy self unto me, that I may for ever give my self to
thee, to live ever to thee, and for thee, as I desire ever to live in thee, and
with thee.

49. Thou know, O Lord my God, that I desire not what I do desire, unless it
be conformable to thy desires; so that my desires are not mine, but thine, not
mine own, but thine own, yea thine all, all thine.

50. I would not have, O Lord God, thou know right well what I would have,
but what I should, that what thou will have me to have, what thou have
appointed me to have, Ah let me have that only, that all, all that.

51. I know that all that thou give us, whether graces or gifts, thou will
have an account of, we shall account with thee for.

52. Ah let me no longer, nor no more have this woe and grief of heart, to have
received much and done little, and to ask much for my self, but to do little,
Ah little for thee.

53. Suffer me not, O Lord, never to think or do that in secret, which I would
not, which I should not do openly, and let me, O Lord, Ah let me much more fear
thine all seeing eyes, than all the seeing eyes of Angels and men.

54. How we are to desire and believe that we receive the Lord, in the
Sacrament of his blessed Supper, and the assurance thereof, to our Souls, to
comfort glad and rejoice them.

55. Ah Lord God, as for me, as for me, Ah Lord God, the food my Soul desires
at thy Table, and Supper, that which resatiateth, feeds, fills, and
refreshes it, is the sweet breath, and most divine, and delitious breathings
of thy divine and most holy Spirit into my heart, and soul, and all the
affections and faculties thereof, to warm and heat them; to ascertain and
assure my heart of thy Love and living in it, which thou do, O Lord, by
sanctifying it, the will, the mind, the memory, the desires, and all the
affections and faculties thereof, and by making it, and them more, not only to
desire, but to perceive, see, feel and certainly to know its growth, and
growing more and more, in conformity and likeness to thee, O God, in Christ, by
loving, delighting, choosing, embracing and rejoicing, in thy Laws, ways, word,
will and Commandments; I do not, blessed, O Lord, be thy name, as do the
Papists, suppose, or believe, that I eat thy flesh and drink thy blood, as thou
were when thou were here on Earth, in the flesh, on the Cross; for I know that
the Spirit must be fed with spiritual food spiritually, the food of the body
cannot resatiate, or satisfy the Soul, and that Soul that has thus tasted,
and fed on thee Spiritually, will assuredly hunger for this blessed heavenly
food, of thy holy, heavenly, blessed, most blessed Spirit, even for the
breathings of this thy Spirit, for the joys and ravishments which they enjoy
that enjoy, and are filled with this Spirit; for the peace, tranquillity,
serenity and comfort of thy Spirit, for the life and living of thy Spirit, to
please, delight, fill full, satisfy, and resatiate the appetite of the Soul,
even as the body hungreth and desires, rejoices and delights in food to
please its fleshly appetite, what if we could or did, O Lord, eat thy very body
and blood, that would not fill or feed our Souls, which are not fed with meat
and drink corporally, but spiritually, and what matters it, O Lord, as for me,
I care not what I eat or drink, as to the outward man, so I may eat and drink
by faith in the Spirit, and my inward man may be filled with the Spirit,
whether the body live or dye, as for the bodies sake, I care not though the
body be hunger starved, it shall, for, sure I am, it will, be well content, if
the Spirit be thus fed, and filled with the presence, breathings, and Communion
of thy Spirit, it is not, Ah Lord, it is not, thou well know, the Quails and
Mannah from Heaven, nor thy body and blood, corporally, but spiritually, that
my Soul longs for, and my heart desires and pants after, so that it even
faints for lack of it, Ah give me that or else I dye, I dye indeed,
corporally, spiritually, and eternally, from which deaths, O Lord, by thine own
death, I trust, I hope, I believe and am confidently assured, that thou have
delivered me, and wilt deliver me, by giving me this Heavenly food of thy holy
Spirit, to live in thee, for thee and to thee, here by grace and hereafter in
glory, this is my belief, O Lord increase my Faith, strengthen it, and comfort
it more and more, by thine own Spirits living, reigning and ruling in my heart,
by causing it willingly, cheerfully and perseveringly, to walk in thy ways,
doing thy will, with sincerity, integrity and uprightness, in thought, word and
deed, both toward thee, and toward all men, for ever, and for ever.

56. He that makes wagers, usually coveteth, if not always, therefore surely
it is best to forbear.

57. Ah Lord, keep me from coveting any other thing than thy self, and thy holy
and blessed Spirit, to teach me, lead me, direct me, guide and govern me, my
heart and affections, to walk in all thy holy ways, and to keep all thy
Commandments all my days.

58. For worldly covetings after the things of this World, keep our thoughts,
hearts, memories and affections, from seeking (with coveting desires) the
things of Heaven, or Heavenly things.

59. Let me covet thee, O Lord, ever, ever, But all things, or any thing out of
thee never.

60. Let my love be to love thee, my delight to delight thee, my care, O Lord,
let it be to please thee, my groanings to go after thee in thy ways, and let
all my joys be to rejoice in thee and thy praise, and to praise thee, O Lord,
my Lord, always.

61.
Ah suffer me not in other to spend my days,
But thus uprightly to walk in all thy ways.
62. Covetings for the World, makes the affections of the heart to affect the
World; but covetings for and after Heaven, makes the heart and all the
affections thereof, to affect Heaven, and the things in Heaven, with a heavenly
heart.

63. Covetings for the World, makes the heart earthly; but covetings for
Heaven, makes the heart heavenly.

64. Covetings after God, makes the heart God-like, according to his heart;
covetings after any thing out of God, or besides God, makes the heart ungodly,
that is ungodlike, and contrary to his heart.

65. Covetings after the flesh, makes the heart fleshly; or a heart in the
flesh; Covetings after the Spirit, makes the heart spiritual, yea a heart
living in God's Spirit.

66. I suppose that if a man love at times unlawfully, lusting after strange
flesh, only with the flesh; that is, desires and would their Loves with the
flesh, but not with the will and mind, which is the heart, though the flesh
says yea, and yields, if the Spirit says nay and yields not, and does much
more ardently and vehemently desire, and would not their Loves, then the flesh
does and would their Loves, and the Spirit, that is their inward man, would
much rather have the hatred, than their loves, and has sincere hatred and
dislike to this Love by the flesh, faithfully, truly, ardently and continually;
it is not he that sins, but Sin that dwells in him; for though with his flesh
he serve the Law of sin, please the flesh, yet he hates, detests and abhors the
evil which he does, and with his mind he serves the Law of God, God's Law is
written in his heart, and remains engraven still in the inner man, on all his
affections.

67. As to me, I willingly, most willingly would, if it might be, love none but
my God alone.

68. True, Lord, true it is, the outward man, that is the flesh, desires and
delights in the things of the flesh, because it is fleshly; as the inner man,
the heart of the Soul, and the Soul of the heart, and all the faculties
thereof, delights and rejoices in the things of the Spirit, because it is
spiritual.

69. I have no Heaven here, Lord, because my Heaven is in thee; and yet I have
a Heaven, Lord, here, because thou that art Heaven, art here, and in me.

70. Above all keepings, keep, O Lord, O Lord, keep my heart, my poor heart
from sin, from choosing, delighting, approving, countenancing, or maintaining
Sin.

71. But this is not all, no Lord no, thou know, it is to be thy servant, to
work thy work, to do thy will; not for my self, as for thy self; not for my
praise, applause or honor, but for thine; for I could not be satisfied, though
I had all I would have, unless I do all that for which thou have created me,
and appointed me to do.

72. It Is not, Ah it is not, the Corn, Wine and Oil of the World, the honurs,
riches, and pleasures thereof; it is not the honey of Earth, but Heavens honey,
that my Soul desires to taste and ever to feed upon.

73. If I had and were ever sure to have, all the satisfaction that ever
Creature had, and I had thee not, O my God, for my Portion, as I firmly believe
I have, I should and would account my self, of all men on Earth the most
miserable.

74. I would not give the part and Portion, that I have at present in my God,
for all this Worlds good, for all its honors, riches, and pleasures.

75. Ah Lord! how much nothing does all things seem to be, when compared to
thee.

76. Faith, hope, and love in thee, and for thee, O Lord, is more worth than
all things else that can be given, that is not of thee.

77. Who is able or can express the satisfactions of that Soul, unto whom thou
have given Love, cordial, faithful, sincere and persevering Love, to love thee.

78. Ah how sweet a thing is it to serve the Lord? Ah how pleasant and
delightsome, to walk always in all his ways, and to do his will willingly.

79. Ah Lord my only grief and trouble is, because I keep not thy Laws, and for
that I have not regard to thy Commandments, as I would.

80. Ah that I were even as a barren wilderness to bear no fruit for my self,
and as a dry Spring to give no refreshment to my self, to my own self, that is
my flesh! Ah that I were as it were, liveless, and loveless, to my self, that I
might only live to love and adore thee, my God, my God.

81. What is my life, or my self, if it be not spent for thee, and what are all
my days? if I walk not only, and altogether, that is, always in all thy ways.

82. Were it not, and would it not be much better for me, that I were not, and
that I never had been? if I be not, O Lord thine, and if I live not to thee,
and for thee, to thy praise, and for thine honor and glory.

83. Beautiful are all thy ways, O God, they are most, yea they are only
desirable.

84. He that walks in them without wavering, turning aside, or going astray,
shall assuredly at last come to his journeys end, to his long home, to that
harbor and haven of rest, happiness, eternal felicity and blessedness.

85. To think on any thing out of, or besides God, brings no true solace, joy,
savor or content.

86. But to think on him as we ought, how easily and quietly does it dispel all
other thoughts, making us to see them as they are naked, empty, nothing.

87. Thoughts on God fill the soul with joy, delight, and pleasure, above, and,
as it were, even beyond end and measure.

88. Good thoughts if they did no other good than keep out evil thoughts, were
they, are they not to be accounted, prized, and valued as a great good?

89. Thy presence, O Lord, at all times fills me with all delights and
pleasures, and thy absence emptieth me even of all.

90. When I have thee, O Lord, I have all I would have: Ah, but when I want
thee, I want all, even all that my soul desires, that it does love or crave.

91. As I have, and according as I have thee, O Lord God, so are my joys, and
according as I want thee so are my sorrows and grief.

92. Thy drawing near does not only comfort me and satisfy me, but also ravish
me: But at thy departure or absence, ah Lord, thou know, thou know, how
my heart quaketh, trembles, and is full of doubts, cares and fears.

93. I cannot, O Lord, thou know I cannot live without the presence of thy
holy Spirit, who is my only comfort or comforter, for when I want thee, O Lord,
I want all good things, yea, I account nothing good.

94. It is not the world that I long for, or care for; it is not, O Lord, the
nether, but the upper springs; not the left hand mercies, but the right hand;
not the footstool, but the Throne favors, that I esteem favors and mercies
indeed.

95. O Lord, my Lord and my God, do thou, I beseech thee, so possess my heart,
that I may only be possessed with thee.

96. O Lord, be thou pleased so to live in me, that I may only and always live
to thee and for thee.

97. Give, O Lord, give so thy self to me, as I may give my self to thee.

98. When I want thee, my God, who art my all, and my only good, I want all,
even all; But when I have thee, O Lord, thou know my heart says, it has
all, it has all, it has all I would have, all that it does think on, or
desire, or crave.

99.
How much nothing, O Lord, is all other things to thee.
And how much above all things, O Lord, art thou to me?
100. Give me then thy self, O Lord, my Lord, and I will always cheerfully say,
I have all, and that I desire nothing else at all; but unless thou do, O Lord
my God, give me thy self, thy only and thy very very self, thou know that
all things seem to me, and are esteemed by me, even as nothing, as dirt, as
dung, as dross.

101. Thou know, O God, my God, that I cannot live without thee, and I
desire only to live, to live in thee, to thee, and for thee.

102. Ah that I were dead to all things, and all things dead to me, that I
might only be alive to thee.

103. Oh that all things would take themselves wings and fly from me, that I
might not be kept back from flying up to thee, my God, my God.

104. In thee, O Lord, there is true rest, a rest of peace in truth; but out of
thee, O God, there is no rest for the soal of the foot of my soul.

105.
I cannot rest but on thy breast,
I cannot live but in thy Love,
I cannot walk but in thy way,
I cannot joy but in thy day.
I cannot run but unto thee,
I cannot see but only thee;
I cannot joy but in thy love,
I am not well but when above.
O God, my God, take me to thee,
That no other I ever see;
For seeing thee I see that all,
That ever was and ever shall;
That glorious Sun that blessed light,
That shows to go by day and night;
That gives all things unto all
That ever were and ever shall.
To thee, O God, and thy Great Name,
Be ever praise, laud, and great fame;
From this time forth for ever more,
Thy self, thy love, I will adore.
106. How sweet, O God, Oh God how sweet are thy Sweets?

107. Oh happy condition to enjoy thee, O God, whatever my condition be.

108. O Heavenly heart that is always in Heaven, meditating on thee, God, the
Heaven of Heaven, in Heaven.

109. Oh happy he that has always Heaven in his mind; that minds only Heaven,
and the things that are in Heaven.

110. Such, Ah such a heart, O Lord, who art the Lord of Heaven and Earth, give
me, that my heart may be according to thine own heart; yea, that my heart may
be in thine, and thine in mine, that thou may, O Lord God, so empty thy self
into me, that I may for ever and for ever be emptied into thee, and filled by
thee, with thee.

111. O Ocean of all goodness, continue to shower into me the abundant showers,
yea floods of thine infinite good, even as thou have heretofore, many, many, ah
many times done, that I may rejoice and be glad in them, as well when I have
them not, and feel them not, as when I feel I have them.

112. Ah Lord, my Sovereign Lord and God, my Superior and Supreme good, the
good that is only able to glad me, and to make me rejoice; fill me, Ah fill me,
O Lord, with these goods, and good things that flow out continually from thee
that I may see thy goodness, thy beauty and thy glory, as in thy Sanctuary.

113. Ah the true satisfactory soul-ravishing Joys to enjoy thee, O God, and
those Joys that thou give; away, away far from me all earthly Joys, earths
Joys, for ye are but earth, and therefore no Joys, but even false Joys, and
foolish, yea, very foolish toys.

114. O my soul, my soul, awake, awake, and see them, their deformity, their
ugliness, their dung, and dunghill likeness to those savory, sweet, pleasant,
and delightsome pleasures that thou give out of the Garden, the Orchard, and
the Fountain of pleasures that are in thy Palaces.

115. Ah how does that heart leap and rejoice when it enjoys thee, O God,
wholly, when it enjoys thee only; how willing, ah how willing is it to be
divorced, separated, and banished from all things, whatever, that are out of
thee, and besides thee,

116. And how unwilling is it, ah how unwilling that the World, and the things
of the World, should have again re-entrance there, where thou, Lord, have been,
for it cools that warmth, it freezeth that beat, it quenches that fire, it
puts out those flames that did so warm, heat, burn and flame in the heart, that
is now (as the fire under ashes) and as the flame in the smoke, it is not
discernable.

117. How, ah how is the heart, by the World, and the things of the World,
carted, as it were, away, and drawn by great force from thee O God, and thy
good: From feasting at thy Table of dainties, to take and taste, and feed on
those dirtie, hoggish, brutish, earthly husks, or earths husks, which cannot
solace nor satisfy it for a moment with any true delight of taste, or
enjoyment.

118. How lazy, sluggish, cold, faint, feeble, and weary is the heart when it
is taken off from enjoying thee, O God, who art its all, even all its Joy.

119. When it must, ah when it must again leave Heaven (as it were) and the
delicacies thereof, of liberty, freedom, peace, rest, joy, riches, honors and
pleasures, and come down from thence, and dig and delve, hew wood and draw
water, be a slave, as it were, to its worst and most cruel Enemy, at least not
to be altogether free, and therefore unquiet, restless, sad, poor,
contemptible, and full of grief.

120. How does, ah how does that heart that truly enjoys thee, O God, with
Jacob, say truly, feelingly, knowingly and certainly, that it has all, even
all honors, riches and pleasures, that are to be had on earth, or in Heaven?

121. How, ah how do such spurn away, kick at and fly from all other things, as
if they had poison in the head, and a sting in the tail, even as from monsters
that have no mercy?

122. Such, ah such a heart cannot, no, no, it cannot satisfy it self with
these satisfying satisfactions, unless he be, ah unless he be always, as it
were, drowned in them, and swallowed up into them; and because he cannot
contain them, therefore, ah therefore he desires to be contained by them.

123. How willingly, ah how willingly would such a one be poor in the world to
have and possess these? Ah these true, indeed, true riches, and to live ever in
disgrace to be thus graced, and to be made lower than the lowest of men: To be
thus high and lifted up above all these high low things here below, how
willingly, ah how willingly would he still live in contempt, and be flouted,
derided, scorned and sco^t at among and by men, to be thus honored by God, and
honorable among the blessed; How willingly, ah how willingly would he be ever
banished from earths home, to be thus brought home to enjoy what is at home in
Heaven, and to feed on the unpleasant, sour bitters of losses, crosses and
afflictions; to drink only of these sweet pleasant streams, and rivers of
pleasures that flow continually and abundantly from Gods right hand.

124. This, Ah this is to be brought out of Egypt, and over the red Sea, and
from his weary and long journeying in the wilderness, to inherit a quiet and
peaceable possession, in that true Heavenly Celestial Canaan, flowing always
with Milk and Honey: for here, even here in the flesh, on earth, he enjoys such
and so many joys, as far exceed all that ever he did, or could ask, that ever
he did or could think.

125. Ah Lord, rich in mercy, love, bounty, and great in goodness; above, Ah
much, much above all that can be conceived or spoken, by Men or Angels; set
before me, Ah set before me always on the one hand my unkindness, my sins, my
blackness, soulness, uncleanness, ugliness and deformity, as I am in my self,
from my self, that I may loath, detest, and abhor them, and my self for them,
and because of them, that I may be driven, drawn, and whipped away from them, to
thee, to hate them to love thee, to detest them to adore thee: and on the other
hand, O God, my God, I may always openly, and plainly see thy love and
kindness, yea loving kindness, mercy, goodness, gentleness, patience, and
forbearance, that thereby and therewith, I may be enticed, allured, tied, knit,
glued, fastened, swallowed up, and involved in thee O God, my God, so as I may
never more be divorced, parted or separated from thee, nor thy ways, but may
long for to enjoy thy most sweet and only sweet, and soul satisfying presence,
and Communion all my days; for without thee, and out of thee, all things are
even nothing, but with thee, enjoying thee, we have all things, and want
nothing, and do care for nothing else, nor ask, nor desire nothing, Ah nothing
else, nay cannot think of any thing else.

126. Bless, Ah bless me then, O Lord, my Lord, and my God, who art the God and
Father of Abraham, of Isaac, of Jacob, and of all the blessed, who blessest all
that are blessed, bless, O Lord, bless I most humbly beseech thee in Jesus
Christ all my weak, frail, and unworthy prayers, praises, desires and actions,
make them a blessing so unto me, as that thou may delight to bless me more
and more, not for the satisfying of the flesh, but of the spirit, not of the
body only, but of the soul also, not only the outward, but the inward, Ah the
inward, the inward man: let me be so blessed in soul and body, as that both
soul and body may ever bless and praise thee, in life, in death, and after
death, Amen, Amen.

127. Ah Lord, let me always live in thee, move by thee, and have all my being
from thee, that is, be all, always, in all places and things for thee.

128. Let, Ah let the world, and the things of the world seem to be as they
are, Vanity and Vexation of spirit unto me.

129. Let me delight in thee, O God, only in thee alone.

130. Let me always so live, as I may always be ready to dye, that whenever I
dye, I may be sure always to live, that is to live Eternally.

131. In Heaven, O Lord, where thou do reign, Where is no grief, no loss, but
gain.

132. When that the heart is, as it were in God, or God in the heart, so that
the mind does only mind him. Ah how unwilling is it to mind the world, or any
thing in the world of the world, and how willing, Ah how willing to unmind it
altogether, and to forget it for ever, even for ever, and for ever, how
sweetly, Ah how sweetly does it pass the time away, when all its faculties are
employed and feasted in the contemplation of God, his love, goodness,
greatness, mercy, truth, wisdom and Eternity; how willingly, Ah how willingly
does it shake off, put away, divorce, and separate it self from all things of
these things here below, and does the soul of the heart rejoice, when it is not
molested with perturbations, it does at such a time as this forget these low
things; even all these high things here below, as if he had never thought on
them, as if they were not, nor had never been.

133. Ah how is the heart at rest, and quiet, how calm, how peaceable, how
joyful, I know not how it is, to set it forth as then it is, when it is with
God, in God, me thinks I know not where it is, nor what it does enjoy, such is
its blessed and blessed condition, as I know not, nor am not able to set down
what condition it is, nor how blessed, it is so blessed, I know not what to
call it, nor how to set it forth in that loveliness, in that blessedness that
then it is blessed with; if it then see any Object out of God, besides God, it
sees it not; if it hear any voice, or words, it hears it not; if it speaks (yet
as it were) it speaks not; if it walk it seems to its self as if it walk not,
as if it moved not; if it stands still, it seems not to know it, for even all
its senses and faculties are so much taken up and employed, as it well knows
not, or as it were, cannot express about what it is employed, at least how it
is employed, nor what it does enjoy, such and so great are its joys.

134. And when, Ah when it must leave this sweet study, this Heavenly work,
this blessed employment, this profitable traffic, this honorable business,
this glorious company, these great joys, these pleasant pleasures, and
soul-satisfying satisfactions, and converse again with the men of the world;
how, Ah how irksome, displeasant, uncouth, troublesome, yea noisome and
burdensome is every other thing, every other word, every other business, every
other matter, or concernment of what concernment soever it be; never, Ah never
any loss seemed to him so great, never any man to his esteem, and seeming, fell
from such a high condition, to such a low condition; how willingly, Ah how
willingly would he have his body in any Condition, so that his mind were always
employed in minding this blessed and Heavenly, most Heavenly, and most blessed
Condition; Ah what words, what thoughts, what desires, Ah what gaspings,
gapings, longings, hungrings and thirstings at sometimes; and then presently,
Ah presently how is he filled and satisfied, and yet knows not as it were with
what, nor how, and this he calls a new birth, and a new birth indeed it is, for
he is then all new, and made another man, within and without, for he is in some
measure as it were like God, holy as he is holy, and pure as he is pure, for in
sincerity he desires and aims at holiness and purity, even at pure holiness,
and to be without spot and wrinkle, unblameable, his life is as it were even
hid with Christ in God, Christ is his life; all his life, is to live in him,
with him, for him and unto him; its the end of his aim, and the aim of all his
end to be his, only his, none but his, always his, that he may be ever his,
even and for ever to live that life, and dye that death as may bring him most
glory, as may glorify him most.

In Bourdeaux, Anno 1658.
1. WE may enjoy the world, and all the things of the world, but we must not,
Ah we must not joy in them so, as to make them our joy: use them we may, but
abuse them in the use of them not, we may not; we may possess them, but must
not, Ah we must not suffer them to possess us; esteem them good we may, but our
least good, we must not, Ah not our best good, not our chief, supreme,
sovereign and only good: for that is God only, only God, who is all good, and
all good only, in Heaven nor earth there is none besides him.

2. Seeking as well as finding, knocking as well as opening, asking as well as
giving, is Gods free gift, for he freely gives all things unto all that ask
aright by faith in Jesus Christ, and no good thing will he withold from those
that love him, that love his fear, and fear his love.

3. What is Hell, but thy absence, O Lord, the absence of thy love, and our
living in, and continuing in sin.

4. And what, O Lord, and what is Heaven, but thy love and thy presence, O God,
the continual and everlasting enjoying of thy ever blessed and loving presence,
and our liberty and freedom from sin, to sin no more, but to praise thee ever
and for ever, and thee only, O God, and thee only adore.

5. Grant me, O Lord God, this one thing, this one thing only, to enjoy thee,
and that I may always make thee my only joy, and to sin no more willingly, with
my will, either in thought, word or deed, but to live the life of the
righteous, to and for, thine honor, praise and glory.

6. Whose sins the Lord forgives, he forgets, whom he has pardoned he will
save, where he loves, he lives, and will ever live there in love; those that
are beloved, shall be ever his beloved, for he has loved them ever, and will
love them ever.

7. The fire of Gods Love are the fiery flames, in which all his children
desire to live, for out of them they cannot live; life is to them death, yea
much worse than any death, and any death they would willingly, Ah most
willingly choose to live this life.

8. Our fitting here for Heaven by sanctification, which is holiness, is an
evident, sure, and certain token, and sign that Heaven is fitted and prepared
for us; for as without holiness no man shall see God, so being made holy, he
shall be sure to see God; that is, to possess him, who is Heaven, eternal life
and happiness; where holiness is, there God is, he dwells and makes his
continual abode, where holiness abides and dwells.

9. O God my God, from whom every good and perfect gift does come, give, O give
I most humbly beseech thee, in Jesus Christ, unto me, a holy heart, according
to thine own heart, that it may be thine, and that thou may delight in it to
make it thy delight, and be pleased to live in it here, until thou shall bring
me to live with thee, and in thee, and to thee, and for thee, for ever, and
ever.

10. What a stinking Carrion is man? Ah what a most deformable thing is man?
when God is not with him nor in him, so much an Enemy he is to himself, that he
always labors to destroy himself, and to all others that he rejoices to kill
those for whom Christ died to give life, even eternal life.

11. Ah Lord, thou know that my Love (through thy Love) is such unto the
brethren, that I even many times wish and desire I could empty my self, that
is, what of God is in me, into them, that they might be so filled with him, as
to know him, love him, fear him, choose him, prize him, and joy and rejoice in
him, and seek him and his presence, with eagerness, hungring and thirsting,
pantings, gapings and groanings, and never let him be at rest, until he has
assured them, that he is theirs and they are his.

12. Gods blessed, gracious and most glorious presence, or Communion with him,
is our Vintage, our Harvest, our nuptial feast, our Canaan, flowing with milk
and honey, our Garden of Spices, where we sit under the shadow of his wings,
and his fruit is pleasant to our taste, he is all our good things, and our good
things always and only, all our springs are in him and from him.

13. Ah what true joy, and what great joy, has that Soul that enjoys God
truly, knowingly, and feelingly, that says, I know that he is mine, and I am
his.

14. He must needs be always full of Joy, that is filled with the Joy of the
Holy Ghost.

15. Such, Ah such, receive Christ willingly and cheerfully at all times, as
Zacheus did, and for his sake, are content to part with all to the poor, and to
become poor, vile and contemptible, etc. and with blessed Simeon, they embrace
him with their whole heart, as their Salvation, and with Jacob say, knowingly,
that they have all; and that they care for nothing else at all; for indeed they
have all they would have, that they even can desire and crave, for he is their
well being, their entire satisfaction, and full and whole contentment, their
joy being full, when they thus enjoy him.

16. Ah Souls labor to live to Christ, for if ye live for him, and to him,
then, Ah then ye live in him, and then ye live indeed, your lives are hid with
Christ in God, and when he shall appear at his second and sudden coming in
Glory, ye shall also appear with him.

17. No man is so willing, or can be, to receive Christ, as he is to give
himself, witness his life, and his death, and his now living, continually
making intercession for us; See John 15, 16, and 17. Chapters, none is, or can
be so hungry, but he is able, and many times does, suddenly resatiate him; none
is, or can be so empty, or hunger-starved, but he is able, will, and many times
suddenly does, fill with unspeakable joy and rejoicing.

18. Give, O Lord, give so thy self to me, as I may be ever emptyed of my self,
and filled only with thee, with thy blessed, most blessed self; that I may, O
Lord, be blessed in life, in death, and after death, and all I beg, in and
through Jesus Christ, my blessed, only Savior and Redeemer.

19. God gives not only space to repent, (...) grace to repent.

20. Repentance is from God, not from man, man of himself can do nothing that
is good, no not of himself, as of himself, think a good thought, all our
sufficiency is from Gods all sufficiency.

21. Sin betrays us, deceives See here the ugliness, baseness, and vileness of
sin.
us, beguiles us, undoes us, wounds us, stabbs us, poisons us, kills us, hells
us, damns us, devils us; of God-like, it makes us Devil-like, like the very
Devil; yea to be as it were, a Devil, to love sin as he loves it, to favor it,
to plead for it, to lie in its behalf, to swear falsely, that its falsity is
truth, that its ugliness is beautifulness, that its deformity is fairness, that
its blackness is whiteness, that its bitter is sweet, that its hatred is love,
that its wiles, and deceits, are truth and uprightness, that its poverty is
riches, that its contempt is honorable, that its ignominy is glorious, and
that its Hell is Heaven, the best Heaven, yea the only Heaven, that there is no
other Heaven desirable, to be desired, loved, chosen, embraced, or sought for;
Sin Metamorphoseth the heart, and makes it like the Devils heart, unclean,
unholy, filthy, abominable, detestable, tempting others to sin, and delighting
and rejoicing, when through their temptation they are overcome, and made like
them, to like, love, cherish, and take pleasure in sin, and go willingly along
with them, to commit all manner of sin, uncleanness, and filthiness, with
hungring, thirsting and greediness; sin shows it self to be what it is not,
contrary to what it is, as light is to darkness; for it says it is good, yea
and the best good, the chiefest good, the only good, the superior and the
sovereign good, that there is none like it, none so good, when indeed and in
truth, it is nothing but evil, all evil, the worst evil, yea the only and all
the evil, and basest evil, only to be detested, hated, abhorred, abominated and
destroyed, sin allures and overcomes, but by showing out, and putting forth
false Colors, not its own, its food starves the Soul, its riches impoverisheth
it, its robes show plainly the souls nakedness, its beautifulness and
gloriousness show the souls deformity, vileness and baseness, wretchedness and
unworthiness; sin is the only Hell, which racks, tears, rends, and strikes
through the soul with a fiery poisoned dart, that makes the wound uncurable,
only the blood of God (man) (man God) can cure it, can heal this deadly;
otherwise uncurable, wound; sin is that intolerable burden that presses down
into that nethermost Hell, that casts into that Lake burning with fire and
brimstone, unquenchable; sin is fuel to that fire, so as it cannot be put out;
sin keeps alive that worm that ever gnaws and will never dye, but causes the
soul thus to live in torments, tormented eternally.

22. O God, my God, heal me, help me, succor me, comfort me, sanctify me, and
save me, that I may appear before thee, and in thy sight, spotless and
unblameable, without wrinkle, beautiful and comely through thine own comely,
transcendent, beautiful beautifulness, that I may, O God in Christ, comprehend
that I am comprehended by thee, that thou live in me, and I in thee, that
thou art mine, and I am thine, that I may* Ah that I may henceforth, and for
ev(...) in thy love, love and adore thy love, and give thee, O God, and give
thee all my love, and my all, for this thy love (through grace) thy most
gracious and free gift, in thus accounting, and making me lovely.

23. He that lives in Christ is a new Creature, and he that is a new Creature
lives in Christ.

24. All old things are past away, and behold all things are become new.

25. His life is new, for he now loves all truth, because his love is true.

26. If he thinks or does any evil, it is not what he would, but that which he
would not, either do or think.

27. The law of God is so written in his heart, that with his whole heart, he
desires to keep his whole law.

28. His joys are so great, and his rejoycings so many, that they make him even
to suppose that he is in Heaven, and to believe that Heaven is in him.

29. He feels Gods loves to be so true, and so truly nigh him, as he values all
love besides, not worth the loving nor the thinking.

30. His soul is so carried away aloft on this high Tide on this full Sea, that
he swims with ease, pleasure, delight, joy, and full contentment, against all
the streams and strong current of the worlds affections, and the fleshes
delights and desires.

31. Though they were but a moment before so violent and strong, that they
carried him down, even head long, which scared and affrighted him so, as if the
time of deliverance had been far off; he durst not, Ah he durst not, presume to
imagine that such a calm was so nigh at hand; sinful fleshly motions and
affections, did in a manner delight him, that he even did as it were allow its
reign (and permit) at least would almost have connived and winked at the
beginnings of evil, though he well, Ah though he well and clearly foresaw the
Consequences to be very great, and greatly dangerous.

32. But on a sudden, Ah on a sudden, how did, Ah how did all these tentations
vanish away, how slighted, Ah how much slighted, how trampled on, Ah how much
trampled on, how cast aside, Ah how cast aside, how trampled and trodden under
feet, how soon, Ah how soon was the memory thereof forgotten; and how sweet, Ah
how sweet was its forgetfulness, delightful its divorce, and joyful its
destruction.

33. And how willing, Ah how willing, O Lord God, thou only know, that soul
is, that thus possesses thee, and is possessed by thee to live, Ah ever to live
in this possession, and to be for ever and thus ever possessed by thee.

34. The worlds chief joys are then but mere and foolish toys; he would not,
no nor cannot give a look on them, they are so barren, so unfruitful, so empty,
so sottish, so brutish to such an enlightened understanding, that he cares not
to understand, nor consider what they are.

35. Ah how, how does he wish it might be ever thus with him, and that he might
be thus ever, senceless and dead to the worlds all, and account all i^s all,
always nothing at all, nay make no account of it, no not so much as think of it.

36. When that the soul is, Ah when that the soul is thus wrapped up in Gods
love, when she is thus emptied as it were into him, and filled with him, how is
she, Ah how is she at rest and ease, how calm, how tranquil, how quiet, how
rich, how honorable, and how refresht and delighted, how has she, Ah how has
she all her desires, and does not, nor cannot desire more; Ah what peace, what
felicity, and what praises, and giving of thanks, how does she, Ah how does she
forget the evil that is past, and rejoices in the good that is present.

37. How is the world, and the things of the world cast out of doors, and how,
Ah how are the doors of all his affections opened, to let in his God to enjoy
him, and to make him his all, and his only joy.

38. Ah my God, go on, go on my God, my God, to Conquer, Triumph, and prevail
over all the lusts and affections which are yet within me, unsubdued, uncast
out, unthrone them, O Lord, unthrone them, and trample them all, O Lord, all,
both the great and the small under thy feet, in the greatness of thy wrath and
fury, that they may be utterly destroyed, and never more come near me to hurt
me, or destroy my poor soul, who cleaves to thee, who sticks fast to thee, who
desires to hold thee, and never, Ah never to let thee go; Ah that I could, that
I could thus live with thee, and in thee ever, and depart from thee never, O
Lord, never, never, see Psalm. 28.

39.
Great is the goodness of the Lord,
to those that fear his name:
And to all those that keep his laws,
and delight in the same:
For they shall see him with great joy,
and shall his honor speak:
Their joy shall be to laud his name,
and he shall make them great.
40.
Oh give your selves to me, says he:
and I will be your guide:
And you shall in my Laws remain,
for I will you delight:
To walk in them you shall have hearts:
for all your joy shall be,
To live to praise my holy name,
the Lord of Hosts (says he.)
41.
Go forth with joy, both evening and morn:
and let your praise redound:
Oh clap your hands and greatly joy,
for that you have him found:
For having him, you have that all,
that mighty all always:
There is none else deserves like fame,
as his Eternal praise.
42.
O come into his Courts always:
and therein rest you still:
Be glad and mightily rejoice,
when that you do his will:
To do thy will is all my joy,
and all that I desire:
Ah give me grace to do it still,
and nothing else require.
43. Ah great God, how great is thy love, and how lovely, Ah how lovely is thy
greatness.

44. What have I, Ah Lord my God, what have I, when I have thee not? and what
have I not, when O Lord God, I have thee?

45. How low, Ah how low are all these high things here below, to those high,
most high and glorious things of Heaven which the soul enjoys even here on
earth, in the flesh, when that it has Communion with God, and enjoys him in
the Spirit.

46. Of what, and how little account and esteem, does he account and esteem of
all Companies, of Friends, Children, Father, Mother, or the Wife of his bosom,
when he can, or may enjoy the company of his God, he will not, nor cannot then
consent to converse with flesh and blood, when he may, when he can by the
spirit, through the spirit speak to God, and hear him answer him. Ah how the
soul at such time is satisfied, delighted, ravished, filled and comforted; how
quiet, how peaceable, how willing, cheerful and glad to obey all his will.

47. And how detestable, hateful, loathsome, ugly, filthy and abominable, (at
such times especially) are all lusts, all affections, worldly and fleshly, are
all sins, of any rank, though never so little, though never so sweet, near or
dear, he hates all, both the great and the small.

48. When that a soul enjoys that blessed blessedness of Communion with God, it
will not, Ah it will not have Communion, fellowship, or converse with any other
Creature or thing, he will not mind any thing else, nor suffer any thing else
to come into his mind.

49. He is then so stuffed, as it were, and so full, filled with God, and the
joys of his grace, that he is divorced, emptied, and outed (as it were) of all
other things, yea, all things are so much out of him, that is, out of his
heart, out of his mind, out of his memory, out of his affections, his desires,
his will, his love, or his liking, that his joy is augmented greatly that they
are so outed of him, for then only he says: Now I have what I would have, yea,
all that ever I did desire or crave, for my God is to me all things, and much
better than all other things.

50. Ah, Lord, bury me, I most humbly beseech thee, thus in thy self, that I
may be dead to all other things, to all things out of thee, and besides thee;
let me, Ah let me so possess thee, and be possessed so by thee, as I may only and
always mind thee, and have thee only and always in my mind. Let love to all the
pleasures of the flesh, though lawful, be low, poor, icy, cold, and frozen to
me, that I may flee from them all to be heated by the fire of thy love, to live
in those blessed Sacred flames, which is the life I desire to live, for out of
them I cannot live as I would; life is to me death, and death would be a sweet
life, delivering me from many deaths.

51. Suffer me not, Ah suffer me not, O Lord, to love any thing else, how
lovely or lawful soever it may be, if it hinder or lessen never so little my
loving of thee, but bet me only choose, prize, esteem, and delight in thy love,
and to walk worthy of it, by all well-pleasing, rejoicing, to do thy holy will
with my whole heart, mind, and will.

52. Such, and so great is thy love and thy goodness, O Lord, that thou
delightest to make us good, and then delightest in our goodness; thou
delightest to give us grace, and then delightest in our graces; thou delightest
to make us holy, and then delightest in our holiness; thou delightest to make
us perfect, and then thou delightest in our perfection; thou delightest to make
us obedient, and then thou delightest in our obedience; thou delightest to make
us lovely, and then thou take delight in our loveliness; thou delightest, Ah
thou delightest to make us such as thou would have us to be, and then thou
take great delight in the work of thine hands, even in thine own handiwork.

53. Ah our great, most great God, how greatly great is thy greatness! How
greatly good is thy goodness! how greatly true is thy truth! how greatly just
is thy Justice! how greatly mighty is thy might! how greatly lovely is thy
love! how greatly beautiful is thy beautiful countenance! how greatly, Ah how
greatly sweet are all thy Sweets! how greatly delightful are all thy delights!
how pleasant, Ah how pleasant are all thy pleasant things! with thee, O God, is
fullness of all joy, unspeakable joy, and from thy right hand flow pleasures for
evermore.

54. Ah the joys, the joys even in this worlds joys, when God is in them, and
comes with them, and when in that, therein alone, we take and make all our joy.

55. God many times is so gracious, as he takes us napping, that is, gives us
grace when we sought it not; yea, gives us himself, many times, when we seek
him not, when we think not of him.

56. How does he many times measure out unto us, and shower down upon us such
measure of mercy, even when we never measured the sweetness, nor the greatness
of what we received, much less of that which we did not, of that which we could
not expect.

57. Ah how much above all things is our God even in the want of all things, of
all this worlds all! that soul, Ah that soul that has him, finds not, nor
cannot find any want at all.

58. But wanting, Ah wanting him, in the midst of all we have nothing, even
nothing at all, but want all, even all, in the very enjoyment of all this
worlds all.

59. O God, our God, thou fillest us many times so full that we even flow over
with thy fullness, even then, many times, when we see our selves, find, feel,
and know our selves most empty, and many times thou causest us to bear and
bring forth most fruit, even then when we think and see our selves most barren;
we have thee, O God, we have thee many times most when we think that we have
thee least, and thou art nighest us when we think, Ah when we think that thou
art farthest off from us, such a good God is our God.

60. How much better is it to be a Lazarus, to beg at a Dives's door, than be a
Dives, and suffer a Lazarus to beg at our doors, and not to give him of our
goods.

61. How much better is it to have nothing at ^ll of this worlds all, then to
have this worlds all, and give of it, Ah and to give of it unto others nothing
at all.

62. How much better is it to feed on thee, O God, and to have nothing else to
feed on, than to feed on all things else, and not to taste of thee, of thine
own sweet, blessed, most blessed, and most sweet self, O God in Christ, who art
the souls only food by faith.

63. Having thee, O God, we are soon filled, yea, feasted and solaced with all
delicious dainties: but feeding on all other things, and not tasting, O God, of
thy pleasant things, they have all no taste at all.

64. O God, thou know I would most willingly be, Ah most willingly I would
be a child, yea, a very fool in wisdom for the world, or of worldly wisdom, for
to get or keep earthly things, to be an old man in Christ, to learn, know,
feel, and keep spiritual things. Ah if I could always walk, talk, and live in
the Spirit, and obey the Spirit, I would account all other joys and wisdom very
toys, and mere foolishness.

65. To forget all things out of God, and besides God, and to mind him so, as
to have nothing else in my mind, this, Ah this is my longing desire, and I
trust it will continue in me through grace, and augment until I have all I
would have, which is my Christ, my Christ, who is my God.

66. Take all this worlds all, ye men of the world, give me my God, my God, and
I will never ask yours, your God: But yet I would that ye had mine, that my God
were your God; that my Portion were all your Portion also, and that we might be
ever brethren.

67. Let me, Ah let me be blind (as it were) to see beauty in no beauty out of
thee, O Christ, dumb to hear no voice but thine, Ah the still sweet voice of
thy Spirit, and senseless to feel no pleasure, but in those things, O God, as
are pleasing, precious, and dear in thy sight; lame, so as I may not walk after
any other thing but thee my God, my God, so that I may be only thine, and none
but thine, at all times, and in all places, companies and things.

68. He that has not tasted of the sweetness of God, even of those sweet
sweets that God gives to Souls, knows it not, and therefore desires it not;
but Ah, he that feeds on them, and has been resatiated with them, he finds
no sweets like them; nay all other pleasant things, unpleasant, and all other
sweets bitter in comparison of these his sweet, most pleasant sweets.

69. Being with God, having God, enjoying God and Communion with him, a dungeon
is to him a Palace, bread and water is good cheer, to lie on the ground; the
earth his bed, the heavens his canopy, and the trees root his pillow, is as a
bed of down, as curtains of gold, and a pillow of wool; nay in flames of fire,
or on a rack, he can lie softly, and sing sweetly, so he do but hear the still
sweet voice of God speaking peace to his Soul, and bidding it to be of good
cheer.

70. There is no company like to no company, to be alone with God, with God
alone; if ever it be satisfied, it is then satisfied, to speak with him, to
him, and to hear God answer him by his Spirit in love; Ah the lovely discourse,
converse, delight and joy, which makes a man not to know where he is, nor
whether he be in the flesh or Spirit, he is at such times so spiritual.

71. Who can, Ah who can tell, or set forth, nay meditate what, how good,
great, loving, gracious, merciful, beautiful and abundant is the loving
kindness, the kind Love of God to his children and servants? or set forth the
sweetness and greatness of his gifts of Grace.

72. He ravisheth them, he fills them, he feeds them, he cloatheth them, he
solaceth them, he enricheth them, he gives them such pleasures, and joys as
eye has not seen, as ear has not heard, nor as no heart can conceive; this
honor does the Lord to those whom he loves, to all his Saints.

73. He makes them to triumph in, and over all adversity and prosperity; in
sickness and in health, in places and conditions; he is always nigh at hand to
those that unfeignedly love him, and fear him, and that tremble at his Word.

74. He causes his goodness to pass before them, and proclaims (as with an
audible voice) that he will be ever and for ever their God, and their Guide,
their Sun, and their Shield, their Peace, and their everlasting Portion; that
he will never leave them nor forsake them, but always and ever own them for his
own, and so stand by them, and live and dwell in them; that no evil shall come
nigh them to hurt them, or to do them the least harm, but every thing shall
always work together for his own glory and their everlasting good.

75. Thus they that honor him he will honor, they that fly to him shall find
succor and help, and be brought out of all dangers, for his own mouth has
spoken it, which is to me much more by much, than ten thousand thousand
witnesses.

76. Ah Lord, I most humbly beseech thee, keep me so close unto thee, as I may
always touch thee, feel thee, hear thee, so as I may know thee by thy name,
that is by thy doings, by thy gracious, most gracious dealings, by thy
wonderful, by thy most wonderful gracious actings in my Soul, and heart, and
mind, and will, and affections, that it may be all thine, and only thine, that
thou may not only, O God, be in all my thoughts always, but always all my
thoughts, desires, love, liking and longing.

77. Fill me, O Lord, fill me with love to thy Laws, that I may delight in
them, yea make the keeping of them my whole and chief delight.

78. Fill me, O God, with thine own goodness, that I may be good, with thine
own Justice that I may be just, with thine own righteousness that I may be
righteous, with thine own mercy that I may be merciful, with thine own truth,
that I may be truly true, with thine own Love, that I may be lovely loving
thee in truth, with thine own fear to fear thee, with thine own Faith to
believe in thee, and to lay fast hold upon thee, with thine own beauty, O Lord,
to make me comely and beautiful, with thine own gloriousness, to make me
glorious, with thine own transcendent shining faithfulness, that I may be
faithful unto thy holy Laws all my whole life.

79. Thou have, O God, thou have, for which I shall never cease to laud and
praise thee, promised to keep me by thine own power through Faith unto
salvation, therefore I will not be afraid nor fear any power, no nor all powers
whatever, whether of sin, men or Devils; for I know that they are all weak, and
that thou art strong, they are the conquered, thou O Lord, thou art the
Conqueror, they are all subdued, and thou have, O Lord, subdued them, they are
brought under, and thou rulest over them, they are thy footstool, and thou
tramplest upon them, all their all to thee, O great God, is nothing even
nothing at all, all the Nations of the Earth, are as the drop of a bucket, and
as the dust of the balance in thy sight, with the breath of thy nostrils thou
art able to consume them, and turn them to their first substance (dust)
therefore, O Lord my Lord, I will depend and rely on thee, that thou will do
for thy servant this good, that is so great, even to make, preserve and keep me
faithful unto the death, and then, O Lord, then, in the greatness of thy
eternal and everlasting goodness wilt give me for ever the Crown of eternal
life.

80. How small a thing, how poor a thing, and how low a thing, is and are all
things? if God be not in them, and come not with them.

81. What is it to have all things out of God, and besides God? that is, not to
have him with them, in them, who is all good, and only able to make all things
good unto us.

82 How poor and low are all these high things here below, the riches of the
World, the honors of the World, and the pleasures of the World, to enjoy all
their pleasures and their joys; how foolish is it? and Ah what toys,
considering their fickleness, shortness, and uncertainty; for what is green,
desirable and flourishing, to day, is to morrow perhaps, withered, dry,
loathsome, and all its beauty past away; for who can say of any thing, or of
himself, it shall be to morrow as it is this day?

83. The wicked shall not live out half his days, and how long soever he live,
they will not be half the days he would live, though God should lengthen them
as he did Hezekiah's, for ten years, nay for a hundred, nay make his days as
Methusalem's, all such a time would be but a moment, to eternity; but to live
in the Love and favor of God a man shall dye never, but death shall make him
live for ever and for ever.

84. What a poor, yea despicable poor small thing are Kingdoms, Crowns and
Scepters, and what else, as humane Learning, the wisdom of men, man's wisdom;
yea though a man could know more than Adam, or Solomon knew, though he could
know all things that are, and that perfectly too, that are out of God, and
besides God, what, Ah what were all this learning, knowledge, or wisdom, but
folly, mere foolishness, in comparison of the knowledge of the Spirit,
Spiritual knowledge, to know in Spirit and in Truth, Jesus Christ, and him
crucified, to be our Christ and our Jesus; Paul accounted all other wisdom
folly to this, and so blessed be our God do I; he desired to know no other
thing, but only this one thing, no more do I; Let all other knowledge in me
perish, so this augment and continue, I shall not, I am sure, grieve, be sad,
repine, nor sorrowful for its loss, come when it will come, and Ah that it were
come, if God so would.

85. Thy Love, O God, O God, thy Love, thy Love, is the Heaven of Heaven in
Heaven, there can be nothing more lovely or desirable, either there or here;
Let me, O Lord, I beseech thee never leave sighing after it, longing for it,
nor desiring to enjoy it, until I do enjoy it with thy self in thy self, by
possessing thy blessed most blessed self, O sweet Jesus, who art all blessings,
and all blessedness.

86. One look of Love from Christ, will make a man willingly and cheerfullly,
to cast aside, to cast away, all things that hinder his loving of him, though
never so lovely, or lawful, near, or dear unto him; for his Love will
constrain, only to love him again.

87. But how then, Ah how then does, and will that Soul love him, that sees
and knows always, that he is beloved by him, he is fed with his Love, yea
continually feasted with his Love, he is clothed with his Love, all his
garments are Love, his treasure is his Love, his honor is his Love, and his
Love is all his pleasure and his delight, he sees his Love in all things that
he sees, that he enjoys, he is continually with him, and this his sweet,
amiable and blessed presence of Love, his most loving presence, he cannot be
without, when he has him not thus nigh him, he seems to want all things, and
when he has him thus, he has all things, and wants nothing.

88. Such a Soul rowleth, depends, and always rejoices, his heart is only
made glad by his delightful approaches, and indwellings; so as he esteems no
life like to this life, of living in him, to him, and sor him; and when, Ah
when all other Subjects, and Objects how loving, or lawful soever at other
times, are outed of his mind, memory, heart and affections; how glad is he? how
does he rejoice, and leap and skip, and sing for joy, that he is with him
alone? that he enjoys him only, that nothing hinders, nor molests their sweet
Intercourse, their sweet Embraces, their mutual Delight, Joy and Love.

89. Love cannot endure to be molested, when it has what it would have, there
is none so rich, so happy, so honorable as he, that is thus loved by God, and
lives always in his love, and is by him, from his love, made to walk worthy of
his love; for such is Gods love, that he accepts the willing will that is in
us, for the working deed, when that it is upright, true, real and sincere.

90. On Christ, the King of love, the sovereign tie and chain of love, thy love
is so lovely, so shining, so transpiercing, so bright, so burning, so
conquering, so consuming that all other loves are consumed at the very approach
of thy love; at thy coming they fly away, they are not heeded, minded,
remembered, nor thought on any more, nay to forget them all what ever they be,
brings joy, even such joy as is unspeakable, for then the soul and body, and
all the faculties and members thereof are filled with thee, and thy joys which
are such as no tongue can tell, nor no heart conceive, thou do so much excel,
O Lord, thou do so much excel, as thus to enjoy thee, Oh thou our Sovereign,
best, and superior good: the soul answers; Ah let it thus be ever with me,
let me be thus ever with thee, O Christ, with thee, with thee, let me, Ah let
me never go from thee, be absent from thee, for there is nothing in Heaven that
I desire like unto thee, or in all the Earth in comparison of thee, make me but
as one of thy hired Servants, that I may always hear thee, see thee, and abide
in thy blessed, most blessed presence, for in thy presence is always all joy,
unspeakable joy, yea fullness of all joy that is unspeakable, and from thy right
hand flow continually all pleasures for evermore.

91. Thus is the soul wrapped up in Christ that enjoys him, he asks, he seeks,
esteems, prises, nor desires no other joys, no other Heaven, no other
happiness, no other blessedness, than thus always to enjoy him, he is at rest,
at ease, he has all that he would have, that he can ask or crave, yea much
above all that ever he did ask or think, so much is Christ above all things,
and more than all things to them, and to all them, in whom he lives in love,
and loves to live, and the soul breaths out for more of his love, that it
may love him more and more.

92. Look, O man, into this Glass, and thou shall plainly A spiritual soul
Looking-glass, or a glass to see the soul, whether it be Spiritual or Carnal.
see thy inner man, the heart of thy soul, or the soul of thy heart, whether it
be or not a heart according to Gods heart, or a heart according to thine own
heart and the Devils, thou shall plainly see whether thou art Carnal or
Spiritual, dead in sin, or alive by grace, a faithful Servant of Jesus Christ,
or a slave to thine own vile, base lusts and affections, of sin and Satan,
whether thou art a Member of Christ's Mystical body betrothed unto him by grace,
or still a Member of Satan's vile body, made one with him by sin, whether or no
thou have the divine nature in thee, or still remainest in thine own fleshly,
sinful, wretched nature, and this thou may easily see and know by examining
of thine affections, what thou love most, prizest, choosest, delightest in,
think on, and esteemest most, what is most the end of thy aim, and the aim
of thy end, after what thou most runnest, pantest, breathest, gapest, hungrest,
and thirstest after, what is most in thy thoughts, yea what thou make thy
thoughts most, what are thy inward longings, if thou choosest all his ways,
freely and universally, the hard and rough, to the flesh, as well as the easy
pleasant and deligthful, and that with pleasure and delight, and rejoycest to
walk in them, and to make them, and to make them thy delight, if his yoke be to
thee easy, and his burden light, if it be thy meat and drink to do all his
whole and holy will on earth, as it is done in Heaven; if it be the Heaven that
thou desire on this side Heaven, thy earthly Heaven, thy Heaven on earth, to
do his whole and holy will on earth, as it is done in Heaven; Consider,

93. Art thou born again, not in the flesh, but in the spirit, that is
transformed, changed, and made a new Creature throughout in spirit, soul and
body, in thought, word and deed, are all old things put away, wholly and
totally, cheerfully and willingly, with consent, delight, applause, joy,
rejoicing and thanksgiving, and are all things become new; have thou a new
mind, new heart, new desires, new endeavors, new will and affections, at all
times, in all places, companys and things, thoroughly, seriously, circumspectly,
faithfully, sincerely, ardently, continually and universally, that is
prevailingly against all sinful fleshly desires, lusts and affections, do
thou find all evil inclinations mortified, have they all received a deadly
wound, do they all stink in thy Nostrils, as they do in Gods, and are they all
loathsome unto thee, as they are unto him, and detested by thee, with thy whole
heart as by God, that is in truth and sincerity of heart, and as well, and as
much secret, airy, vain foolish thoughts, that disturb thy peace, and thy
Communion with God, as open sins; so that Gods nature, divine Image and
resemblance is most of all dear, pretiou^, and delightful unto thee, and thou
labourest with tooth and nail to preserve it, with a continual, heedful,
watchful, careful care; so that to do good is habitual in thee, yea as it were
natural, it is all thy delight, joy, rejoicing, end, and aim: do thou
heartily hate all the former evil that was in thy heart, loathing, detesting,
and abhoring the sins of thy life heretofore, thy heretofore sins, are all
their sweets become to thy taste bitter as gall and wormwood, are all their
pleasures, altogether unsavory, unpleasant, and so loathsome, as thy very heart
rises against them, and loatheth the very thoughts of them, do they appear
unto thee all, both the great and the small in their own black colors, filthy
and ugly hue; is there no one lulled in thy bosom, hugged in thine arms,
embraced in thine heart, pleasant in thine eye, sweet to thy taste, or winkt or
connived at, as a small one, or but as one, as a dear one, even near and dear
as a right eye, or a right hand, but are they all, both great and small, known
or unknown, secret as well as open, like unto thee, exceeding, yea above
measure loathsome and sinful; do thou watch against them always, and not
suffer any one when he peeps in, to come in; do thou fly from them all, as
thou would do from the Devil, from Hell, and from the greatest of Gods
Judgment, and Eternal wrath, are they to thee as a Hell, yea as the worst of
Hell in Hell, do thou feel the burden of but one sin, though not committed
altogether willingly, or with delight, to be heavier than the whole earth, and
had rather have all the Rocks and Mountains in the whole world to fall on
thee, to lie upon thee, than one willing sin committed to lie upon thee; and is
sin thus hated, loathed, detested, and abhorred by thee, because it is sin,
because it is a breach of Gods holy Laws, and divine Commandments, which are
altogether all holy, just, and good, because they disturb thy peace and thy
communion with God, and are contrary to thy nature in truth, as to Gods nature,
and because they make thee to lose thine image and likeness of God and Christ,
and converse with the Spirit of grace, who is thy sole and souls comfort and
comforter, and for that they make thee vile in Gods eyes, and disobedient unto
him for whom thou art and were created, and for whom, and unto whom thou
desire to live, to love, to fear, to honor, and to obey for ever, and for
ever.

94. Art thou conformable to Christ thy head, thy husband, thy Lord, and thy
King? Does he wholly reign and rule in thy heart, with consent, applause,
delight, joy and rejoicing, and in, and over all the faculties of thy soul, and
members of thy body? Art thou holy as he is holy, pure as he is pure, and
perfect as he is perfect, that is, sincere in truth, truly sincere in all thy
actions and affections? Art thou within as thou seem to be without, and do
thou labor much more to be approved, applauded, esteemed and honored by God,
and in his sight, than by men and in their sight? Do thou stick only to him,
cleave to him, and hold him fast, with true, faithful, sincere, ardent,
continual, and loving embraces, and choosest him only for thy choice, for thy
chief Superior, best and sovereign good, for thy Heaven, for thy happiness,
and for thy felicity, peace, rest and blessedness? Is there nothing in Heaven
so dear and precious unto thee as is thy God, thy Christ, nor in all the earth
in comparison of him? Do thou much more love Heaven for God than God for
Heaven.

95. Is Jesus Christ become to thee so great gain, as for his sake thou carest
not what loss thou do sustain, Temporal or Spiritual, so that thou may
live the life of the righteous, to his praise, honor and glory? Thou carest
not what be thy condition, nor where thy place of abode be, nor with whom, nor
what be thy life, nor what thy death be, though poor, hunger-starved, full of
scabs, botches and sores, from the crown of the head to the soal of the foot,
like unto Job, or Lazarus, so as there be no whole place in thee, and though
thou should be (as they were) defamed, vilified, condemned, cast out, scoffed
at, mocked, lie in the dust, on a dunghill, be fed with the dogs, yea, refused
what is given them, even the very Crumbs that fall under other men's Tables, yea,
though thou should be banished, imprisoned, persecuted, scourged, whipped,
tormented, rackt, torn by wild horses, consumed by fire, or drowned in the
depth of the Sea.

96. Can thou choose any of all these, yea, all these, and all other
afflictions whatsoever, willingly, cheerfully and joyfully, for Christ's sake,
and the Gospels, rather than deny thy faith, thy hope, thy love; rather than
commit any sin, rather than do the least evil with consent, approbation,
liking, or choice? Is Christ better to thee than all things? Can thou truly,
cordially and sincerely say, that thou have nothing so dear and near to thee as
Christ's Honor, Crown and Glory is: And whatever be thy Portion here below of
these high low things, thou can willingly with all thy heart and will go from
them all, or be content that all things be taken from thee, Houses, Lands,
Goods, Kindred, Friends, Father, Mother, Wife, Children, and what else,
desiring much rather by much to hold fast thine integrity, with the loss of all
these, than hold fast these and lose thy love, thy light, thy life, which is
thy Jesus.

97. Would thou much rather chose affliction, any affliction, yea, all
afflictions, Temporal and Spiritual, on body and soul, as the children of God,
rather than commit the pleasures of sin for a season, rather than in the least
displease thy Christ, thy Jesus, thy God, thy good, thy Savior and thy
Redeemer for a moment; much rather by much suffer the afflictions due to sin,
than sin and suffer no affliction; for surely a Saints greatest affliction is
sin, sin is the very worst of Hell to him that makes God his best Heaven, the
Heaven of Heaven in Heaven.

98. Do thou feel thy heart heartily to long for the knowledge of God and all
his ways, to love, fear, serve, honor and obey him? And do thou find that
all that thou do is nothing to what thou would, and desire and longest
to do? Thy very best is too too bad, thy most holy things are too too unholy,
and all thine all even nothing at all; thou art altogether ashamed of thy self
that thou art what thou art, and abhorrest thy self in dust and ashes,
accounting thy self (as thou art in thy self) the vilest of Creatures, the
greatest of sinners, and the very worst of the worst of men.

99. And this causes in thee sorrow, shame, grief and astonishment, wondering
that such a God should love such a man, such a worm, such a wretch, such a
miscreant, such a dog, such a sinnner, yea, such a devil as thou art in thy
self? Do thou thus condemn thy self, loath and abhor thy self, and art thus
truly angry with thy self, and ashamed of thy self, and of all thy doings, and
marvellest how thou can find acceptance at such a glorious Throne of grace,
and gracious Throne of Glory; and that God has had so long patience, and that
he did not cut thee off long ago; and give thee thy portion with thy brethren
in Iniquity, Whoremongers, Drunkards, Prophaners of the Sabbath, with the
Covetous, Proud, Boasters, Malicious, Raylers, False accusers, etc. even with
the devil and his angels; and that thou do esteem it a Heaven that thou art
not now in Hell, giving continual Glory to God in Christ that thou were not
consumed and cut off long ago; and that he has not given only space to repent,
but also grace to repent, from all and every sin in thought, word and deed,
even with repentance unto life, never to be repented of.

100. And if thus thou art in sincere truth, I say, if in truth and sincerity
these, or the like, be thy desires, endeavors, life and living, end and aim,
habitually, continually and universally, then art thou what thou should be,
and what God would have thee to be, assure thy self thy heart is upright,
clean, pure, holy and perfect, even according to Gods own holy heart; thou art
a man in Christ, a member of Christ, and surely, surely Christ will assuredly
own thee for his own, and always love thee, and live in thee even as he does in
his own, as he does to those in whom he lives, and whom he loves, and thy
life shall henceforth be hid with Christ in God, so that when he shall appear
at his second and sudden coming in glory, thou shall also appear with him, to
his eternal glory and thine everlasting comfort, joy and eternal salvation.

101. And therefore, O man of God, child of God, son of God, and servant of the
eternal and ever living God, cheer up thy self, and rejoice, yea, I say,
evermore rejoice, for God is thy God, and thy Father, thy Portion, thy Lot, and
thine Inheritance; thou art surely his, and he is as surely thine, and Christ
Jesus will be also thine all, all thine, the way, the truth, and the life to
bring thee unto, and give the possession of eternal life, life eternal, which
he has prepared for thee by his death, and is preparing thee for it by his
life, for he lives to make continual intercession for thee; the holy Spirit of
grace, the Sanctifier and the Comforter is thine, he will guide thee, lead
thee, direct thee, keep thee, and preserve thee unto the end, even in the ways
of all holiness and righteousness, of peace, joy, comfort and consolation,
which are the foretasts and fore-sights of eternal life and salvation, the very
beginnings of the beatifical Vision of glory in glory, and of those ravishing
joys and pleasures prepared and laid up for the Just, before the beginning of
the world was, which are such as eye has not seen, as ear has not heard,
neither has it ever entered into the heart of any man at any time to conceive,
being much, ah much above all that we can ask or think, for there we shall ever
possess and enjoy all joys, unspeakable joys, yea, fullness of all joys and
pleasures for evermore, even God himself, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, who is
all in all, and in all the blessed, to him alone be eternally given all Honor,
Glory, Power, Might, Majesty, Dominion and Thanksgiving, now, and for ever and
ever, Amen, Amen.

102. None but the true children of God can truly love Gods children, they that
are his, will love those that are his, chiefly and most because they are his,
and those most that appear to be his most, and those dearliest that are his
dearest.

103. I will much more, more by much rejoice in an obedient heart, to submit
unto, and to do the whole and holy will of God in all cases, conditions and
places, than to enjoy the wisdom of Solomon, and all the honors, riches,
delights and pleasures of the whole world.

104. Ah Lord, let my heart never be at rest until I find that it does most
willingly, freely, joyfully, and choosingly submit, and acquiesce unto all that
God will, be it what it will, and to say of all things, and in all conditions,
so would I have it.

105. There is surely nothing so delightful unto the heart of a true Christian,
as to do the whole will of God holily and heartily, as to please him by a
sincere, hearty and cheerful obedience universally.

106. Ah the joys, the joys, the true joys, the great joys, yea, the
unspeakable joys, the peace the peace, the comfort the comfort, the solace, and
the rest and quiet that is in the heart of him that fears always (from love)
for it destroys all servile fear, and causes such joy and gladness as passes
all understanding.

107. What, ah what honor is there like that, as truly and sincerely to honor
God! What pleasure, ah what pleasure like that as always to please God! What
joy, ah what joy, like that as always to enjoy God! What happiness, ah what
happiness like that, comparable to that, as to know him to be ours, and we to
be his! What peace, ah what peace like that, as when we know our peace to be
made with the God of peace, through and by Jesus Christ the King and Prince of
peace, witnessed unto us by the continual indwelling in us of the Spirit of
peace, the Sanctifier of our souls, and the Comforter of our hearts? Ah what
comfort, what comfort like unto that, as to find our selves in God, and that
great good God to be in us! What, ah what so sweet, as to feed continually on
these true heavenly sweets here on earth, which are the very sweets of Heaven,
in Heaven.

108. I do now wonder that any man has, or can have any peace a moment, that
has not his peace made sure, or a sure peace made with God.

109. All other quiet, ah how unquiet will it prove in the end, that is not
founded or grounded on this sure foundation, or ground of Gods love in Jesus
Christ.

110. I wonder, Ah I wonder, men are not as it were continually torn in pieces,
with sears, and cares, till all these sears are taken away by a lively living
Faith, and their whole cares cast on Christ.

111. I wonder, Ah I wonder, that terrors do not always terrify them, that
Hells torments do not affright and amaze them, until that they have a sure and
certain confidence, that Christ has redeemed them from it.

112. I wonder, yea I much wonder that any man can call any thing else a good
thing, but only this one thing that is so good, even Christ's goodness, and
that he is mine, and that I am his, even bone of his bone, and flesh of his
flesh, and that I am sure, he has so loved me as to give himself for me, to
dye in my place and stead; So that I am now reconciled thereby unto God, who is
become my Father and my God.

113. I wonder, Ah I much wonder now, that any man can desire to live any other
life, or dye any other death, than to God, and for God.

114. I wonder now, yea I now do very much wonder, that all men do not seek
this one thing necessary, so necessary, to give up themselves, even all their
all unto God, by good works and a holy life, to live to him only by whom they
only live, and for whom only, they are and were created.

115. I wonder, Ah I wonder now, that any other life can give, or should give
us any, or the least pleasure; for thus to live in, for, and to God, is only to
live: and he that thus lives, lives only, and none but such do live; for those,
and all those that live not unto God, are dead, though they be alive, yea
though they do live.

116. The worst of men, and all men, and at all times, wish to dye the death of
the righteous, as Balaam did; but few, Ah few, sincerely desire to live the
life of the righteous: for if they would they might, and be assured to their
eternal and everlasting joy, that if they did so live, they should so dye, and
then so live with God, and in God eternally.

117. Ah let us then not only desire, but also earnestly labor, and endeavor
so to live in this life, as we would live in the after life, when this life
shall be no more; and to hate sin, and love righteousness now, as those do, and
shall then, and as we shall likewise, if we live in God with them; and he that
so loves and hates here, shall ever live in Love for ever hereafter.

118. Let us love the Lord heartily in all things and for all things, knowing
assuredly, that all things that he does unto us, are in Love.

119. Therefore if the Lord strike me, I will rejoice in it, because it is his
hand does it; yea I will therefore mightily rejoice.

120. What ever the Lord does unto me, I will rejoice mightily in it, because
he does it, and because he does it unto me, therefore I know it is best for me,
and I know that his end in it, is, to make me to rejoice.

121. Strike then, O Lord, strike, strike and spare not, either on my body, or
Soul, goods, or good name, when thou will, where thou will, and in what manner
soever thou will, I am ready, most ready, and most willing to praise thee, to
laud, extol, and magnify thee, and to declare that so I would have it, yea
that I would only have it so; for thou know, O Lord, my heart, and therefore
that with my heart I heartily desire to be, and have, what thou will have me to
have and to be, thy will, O God, thy good will, and not mine, let be always
done, in me, and upon me.

122. I desire to live in God only, that I may only live to and for his glory.

123. To glorify God, is true glory, the glory only which is true.

124. To possess God is true riches, the riches only which is true.

125. To get God is to get all; for all things else are nothing, nothing, yea
nothing at all.

126. To be with God is to be free; for all things, Lord, are still in thee.

127. Thou art that all, that only all, that ever was, and ever shall.

128. I have nothing wherein to boast, but in the Love and Mercies of my God,
and of his Mercies and Love I am resolved ever to boast.

129. He that possesses God, possesses all things that he would possess, and
cares not, nor asks not, nor regards not any other possessions.

130. He that fears God rightly, fears no other fears, how dreadful or
fearful soever they be, no not his many great fearful sins, nor death the King
of terrors and fears.

131. He that enjoys God, has all the joys he would enjoy, or can desire to
have; for to him, God is much more by much than all, and above all things that
can be enjoyed.

132. He that loves God truly and rightly, has all that he loves, because he
loves nothing like him, or in comparison o^ him, either in Heaven above, or on
the Earth beneath.

133. He that pleases God by walking wellpleasing before him, has, and he can
desire no other pleasures, for to keep his Laws is all his delight, and the
only thing that brings joy to his heart, and that feasteth his Soul, with
marrow and fatness, yea with all pleasant things.

134. He that thus gives up himself to God, and acknowledges him for his all,
shall have of him (here) as well as hereafter, much, I say much above all that
he is able to ask or think.

135. He that only wills Gods will, has always his own will at all times, in
all places and conditions.

136. He that gives himself to God, may be sure that God has given himself
unto him more sure, and therefore all that God has is his.

137. He that would no other good but God, has God, and therefore all good;
for he that has God sure, has all things else sure he may be sure, for in him
are all things, and from him come all things, therefore to him alone, and unto
none else be only all honor, and all glory for ever and for ever.

138. Ah what a blessed, yea most blessed Heaven is it to walk in the ways of
God, which will assuredly lead us, and bring us to the Heaven of Heaven in
Heaven.

139. To possess God, we must dispossess our selves of our selves.

140. To be filled with God, we must empty our selves of our whole selves.

141. To have God, we must hate our selves, that is all, even all, that is not
of God.

142. To see God, we must put out our own eyes, and not see with them, but with
his eye only, only with his.

143. To feel God, he must be in us, and we must be in him.

144. To know God, we must first know our selves, as we are in our selves,
then, Ah then shall we have our eyes opened to see him, and know him as he is
to be known and seen, which is by faith from love.

145. To hear God, we must resolve to be obedient unto him, then shall we
surely hear his sweet still voice, even of his own spirit within us, saying,
Son be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee, I am thy God, and I will be
thy God and thy guide, for ever and for ever.

146. To fear God, is to walk uprightly in all his ways, esteeming them all
holy, just and good.

147. How, Ah how does the heart of a Child of God open and shut, pant and
gape, hunger and thirst, grieve and groan after the goodness of God, which is
after his likeness, to be like him; for it cannot else be satisfied, no not
with all things, not with Heavens all, or that is on the earth, for God only is
all his good.

148. I had much rather by much, have the grace to please God, than the grace
of spiritual comfort; rather have the grace of Sanctification, than of
Consolation.

149. Let me get and keep my God with the loss of all, and I will account it no
loss, I say no loss at all.

150. The worlds all is nothing, I say nothing at all, to God our all, who is
only all, even all only that is, or can be desired.

151. Surely, surely, the very soul of Religion is to serve God sincerely, and
heartily with our whole hearts and souls.

152. For a little, Ah for a very little which we give to God, he gives much
to us, let us not be niggards then, if we will, or desire to have him
bountiful unto us, and recompense our little with his much, our small with his
all.

153. No man, surely no man ever lost or repented for giving too much to God,
or for doing too much for him, for every mite we rightly give, a Talent at
least we shall receive, thus to love and fear the Lord in truth, is true wisdom.

154. Ah the happiness, the unspeakable great and true happiness to possess
God, and to be possessed by him; if then so great here, Ah how great shall it be,
and will it be hereafter, if the beginning here bring such unspeakable joys,
how unspeakable will they be when begun there, where we know they will never
pass away, or have an end.

155. I had much rather by much, have God with me and in me, and feel it, and
know it, and have nothing else, than to have him and not feel him, and have all
that my heart does or can else desire.

156. When, Ah when I am in his presence, I am so satisfied to the full, that I
ask after no other satisfaction, all other things are not regarded, no nor
thought on, but thought altogether unworthy to be thought on, or in the least
regarded.

157. Possess then, Ah possess then, O God, my God, who art all my good, my
whole heart, mind, thoughts and affections, that I may be all thine, and none
but thine, always thine, and ever thine, even wholly thine, until that thou
have made me such as thou will have me to be, which is holy as thou art holy,
pure and perfect as thou, O God, art, even in all things, in some measure like
unto thee, so be it, O Lord God, so be it, Amen, and Amen.

In Bourdeaux, Anno 1659.
1. IF thou art, O God, my God, I am sure thou will be my guide, and if thou
art my guide, O God, I am sure thou art my God.

2. If, O God, thou go with me, I am sure that all will go well with me; but
if thou go not with me, I am sure that what ever I do will be ill with me,
and for me.

3. If thou art mine, O God, if thou art mine, I am sure I am and shall be ever
thine; but if thou art not mine, so sure, even so sure it is that I am not
thine.

4. If I have thee, O God, for my God, I have all I need to have, but if I have
thee not, I have nothing, (thou know) of all that I desire and crave.

5. Let me then so find thee, that I may feel thee in me, and feeling* may
rejoice with that unspeakable joy, which they only feel and find, that have
found thee and fed on thee.

6. Let all things else what ever they be, pass away, do but thou, O God, with
thine own spirit abide in me, I say ever abide in me; and I shall I am sure
rejoice and be glad that they be all banished what ever they be, and that it be
said of them all they are not, they are not at all.

7. Let me then, O God my God, so have thee, possess thee, find, feel, and
enjoy thee, that my heart may be always upright before thee, and transformed,
and conformed like unto thee, even according to thine own heart, holy, pure,
perfect, spotless and unblameable, that thou may henceforth and for ever,
always and ever, own me for thine own.

8. I love truth in all things, it is only truth that makes all things unto me
lovely; for where truth is, there we may safely and truly say that God is, for
God is truth.

9. Let, O God, always truth abide in me, and I in truth.

10. Truth is my joy, truth is my delight, truth is my food, truth is my life,
truth is to me a continual feast of myrrh, mirth and gladness; truth always
gladdeth my heart, and makes it to rebound upward, to skip and leap as a Kid on
the Mountains, and as a Lamb on the Hills.

11. Truth is to me as a precious Ointment, an eye salve, it is a healing and a
comforting to me always.

12. Truth brings down (as it were) Heaven unto me, and carrys me up again into
it.

13. Truth speaks loud in the ears of my soul, and fills it with joy, and
continual and abundant rejoycings.

14. Truth warmeth my heart at all times, keeps the fire of love, joy and
peace alive that it never goes out.

15. Truth is a Balm to heal all sores, to fill up all scarrs, to make us
without blemish, fair and beautiful.

16. Truth never grows old, but is always young, strong and tender, it keeps us
fast to him, and him fast to us, whom only we desire to hold fast, and never to
let go.

17. Truth has power to weaken all that is amiss in us, to bring it under
until it be conquered finally, and destroyed totally.

18. Truth inflames our hearts, that they are as a fire newly kindled, which
cannot easily be quenched.

19. Truth abounds over all, and makes us to abound likewise, so that we know
both how to want and how to abound.

20. Truth inableth to go beyond all things, for truth brings us home to
possess all things, even to possess God, the God and giver of all things, who
is truth.

21. By truth we are enabled to lead new lives, and to have holy affections
frequent in us, our hearts being set on earth.

22. Truth is lovely, amiable, beautiful, desirable, as the finest gold that
cannot be finer.

23. Truth makes us (unlovely) lovely, beautiful, bright, shining, transparent
and glorious, being a beam, a spark, a coal, a little light of that great
light, in whom we are comprehended, but cannot, Ah cannot comprehend, for he is
altogether incomprehensible.

24. Truth makes us always lovely, fair and beautiful in his eyes, who can
behold no falsity, no evil.

25. Truth is that mantle to cover our many infirmities, and to make us that
with boldness we may approach that glorious Sun, and not be burnt, that
glorious day, and partake of its glory, that will cloud and eclipse the errors
that are yet in us, and make us to feel and to know that we are bound up in
this blessed mantle with his hand that will take care over us and for us, that
no evil any more hurt us.

26. Ah God, the God of truth, and my God, let this truth of thine never depart
from me, nor I from it; let me shine in it more and more, that I may be
resplendent and glorious, always shining in thy sight, that thou may delight
to look upon me, to love me, and to honor me, making me thy delight, in and
through the Son of thy love, and the Savior and Redeemer of my soul, Jesus
Christ the Righteous; let my heart be always a heart of truth, a true heart of
truth, serving thee unfeignedly, and doing always all that I do in truth, from
love.

27. When God is present, there is present all good, for all good is in God,
and from him proceeds nothing but good, he being the best, the chief and the
only good.

28. Accordingly as we enjoy God, our joys abound, increase or decrease.

29. When we possess him, whatever other things we possess, we possess them
not, whatever else we hear, we hear not, whatever else we see we see not,
whatever else we be, we are as if we were not, he being the souls all, even all
that it wills, would, love, or desires, the soul is so glued to him, that it
cannot be taken off by any thing that is either in heaven above, or on earth
below.

30. Who can, ah who can recount, express, tell, or set forth the gracious,
magnificent, transcendent, bountiful bountifulness of our God in Jesus Christ;
its height is too high, its breadth is too broad, its length is too long, and
its depth is too deep. As it is only his own Spirit that can tell what is in
his mind for our good, so it is only they, they only that possess his Spirit
that can comprehend in some measure the sweet Sweets that he gives, that he
pours and showers down into the hearts of his beloved ones.

31.
The joys of heaven are far above,
Unto all those that truly love,
Than all else be, that we do know,
That we taste, that we feel, that we see.
32.
Go on, go on, O God, go on,
To give me thy beloved Son,
Let him be mine, let me be his,
For he is my joy, my peace, and bliss.
33.
Let me in him, and he in me
Be always seen to live and be,
Then when this all shall pass away,
My soul with him shall ever stay.
34. It is unto thee, O Christ, that I come to have of thy self, thy self.

35.
Let the world and devil use all their skill.
I am sure my God will be with me still.
36. I am sure that God will fit and prepare me for all trials and afflictions
whatsoever, either before or in the trial of affliction.

37. Ah Lord, I beseech thee give me this grace, that I may desire grace, pray
for grace, and prize grace here on earth, as I do and shall do glory hereafter
in heaven, for I know that he that has not grace here, shall not have glory
hereafter; and the more grace here, the more glory hereafter.

38. If then I live the life of grace here, I am as sure I shall live the life
of glory hereafter.

39. Methinks it is much too low a thing for a Christian to desire any thing,
either here or hereafter for himself alone. If I desire any thing here,
methinks it is chiefly for others, most of all for others to refesh and comfort
them. I desire to have, that I may have to give; as for my self, any condition,
I praise God, would now fully please me, would now fully content me; yea, I am
fully persuaded that any bitter, yea, all bitters would be to me sweet: in
poverty, I should find riches, in banishment liberty, in dishonor honor, in
contempt applause, in being despised rejoice; and though I had nothing, yet
methinks I should enjoy all things.

40. My God knows how much I desire heaven, but more for his sake than for my
own sake, he knows, that knows all the secrets of my heart, that with my
heart and soul I love him more (much by much) than my self. I am so unlovely to
my self, that I cannot, that I dare not love my self but in subordination to
him, and for him, that I may praise him, that I may prize him, that I may fear
him, that I may love him, ah that I may love him, obey him, and adore him.

41. To love God I am unfit, I am unworthy, because I cannot, ah because I
cannot love him as I would, as I should. Indeed, if thus it were possible for
me to love him, ah how would I delight even in my own love, and love my self,
if that I had such a heart according to his heart, to love him only with my
whole heart, even with a holy heart.

42. But I find my heart so dull, so dead, so cold, so benumbed, so Icy and
Frozen, that there is not that heat left within me (of love) as I would, as I
desire, and as I should have for my God, for my good, for my heaven, for my
bliss, for my rest, for my peace, and for my only joy, all which is my God.

43. Ah my Love, thou art altogether un^ovely, because thou do not, and
because thou can not love as thou should what thou should love, and
because thou love so much too much what thou should not love (thy self) thy
unlovely loveless self.

44. Ah Lord, my Lord, it is thee, it is thee that my Soul with all my heart
would love, and would if it could love none else, love none besides, in
comparison of thee; and thou know, O Lord my God, I desire sincerely, and
would be filled with this grace of Love; bu^ for thee alone, alone for thee,
for thee, my God, my God, who art to me only lovely; let I beseech thee all
other love that is disordinate decrease, that loving these less, I may love
thee more; love thee so as thou requirest and deservest, that is, above all
things in heaven above, or on earth below.

45. I know, O Lord, that thou art with me of a truth, because thy truth is
with me, that is, in me of a very truth.

46. Love from God fills our hearts with sincere and true love for God, or
God's love to us fills us with love for him, his love sweetly constrains us.

47. Ah how light, how light is that heart that is emptied of all sin, being
unburdened of that intolerable burden; for if a wounded heart cannot be born,
ah then when such a heart is made whole, it must needs bring ease, refreshing,
comfort and unspeakable joy.

48. When God is in the heart it may be seen in the face, and perceived by the
words that come out of the mouth; such a luster is on the whole Man, both
within and without, when the presence of God by his Spirit is within, he is
surely beautiful in the eyes of all beholders that delight and desire to
behold the face of God in Jesus Christ, the very Majesty of God (in some sort)
is on such a Soul, and through the glorious light of Christ's gracious face his
face does shine in the sight of God, and all good men.

49. I will make no condition with thee, O God, but only this, that is, to love
thee only in all conditions as my God, and my only good.

50. Ah Lord, I most unfeignedly and humbly beseech thee let me never taste of
this bitter bitter, that is, to find any sin sweet.

51.
But let all sin, even all, oh all,
Be unto me as wormwoed and gall.
52. Ah Lord, I humbly beseech thee never suffer the remembrance of the former
pleasures of sin to please me, but let their remembrance be altogether
displeasing, hateful and detestable, and to be delivered from them; let it be
unto me as the deliverance from Death, and from Hell.

53. Let the fire of thy grace quench totally the heat and fire of all and
every lust, sinful and disordinate affection, that I may henceforth burn only
in the fire of Love to. thy Laws.

54. The true Life of God in a Christian is most of all and plainliest seen by
his hatred to all evil and sin, and by his unfeigned, sincere, ardent, and
continual Love to all that is good; he loves all that is good in all, to see it
though afar off, to hear it spoken of by any whatsoever; but to find it in
himself most of all joys and satisfies him; to see any evil committed, or to
hear any evil spoken by any, troubles and afflicts him; such is his Antipathy
against it, that he will not give it the least healing, or parley, no nor cast
the least glance of an eye to favor it, it is abominable to him in thought,
word, and deed, and in all its circumstances, even in all. And as well has the
whole man all the faculties of the Soul, hatred to the least circumstance of
all ill, as well as to the greatest; but the degree and measure, is according
to the measure and degree, or nature of the ill, but it is alike hated
(sincerely) as well the very least as the very greatest of all. And in the same
manner and measure is his unfeigned Love to all that is good; he thanks, and
praises and prizeth God, for good thoughts, as heartily and sincerely, as for
good words, or actions, because he as plainly sees the true Love of God in the
very least particular, as in the very greatest. And it is the Love of God, which
is his presence in Love, that makes his Soul to leap within him, with joy. When
that the Soul sees his God, it sees all his good, his Heaven, his Bliss, his
Peace, his Love, his Joy, his Rest, his whole and only Delight, Contentment and
Comfort; But in the most good he sees him most, and therefore desires to do
the most good that ever was done, or is possible to be done, and therein he is
best pleased, because that pleases his God best, and to please him is his only
pleasure, all his pleasure, joy and delight only; it is his Heaven, and
therefore he makes it his only happiness.

55. Ah God my God, and my only good, let it be I most humbly and unfeignedly
beseech thee in Jesus Christ, always thus with me, that my soul may be
satisfied, may be solaced, may be refresht and comforted, by thy living in me,
and by my living always in thee, and unto thee, to thine eternal honor, praise
and glory, for thine own glorious and holy names sake, give me this grace, that
I may live this life here on Earth, until I come to live that life, that I
shall after this is ended, live with thee in Heaven. So be it, Lord, So be it.
Amen. Amen.

56.
Ah how happy, thrice happy are we,
Who both taste, know, feel, find savor, and see
That thou live in us, and that we live in thee.
57. Empty me, O Lord, of all, even of all, that I may be fit to receive, and
be filled with thy fullness, even with thy blessed most blessed self, the Ocean
and Sea of all goodness.

58. As long as we are full, or in part filled with world, flesh, or self, so
much less room there is for God; for when a Vessel is full, it can receive
nothing, and according to the measure it is empty, it is capable to receive.

59. How then, Ah how then should we labor to empty our hearts of all that is
not of God, that we may be filled only with God, with God only, and always be
thus empty, that we may be thus always filled; for it is clear according to the
measure we are empty, we are capable to receive, and we shall receive from God,
of his blessed fullness, of unspeakable joys and pleasure, if we are willing and
labor earnestly and sincerely to empty our selves of our selves, and of all
fleshly worldly pleasures and joys, which are but mere fancies, vanities,
fooleries and toys.

60. Ah Lord God, the Fountain and the Ocean, that can never be emptied, empty
I most humbly and unfeignedly beseech thee, in the name and for the merits of
thy Son and my Savior Jesus Christ, my heart of all things, even of all, what
ever it be that is not according to thy heart, that is not of thee, that I may
pant and gape, hunger and thirst, long and desire, to be filled with thee
alone, alone with thee, with thee, who art only desirable, and to be desired
only; grant that all the Worlds all, may be more and more unto me nothing, even
nothing at all, that thou may be all mine, and I all thine, that I may love
all things out of thee less, and less daily, and thee, O God, more and more,
until I so love thee as it may not be possible for me to love thee more, that
my Love may cause me so to sink into thee, as I may see my self in thee and
thee in me, yea that I may be so swallowed up into thee, that I may not be mine
but thine, not mine own at all, but thine own all, even all thine. Now
henceforth, and for ever more. So be it Lord, So be it, Amen, Amen.

61. The greatest gift that God can give us, is himself by Christ, and then
Faith to believe it; a heart to love him and rejoice in it, and to praise him
continually for it.

62. And this will work in us unfeigned sincere ardent true Love, which will
cast out all fear of doubting, and work in us a true fear, not to offend or
grieve him any more, seeing he has given us himself, to make us his for ever
and for ever.

63. The greatest gift that God gives man here on Earth, is, to ascertain and
assure him, by his own Spirit, that he has and will give him himself, for ever
hereafter, to behold his face in Heaven, and that we are his, and shall be his
for ever.

64. Ah Lord God, I beseech thee augment and increase my Faith, that it may
remove the mountains of my sins altogether out of my sight, that they may never
shadow thy graces in me any more; but that I may always say, as now thine own
Spirit in me causes me to say sweetly, and boldly, that thou art mine, and I
am thine, that so I may in all needs, wants, crosses, and afflictions whatsover
(say) I have enough, I shall not want, I cannot be poor, because the Lord is my
God, and my Portion, for ever and for ever.

65. Ah Lord God, let me feel anew an^ afresh daily, what I have felt of thy
Lov^ and kindness in truth, and know more an^ more clearly that thou art mine
and tha^ I am thine; let me be still constantl^ assured that thou art my Lord
and my God and that thou will never leave me nor for^ sake me, but wilt live in
me for ever and so ever.

66. Let all doubts and fears be scattered that Satan may never gather them
togethe^ to molest or trouble me, that my joy may be full, that I may always
joy, in this thy so great Salvation, and be made glad by the light of thy
countenance shining upon me* which is better much by much, and chea^eth more
than any wine.

67. It is a most sweet thing to live fre^ from all sin.

68. To see our selves as we are in our selves, and as we are in Christ; in our
selves black, ugly, deformed, loathsome, filthy and abominable; but in Christ
comely, fair beautiful, white, clean, pure, bright, delightful and spotless; to
see our selves in our selves darkness, black, thick horrible darkness; but in
Christ transparent, transcendent bright light; to see our selves in our weak,
but in Christ strong: to see our selves in our selves barren, but in Christ
fruitful; to see our selves in our selves very foolishness, but in Christ true
Wisdom; to see our selves in our selves loveless, but in Christ lovely; to see
our selves in our selves nothing, but in Christ all things; to see our selves
in our selves sinners, miserable sinners, members of Satan, heirs of Hell and
eternal damnation, but in Christ, Ah in Christ our Christ, without sin, as if
we had never sinned, as members of his own glorious body, and coheirs with him
of Eternal Life and Glory; thus Faith does cause us to see our selves, when our
eyes are opened.

69. I had much rather by much, have Obedience than any grace of comfort or
assurance; I had rather much by much be wholly obedient and want assurance,
than have assurance, and fail in any point of obedience.

70. Ah God my God, and my only good, give this grace that I may be wholly
obedient unto all thy holy Laws and Divine Commandments; for as thou look on
it as the best of Sacrifices, so my Soul rejoices more in it, than in all
graces; for methinks it comprehends all graces to be obedient from true sincere
unfeigned Love Such a one would be wholly holy, do thy whole and holy will
always; for such a Soul makes the keeping of thy Commandments the only joy of
his heart, and the solace of his Soul.

71. What, Ah what a sweet most sweet condition is it to live in God only, and
to see our selves in him; for then the heart desires nothing else, nor the mind
minds nothing else, nor the will choose any thing else, nor the affections love
any thing else, nor the Soul cares for any thing else, nay it rejoices for
that it is thus divorced from all things else, and Ah, how it chooses and
desires thus to be ever, to be ever thus, to joy only in God, and to make God
only his joy.

72. The Heart and Soul is then to the World, and to all the things of the
World, as a man asleep, he values no more Crowns, Scepters nor Kingdoms,
wisdom, strength, beauty, riches, honors or pleasures, than a stock or a stone
does, or can do; he is so senseless, so benumbed, frozen, icy and cold, that he
has no sense or feeling, he is caught up above all these high things here
below, and when he does return to consider them* Ah how low, vain and foolish,
does he account them, nay he makes not any account of them at all, either
great or small.

73. He weeps to see that he has esteemed them as he has, and laughs at their
folly that do choose them for their choice, best sovereign and chief good.

74. A Soul in such a condition says, what have I any more to do with such
Idols; Ah that I could, says such a Soul, ever enjoy my God so, as that all
things out of him and besides him, might give me no joy.

75. Such a Soul says, when, and whilst I have the best good, the sovereign
good, take the other he that will; I would, Ah I would with my whole heart give
all to any, so I could give the thoughts of it likewise, that it might never
more come into my thoughts, but that I might be so swallowed up in God, as he
might only contain me, and be all my all.

76. What has the King more than the Beggar, or what is he more? when he is
asleep (as to enjoyment) the Beggar then wants nothing of what his heart
desires, and the King possesses nothing then, of all that he possesses,
according to the desires of his heart, they are then alike, frustrate of all
things, and possess nothing.

77. Even so it is with the Soul, nay with the whole man, when he is drawn in,
drowned, buried, or swallowed up in God, he is asleep, yea dead to all things
out of God, and besides God, and says, what are all these outward, glorious,
beautiful Objects, to those which I did enjoy in God? Ah if I could, if I
could always possess these, what would I care for them? they are to me at such
times even as if they were not, in comparison of what they are at other times.
I can and do now heartily laugh them to scorn, and have them in contempt and
derision, my God, my God, is so good, he is so good and so delightful, as he
is now become my whole and my sole delight.

78. Ah if it could be ever thus with me, I am sure I should never want any of
these things that the flesh craves, not bread to feed me, not drink to refresh
me, not clothes to cover me, having and possessing the things above, and could
they, Ah and could they always be possessed, I think none but mad men and fools,
will dare say, that we want any of the things below, though we should want them
all. As to me, I am sure I should not find any want, if I could be always, as I
have been sometimes.

79. But, O Lord, I praise thee, O Lord I mightily prize and praise thee, that
I am content with thy will, that is, yet to live in this Bacca, in this
Wilderness, and in this Valley of Tears as long as thou will; yea, I am so
content, that I pray heartily with my whole heart, Let thy will be done on me
wholly as thou will, and not as I will or would, I desire to be only, only to
be what thou will have me to be, thine, O Lord, thine, and not my will be done,
until thy Kingdom come, Amen, Amen. So be it, Lord, so be it. Amen, Amen.

80. To have all things and not to have God sure, is to have nothing sure; to
possess all things and not to possess God, is to possess nothing; all things
besides God are vanity, foolishness, nothingness, will fly from us and leave
us for ever, even then, and when we have most need of help, succor and
defense, but God will leave us never. If we be his, he will surely stand by us,
def^nd us, assist us, and give us all that we shall stand in need of, yea, much
above what we can ask or think.

81. The very least mercy or blessing, either on body or soul, which I have
received from God, deserves much more praise, by much, than I am able to give
unto God though I should continually praise him, and live continually to his
praise: for what am I, poor despicable I, that I should receive any thing from
the hand of God! But ah how much less then from the heart of God (in love.)

82. I know, O Lord God, that thou have regard to my feebleness, to make me
strong; to my poverty, despicable poverty, to make me rich for ever; to my
nakedness, to cover me with thy most glorious Robes; to my emptiness, to fill
me with thy blessed most blessed self; to my uncleanness and filthiness, to
wash me white and to make me clean; to my uncomliness, to make me comely; to my
ugliness, to make me lovely; to my wretchedness and misery, to make me
honorable and blessed; and to my nothingness, to give me all things for ever
and for ever. So be it Lord, so be it.

83. Who can, ah who can measure the earth, fathom the sea, and co^unt the
stars in heaven, and yet how much more unable and hard is it to measure, to
comprehend, and understand the height, the depth, the length, and the breadth
of the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

84. His goodness is as his greatness, incomprehensibly great.

85. Thy presence, O God, thy presence, makes all things that are bitter,
sweet; and thy absence makes all sweet things bitter.

86. O God, thou give such gifts to men, that they can see even here in the
flesh (by the eye of faith) that which thou have prepared for them in heaven,
that Christ and all his graces and righteousness is theirs, that heaven and
eternal life and glory is theirs for ever and for ever, that their sins are all
pardoned and done away as if they had never been; they see all that is to come
as if it were already come unto them; they have already (as it were) what they
shall have hereafter, even all those joys, riches and pleasures that are in
God, and therefore they rejoice even here with unspeakable joy.

87. Faith causes us to read in that Book that is sealed up (our names written
there) and our sins blotted out; Faith carries us often up into Heaven, even
whilst we are here on Earth; thus Faith can, and thus Faith does, do all things.

88. Heaven is Heaven, O God, because thou raignest See here in some little
measure what Heaven is, and what Hell is.
there, and Hell is Hell, because thou raignest not there; Heaven is all good,
because that thou, O God, that art all good dwell there, and give out
continually of thy goodness to make them all good (and like thy self) that are
there; Hell is all evil, because that thou, O God, that art all good art not
there, for Hell would not be Hell if thou were there, O God, (in love;) it is
thy presence that makes Heaven Heaven, and it is thy absence that Hell is
Hell; Heaven is filled with thy smiles, therefore it is Heaven, Hell is filled
with thy frown: and therefore, ah therefore it is Hell, Heaven is filled with
thy love, and therefore it is lovely, Hell is filled with thy hatred, and
therefore it is hateful; Heaven is free of and from all sin, and therefore it
is Heaven, Hell is full of all sin, and therefore, ah therefore it is Hell;
Heaven possesses, O God, the light, that glorious light of thy most glorious
countenance, and therefore it is such a most glorious light as cannot be
comprehended with darkness; but Hell is altogether dispossessed of thee, O God,
who art this light of Heaven, and therefore it is all darkness, even black
thick darkness; Heaven has always thee, O God, who art not only holy, but
holiness, who art not only wise, but wisdom it self, who art not only powerful,
but power it self, who have not only all things, but art all things, and
therefore Heaven is such a Heaven as it is, but Hell has thee not, wherefore
it is all sinful, wretched, and miserable; Heaven is Heaven in Heaven, yea,
such a blessed Heaven as it is, because thou have, O God, blessed it, and Hell
is cursed, yea, cursed as it is, because thou have cursed it from thine eternal
ever blessed presence; They are blessed, and shall be ever blessed that are in
Heaven, because they shall ever live with thee, and possess thee, O God, the
God and giver of all blessedness, and they are cursed, and shall be ever cursed
that are in Hell, because they live not in thee, possess thee not, and are not
possessed by thee.

89. Ah Lord God that art this Heavenly Heaven, this light; this glory, this
transcendant incomprehensible, glorious light, this blessedness, this full,
whole, entire, complete, and perfect blessedness of all the blessed in glory,
this holiness, this love, this most lovely holiness: Give me, I most humbly
beseech thee, and unto all thine, such a measure of thine infinite grace, that
we may (even here) sink into thee, and be swallowed up by thee, receiving
continually grace for grace, and be always altogether fully filled with thy
blessed fullness, and be for ever separated and divorced from and out of all
things that is not of thee, that we may henceforth lead such holy lives in all
our doings, dealings and conversations, so that after this life ended, we may
with thee, and in thee, O God, our only good, live that everlasting life of
peace, rest, joy, solace, and full contentment that shall never, ah that shall
never know end; So be it, O Lord God Almighty, so be it, Amen and Amen.

90. Ah Lord, give me this grace to hate sin, all sin, though there were no
punishment due unto it, and sincerely to love virtue and grace, though there
were no reward for it; hate the one, because it is hateful in it self, and love
the other, because it is in it self lovely.

91. O Lord, let my love be true for thee, as thine is, I am sure, for me.

92. Let my love, O Lord, be hot for thee, as I am sure thine is for me.

93. Let my love be strong for thee, as I am sure thine is, O Lord, for me.

94. Let my love be sincere for thee, as thine is O my Lord, I am sure, for me.

95. Let my love be continual, O Lord God, for thee, as I am sure thine is, and
shall be for ever for me.

96. All the things out of God, and besides God, are to a true believer but as
husks, but as the shell, but as dry bones, etc. But all things in God are the
pith without the husk, are the kernel out of the shell, are as marrow out of
the bone; they are truly savory and sweet, much more desirable and to be
desired than gold, yea, than much fine gold, and the most precious pearls.

97. He tha^ is in God, and finds God in him, that is, the life of Christ
within him, Christ, which is holiness, to be writ on his heart, esteems
himself rich in the greatest poverty; for he knows that all things are his,
he still carries about with him that unspeakable treasure, that unpusible
treasure, that will make him truly rich, wise and honorable to all Eternity,
and with this riches he makes many rich; though such a one be despised, he
mocketh at their laughter and mockings; and sincerely desires and wishes that
they had changed their estates for such an estate as will make them surely and
truly for ever rich.

98. He that possesses the riches of God his spirit, esteems the wisdom of
the wise (according to the flesh) that is humane fleshly wisdom, to be but mere
foolishness, the treasures of the world, though it were even all this worlds
treasure, to be but mere trash, and all its honors and pleasures to be but
mere emptiness, shadows, outsides, nothing, and can be all fitly compared to
nothing, but to nothing.

99. Let me have thee, O God, always, and I will always say as Jacob did when
he had thee; I have all, and I am sure I shall never lack any thing at all, for
this life or the life to come, for thou art, O God, more than all, that is
either in Heaven above or on Earth below.

100. He that possesses God thus, has in some measure Gods likeness, which is
holiness within and without, and that brings true contentment, and he that is
truly contented, wants nothing, but possesses much more by much, than he,
(which if it could be) should possess all the whole world, its riches, honors
and pleasures: thus the man that lives in God, knows, finds and feels,
and therefore rejoices with unspeakable joy, and this his joy, as no man
knows, so no man can take it from him, it is the gift of God, yea it is the
gift (God.)

101. What, Ah what heart is able to conceive, or tongue express the joys, Ah
the joys, the joys that he enjoyes, that thus enjoys God, how, how, Ah how does
he rejoice and triumph, having got such a Victory, having got such a Crown of
glory, such a glorious, most glorious Crown put on his head, much finer than
the finest gold, and brighter than the clearest Pearl or Diamond: thus faith
makes such souls triumph without control, they are so fully filled with those
rivers of pleasures that flow from Gods own right hand.

102. Thou art, O God, thou art, and there is none else, none besides thee, God
blessed for ever, give me I most humbly beseech thee, if it be agreeable unto
thee, those joys continually, that I may, Ah that I may continually fear thee,
that I may continually love thee, that I may continually serve thee, and more
and more, O Lord, much by much, give up my self, spirit, soul and body unto
thee, to worship and to adore thee, the greatness of thy goodness, and the
goodness of thy greatness, which is so incomprehensible and without end; Ah
Lord, I leave my self with thee, leave thou thy self with me; I desire (thou
know) never to go from thee, go not then I beseech thee from me, but let me
be all thine, and always thine, from this time forth and for ever more, Amen,
So be it, Lord, so be it, Amen, Amen.

103. The glory of my glory is, that thou have O God created me for thine own
self, for thine own glory.

104. Swallow me up so in thy self, that all things out of thee and besides
thee (O God) who art my best good, may be swallowed up, that is consumed, that
all mine may be all thine, and thee and thine mine.

105. I would much rather by much, that God should keep from me the greatest
comforts, than not to see and know my failings and fallings.

106. Ah Lord, the sight and knowledge of my failings and fallings, causes
thee to have thoughts of good for me to send me comfort, by restoring me to thy
wonted favor, and by giving me repenting grace, pardoning grace, and
preserving grace.

107. By seeing my failings and my fallings thou pitiest me, O Lord, because I
am in so pitiful a case.

108. Ah Lord, let thine eyes be always open, and watch thou over me, to see
me, in what case or condition soever I be.

109. I was indeed, I confess, heretofore ashamed and afraid that thou
should and did see me and know me, I was so vile and filthy, and finding
no true love in me for thee, I thought, O Lord, that thou had none in thee
for me, but that thou did hate me, because indeed I was altogether hateful.
But now I know (and for which I heartily and sincerely desire ever to praise
thee) that thine anger is turned away, and that thine hand is stretched out
still over me, to preserve, protect, defend, maintain, and to do me good.

110. So that what I thought was my ill, I now know is my greatest good; that
thou see me (O God) that thou always see me, and I would not but that thou
did always see me, as well when I am in my sins, in my worst case and
condition, as when at the very best, because at the very best thou can see (I
acknowledge and sincerely confess) nothing in me, that thou should do any
good to me or for me, so bad is my very best, so empty nothing and vile is all
mine all. And knowing thee now, O Lord God, by thine own sweet name of love and
mercy, I am not (I praise thee) at all afraid; that thou see in me all my sins
(past) because thou have given me a free pardon for them (present sins) because
having pardoned those, I am as sure that thou will pardon these, neither am I
afraid of my sins to come, because I know that thou art never weary of doing
good, and that thou never slumbrest nor sleep, but always watchest over me.
Wherefore, O Lord, seeing that thou art become my Lord, and my God, I now most
humbly beseech thee to look on me at all times, in all places and things, what
ever my failings or my fallings be, to recover me, and comfort me as thou
did Peter; for I know, and firmly through grace believe, that what thou
were, thou art, and wilt be ever unto me a sin pardoning God, a God pardoning
all my sins whatsoever: And seeing O God, my God, that thou art such a God as
thou art, give me grace, that whatever I do, I may do it to thy Glory, for thy
glory, and never more, Ah never more willingly, wittingly, or knowingly sin
against thee, in thought, word or deed, but freely and cheerfully depart
henceforth from all iniquity, with my whole heart and soul, even from all both
the great and the small, that I may be ever thine, and all thine, from this
time forth and for evermore, Amen.

111. Thus the Lord brings good out of evil, sweet out of bitter, and gives us
(as at this time, unto my poor Soul) new tokens, pledges, and assurances of his
old love.

112. Ah Lord, let this thy Love and Kindness, even thy most loving and kind
Love, be always had in remembrance of me and cause me to cling to thee, to
cleave to thee, to hold thee fast, and never to let thee go, and let me always
say, the Lord be praised, the Lord be praised always.

113. Ah Lord, seeing I have so deeply and so sweetly drank of and at this Well
of Consolation, let it be in me ever a Well of Living Water, that may never
grow dry, that I may always suck at this breast, to refresh my Soul, when I am
a thirst.

114. I sincerely confess and profess, were I to spend all my days to praise
thee, that the time would be too too short much by much, to show forth thy
loving kindness, and thy Love wherewith thou have loved me. And therefore my
soul praises thee' and rejoices, for that there shall be no end of that time
which thou have, O God, appointed, wherein I shall speak of and sing thy
praises; it shall be World without end, that I shall praise thee, O God, the
God of my Salvation, and my God.

115. O God, let this mercy be always as fire to heat me, as food to feed me,
as drink to refresh me, as wine to comfort me, as clothes to cloth me, as
riches of all sorts to enrich me; let it be to me always all things. Let it not
lose its worth nor taste by lying, but let it be always as the Honeycomb,
dropping honey to revive and comfort and strengthen me, and that I never forget
what a God thou art, and that thou changest not thou art still the same God,
blessed for ever and for ever.

116. Ah Lord, let me never forget these thy mercies, but through grace and the
presence of thy holy Spirit, walk worthy of them unto all eternity, through the
worthiness, merits and obedience of Jesus Christ, thy only Son, and my alone
Savior and Redeemers sake, Amen.

117. Many times God is so good and gracious, so merciful and loving unto us,
that then, even then, when we fear we shall see his frowns, that he will frown
on us when we come before him, He, to our great astonishment and admiration
smiles on us: When we fear that he will strike us with the Rod of his Anger, he
embraces and kisseth us with the kisses of exceeding transcendent Love, when
we fear he will be absent, he is then many times most sweetly present,
surpassing much by much, all sweets conceivable, as he was at this time to me;
which Ah that I could always bear in mind, that I might henceforth and for ever
live as I should live, to his honor and for his glory only.

118. Thus is our God good, that he brings us good when we fear evil, and
sometimes shows us that his goodness is so great toward us, for us, that he
minds not our evil.

119. Surely when we mind it much, and afflict our selves, and are heartily
ashamed and confounded, by reason of our weaknesses, failings, and
imperfections, he shows that he will not punish us, when we do as it were
thus freely and severely punish our selves; he knows of what we are made, and
that we are but dust, and yet he delights that we love him, fear him, prise
him, praise him and believe him, and make him and his Love all our delight and
joy.

120. Ah Lord, suffer me never more to requite this thy exceeding great
kindness, with the least, or any unkindness; but that I may henceforth walk
before thee circumspectly and wisely, with a heedfull, watchful, careful
care, doing always thy will, with my whole heart, mind and will.

121. When a Soul sees himself free from the Love, liking, or allowing of any
sin, it sees its self in God, and how it is made partaker of the Divine Nature,
that it is a little spark or beam of that glorious Light, which is pure,
transparent, bright and clear, and having no mixture, nor no cloud; for sin
only brings darkness in the Soul, sin only is the cloud which eclipses the
Light of this glorious Sun; sin only darkens and weakens our sight, and our
knowledge, and hinders us that we do not, nor cannot see our selves as we are
in God; but when that sin is done away totally, that is all Love, liking and
allowance; then are the eyes of our understanding opened, and all darkness is
swallowed up, done away, and wholly and totally consumed, and we are swallowed
up into this Divine Light, by which we are made to see and know our selves as
we are in God, a part (as it were) of this Light, even this Light it self in
some measure, it is so in us, and we are so in it; we see our selves clear and
free from all fears and cares, being delivered from them, and having obtained
the fullness of knowledge desired, or desirable; that is, that we are partakers
of him that is all purity, all light, all wisdom, all serenity, peace,
contentedness and rest, all passions ceasing of desiring more, for all the
desires are satisfied, having this knowledge, to see our selves and know our
selves to be with him, and in him, which to know, to behold, is to partake of,
and this is Eternal Life in us.

122. But when the mind of man (I mean only his thoughts) is on any sin, though
never so small, or never so li^^le, if in the least measure consented unto, it
robs him at that time, of all his happiness, his sight is darkened, his eyes are
so dim, that he cannot look up, sin is so heavy, so devilish, that it presses
the Soul downward, to Hell, to the Devil, which plainly shows its Center,
whence it is, and what it is, for the time that it is thus liked, or loved, or
but connived at, it metamorphoses the Soul, and makes it instead of being
God-like, Spiritual, Knowledge, Light, Purity, Serenity, Peace, Rest, Comfort,
Joy, and full contentedness, to be in some measure, Devillike, darkness; fear,
shame, horror, confusion, condomnation, accusation, hanging yea falling, always
downward, and not able in the least measure to look upward, or to hope, or to
think, or to believe, this is the nature of sin, and of the man that is in sin,
to be heavy, dull, faint, coward, swallowing down, and giving it self up unto
all fears, horribly ashamed and confounded, being darkness, even black thick
darkness, darkness it self, and miserable ignorance, which I take to be the
greatest and sorest evil of all, to be deprived of this Heavenly flower, of
this Heavens beauty, of knowledge, to see and know our blessed estates, of
being in God, and Gods being in us, which is perfect, full, whole, and entire
blessedness, therefore the contrary (ignorance,) black thick ignorance, must
needs be the contrary, the puddle, the filth, and excrement of Hell, in it self
(as it were) entire, full, whole, complete, and perfect cursedness and misery.

123. Ah Lord God, how great, how transcendent, magnificent, wonderfully,
exceeding and unspeakably great is thy bountiful goodness, in giving and
forgiving what thou give, and forgivest, especially unto me, despicable,
poor, vile me, the first, chiefest, and greatest of all sinners, and the very
worst of the worst of all men: how, Ah how my Soul does desire unfeignedly at
this time to prize and praise thee, I know that thou know. And Ah that I
could tell and show forth how and what thou have at this very time done for me,
in opening mine eyes to see and know, and comprehend in some measure, and
understand, what it is to be in thee, to partake of thee, and to be swallowed
up into thee, and in a little (though very little dark measure) to know thee,
but clearly to see, feel and know, that I am comprehended of thee, that is,
that thou art mine, and that I am thine; Ah Lord, suffer not I beseech thee,
that the ignorance which I am sure that sin brings with it, take away from me
this glorious portion of knowledge, to know and feel, and see my self in thee,
and that thou art and all thine, mine: Ah Lord, let this light of thine, which
is thy self, always shine in me, that by it I may be kept from the black thick
darkness, of sin, ignorance and error, and that I may not hence forth walk in
those ways which lead unto such deep destruction, as to eclipse, weaken,
darken, much less put out or destroy this glorious beam of thy most glorious
light, which through thy free, most free grace and mercy in Jesus Christ, thou
have at this time caused so brightly, clearly, transparently, and fully to
shine upon me: Ah Lord, let this glorious Light of thine always continue in me,
that I may always see my self in thee, and thee in me, and know thee to be
mine, and that I am thine, that thereby I may be enabled to tell of, and to set
forth thy praises and that thou art such a God as thou art, and to be desired
and sought after only, being only the desirable and the desired. And grant that
the remembrance of this thy Love and gracious dealing with me at this time, may
never be forgotten by me nor slip out of my mind, but that I may always have it
in remembrance, that it may be as a strong Tower and Bulwark against all and
every temptation, that shall at any time fall upon me, and that hereby I may be
made more and more able, to resist every lust and sin, whether in thought, word
or deed, to hate it, and fly from it, as the greatest of all evils; as the fire
of Hell, and the worm of Conscience, esteeming it the very worst of the worst
of the Devil. Let it I most humbly beseech thee, O our Father in Jesus Christ,
strengthen and augment my resolution and hatred against all and every sin, as
well against the least of all, as the very greatest of all; that I may more and
more see all sin to be exceeding sinful; the bane, ruin, destruction, and
destroyer of all good, blessedness and happiness. Ah Lord, hear me, and answer
me, in Jesus Christ, and continue thus graciously to go along with me, to be
always by me, and to watch over me, that no evil at any time, either in
thought, word or deed overtake me, or come nigh me to hurt me, to the end I may
walk before thee with a perfect and upright heart, doing always all that is
right in thy sight, that thou may, O Lord, more and more delight in me (the
work of thy hand, and in some measure I hope, trust, and believe in Jesus
Christ) the joy of thy heart, and that thou will graciously own me for thine
own, and never be ashamed to be called my God; for Christ my Soul does and
shall always bless thee, and to him, with thine own most glorious Majesty, and
Holy Spirit of Grace, the Sanctifier and Comforter, be always and eternally
given, Honor, Gloey, Power, Might, Majesty, Dominion and Thanksgiving, for
ever, and for ever Amen.

124. God he waits to be gracious to bring deliverance to his children and
servants, as they wait for the grace of deliverance.

125. Thus is our God, good, gracious and merciful, sympathizing with us, in
our afflictions, as well as in our comforts.

126. Thus is our God a most gracious God. The God of all grace, and Father of
all mercies, always doing good, never weary, repenting, or standing still

127. His fountain of Love, favor, grace and mercy, is not only always open
for us, but always running over, flowing out to run into us, he is abundant in
loving kindness; yea his delight is to be always doing good, he would that we
would always ask, that he might always give.

128. It is not possible, but impossible, to be weary speaking unto God, when
that we have his Spirit, or to be weary hearing of him speak to us, by the same
Spirit.

129. His words are as the droppings of honey, the sweet of all sweets, sweeter
much by much than the honey or the honeycomb.

130. The Soul of a right Christian, of a true Believer, does not, nor cannot
desire more favor than to be admitted to speak freely unto God, being fitted
by him, and taught by his Spirit what to speak; for then he is sure to hear
him, to speak to him again an answer of peace.

131. If it be so delightful a thing to us here in the flesh (whilst we are as
it were so far from him) or at least seeing him far off, so darkly, his back
parts only. Ah how comforting, how solacing, how transforming? to see his
transcendent glorious face, as he is to be seen, and to hear his sweet and
sacred voice audibly, that we are his, and that he is ours. And when he shall
have clothed us with his own likeness, and have made us in some small measure
glorious as he is glorious; for we shall then shine in the glory of our head
Christ Jesus, putting on his glory.

132. Ah Lord God, be good unto me, and grant that through thine infinite
fullness and goodness, I may fill others that are empty with these thine
overflowings, wherewith thou have filled me, that I may feed them with this
bread, and with those dainties, wherewith thou have been pleased so graciously
and plentifully to feed me, and that I may by communication, enrich them with
this same impuissable treasure, wherewith thou have now and heretofore enriched
my Soul.

133. Let me have nothing, Ah Lord, let me have nothing for my self alone, but
let me be always ready and willing, to give unto others, whatsoever it be that
thou shall give to me, to carry to them forthwith whatever thou thy self shall
bring me, to make them partakers of all whatsoever thou shall make me at any
time, yea (the best of times) partaker of, that thou give it unto me when
alone, yet grant, O God, (...) may esteem it as a common gift, that is, to make
it common, by giving it freely, liberally and cheerfully, not repugningly,
repiningly or repentingly, as thine, O Lord, as thine, that we may altogether
go hand in hand, speaking thy praises and telling of all what ever thou do
for our Souls.

134. Whatever God gives his Children, what condition soever he brings them
into, it is intended by him for their advantage and good, therefore they should
always re^oyce for all things; for high degree and ^ow degree, for health and
sickness, for ap^lause and for contempt and scorn, and not ^o do as many do,
endeavor to turn what God intends for their comforts into sorrow^g, cares and
heaviness, and say that they ^re not fit for comforts and joys, as if God ^new
not what were fit or fittest for them. How is it to be pitied and lamented, and
God knows how I pity them and lament for ^em, that thus turn his good into
evil, even ^ themselves and their very Souls; that is, ^ey labor with might
and main, what in ^em lies, to turn his comforts into discom^rts, his peace
into war, his smiles into ^wns, his joys into sorrowing; to change ^s
intendments for their good (as much as ^ them lies) unto their own hurt,
should ^e not be glad when we see and plainly perceive, that he intends to glad
us, and rejoice when that he intends to fill our cup full of joy, shall we say,
Ah God forbid, show me not Heaven yet, give me not ^ foretast or a foresight of
it yet; leave m^ thus alone, and come not, O God, so nigh m^ with thy comforts,
for thy smiles and thy most lovely and gracious presence overcom^ me. I would
rather thy absence, and the frowns, for a little space. What, shall w^ be sorry
for that God is so good unto us and say, that he does us too much good how dare
any man choose any condition f^ himself? how dare any man presume ^ think, that
he knows what condition best for him, and be so bold as to say, that contrary
condition to that which Gods giv^ him and sends him would be better for him as
if God knew not when best to fill us wi^ joys and when with sorrows; and when ^
take the one and the other from us. If ^ sends me always joys, I will always
rejoyc^ and if he fill me always with sighing a^ sorrows, I am sure he will fit
me for the condition also; and also in it to make me ^ rejoice: Let the Lord do
unto me alwa^ what seems him good, what he will, ^ what I will; his will not
mine be done, n^ henceforth and for evermore, Amen.

135. Deal with me, O God, the God of my Salvation as thou please, let the
Issue of all things be as thou will, only give me grace in all things to walk
uprightly before thee.

136. If we have, O God, so much cause to serve thee for what we have already
received, how much more for that, O Lord, which thou have promised, and which
we know thou will surely give us.

137. Ah Lord, let me cling to thee as a sucking Child does to the breast, for
it is from thee that I can only suck the milk of consolation, nourishment,
strength and comfort.

138.
' It Is thee in us, and us, O Lord, in thee.
That does from all sin ever make us free.
139. O Lord, the Heaven of Heaven does not contain thee only, but thou live
also in the lowest hearts of thy Children, as well as in the highest Heavens
with thy Servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

140. O Lord, thou know that I am content and willing too, to lose much (as
to my self) that I may be able to give a little unto others.

141. I would rather write a little for others sakes, then hear much for my own
sake only.

142. This loss I have often had, and yet I desire rather much by much, to be
always a loser than a gainer, being more others (for the most part) than mine
own, for in some measure, and for which I desire Eternally to praise thy name,
I have what I would have, and I am sure I shall never lose it.

143. Ah how glad am I when I can glad others, thou, O Lord, know the great
joys I have, when thou art pleased to use me as a means to make others to
rejoice.

144. When, O Lord, thou fillest me, and then emptiest me (as it were) into
others, I account it not emptying but overflowing.

145.
So that by my loss others might but gain,
I care not what loss soever I sustain.
146. When, O Lord, thou speak to the heart, thou preparest, that is, make
the heart fit, to speak fitly and preparedly to thee.

147. Thy tongue, even thine, O Lord, makes our hearts and our hands, as the
pen of a ready writer, always ready to speak or to write.

148. Thy graces, O Lord, many times flow into our Souls as the full Sea with a
high Tide, loftily and sweetly.

149. But Ah, how is the soul beneap'd and muddy, having no pleasantness, when
the Tide of thy presence is gone out.

150. Return, O Lord, return, return unto me to fill me, that I may (at least)
be as often filled with thine overflowings, as emptied of them by mine own
outgoings.

151. Ah that I had thee so, O Lord, as I might always have thee, possess thee
so, as I might always joy in these sweet, pleasant and delightful enjoyments
of thy blessed, most blessed presence, which only comforts and contents me.

152. Thy presence, O God, thy presence, thy presence is much more esteemed by
me by much, than life, and sweeter ten thousand times ten thousand, than the
Honeycomb of any pleasure, more desirable than the finest Gold or most
precious Pearls, and to be preferred above many Rivers of Wine and Oil.

153. Heap upon me, O Lord, I beseech thee, heaps upon heaps of these thy
favors, and cause these thine overflowings to cover the banks of my barrenness
and filthiness, that I may be comely and pleasant in thy sight and esteem.

154. Fill me, O Lord, I beseech thee so full, as that I never grow empty again
of thy grace and goodness, of obedience and love.

155. Warm me so that I never grow cold again, but let this heat of the fire of
thy love, burn and consume all the cold Winter frost of the weeds and roots of
sin and Corruption, that my soul may be as a pleasant garden for thee, O Lord,
my King, and my God to take pleasure in.

156.
Thou have, O God, thou have,
thou have, in a very great measure,
Turned the Mountains of my sins,
into a Valley of pleasure.
157. God is my God, and therefore he will be my God always; so whatever
temptations fall on me, I will not fear them, for God who is my God, is
stronger than all, and his love is above all, either in Heaven above, or on
Earth, or Hell below.

158. He that truly loves all good, must truly hate all evil, for love to good
produces always in all, hatred to evil, for there is a contrary to every
thing, as light is contrary to darkness, therefore loving the one (good,) we
must and can do no other than hate the other which is the contrary, (evil.)

159. Having our eyes opened, our understandings enlightened, we then see sin in
its colors, as it is in it self sinful, and therefore we must hate it, and we
can then do no other but hate it, with a perfect, which is sincere hatred, not
only leave all sin, but heartily, unfeignedly, sincerely, and with our whole
hearts, hate all sin, and loath all sin, being changed and brought out of
darkness, which is from sin, into the marvelous light of the knowledge of the
love of God, we cannot, being clothed with his nature, loving what he loves
(Holiness and Righteousness, but hate what he hates, which is all sin and
wickedness, having put Christ Jesus on, we must put the other off, the world,
flesh, and Devil, and all their works, sticking to Christ, and holding him
fast, we must and will, and can do no other still, than let go our hold to all
things out of him and besides him; for according as our love is to the one, so
our hatred will be, nay is to the other, they being contraries and opposite one
unto another.

160. He that truly loves the ways of God, which is Righteousness, must, does,
and can do no other than hate the ways of the Devil, which is sin, we cannot
serve two such Masters, it is impossible to love two such Contraries.

161. By our true, sincere, and unfeigned hatred to the one, we may see and be
sure of our unfeigned, sincere, and true love to the other, and if we thus love
truly all good, we love God truly, which ought and should assure us that we are
beloved of God, yea that we are his beloved, through Jesus Christ the truly
beloved, whom he does and ever will love truly, and us in him, for his love is
not yea and nay unto us, but yea, and in Christ yea and Amen.

162. He that has thee, O God, has all, and therefore he that wants thee
wants all, though he wants nothing else at all.

163. He that possesses thee, O God, possesses surely the best possession
that is or can be possessed.

164. He that knows thee, O God, has perfect knowledge, for none does or can
know thee, but from and by thy holy spirit of true wisdom and knowledge, all
knowledge and wisdom else to this is mere foolishness.

165. When we are in thee, O God, we are truly free, free from all evil, and
filled with all good, for all good is in thee, and comes freely from thee, as
the Rivers from the Sea.

166. Wash me, make me clean, O God, in and by Christ, that I may be pure in
thy fight, even as gold well refined, without any dross or mixture, perfectly
pure, pure in perfection.

167. By giving, we receive, that is, when our hearts are drawn forth sincerely
to give what God has given us, (I mean of spirituals) God gives us what we
would have, yea and much above what we did ask or could think.

168. When thus we beg for others, to have, that we may have to give; Ah how
good, gracious and bountiful is the Lord unto us, in giving of us according to
our hearts desires, even the very desires of our hearts.

169. When thus we desire grace, to impart it unto others, how agreeable unto
God are our desires, how, Ah how does he regard us, and reward us.

170. When thus we are beggars for others, God makes us rich with the
treasures of Heaven, with that true riches which will make us rich for ever,
which is grace here, and glory hereafter.

171. When thus we mind others good and welfare as our own, making their case
ours, sympathising with them, both in their good and evil, in their present and
future happiness, then we show forth that we live in God, and that God lives
in us, for where true love is, God is, for love is God, and God is love.

172. When we feel want in our Brethrens wants, and are filled with what they
are filled, bearing their burdens of grief and sorrow with them, it shows that
we are of one heart, and of one mind, that we are Brethren, if we have thus
compassion one of another.

173. And when we make their joys our joys, it shows plainly that there is one
spirit in us, even the spirit of the love of God (which is Christ Jesus our
Lord) who leads us in his paths, and teaches us to practice what he has
commanded us, and his Children we are whom we obey, whether of sin unto death,
or of Righteousness unto life. By their works ye shall know (as God) who are
his.

174. When thus we are unto others what we are unto our selves, it shows
plainly that we are members of Christ's mystical body, and that he is our head.

175. When thus we agree and sympathise in one another honor and dishonor,
sorrows and joys, we show forth that we are not two but one, and this oneness
shows also, that we are one in Christ, that he lives in us, and that we live
in him, that he is ours, and that we are his

176. And when Christ thus owneth us for his own, we may be sure that when he
comes at his second and sudden coming in glory, we shall also appear with him,
and be made like him, glorious as he is glorious, though not so glorious.

177. He that thinks any thing more worth than Christ, is not worthy of Christ.

178. He that would not willingly lose all things for him, and for his sake,
shall never have him, nor of him partake.

179. He that holds any thing dearer than Christ's love, shall never partake of
his love.

180. But he that loves him above all things, beyond all things, and more than
all things, may surely say that he has all things, for as Christ is above all,
God blessed for ever and for ever, so he is all in all unto all those that
truly love him.

181. So sure as we would, that he did love us, so sure it is that he does love
us, and more sure much by much, and so much as we would that he did love us, so
much he does love us, and yet much more by much, and so strongly, and
continually as we would that he did love us, so does he, and so will he, even
unto the end, for there is, nor never shall be any end of his love, he will
love whom he does love, world without end, for ever and for ever.

182. So sure as we are Gods creatures, so sure is he our God, and so sure as
he is the Father of all mercies, so sure is he our Father; and therefore sure
it is that we are his dear children, and therefore surely he will be ever unto
us a most loving and merciful Father; delighting to do us good, and to make us
his very delight, in Jesus Christ, our eldest Brother, blessed Savior and
Redeemer.

183. O Lord, I have no good in me but what comes from thee, I say none at all
either great or small.

184. From thee, O Lord alone, I have all that I have, therefore me and all
mine, I confess and acknowledge is all thine.

185. How weary, Ah how weary am I of my self? and yet not so weary as I would
be, because I keep not thy Laws.

186. How loathsome, Ah how loathsome am I to my self, and yet not so much by
much as I would be? because I love thee not, O God my God, as I would, and as I
should love thee.

187. That God is what he is, is the greatest and chiefest joy of all those
that love him, fear him, know him, and have given up themselves unto him.

188. The presence of God (which is Communion with him through his Holy Spirit)
is the feast of fat and pleasant things, yea the Feast of Feasts unto that
Soul, and every Soul that has truly tasted of him.

189. In his presence is all joy, unspeakable joy, and from his right hand flow
continual pleasures for evermore.

190. The good, and the only good that a soul in God desires, chooses,
longs for, and pants continually after, being ever hungry and a thirst to
enjoy, is, in some measure to be like him in all things, always to be
conformable unto him, to put him on, and that he may never put him off.

191. The goodness of God, is such a souls only goodness; the glory of God is
such a souls only glory; the honor of God is such a souls only honor; the
wisdom of God is such a souls only wisdom; the riches of God is such a souls
only riches; and the love of God is such a souls only love, God being only his,
his only good, his only all in all, always: All that is Gods, is dear and near
unto him, yea is his dearest and his nearest of all things, either in Heaven
above, or on Earth below, his cause such a soul makes his, and his truth and
ways he is so wedded unto, as he only joyeth in the remembrance of them, and
for that he is by his Holy Spirit thus strictly wedded unto them, having chosen
them for his Love, his delight, his refreshings and rejoycings, having his
heart in some measure according to Gods heart, and his mind according to the
mind of God.

192. All that is in all creatures, both in Heaven above, and here on Earth
below, is from God, all their strength is from his strength, all their Power
from his Power, all their might from his might, all their wisdom from his
wisdom, all their love from his love* and all their loveliness from his
loveliness, all their goodness from his goodness, and all their greatness from
his greatness, all their riches from his riches, and all their peace from him
who is the God of Peace; all their rest from him who is their rest, all their
joy from him who is the God of Joy, all happiness, felicity and bliss, from him
who is all happiness in himself, and is his own felicity and bliss. Thus from
Gods all, all Creatures, Saints and Angels, have their all, and therefore they
return unto him always, as all due is, all Honor, Glory, Power, Might,
Majesty, Dominion and Thansgiving, for ever, and for ever.

193. Ah God, how great is thy greatness? how good, Ah how good is thy great
goodness? how deliciously sweet is thy sweetness? how lovely, Ah how
transcendently lovely is thy loveliness? how beautiful, Ah how beautiful is thy
beautifulness? Who, Ah who is a God like unto thee our God, abundant in loving
kindness, always doing good.

194. Ah most gracious, and most glorious Lord God, full of all grace and all
glory; thou art all fullness of all blessedness, all the blessed are all blessed
in thee, even from thy ever blessed blessedness.

195. The Lord would not give me the World at full, till he had first fully
given me Heaven, to the end that I might not love what I should not, but what I
should, that I might not love most the less, but the most; that is, having the
true knowledge of the worth of Heaven, I might choose it, prize it, love it, and
make it my whole choice, delight and love; for if the Lord had first given me
my fill of the World I should doubtless) have satisfied my self therewith, and
rested on it, and sought only after it, and not have minded Heaven, nor the
things in Heaven; I should have made these low things here below, the highest
things in my esteem and choice, and sought no other Heaven than thus to have
lived on earth, possessing earthly things.

196. But now, blessed be God for his goodness, though I have earthly things in
abundance, I esteem, account and prize them, but as the things of earth, even
as dirt, dung and dross, compared with the things of Heaven; yea with those
things of Heaven, that God gives here on earth to those that love him; for he
that has seen, that has tasted, and that knows the one and the other, must
needs acknowledge, confess, and say, Ah how low are all these things here
below, when compared with the things above, they are all even nothing at all,
empty, poor, despicable, poor, low things.

197. The Lord would not suffer me to possess the things of the flesh first,
ere he had feasted, resatiated, and satisfied me with the things of the Spirit,
with Heavenly and Spiritual things, that I might be able to make a fit choice,
to choose fitly, and now he alone knows my desire, my choice, my aim and my
end. Let him do all that seems him good, his will, and not mine, be done.

198. Ah Lord, make me more and more by much to hate all evil, because it is
evil, altogether hateful, and therefore to be hated.

199. But Ah Lord God, let me much more by much love all good, because it is
good and only lovely, and therefore only to be loved.

200. Let me hate all evil, because it is not of thee, O Lord, nor from thee,
nor according unto thee, but contrary, yea altogether contrary unto thee, and
therefore hateful, only hateful, and to be hated only.

201. But let me, Ah Lord, let me love all good and in all, because it is from
thee, O God, because it is of thee, and according unto thee, and therefore
lovely, beautiful, desirable, and to be only loved.

202. Let me love only that, O Lord God, which thou love, and hate what thou
hate, and as thou love and hate both the one and the other, that is,
always, and for ever and for ever.

In Bourdeaux, Anno 1660.
1. THE happiness of a Christian in this World or in this Life (he makes, as to
me) to be strength against all sin, even against all, both great and small,
against the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, that
he may totally overcome and always all sinful, worldly, fleshly lustings and
affections, so that he commit nor consent unto no evil at all, either great or
small, but serve the Lord continually in sincerity and godly simplicity, by all
his thoughts, words and actions, doing all good always, that is possible to be
done, at least, in his choice, will and desire.

2. The comfort of a Christian in this life is in purity and holiness of heart,
mind, affection and thoughts, endeavoring always with might and main, to his
very utmost, that he be not carried away with vain, foolish, fleshly thoughts,
cogitations, inclinations, or affections. The more Spiritual, holy, heavenly
and the more perfect he is, the more of the Divine Nature he has, the more of
Heavens beauty, glory and happiness is in him; the more he has of the
glorious, beautiful and ever blessed impress of the Image of God in him, which
shines forth unto his understanding, comprehension and reason, so irradiously
and brightly, that he is comforted, delighted and refreshed, with the very joys
and bliss in glory, he is made partaker of those very joys (though but in a
small measure) that the Angels and Saints enjoy in Heaven; for such a Soul
possesses God and his glory, and happiness as they do; the difference only is
in the measure, or quantity, and not in the certainty or quality, the Saints
Cup in Heaven is full to the brim, when given them, and they drink deep of
those pleasures and joys which are at God's right hand. But we indeed here,
have but a snip, a taste and away, they indeed enjoy these joys always, without
the least intermission. But alas our enjoyment of these joys, are short, but a
very little moment, we cannot so comprehend as they do how they are
comprehended, we see but darkly and know but in part; however it is the same
that they see and know, and so are all things ours as well as theirs, both
things present and things to come; for God being our God, we have as much as
they have, he being our Portion, theirs is not, nor theirs cannot be greater.

3. Thus is a Saint on Earth perfectly, substantially and effectually in
heaven, thou on Earth (at times) and sees and beholds things there, as they
are; for a Saints heart which is his better part, and greatest part, is always
in Heaven, though his body be on Earth; his affections are above and burn in
the fire of Love, always, for the things that are above, are, purity, holiness
and love, his meditations and desires are on his God, in his God, and for his
God; and thus he dwells in God, and God dwells in him, which is the sole,
entire and complete comfort and joy of his life and soul, even as it is theirs
that enjoy and possess God in Heaven.

4. Put these two together, a Christians happiness and a Christians comfort;
for they cannot be separated, yea there is such a oneness in them, as though
they be two, yet they seem to be but one; true one man may abound more in one
of them, and the other in another. Now I am sure that there is not the Man
alive, nor never will live, that knows the sweet, the worth, and the excellency
of them, but will confess and say, that such a man is the only happy man, the
comfortable man, the peaceable man, the rich and the honorable man; Ah man,
man, who ever then thou art that shall be brought by Providence, I mean the
Spiritual and most favorable Providence of God to peep here into; I pray thee,
endeavor to pry and look into this perfect Law of Liberty more fully, more
clearly, more plainly, than yet thou have, and thou shall find what I have
expressed, thy self to be even in Heaven, and Heaven to be in thee, though thou
art on Earth, to be in God and God to be in thee, which is both men and Angels
only good, bliss, happiness, comfort, joy and rest, which good Lord for thine
only holy names sake in Jesus Christ I most humbly beseech thee cause me more
and more to know, to feel, to love and long after, and that it may be my only
employment to find out this incomparable good, this wisdom of wisdom, those
joys of all joys, the only true and satisfactory, and to be desired, esteemed,
and rejoiced in. Let me then, O God my God, I beseech thee, be sequestered from
all things that tend to please, satisfy, refresh, solace, content or delight
the flesh; for I earnestly would, O God, if thou so wilt, that thou would
always be all mine all, (for thou alone thou know) O God my God, art only
able to satisfy the ambitious and exorbitant covetous desires of my mind,
heart and soul; for it hankers and hangs on thee, as thou know continually;
let me have thee, O God, let me so have thee, as I may find and feel, that I
have nothing else, what ever else I may have. Let me be swallowed up and
consumed in thee, yea let me I most humbly beseech thee, be as it were dead and
senseless, to all things out of thee, and besides thee, and give me grace, that
I may so live to thee here, that I may ever live with thee hereafter, as there,
so here, to bless, praise, magnify, laud, honor and extol thy holy, ever
holy, most blessed, most great, most gracious, and most glorious name. So be
it, Lord, So be it, Amen, Amen.

5. A Christians life should be (me thinks) but a good thought, that is, always
thinking of God for good, or at the most but as two thoughts, one of Gods
Goodness, Love, Mercy and Kindness; and the other of our own desperate badness,
unkindness, ingratitude and misery. Thus even thus (me thinks) we should always
be, all the day long, all our days, unto the very end of our lives.

6. According as is our Spiritual warfare (within us) so is our peace, if there
be an universal war in all the faculties of the Soul, and members of the body,
against all sin, then and only then do we enjoy peace, true peace, full peace,
and perfect peace. Wherefore make first a Covenant with thine eyes, that they
gaze not abroad, nor look irregularly, or wantonly. Secondly, with thine ears,
that thou take no pleasure, but avoid to hear all vain, idle, foolish or sinful
talk. Thirdly, with thine hands, that they touch no unclean thing, that is,
that they serve not as an instrument (at any time) to do any evil. Fourthly,
with thy feet, that they carry thee not to do the thing at any time, that is
not altogether right in Gods sight and esteem. Fifthly, with thy tongue, that
thou speak not vainly, lightly, idly, foolishly, hurtfully, slanderously or
sinfully. But that which shall honor thy God, edify thee here, and comfort
thine own soul, and give thee joy in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ. Sixthly,
with thy mind, that thou mind only the things of God, and what are according to
his mind. Seventhly, with thy heart, that thou love not, seek not, choose not,
prize not any other thing, than what is according to Gods heart. Eighthly, with
all thy affections, to love what God loves, and to hate what God hates, and
as he loves and hates them in sincerity and truth continually. Ninthly and
lastly, but not the least, with thy thoughts, to suffer no evil, vain, idle,
foolish gadding worldly affection to settle it self there a moment, keep out
all things thence, but thy God, and the serious thoughts of his goodness, and
of thine own badness, of his mercy, and of thine own misery, of his Heaven, and
of thine own Hell, of his glory, and of thine own shame, of his beauty, and of
thine own deformity and ugliness, of his light, and of thine own darkness, of
his fullness, and of thine own emptiness, of his fruitfulness, and of thine own
barrenness, of his power, and of thine own weakness, of his Wisdom, and of
thine own foolishness, of his Patience, and of thine own frowardness and
peevishness; in a word of his riches, which is above all, over all, and more
than all things much by much, either in Heaven above or Earth beneath, and of
thine own despicable poverty and nothingness at all, only a sinful nothing, or
nothing but sin.

7. If thus thou endeavourest to keep out all things (but God and his ways) out
of all thy thoughts always, thou shall I promise thee live such a peaceable,
quiet, comfortable, sanctified, holy blessed life, as is unutterable,
unexpressible; for as thy thoughts are, so will be thy comforts, or
discomforts, thy joys and rejoycings, or thy reproaches and bewaylings. Do thou
thus draw near to God, and thou shall find him, and feel him, and perceive him,
and see him to draw near unto thee, by his graces here, which will bring thee
to possess himself, his Heaven and his Glory for ever hereafter.

8. God does not give us such a measure of grace here to free us altogether
from our Corruptions, infirmities and failings, for these two ends (as I
conceive) first, that we be not lifted up above measure, as we should be, and
think our selves to be something, and that we are clothed and rich, and full;
God knows that it is better for us to see our poverty, nakedness and
emptiness, that we may be Inheritors with the Saints in life, of all the
promises, both of things present and to come. And not to be shut out of them
with the evil Angels, and have our Portion in the Lake of fire and Brimstone
world without end. Again, secondly, If thus we did live at our hearts ease,
always without temptations, failings or falls; we should surely with Peter,
foolishly make Tabernacles here, and not care for any other Heaven; for indeed
it would be a Heaven. But not, Ah not such a Heaven as our God has prepared
and provided for us above, where we shall see him as he is to be seen, and know
him as he is to be known. If we had here all that we would have, or could
desire and crave, we should not with holy Heavenly enlightened Saint Paul,
desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which as he said well, truly and
divinely, was much better by much, yea best of all. And if we were not at times
tempted, how should we manifest the gifts and graces of Gods spirit in us, as
now through grace we do by our fightings, strivings, struglings, wrestlings,
contendings in the heat of Zeal, and fire of fervent love in truth, to keep our
selves as valiant Combatant^ (...) holy Lists of his Divine and blessed Laws
and ways, not flinching at all, or drawing back in the least, or moving a foot.
But standing it out to the very last breath against all our spiritual Enemies
and Adversaries, within and without, of Devils Lusts, worlds Lusts, and fleshly
Lusts and Corruptions. And here, by constant and faithful engagements in this
holy war, in this spiritual combat, in this Angelical fight, for the honor
and glory of the Eternal God, the King of Kings, and Lord of lords, we are
confirmed, assured, strengthened, and settled by the whispers and sweet voice of
his holy spirit within us, to our Souls and Consciences, that we shall in due
time be made through his strength and continual assistance more than
Conquerors; and shall at last sit down and rest in peace Triumphantly, with the
Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs and Saints, wearing for ever the Crown
of Victory and Glory, in Glory, and be arrayed with the long white robes of
Christ's righteousness, worthiness, merits and obedience, and ever live with him
and his bliss, enjoying for ever and ever his presence, his Heaven, yea
himself, who is the bliss of all bliss, the Top and Crown of all joy; the
Heaven of Heaven in Heaven, and the glory, beauty, splendour, and sublimit^ of
Glory in Glory.

9. See then, and consid(...)ess and much better does God deal with us, and
carve to us, than we can or would for our selves, how much, Ah how much better
is he to u^ and for us, then we would be to and for our selves, how much more
over and above has he prepared for us, and will surely give us, than we are
able to ask, than we are able to think; wherefere let us learn to let him
alone, and pray him to deal with us, and do for us, as seems him good; and
always say in all things, so Lord, so would I have it, seeing thou will have it
so.

10. I also conceive that God suffers us to fall at times for this end, or the
like, that by our fall, we may learn and be made to stand the faster, to rise
the higher, and to stick the closer unto him, who only is able to hold us up,
and to keep us from falling; me thinks if we did not sometimes fall, not that I
desire to fall or stumble at all, neither to sin in the least, to have grace
abound; but me thinks if we did not at times fall, we should not see his
Fatherly love so clearly, so greatly, in taking care of us to preserve us, by
protecting of us from greater evils and dangers; for when he has lifted us up
again, after we have fallen, Ah how do we cling to him, how do we hold him
fast, how do we endeavor to have him always in our sight, and how do we cry
after him, when we perceive any evil of affliction or temptation to be nigh us;
and how do we cast our selves down before him at his feet, and bewail our
infirmities and weaknesses, begging strength from him to support and keep us
up; how do we wonder and are astonished to see the fire of his wrath kindled
against the wicked, and against evildoers, and yet that such wicked evildoers
(as we are) are not consumed; to see fire in the bush, and yet the bush not
burnt.

11. Thus we may plainly see that God sees all to be good for us, yea best of
all, which he sends us, causing every thing to work together for our good.
Ah, seeing then that his love, mercy, and goodness is such, and so great for
us, let us always mightily prise him, and prize him at the very highest price,
and give up our spirits, souls and bodies to live to him, and for him, and
unto, and for his praise, honor and glory, it being our glory and our honor,
our happiness, and our bliss that he is such a God as he is; To him alone
therefore be given always, all honor, glory, and praise, for ever and for ever.

12. Laying out, is laying up; laying out of earthly treasure on earth, with a
heavenly heart, is to lay up heavenly treasure in Heaven, according to Gods
words, and his heart.

13. God gives unto his Children, of his own strength to overcome as it were
(himself) he delights to be (as it were) overcome by them. And to make us
more than Conquerours.

14. Ah the mercy, the mercy and bounty of God and the misery of man, that God
being such a God as he is, should notwithstanding continue to do so much for
man, and man nevertheless continue continually to do so much against his God, I
say against his God, even then, when he knows God to be his God.

156. Ah Lord, how is it that thou should take pleasure to mind us so much
as thou do, although thou know well our evil minds, and how little we mind
thee; and although thou tellest us by thine own spirit, how that we are near
and dear unto thee, even always in thy mind and heart, to do us good for ever
and for ever. Ah how great is our misery to have such depraved natures, and
such Devil-like hearts, to pay thy merciful kindness with such high unkindness
and ingratitude, to thee who art our only good.

16. How is it, O Lord, that thou take such continual care and pains (as it
were) and art at so much cost, to overcome us with thy loving kindness, and yet
we remain so brutish and senseless, stupid and unkind, that we will not (but
refuse) to he overcome.

17. Ah the misery, the misery of man, who is never weary, nor would never be
weary of doing evil, yea all manner of evil against his most kind and loving
Lord and God, who is so good to him, as he is never weary nor repents of doing
of him good, notwithstanding his continual doing of evil, or doing of all evil
continually.

18. A good heart gives unto the Lord freely, cheerfully, willingly and
rejoycingly, of all that he has, and always acknowledges, and says, of thine
own, O Lord, I will and do give thee.

19. When that the Lord gives unto such a soul Grace, he gives him Glory;
when he gives him outward things, he praises him, and enlarges his bowels of
compassion unto the Saints.

20. Such hearts desire mightily, largeness of heart, or large hearts, to give
according to what they receive, whether it be Spirituals or Temporals, nothing
is so near or dear unto them, as the work of the Lord, which is to do his will
in all things, from the very highest of Grace, to the very lowest of things in
Nature.

21. Ah Lord God, let me always bear thee in mind, when ever I mind, that is,
think on any thing.

22. Let me, O Lord, I most humbly and unfeignedly beseech thee, do every thing
that I do, as knowing and remembering, that thou see and know all the
thoughts of my heart, and writest down all my words, and works on thy blessed
book of remembrance.

23. Let me do all that I do before men, as before thee, O God my God, knowing
that thou see it and hear it.

24. And all that I take in hand to do, O God, before thee, Let me do it all,
as if all the men in the World did look on me and see it.

25. Notwithstanding the greatness and numberless number of my sins, thy
goodness, O God, was so great toward me, as moved thee to have compassion on
me, and to pour out thy endless and everlasting love and kindness in mercy upon
me.

26. Also, O God, thou causedst my own sins to appear so great and filthy
before me, that I was thereby ashamed of my self and confounded before thee.

27. So that seeing my self thus polluted, filthy, abominable, and unclean, yea
abominably unclean, I left my self willingly, I hated, and do hate my self
truly, and I embraced (through Grace) thy most gracious offers of Grace, Love
and Mercy, heartily and unfeignedly, returning unto thee with my whole heart,
desiring entirely and sincerely, an entire change from all evil to all good,
from my own evil ways, to thy most blessed ways that are so good, so sweet, so
beautiful, so delightful, that since the knowledge of them, my soul has been
often delighted, refreshed, feasted and satisfied in them, and with them.

28. Ah mercy of mercies, that thou would, O God, be pleased thus in mercy
to look on me, when I was fit and ripe for all thy Judgments; And when thou
might justly have poured out the viols of thy wrath and fury upon me with
the greatest indignation, that then even then to kindle the flames of Love in
my heart, from the continual burnings in thine, O God, in thine, to love, fear,
seek, adore, and serve thee unfeignedly with my whole heart; Ah what mercy to
this mercy.

29. Continue, O God, that art my God and only good; continue, Ah continue I
most humbly beseech thee, to be thus merciful unto me, that I turn not thy
Grace into wantonness; but in some r^easure labor and strive to walk worthy of
these thy rich and saving mercies, with which thou have, and wilt for ever
enrich my poor Soul with, and save it.

30. As a natural Father, a Father in the flesh, is, and must be still a
Father, and a child, a child, so me thinks it is with God our Heavenly and
Spiritual Father; he having once begotten us, and we are born again, and are
become his children by the Grace of Adoption, Justification and Sanctification,
he must be still our Father, and we his children, unto Eternal Salvation.
Though we do many times (as fleshly children) not always do the will of their
Fathers in the flesh, nor please them always, not satisfy or delight them, nor
give them content, yet notwithstanding they are still children, nor they cannot
cease to be children, nor their Father to be their Father; even so, though we
do not always do what likes God our Heavenly Father, but that at times which
disliketh him, and displeases him, he as a good Father sometimes punishes us,
and sometimes passes by our failings, without punishment, eyeing what is rest
for us, and as a Father he never fails us, neither will he suffer us to fail
of being his children. Once his children and ever his, his for ever, and for
ever.

31. Ah Lord God, that art so glorious here in Grace, how transcendently
glorious art thou in Glory? If the Earth be so full of thy Glory, how full is
Heaven, O Lord, thy dwelling place, where thou manifestest thy self unto the
Saints, and they behold thy beauty and thy glory face to face.

32. If thy back parts be so beautiful, to our eyes here in the flesh, how
beautiful, Ah how beautiful, O Lord, will thy glorious countenance be unto us
in glory? where we shall see thee and know thee as thou art to be known.

33. Thy presence even here, O Lord God, when we have Communion with thee, does
so delight and ravish us, that we had much rather by much be a doorkeeper in
thy house, be a servant to the meanest of all thy servants, than sit on Thrones
and rule among the wicked that keep not thy Laws.

34. I have, O Lord, I confess, abused thy merc^es and do therefore acknowledge
that thou may justly refuse me all mercies.

35. I have walked contrary unto thee, O God, and still do, and therefore I
confess that thou may justly walk contrary unto me, and give me up to do all
the evil, that is in my heart, which is the very greatest of all thy Judgments
in this life.

36. We are the work of thine hand, we are thine own, and thou may justly do
with us, all that seems good unto thee to do; for what is right in thy sight,
O Lord, is just and right, and good.

37. When the Lord is with us for good, then he has accepted of us, he is in
us, and we are in him, one with him, and he one with us, we as bone of his
bone, and flesh of his flesh, and he as bone of our bone, and flesh of our
flesh; we are not two but one, yea there is such an oneness, as we are one (in
some measure) in all things, and have the same affections for all things,
loving what is to be loved, and hating what is to be hated; there is a like
purity and no mixture in our choice of good, and in our hatred and abhorrency
of evil, (as to the truth and sinceri^y of it) though much different in the
degrees.

38. Thus even thus is man made (in some measure) as God, that is God like.
Thus even thus does he partake of the holy and Divine Nature of God. Thus even
thus does God himself give of himself unto man, to make man like himself. That
man may be satisfied as God is satisfied; but differently thus, God seeing all
things in himself, from himself, and man seeing what is of God in him, is of
his free gift, from his free Love.

39. That is, to have a heart according to Gods heart, to be always satisfied
in all Gods dealings and doings.

40. All that God does is to have his own will accomplished and done, and if our
will (as it should) be according to his will, then are we well content in and
with all that is done; for nothing is done or can be done, but that, and only
that which God will have to be done.

41. The honor of all the Saints, is Gods honor, and their glory is to bring
him glory, or to glorify him as the Saints and Angels do in glory.

42. Ah Lord God, let me as the Be, make honey of the weeds as well as of the
flowers, fetch good out of evil, as well as increase and multiply good from
good, condemn sin where ever I see it, hate it most where I see it most, speak
most against it, when I hear it most spoken for, and let the hearing and seeing
of grace in others and from others, beget more grace in me, and let me lay it
up as the Be does honey in the hive, for my self to feed on in the winter of
temptation and affliction, and that as honey it may be sweet and comfort others
also.

43. I am resolved, O Lord, not to be satisfied, until I find within me that
thou art well and truly satisfied with me, and by my whole life and
conversation.

44. I am, O Lord, resolved (through grace) not to be satisfied, until I find
thy holy Laws so writ on my heart, that my heart be according to thy heart, and
set and bent, and resolved entirely and continually, and universally in all
things to keep thy Law.

45. Ah Lord, let me so find thee always within me, that I may always do the
things, and only the things that are right in thy sight.

46. Let my Love be so true, O Lord, for thee, as I may only love thy truth,
that truth only, in all things, may be only lovely unto me.

47. Let my goings out be comings in unto me, that is, Let all, O Lord, that I
do, bring me good, yea even my falls make me rise and stand the faster, relying
on thy strength, O God my God, who only art able to keep me both from stumbling
and from falling.

48. Watch, O Lord, watch over my heart continually, that I depaat not from
thee, but that I do the things always, that are in some measure according to
thy heart.

49. The Lord gives his graces unto those that rightly ask them, as we would do
water at a Fountain unto all those should come for it in a due and right
manner, give as well a thousand, ten thousand, yea a hundred times ten thousand
draughts to any one that should need it, as one draught alone (so our God) such
is his fullness, such is his goodness, that he gives as well and as willingly,
all the desires of our hearts and souls as one desire alone, yea as the least
desire o^ all, if we do but ask as we should ask, and for that end or those
ends alone, that he has appointed them, and us to have them; for to give much,
or little, is to him all alike; he cannot (such a Fountain is he) be emptied,
no nor lessened at all by whatever he gives, he is still the same, full of all
blessedness, and goodness, always ready to distribute and give unto the
necessity of the Saints, never weary nor standing still, yesterday, to day and
to morrow and for ever the same.

50. Therefore to have much, is to ask much, ask and ye shall have, that your
joy may be full. God does not say or mean that we may or can be too bold, that
we may ask too much. And to take away this scruple or doubt, he promises that
what ever we shall ask (believingly) in the name of Jesus Christ, we shall
receive if we open our mouths wide, then we have his promise that he will fill
them, which implies that the way or means to have much, is to ask much, this
holy Coveting and Ambition he is well pleased with, and so good, bountiful and
free our God is, that we cannot please him better, than after what ever we have
asked, to believe that he will give us much more by much, than we are able to
ask or think; whoever lacks Wisdom, if he ask it of God, he will give it
liberally, for he upbraids no man, neither is he a respecter of persons, having
given us Jesus Christ his only Son, the Son of his love and delight (how) shall
he not with him give us all things?

51. Surely, surely, seeing he has, and daily does give us such things as
these, Himself, his Son, and holy Spirit, we may be sure we shall (as Abraham
did) be weary, or leave asking, or God will leave giving, for weary he cannot
be: fit then thy self to be filled; and I promise and assure thee who ever thou
art, thou shall not be sent empty away, what ever thy hunger and thirst be,
whatever thy coveting and ambition be, thou shall have to fill thee, to
satisfy thee, yea over and above what ever thou can ask or think (believe)
for all things are possible, yea easy for him to do.

52. The life which delights the Lord, and which he would have us to live, is
to live unto all holiness and godliness every day, even as we would do, if we
knew it to be our last day, yea to live every moment of the day, all our days,
as if it were our very last moment.

53. The death of the Righteous every one (seemingly) desires to dye, but truly
I may say of the most that thus say, be they whoever they be, that they know
not well what they say, because, that perhaps, not one of a thousand but denies
it in his deeds for the death of the Righteous, in which the Lord delights,
as in their life, and which honors him most, even as a holy and godly, that is
God-like life does; I say this death of the Righteous is (as I take it) to dye
daily, yea every moment of the day, to all sin, even to all both great and
small, in thought, in word and deed; to dye thus, is to honor, glorify, and
dignifie more the Lord, than to dye any temporal death, on the Rack, in the
flames of fire, or to be buried alive, etc. It Is not with these, Ah not with
these Sacrifices of our fleshly lives, but with those Sacrifices of our Lusts,
Corruptions, and sinful affections, that God is well pleased, refreshed as it
were, and delighted. These Sacrifices send up sweet Odours in his Nostrils,
these are precious in his eyes; I, thus, thus doubtless it is, that the death
of the Saints are precious in the eyes of the Lord, to put to death those cruel
ones, those Enemies of our Eternal life, of our souls salvation, that put to
death the Lord of life and glory himself, (in his manhood) this is to be
valiant for the Lord, to do wonders, or wonderfully, to fight well his battles,
and to help the Lord (as it were) against the mighty; Ah how is he delighted,
that we will avenge our selves thus on his Enemies, and spare none alive, but
as Samuel did, hew Agag the King (himself) in pieces; this is to be jealous for
the Lord with a godly jealousy, and to have our love for the Almighty to be as
hot as fire; Ah thus, thus, if we pull out our right eyes, and cut off our
right hands, we shall be sure to enter into life, but not maimed, but whole and
entire. And he that is thus willing to lose his life, shall save it, and he
that will spare or save his life, that is his life of sin, or fleshly life, to
live in and commit sin, shall surely lose his life, both Spiritual, Temporal
and Eternal.

54. He that thus dies all the day long, all his life long, dies much more
gloriously by much in the eyes of the Lord God, and in the eyes of all his
enlightened Children; than if he did suffer in the flesh constantly all his
days the cruellest death of any of all the Martyrs. Ah to suffer thus, is to
suffer truly, is to suffer rightly for the cause of Christ, and the honor of
the Gospel; for it is not, Ah no, our outward sufferings in the flesh* that
delights the Lord, for he is a God o^ joy, and would that we did always
rejoice and is there any other thing that we do, o^ can do, that gives us so
much cause to rejoice, as to be delivered but of the hands of all our Enemies,
and to see them lie slai^ before our eyes, as the Egyptians. Ah then, then may
we serve him without fear, then and thereby do we serve the Lord in
Righteousness, and true Holiness, and he that is thus faithful unto the death,
to put sin to death every moment of his life, shall be sure in the end of his
days, to have the full end of all his desires, and to wear for ever the Crown
of Eternal life; he that thus fights shall overcome, he that thus suffers no
sin to reign in his mortal body, shall reign with Christ in bliss and glory,
world without end, Amen, Amen.

55. Thus then to live, and thus do dye, is to be sure we shall live with
Christ Eternally.

56. He that does live thus, and thus puts sin to death, lives that life and
dies that death daily, as most of all honors God, and which brings him most
glory, which is the thing only, or the only thing, (as I suppose) that all Gods
Children most desire and long for in this life.

57. He that thus lives, shall ever live; and he that thus puts sin to death,
is past from death to life, and shall never see death, that is the power of
death to terrify him, for death is swallowed up into Victory; death when it
comes shall carry him in triumph, yea triumphantly into the blessed arms of his
blessed Jesus, who has thus redeemed him from Hell, from sin, and from death,
to live ever with himself in bliss and glory, an Eternal life.

58. When I shall find that sin is thus put to death in me, then will I say
boldly, that the Lord has sent his destroying Angel to do it, that he has
done it with the word of his power, with his own voice, who is that blessed
Archangel of the Covenant of peace and reconciliation.

59. When I shall find that sin is thus rooted up in me by the roots, then will
I say, that the Lords hand has done it, for I know that none but the Lord
himself can do such wonders, and work wonderfully thus.

60. When I shall find that sin is destroyed in me, then will I say that the
Lord has visited me graciously, that he has spoken peace to my poor soul, and
revived it, and refreshed it; then may I say he has been with me of a truth,
and not regarded the low estate of his poor Servant.

61. When I shall find sin dead, then will I say, as the Lord lives, and
because he was put to death, and now lives, I shall live also.

62. Sin being thus banished and cast out, then shall I see my self free, and
taken O Lord into Covenant with thee, then will I say, I am no longer under the
Law, but under Grace, which gracious favor, O Lord, do me, that I may
henceforth and for ever live unto and for thine Eternal honor and glory.

63. Ah Lord God, that were fastened to the Cross for my sins, and to save my
poor Soul; fasten my sins there, and let them never get loose again, and Ah
Lord, let my Soul live ever in thee and possess thee ever.

64. Ah Lord that raignest over all Principalities and Powers, reign I most
humbly beseech thee over all these Princes and Powers, that have Dominion over
me, that I may be brought into subjection unto thy most holy Laws and live
obediently, keeping all thy Divine Commandments. That thou, O Lord God, who art
God over all blessed for ever and for ever, may be my God ever, over all and
bless me also for ever and for ever, that I may ever live in thee, and thou in
me. Amen, Amen.

65. If we be so willing to unstrip our selves of our clothing at night, and
lie down on our beds naked to uncloath our selves of all our glory and honor,
pomp and beauty, and to unmind that we are what we are, to the end we may enjoy
a few hours quiet and rest; Ah how willing shall we be to unstrip our selves of
all that we possess, and of our lives too, when that last long night of death
shall come and appear to fetch us up from hence, that we may be ever with the
Lord, who is our Eternal and everlasting Portion, our infinite and
incomprehensible good, and blessed rest and peace, which shall be as it were,
ever beginning, and never end nor cease.

66. Ah our God that art what thou art, and yet wilt be pleased to be ours, and
to own us for thine own.

67. Ah Lord God, though others satisfy themselves to hear of thee, let me not
be satisfied till mine eye see thee.

68. Though others, O Lord, be well contented to know thee as men teach, Let me
I beseech thee be satisfied only with thine own teachings, to know thee as thou
art to be known, that is, to see and find, and feel thee in me, dwelling,
reigning, and ruling there, being all in all, and bringing into subjection all
powers that lift up themselves in me against thee.

69. Ah Lord God, how much better is it thus to have thee, than to have all
things out of thee? as the Corn, Wine, and Oil of the World.

70. What, Ah what is Earth to Heaven, these things below, to the things that
are above, but as pebbles to pearls, as dross to gold, or as a shadow to the
most glorious and most sublime substance.

71. The one being life, the other death, the one fully satisfies, the other is
vain, and brings nothing but vexation of Spirit with it.

72. We cannot know God till we altogether forget our selves, we cannot hear
God till we are altogether deaf to our selves, and to all things out of God; we
cannot see God, till we are stark blind to all things besides him, and that is
not of him; we cannot find God as he is, until we have lost our selves, and
all things else that concerns him not (so do and prosper.)

73. As we know not our latter end, nor are not able to number our days, so are
we not at all able to tell what God is, unless he tell us, nor to hear him
unless he open our hearts, and give us understanding, nor comprehend him until
he has made us one with himself, and given us his own Spirit to know him by.

74. Thus if we live to move after his call, and be obedient unto his voice, we
shall so hear, that our Souls shall live and for ever rejoice, that we live
thus to obey him.

75. Ah Lord God Almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth, thou art the all of all
those that know thee; they that know thee, O God, as thou art to be known, care
to know nothing else, thou art altogether alsufficient to content and satisfy
them, with all pleasures and delights, their joys are full when that they enjoy
thee; And they then say with Jacob, that they have all, and with David, desire
nothing else either in Heaven above, or Earth beneath. Their wills are so
swallowed up into thine, that they are not theirs but thine, and thus to live
to thee, and in thee, they count it only to live; and out of thee (to be) as if
they were not, as if they had no being.

76. I am a Creature, but thy Creature, O Lord my God; I am a man, but created
for thy self, for thy glory and my Everlasting good and happiness, and shall I
know that I am thus, such a one, and not be satisfied? for is there any thing
else that can satisfy me thus?

77. Ah Lord thou set before me life and death, good and evil, light and
darkness, Heaven and Earth, the things above and the things below. Ah suffer me
not I most humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ, to prefer pebbles to pearls,
dross to gold, darkness to light, death to life, evil to good, Earth to Heaven,
these low things here below, to those high and most transcendent glorious
things above. But let me give my self to thee, O God, that have provided and
given such rich, rare, and precious things to me, enjoying them; let me not
care, seek for, or mind these, having thee, let me be fully satisfied, and
rejoice evermore with unspeakable joy.

78. Being thy favorite, O God, who art King of kings, and Lord of lords,
living in thy fear and favor, shall I not rejoice much more by much than they
do, or can do, that are but favorites to men, and have but their favor: they
shall all pass away, but thee and thy word of grace ingrafted in me, shall
endure for ever and for ever.

79. Ah Lord God, pour out of thy self into me more and more, that I may be
made to rejoice always with unspeakable joy, yea that my joys may be full.

80. Let m^, O Lord, rejoice much more in despising these things here below,
than in prizing of them, and to have a heart to trample them under my feet,
than to set them up in my thoughts and affections. These being low as they are,
let me, O God, keep them always under my feet, and trample on them as on dirt
and dung, minding these high and holy things above, which thou give only in
love, and to those only whom thou love.

81. Ah Lord God, swallow me up into thy self, that I may be found there, naked
and empty of all things out of thee and besides thee, so that I may only
possess thee my only good, bliss and blessedness.

82. Ah Lord God, set always before my eyes mine Eternal and Everlasting
Portion of thy grace, and grant that I may be made thereby a worthy partaker of
thine infinite and eternal glory in glory; so be it, Lord, so be it.

83. If any other condition were fitter for me than my present condition, I
know that the Lord would give it me, and fit it for me, and fit me for it.

84. Ah Lord, give me then a contented and thankful heart always, and in all
conditions whatever, seeing thou have caused me this day to know a fresh, and
to be assured, that thou art always with me, take care for me, and watchest
heedfully over me, and that thou will be ever unto me, as hitherto thou have
been, my support, strength, assistance and satisfaction.

85. If God be come down into our hearts then all powers that are not of God,
are brought down, are brought under into subjection unto his holy Laws, by
obedience unto his Divine Commandments; for where he is present, all that is
not of him, must absent it self; Two being not agreed, they cannot live
together, and the stronger will turn out the weaker.

86. Ah Lord, let me always eye thee eying of me, and let my eye be never off
from thee; for I know that thine is not, nor cannot be, off from me.

87. Ah Lord, let me seriously consider, that all things that are done by thee,
are done for the good of all those that love thee.

88. Therefore whatever is done at any time, whether in Heaven or Earth, let me
always say, so Lord would I have it, seeing thou that art Lord of all things
and over all, even God blessed for ever and for ever, wilt have it so.

89. Ah Lord, suffer not my vile will, to control at any time thy Divine Will;
but let thine be always mine, and mine according unto thine.

90. Ah Lord, suffer me never to go about to bring thy will to mine, but always
and in all things labor with all the Powers of my Soul to bring mine to thine.

91. And after I have asked let me be content with what ever I have, knowing
that thou, O Lord, see and know my condition.

92. Ah Lord, swallow me up into this blessed condition, that all conditions be
a like unto me, and that I may esteem them blessings, and thee and me alike
blessed, not in a like degree, but in truth. Thou God blessed over all, and I
in thee, blessed by thee, through thy blessed goodness unto me.

93. Ah Lord be thou with me where ever I am (mine) and then I am sure I shall
not want any thing, because, O God, thou that art all fullness wilt, I know, and
am sure of, continually fill me.

94. Thou art, O God, my good, and therefore no evil can or shall come nigh me
to hurt me; for I know that thou always watchest over me for good, and that
thou never slumbrest nor sleep.

95. Ah Lord, thy shadow is unto me safety, let me then always sit under the
shadow of thy wings (that thy, Word in me) may be always the food and the life
of my Soul.

96. Ah Lord God, if thou have made our life thus sweet unto us over all
things, and above all things, it is because thy self, being thus the life of
our life, we may be taught to spend it so for thee, as we may ever preserve it
for thee, to live unto thee for ever and for ever, to praise thee.

97. Ah Lord, I praise thee for that thou have at this time made me so to touch
thee feelingly, so as to feel virtue come out from thee into me, that mine eyes
are opened so, as I see thee and know thee to be with me and in me.

98. Ah Lord, let this light of thine never depart from me, but let me more and
more be swallowed up into it, that by it I may be made more and more able to
comprehend it and live in it.

99. Ah Lord God, let these thy dawnings draw me after thee, to follow thee the
Lamb of Righteousness where ever thou go, and let me never grow weary, nor
faint in the way where ever thou shall lead me, or what ever thou shall bid me
to do, though it be to spend and to be spent. But grant that I may be always
thine, as I know and see through thy good grace in me, that thou art mine.

100. Ah what a most blessed thing is it to live in the Peace of the Lord, and
to dye with his Peace.

101. Ah Lord, suffer me not to purchase the whole World (if it were to be had)
with the committing of one sin against Conscience; for what shall it profit me
to gain the whole World, if I lose my own Soul?

102. Ah Lord, how happy is the man that knows thee only, that is, is so
swallowed up into thee, as he knows none, nor nothing but thee; thou art, O
God, over all, and above all in him, and he is only thine, and none but thine.

103. Ah how low, how low is it, to know any thing but thee, O God? or
incomparison of thee?

104. Ah Lord God, let me so know thee, as I may comprehend thee, that I may
despise all other knowledge, and rest satisfied in this one thing, only
necessary.

105. To know thee the true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent, is the
depth of Wisdom, and all things to it (in comparison of it) is mere foolishness.

106. The Angels know not more, and this knowledge of theirs is but in a
degree, and, ah how low and inferior to that knowledge that is in thee, that
is, O God, in thee, in thee.

107. This knowledge is so sweet in its manifestation, that it drowns and
consumes both men and Angels in its contemplation.

108. This knowledge is so deep and sweet, that all, both Men and Angels, do
thee only greet.

109. Thus to know thee, O God, is to be in some measure like unto thee, filled
with all wisdom and knowledge.

110. But this (alone) is given us all to know from thy self, who know all
things, and give unto none but what thou know, is for thine own glory, O
God, and their Everlasting good.

111. Fill, O Lord, fill all the hearts of those that unfeignedly seek thee,
and this thy Wisdom, that they may become fools to themselves, and only wise in
th^^, and for thee.

112. Ah Lord God, what is it to know all things from the Cedar to the Hyssop,
if we have not our understanding enlightened, to comprehend that we are
comprehended of thee.

113. Let me only have this honor, and I will despise all other honors and
dishonours; yea let me be despised by all, so that I may be thus honored, O
God, by thee, by thee, O God, by thee.

114. All things, O God, compared to the knowledge of thee, is not, nor shall
not, I trust, be ever at all regarded or esteemed by me.

115. For if I can but once attain to know thee as thou art to be known; I am
sure I shall have all that I can desire to know; to possess, or to have.

116. Having thee alone, O God, I shall have all that is, or can ever be
attained, either here, or hereafter.

117. I know that there is none in Heaven that have more, or that desire more;
let me have what they have, and I shall then be as they be (satisfied) but
till. I have as much (at least) as any, I cannot say that I have enough; for my
desires are as large. And till I am thus filled as they are, that thus know
thee, possess thee, and adore thee; I cannot but cry out with continual
hungring and thirstings, Oh feed me, Oh fill me, for I am empty and want all
things; if thou do not, O God, thus fill me with thy bounty, and satisfy me
with thy loving kindness, and cause me to see and know that thou art mine, and
that I am only thine.

118. Ah Lord God, I know it is thee only, only thee, that can cast out
Devils; Ah cast out I most humbly beseech thee all the Devils that are in me;
thou, O God, that raisest from death to life, and that forgivest all our sins
freely, even for thine own names sake only.

119. All that is done in me, is done by thee, O God, it is thine arm that
brings me so great Salvation.

120. Ah Lord God, thou only art able to teach, and none but those that are
immediately taught by the spirit, know thee, or thy teachings.

121. Ah Lord, teach me then but to know thee as thou art known by thine, and I
will not care for any other knowledge, or any other thing; for he that has
this one thing given him, may truly say as Jacob did, that he has all.

122. Thou art, O Lord God, that well of life, and water of life, that whoever
drinks of, that is, has thee in himself, shall never more thirst again after
any other thing: for thou will, O Christ, be ever in him a well of water,
springing in him, even unto Eternal life.

123. Thou art, O Christ, thou art that bread of life that comes down from
Heaven (into our hearts) and feedest our souls in the assurance of faith,
sight, and knowledge, unto Everlasting life.

124. Thou art ours, and we are thine, and this we are taught by thine own
spirit dwelling in us, and not by any other teaching or science.

125. And being thus persuaded and assured, our hearts do continually rejoice,
yea and shall rejoice continually, even for ever and for ever.

126. Such is the Mighty Power of God, unto those that know him, and wait on
him, that he makes (as it were, at times) the very stones in the wall to look
on us, and to speak good unto us.

127. Such is Gods goodness, that his presence brings with it all good, and
makes it present to us, and dissipates all evil, so as we are in some measure
changed from evil to good, and emptied of all evil, and filled with all good.
But Ah, its duration for the most part, for the most of times, is little, and
soon departs; such is our forwardness, and proneness to all evil, and our
aversness and deadness to all that is good, which makes the Children of God
(with Paul) to be weary, yea stark weary of themselves, as of a dead body, yea
to esteem their bodies, their own natural affections, even as dead bodies;
wherefore they desire to be dissolved, finding such a Law in their members as
continually fights and warreth against the Law of God in their minds, and
leads them so often Captive unto the Law of sin, that they complain in the very
language of that blessed Apostle; Ah wretched man, miserable worm that I am,
when shall I be delivered, when shall I be freed and set at liberty, when shall
it be with me as my Soul desires it were, to live unto God as I should, as I
would, and not thus live in death, or die all the day long whilst I am alive?

128. Ah most glorious and most Holy Lord God, it is thy glory that thou art
what thou art, and it is our mighty shame that we are what we are, thy purity
and thy power, O God, is only known unto thy self; we indeed see something of
thee. But all that all the Angels and blessed in Heaven see, were all their
sight and knowledge in one of them, would yet be much less by much than the
least drop is to the whole Ocean; yea than one moment is or would be unto
Eternity. Thou art, O God, thou art incomprehensibly glorious, powerful and
great; there is no end of thy goodness, for it shall continue for ever, and for
ever, world without end, so be it, O Lord, so be it, Amen, Amen.

129. Let me, O God, my God, be so swallowed up into thee, as I may ask after
nothing but thee, as I may speak of nothing but the, nor hear nothing in me but
thee, that I may desire nothing but thee, and may live unto nothing but thee,
so that I may be all thine, and nothing but thine.

130. This knowledge, O God, of thee passes all understanding, none can speak
of it, unless thou speak it in him, and that is according unto us, and not
according to thee: for if thou should speak unto us according to thy self,
Ah Lord, we could not hear thee so, as to comprehend it.

131. As we have thee, O God, so we speak of thee; as we know thee, so we
declare thee; as we feel thee, so we praise thee; and as we comprehend thee, so
we prise thee; and according as thou art unto us, so we publish it unto others.
But alas, alas, what is this to thee, to what thou art.

132. Let not him that has the most, boast, for he has naught but what is
given him.

133. Let not him that has the least, be discouraged, for he has so much as
will do him most good at the last.

134. Let not him that is fallen cast himself down over much, for God (if he
seek him) will raise him up again.

135. Let every man wait, and in due time he shall have so much of that, which
God sees and knows is best for him.

136. The best of all, is that which God sees to be best of all for us, and so
much he will not fail to give thee (O man) who ever thou art, if thou rely and
depend on him.

137. And when we have received it, let us lay it up, that is, lay it out, that
it may increase, for he that has most, more shall be given him, he shall have
most of all.

138. The blessing of the Almighty, shall, and will always go along with those
that diligently seek him, they shall be sure to see no evil all their days.

139. The Blessedness and the happiness of the Saints, is to see God, and to
know him to be theirs.

140. He shall have him that would have him, he shall be with him that desires
him, he shall be taught by him that gives himself up unto him, and he shall
know him that follows after him in his ways, and that delights in the
keeping of all his Commandments.

141. Delight thy self in the Lord, so shall no evil come upon thee, but all
good shall follow thee every where.

142. Fear the Lord, and thy days shall be many.

143. Watch over all thy words, and let thy thoughts be as the light, without
any darkness.

144. Have him always nigh thee, that thou may not do the thing that is not
of him.

145. Comfort thy self, and shake off all fear, for the Lord will honor thee
by doing his will in the midst of all those where he shall carry thee.

146. Give thy self up to him more and more, that thou may be taught by him,
and know him.

147. Let thy knowledge be of him to know his will, that thou may walk in
his holy ways, and do all that he shall command thee, that thou may possess
the good that he has laid up for thee in himself.

148. Ah Lord, cause me to see every thing as it is in it self, then shall I
esteem all things out of thee, as Paul did, as dirt, dung, and dross (compared
to thee) then shall I also know well, how to want, and how to abound.

149. Ah Lord, cause me more and more to know thee, as thou art to be known,
for then shall I be more and more weary of all things out of thee, and esteem
them as Pebbles to Pearls, yea all, as nothing: for alas, alas, what is all,
when well considered, when seen and known to be just as it is?

150. If we do not, O God, see thee in all things, what do we see, when our
understandings are enlightened by thee; but Poverty in the greatest riches; but
ignominy in the greatest honor and glory; but foolishness in the greatest
wisdom; weakness in the greatest strength; deformity in the greatest beauty,
and mere baseness in the very greatest splendour of earthly Majesty. All things
put together, I am sure, are to such an eye, but a thing of naught, a poor,
empty low thing, nay nothing.

151. Ah Lord, shall we be such fools as to esteem our selves wise, to get and
lay up such things as can do us no good, as can stand us in no stead at all in
the greatest need of all; shall we, Ah shall we spend our time, our most
precious time, for that which is so full of vanity, that makes us so vain, as
to think our selves wise, and to lay it up even against that great and terrible
day of the Lord, when the reward will be shame and grief, and anguish, and
vexation of spirit.

152. Ah let them, O Lord God, that know thee, not trifle away their precious
time thus, but spend it to get thee sure, who only can make us truly rich,
wise, honorable, beautiful and blessed for ever and ever.

153. All the Angels are but as a drop, compared, O God, to thee; they would be
as a troubled Sea, or a Sea of trouble, if thou should go out of them.

154. None knows thee, O God, or can speak of thee as thou art, thou art
glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders; the earth (man) is
filled with thy Majesty and thy glory; the dust (man) does praise thee.

155. Ah Lord, let me not mince thy words, cut or carve them, or put them into
any other frame, than as thou shall give them me, if they go forth rough, thou will make them smooth, and fit them for those, for whom thou have appointed
them.

156. He that has chosen the Lord for his God, shall have him, yea has him,
and shall ever have him.

157. Ah Lord God, that soul that loves thee, and knows how lovely thou art,
cannot at all be satisfied with any, nay not with all these high things here
below, the riches, the honors, and the pleasures of the world.

158. It is only Heaven, and the things of Heaven that are in his eye; for all
the things on earth he easily thinks them into nothing, and winks their beauty
into blackness and deformity.

159. Ah Lord, open the doors of Heaven, yea set wide open those Everlasting
gates of thy goodness, that the scales of ignorance and worldliness being taken
away from before the eyes of my understanding; I may through thy light, see
light, even that light of thine, to see and contemplate those most glorious
things in glory, even those which thou have laid up and prepared, and wilt give
unto all those that wait upon thee, that desire thee, know thee, and love thee.

160. Such as have thee, O God, have, and are, sure they shall have always all
and above by much what they can desire to have, ask or crave.

161. Thou, O our God, that fillest Heaven and Earth, with thy bounty and thy
goodness, wilt not fail to fill also, all the hearts of all those, that draw
nigh unto thee, and that depend upon thee.

162. Such shall be sure to lack nothing that take care how to please thee.

163. They that make this one thing their only pleasure, shall never lack the
thing that shall make them happy and blessed for ever.

164. Thou love us not, O God, because that we are what we are, but because
thou art what thou art, thy Love is free from thy self, none constrains thee,
as none can give unto thee.

165. Ah Lord God, I know that thou love us, not because we love thee, but we
it is that love thee, because that thou love us.

166. Thou art, O God, all things to all those that depend upon thee, food to
the hungry, drink to the thirsty, riches to the poor, wisdom to the simple,
liberty to them that are bound, comfort to the comfortless, even all things to
all, in life, in death and after death.

167. Let the wicked the men of the World have their fill of the World, the
Corn, Wine and Oil thereof: but let me, O God my God, have my fill of thee; for
thou art much better by much, than all things either in Heaven above, or on
Earth below; do but shine upon me, O Lord, with the light of thy Countenance,
that I may see thy light, and I shall rejoice with unspeakable joy.

168. All things, O Lord God, compared to thee, are blackness and darkness and
nothingness, thou only art and there is none besides thee, wherefore my Soul
says with David, whom have I in Heaven but thee? and what is there on all the
Earth in comparison of thee? all other joys are false joys, and all other
things are nothing, but mere toys; for with thee, O God, and only with thee is
all joy, unspeakable joy, and everlasting pleasures are at thy right hand.

169. Ah Lord our God, thou art all in all things; for without thy presence,
the best and the greatest things are nothing, to that Soul that knows thee
what thou art.

170. Thou art, O God, the sweet of all sweets, the light of the light, the
glory and the bliss in glory. As in thy presence is all joy: So in thy absence
is all sorrow, to all Souls that are acquainted with thee, and to whom thou
have manifested thy self. Therefore the Angels, those glorious, knowing
Creatures, endeavor to pry into all thy mysteries. Such an endless and
bottomless delight there is in them all, from the greatest to the very least of
all.

171. This indeed is such a high and glorious Mount, from which we may justly
desire never to come down, but to have there our abiding place. A Tabernacle to
dwell in for ever and for ever, not only to behold the glory of our Lord, but
the Lord himself, of all our good and our glory.

172. Ah Lord God, that art the wisdom of the wise, the strength of the strong,
the honor of the honorable, the power of the powerful, the might of the
mighty, the riches of the rich, the goodness of those that are good, the
blessedness of the blessed, the beauty of the beautiful, the joy of those that
rejoice, the light of those that see thy light, the Crown and the glory of
those that are in glory. Thou only art and there is none besides thee, our God,
even God, blessed for ever and for ever.

173. Ah Lord, I know and am assured, that it cannot be better with me, than to
be with thee.

174. And to be with thee here on Earth, whilst on Earth, thou know, O God,
that I esteem it to be my only Heaven.

175. Let me thus have thee, I say, always have thee thus, and thou know, O
Lord, that know all things, that I have all that I would have; for thou only
art all mine all.

176. Ah that thou would, O God, take all things from me, that hinder thy
blessed approach to me, and that cause me to draw back from thee.

177. Ah Lord, thou know that there is nothing that I have, but I most
willingly offer thee, and would cheerfully give thee to have thee.

178. My life is not dear to me at all to spend for thee, thou know, O God
my God, that I account it a thing of naught. If thou will have it, O God, take
it, for I confess it is thine, and not mine.

179. Yea I trust that all mine is thine, that I am thine, all, both Spirit,
Soul, and Body, and that thee, O God, and all thine is mine, both thy Kingdom,
power, and glory, for ever, and for ever.

180. Ah blessed change, to be thus changed into all blessedness, even so, as
to have the Lord God for our everlasting Portion.

181. Weary me, O Lord God, weary me more and more of my self, that I may be
dissolved, and be with thee, which is best of all.

182. For out of thee, O God, my Heart is not satisfied, neither can any thing
but thy self satisfy it, either that is in Heaven above, or on the Earth below.

183. What, O Lord, what shall I say unto thee, thou know all things, and of
me and my Heart, more than I can tell thee, make me and it, O God, such as thou will have me to be, that thou may ever own me for thy own.

184. Ah Lord, Let me be always on the wing after thee, yea let me pursue hard
after thee continually; let me run and not grow weary, and walk and not faint.

185. O God, that art my God, heat I beseech thee my affections, increase my
desires, build me up that I may be a living stone in thy house, and ever speak
loudly thy praises.

186. Ah Lord God, let me always have before me Heaven and Hell, let me see
Heaven as it is prepared for the Just, and Hell as it is prepared for the
unjust; Heaven for those that ever eyed it, and rejoiced in it, and Hell for
those that never feared it, nor believed it, but by their ungodly lives lived
as if there had not been either a Heaven to recompense the Godly, or a Hell to
punish the ungodly.

187. Ah Lord, cause me always to eye those things that are invisible, that eye
never saw, that ear never heard, nor that ever entered at any time into the
heart of any man to conceive; even those endless everlasting joys, that thou
have, O God, prepared in Jesus Christ, and laid up for all those that love thee.

188. Let me, Ah let me always harken to hear that sweet and blessed voice of
thy Holy Spirit within me, saying, (of all the glory that is in glory) these
are all thine, yea all that is mine is thine, and thou art mine.

189. Ah Lord, let me never forget that all these earthly things, must pass
away us in a moment in the twinkling of an eye. But that our Souls are
immortal, and shall live for ever and ever, in endless unexpressible joys, or
endless, everlasting unexpressible Torments.

190. How low, Ah how low are the conceptions of any brain, yea the words of
Men or Angels to express and show forth the life to come, either of the one or
of the other, of those beloved of God, that shall ever live and abide in his
Love, which is in himself, or for those that are so hated by him, as shall for
ever be cast out of his blessed presence, and enjoy the cursed wretched company
of the Devils, and his Angels, in burning and unquenchable flames, where shall
be yelling and roaring, weeping and wailing, curses and horrid blasphemies,
against that God and his goodness, which they know is holy, just and good: and
this as fuel shall feed that fire, that cannot be quenched, and give life to
that gnawing worm (an accusing condemning Conscience.) that shall never dye;
and thus those poor Souls must and shall live everlastingly.

191. Ah Lord God, give me Faith to believe, and grace to repent, that I come
not into this place of torment; but for ever enjoy those eternal and
everlasting joys that thou have from all Eternity prepared, and wilt only give
unto those for whom thou have prepared it.

192. Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly, and fill me, and feed me, and satisfy me
here with thy good things, that I may ever live to enjoy them and thee.

193. Thy appearances, O great God, are like thy self (yea they are thy self)
but few (I fear) there are that thus see them, and know them thus; thy power
thou show most in weakness, in such as see, confess and acknowledge
themselves to be weak; for thou make the weak strong, and causest (many
times) the very meanest and simplest, even those (according to the knowledge of
men) that know least, to know most; for thou hidest thy self from those that
seek that knowledge that puffs up; but revealest thy self, and show thine
appearance as the Sun at noon day, to those that deny themselves, and seek only
that Wisdom to know thee, that they may give up themselves unto thee.

194. Thus, O God, thou feedest the hungry, but the rich thou sendest empty
away, thou confoundest the wisdom of the wise, but make glad the hearts of
thy holy ones, which are the humble ones.

195. Let me not, O God, be cast down, to doubt of thy Love, how low so ever
thou shall cast me, nor lifted up (above measure) how high so ever thou shall
raise me.

196. Ah Lord God, let my knowledge be, that thou live in me, and I in thee,
that thou art mine and that I am thine.

197. Ah Lord, destroy the adversaries and enemies of my Salvation (here) which
is thy shining manifesting and appearing in me, unto me, my knowledge of thee
to be mine, and I to be thine; my dying to self, to flesh and World, to all
that is not of thee, and my living only to thee, O God, the God of my
Salvation, to thee, to thee.

198. My hereafter Salvation, I know that none nor nothing can hinder me from.
I shall (I know) enjoy thee, O God, possess thee, behold thee, know thee and
see thee, as thou art to be seen and known. I say, and am sure that nothing is
able or shall hinder me from this blessedness which thou have prepared for me.

199. Ah were it not for the enemies of our Salvation, which are our own
fleshly lusts and vile affections, which fight and war continually against
thee, O God, our Salvation (in us) we should see, know, find and feel the same
Salvation (ever here) as hereafter, we should contemplate thy beautiful beauty,
and thy most glorious glory here, even as in glory hereafter.

200. Ah Lord God, fight then on my behalf, consume and destroy with an utter
destruction all these my enemies which hinder (here,) this my so great
Salvation, consume and make wast all their powers, and deliver my poor Soul,
because I trust in thee, and in thy great name, which are thy faithful promises.

201. As a Fountain gives freely without intermission, or constraint (but the
natural power, or fullness that forces,) even so should we that live in God and
possess him, and his fullness, be always giving and communicating of what we
have. And as a fountain that is stopped a while, being hindered of continuing
its largess, does as it were during that space, make or lay up provision, to be
more larger in its bounty; even so me thinks should we be and do, if for some
time, occasion or opportunity present not, but we are as it were stopped from
giving, being unstopt, that is, occasion presenting it self to our charity, we
should show forth by our gross streams of largeness, in giving, that the
restraint (of not having occasion,) was a constraint, and against the
supernatural, now natural faculties of our Souls affections.

202. If thus we were always communicating, and when we find not occasion so to
do, had in us always a vehement earnest burning desire to give, Ah how like
should we be unto our good God, and Heavenly Father, who gives continually, and
is never weary nor repents.

GLORY TO GOD.
In Bourdeaux, Anno 1661.
1. THe love of God is the best of Heaven, the very glory in glory.

2. The love of God makes all things lovely to all those that know that they
are his beloved.

3. Gods love is sweeter than the honey or the honey comb, much more desired,
and to be desired more by much, than all fine gold, and the most precious
Pearls.

4. Gods love is better than Wine to comfort the heart, it is the fatness,
marrow, and sweetness of Heaven, that feeds, feasts, and solaceth the Soul.

5. There is nothing in Heaven above to be compared to Gods love.

6. And all things that are here below; ah how much below are they all to the
love of God.

7. He that has, or is in the love of God, has all God, for God is all love.

8. Ah Lord God, love me then so, that I may be filled with love to love thee
as I should love thee, to fear thee, as I should fear thee, to honor thee, as
I should honor thee, and to obey thee, as I should obey thee in all things, in
spirit, soul and body, by all my thoughts, words and actions, now, henceforth,
and for evermore, Amen.

9. Ah Lord God, how unspeakably great is thy love to all thy Children and
Servants, turning all things to their good, even the very worst of things
(their sins.)

10. God shows his great love unto us, how he loves us, by shedding abroad
his love so in our hearts, as we are made thereby to love him, for naturally we
love him not; and therefore did he not give us love to love him, we would, nor
could never love him.

11. Ah powerful love that makes (of us haters) to become true lovers, to love
him in very truth, whom we hated truly.

Yea those that have the love of God thus in their hearts, love him so, as it
may be truly said of them, that they love nothing else, for they love him above
their goods, or good name, above their Children, above their Wives, yea much
more, and above their very lives. They can, and easily do, when called thereto,
give up all to him and for him, his love does constrain, to love him again, the
heart is so in love with him, finding him so lovely, that it cries out
continually for more love, that it may love him more; for nothing comforts such
souls as Gods love, they make and account his love as himself, and himself to
be his love, and being thus loved by him, and living thus in his love, they
live in him and he in them, which is the very life of their lives, and the very
bliss and Heaven of their Heaven.

13. Such is the love of God unto us his Children, that he swallows us up and
houseth us in himself, that we may be all his, and he all ours, that we may put
him so on, as be made like him, and partake continually of him, which is our
Crown and Glory, yea our Crown in Glory which will make us shine more beautiful
and glorious than ten thousand Sons.

14. Cause me, O Lord God, to declare what thou will have me to declare; cause
me to believe what thou will have me to believe, cause me to know what thou will have me to know, and enable me to do all that thou will have me to do,
that I may be filled with thee, to live to thee and in thee to thine Eternal
honor, praise and glory, so be it, O Lord, so be it, Amen, Amen.

15. Go forth, O God, go forth before me, that I may follow thee where ever
thou go, that thou will be unto me a light by night (in the midst of my
natural darkness) which is darker than the blackest night, and be also unto me
a fire by day (in the midst of thine own light in me) which is clearer and
brighter than the brightest day, that I may burn, O God, in the Sacred and
Divine flames of saving knowledge, and obedience unto my lives end.

16. Instruct me, O Lord, in thine own Laws, and write them so upon my heart,
that I may never depart from them.

17. Feast me and fill me, O Lord, so with thine own self, that I may be all
thine, and thou all mine.

18. It is the spirit of Christ, or Christ in the Spirit (which is perfect
God,) living in us, that Gal. 3. 27.
makes us Christians, which is to be like Christ, to be Baptized in him, to
have put him on; and this oneness with Christ (God) is in all the Saints, all
the Saints are thus one in God, with Christ, he in us, and we in him.

MEDITATIONS ON DEATH, HOW It appears to the Godly, and to the Wicked, after a
great Sickness.
ALL happiness is in Christ and in possessing of him, and there is no true
happiness out of Christ.

All the whole world is much too little, and too low to be compared to Christ,
and to the living in him.

Though he should want bread to eat, and Clothes to put on, Christ I am sure
alone will satisfy, and truly please and content any man.

A naked Christ, a poor Christ, that is a Christ that shall bring nakedness,
and if as with Job, Poverty and uncomliness; he will be to a Soul that truly
knows him, the fairest of ten thousand, without spot or wrinkle, the only fair
and beautiful, the only desirable, the whole and only desires, the riches,
honor, treasure, and pleasure of all souls that truly know him.

A soul that truly knows Christ, cannot live as he would, without a farther
knowledge of him, living in him, to have Communion and fellowship with him,
which is of more value to him, and he prizeth it more than ten thousand worlds
and lives, Christ being above all things, and more than all things much by much.

A Christians last hour is his best hour, the hour of his Death is the best
hour of all his life; yea that hour is the true beginning of life, for Death,
sin, and Hell are swallowed up into Victory, and the Devil totally and finally
overcome.

Death is advantageous unto a Christian diverse ways; when he dies then he
begins to live in the Lord, who is the Lord of life and glory, then he shall in
a very great measure know, feel, and see the unspeakable love of God to him,
but I conceive not altogether so as it is in God, that shall even surpass our
knowledge there, for we shall be swallowed up into it, and be filled with it,
it shall contain us, but we shall not be able to contain it, and there shall we
have continual and perfect love; to love God perfectly and continually, even as
he would have us to love him, which is the continual fulfilling the whole Law,
and which will make us of all things most like himself, for God is love, and
surely it is the most lovely grace of all graces, both on earth as well as in
Heaven; and so, through grace I have found it; Ah let us never then pray
against Death, which brings us these and a thousand more Heavenly advantages,
but rather be prepared to meet it with joy, and embrace it as our best friend,
next to Christ.

Ah how sweet is Death, even almost as Heaven, to that soul that is housed in
God, and has his peace made sure with him; Death to such a soul is much better
than any life.

Ah how sweet is Death to that soul that knows Heaven is prepared for him, and
finds, and feels himself prepared for Heaven, and sees his Savior with his
blessed arms spread abroad to welcome and embrace him, and his glorious head
bowed down to kiss him, and he nigh him, to receive him into his Everlasting
Habitation of rest, joy and peace.

Death at the worst is but a sweet sleep to the body, to him that dies in the
Lord, for he rests from all his labors; but it is life to the soul, and it
shall ever live in and with the Lord of life and Glory.

I am sure to a good Christian, that is, such a one as is in some measure like
Christ that lives, and walks, and does (as far as he is able) as Christ did
when he was here in the flesh, the thoughts of death, and its being not far
off, bring him the most joy next to the Glory of God, and his interest in him
by Christ.

Ah how sweet is death to that soul that knows himself to be long since dead to
all sin.

Death is sweet to all such souls, because he be-friends them so much as in a
moment to house them in the blessed arms of their blessed Redeemer Christ Jesus.

Death is sweet to them that are in Christ, because he carries them in a moment
to live in his presence for ever and for ever, and to enjoy him as he is to be
enjoyed, and to be made like him, glorious as he is glorious, though not so
glorious.

Death is to all that are in Christ, as Elijah's Chariot of fire, which
purifies them, and expels all the remainder of Corruption that is within them,
that is by death, all evil is done away, we are no more capable of sin by
death, death is destroyed, and life appears.

But Death to the wicked is the Devils Chariot sent from Hell to bring them
quickly there, as Jehu's Chariot it drives them furiously thither, from whence
none is able to deliver.

Death to the Godly is a Consuming fire to all their sins, they shall not ever
more be seen or remembered, but it is a fire as from Gods Altar, to purify
their graces, and to make them shine more radiant than the Sun; after death
they shall in a moment be made perfectly pure, and purely perfect, and ever so
abide.

But Death to the Wicked is that fire of Hell that shall consume all the good
that ever they did, so as it shall not, nor cannot be seen nor remembered; but
it will make all the evil that ever they committed, either in thought, word or
deed, to be ever before the eyes of God, and all the blessed in Heaven, and
before the Devils, and all the damned, and their own, as if writ with a beam of
the Sun.

Death to those that are in Christ, brings them to hear that sweet and ever
blessed voice of Christ himself; come ye blessed inherit the Kingdom prepared
for you from all Eternity, and well done good and faithful^ Servant, enter thou
into the joy of thy Lord.

But death to the Wicked will bring them in a moment for ever to hear that most
doleful voice from the mouth of Christ; go ye cursed (with whom?) with the
Devil and his Angels into everlasting burning, into that fire that cannot be
quenched, which is so hot that a whole world of gold would be given for a drop
of water, and yet it is so cold as will make thee for ever to weep and wail,
and gnash thy teeth. But it may be thou will not believe it, till thou have
felt it, if thou art such a fool, and such an Enemy to thy own soul, to thine
own peril be it. I can and do assure thee on my souls salvation, that then it
will be too late, and thou shall find no place to repent in, how many tears
soever thou sheddest; wherefore whilst it is day, hear the voice of the Lord,
who wooes thee to come unto him, that thou may have life, and be no longer a
neglecter of so great Salvation as is so freely offered unto thee; and quench
not the spirit (in thee) no longer; which if thou will but now repent, and
leave for ever thy sins, thou shall find mercy, and he will seal it to thy
heart and Conscience unto the day of Redemption; awake then thou that sleep,
and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee life. But know that if thou
neglectest it, and wilt put it off till the morrow; know that there is no to
morrow in all the Scripture; it is to day if thou will hear his voice, harden
not thy heart, and consider how nigh this day may be past, and how nigh the
night may be at hand wherein no man shall work. The Lord speak so effectually
to thy dry, obdurate, rocky heart, that it may so hear as thy soul may live,
and that these words may prove a savor of death to all thy sins, and of life
unto thy poor Soul.

Death to all that are in Christ is a day of Harvest, of reaping, gathering and
gain; it will be to him a day of Espousals, she shall be married unto the
fairest Bridegroom that ever was; Absolom's Beauty will be blackness and
uncomeliness to his, to the richest that ever was; Solomon's riches will be but
as Job's poverty compared to his: And to the most highest in honor that ever
was, being King of kings and Lord of lords; to him all Kings shall fall, and
cast their Crowns at his feet.

Death to a true believer is the best of all things, because it brings him to
possess all things, yea to possess Christ himself, who is the giver of all
things, and much better than all things, much by much.

A Soul in Christ is always ready to meet and embrace death at midnight or
midday, at the Cock-crowing or any other time, he has his life as it were in
his hand, always ready and willing to lay it down, or give it up to him that
gave it him, and redeemed it; he accounts nothing his own but all Christ's, and
that he has all things both in Heaven and Earth, having him.

When Death is ready to carry us into the arms of Christ, the Ark of our peace
and rest, then the Devil many times rages most against us. But Christ our
Captain and deliverer, who will save us to the utmost, (as the Lion of the
Tribe of Judah) roareth against him, and forces him to a trembling and
yielding retreat. But to Saints our Christ appears as a Lamb, meek and
pacified, yea as the Lamb of God that takes away all our sins, that he may
present us spotless and unblameable unto his Father, that we may as Children
and Coheirs with himself, receive a Crown incorruptible, and the inheritance
prepared for us from all Eternity.

Death to us, that are dead to sin, and alive to Christ, has no sting, and
therefore cannot in the least do us any harm, wherefore we cherish him, and as
a dear friend are glad to hear of him, and so think often on him, and when he
comes, we bid him most heartily welcome, entertain him kindly, and lodge him in
our bosoms.

But to those that know not Christ, his Master, and have no interest in him,
nor his mark on their foreheads, he comes in flames of fire, and as a most
cruel Executioner, to execute on them the direful and eternal doom of God, and
so carries them post and headlong to Hell, delivering them into the hands and
power of their grand Enemy the Devil, to be tormented in everlasting burning,
world without end, or for ever and for ever.

Death, Ah how comely art thou in the sight of all Gods Children? that art sent
by him, to bring them to see him, their King, Lord and Master, that have so
long desired to see this day, and thy delightsome countenance, thou art most
welcome and dear as the most dearest Brother; come in thou Messenger of the
most Highest. I know what thou have to say unto me, thou bring me the
gladdest tidings that ever I heard, I am ready to go with thee when thou will,
I shall be now soon brought to my long desired home, to my everlasting
habitation of repose and rest. Now my Soul thou shall be no longer perplexed nor
troubled, all sighing for sin, and fear of sinning shall fly away; now is that
blessed day come wherein thou shall at once have all thy Prayers answered, all
thy desires, petitions and suits granted, and ten thousand times ten thousand
more than ever thou did ask or think; now thou shall sin, grieve nor offend
thy God no more, but evermore serve, honor, obey and please him. Now thou
shall see him who created thee, God the Father; him who redeemed thee, Jesus
Christ the Son, and him who so often comforted thee, and has sanctified thee;
the Holy Ghost, the blessed Spirit, three in one, and one in three, which is a
great mystery, but most true; Ah happy they unto whom it has been manifestly
manifested, such have Eternal life, and therefore fear not death.

But to the wicked that fee and know themselves out of Christ, death is to all
such the King of Terrors; they dread and fear him more than all the Kings,
Tyrants, Torments and Tormentors in the World, nay than the Devil himself; for
it is by death that they are sent or brought to keep company for ever one with
another; it is death carries them to that infernal habitation, that throws them
headlong into that Lake of fire and brimstone, into that bottomless pit of
black thick darkness which may be felt, that binds them in fetters so strong as
none is able to deliver them, and then flies swifter than the wind from them,
resolving (which they know) never to return to deliver them, and this later
woe, for ever to abide so, is the greatest of all; this sinks their hearts, and
hopes into an everlasting despair, which most of all makes death dreadful to
them, and they would much rather lie under the greatest rocks or mountains, or
be cast with a millstone about their necks, into the bottom of the Sea: But it
cannot be, death will execute his part of the doom pronounced against them, by
him that judges wisely, righteously and justly, and that spoke as never man
spoke.

A Prayer.
MOst High, most Holy, most Heavenly, Eternal, and Incomprehensible Glorious
Lord God, the God and Father of all mercies, and of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ; I thy poor and unworthy creature, despicably poor, blind and naked, and
out of Christ, I confess and acknowledge, that I have nothing wherewith to
cover my nakedness, and deformity, but unclean, filthy rags, my own
righteousness being unrighteousness, my own obedience being disobedience, my
own worthiness being unworthiness, so that all my all is even nothing at all,
and can be fitly compared to nothing but to nothing. I see now and know my self
to be a most miserable wretch, the chiefest and the greatest of all sinners,
yea the very worst of the worst of all the sons of Adam, dry bones, rottenness,
filthiness, barrenness, uncleanness, naughtiness, emptiness, unsavory salt, a
well without water, a broken cistern, that can hold no water, impurity,
unholiness, all evil, and altogether all evil, always without, and within, in
Spirit, Soul and Body, all my thoughts, words and actions, and that
continually. I sincerely confess and proclaim unto thee, O God, and before
Angels and Men, that there is nothing in me (as I am in my self) which does or
can deserve the least of all thy mercies, not the least look of Love, not the
least smile, nor glance of one of thine eyes, O Lord, in favor, nor to be
admitted to look up to Heaven, or call thee, O God, Father, nor to expect the
least admittance into thy glorious presence. Thou may, O God, thou may
most justly reprove and reproach me openly, and take all my Prayers, Petitions,
and what else soever, and as dung throw them in my face, to my everlasting
shame and confusion, and to thine own honor, glory and praise; thy judgment
would be just, right and good, and all both good and bad must and would applaud
thee for it, and my own soul and Conscience would say Amen thereunto; for there
is not any of thy Divine Commandments and most holy laws but I have broken
again and again, wittingly, willingly, knowingly and presumptuously. I have
often cast thy precepts behind my back, and trampled them under my feet: I have
often, O God, I confess I have often turned thy grace into wantonness, quenched
the sweet and blessed motions of thy holy Spirit; hated to be reformed chose
the ways of Hell, death and destruction for Body and Soul, and run knowingly
and wilfully out of the ways of Heaven, bliss and everlasting rest and
happiness. I would not that thou should reign over me who art the Lord of
Life and Glory. I have profaned thy house, thy Sanctuary, thine Ordinances,
thy Word and Sacraments. Thus even thus, and a thousand times worse, have I
rebelliously and traitorously acted against thy Sovereignty and Power, though I
knew that thou were Lord over all and above all, even God blessed for ever and
for ever, by whom I did live, move, and had my being. Ah Lord, I know well that
thou know all that I have ever done against thee, or would have done. I know
well that nothing is or can be hid from thee, thou see into the dark corners
and crannies of our hearts, thoughts and affections, thou know what I am,
and what I would be, and how I should have ^hus continued unto my lives end,
had ^hou not in love and mercy pulled me out of the everlasting burning, as a
brand out of the fire; if thou had not, O God, come in ^o my help and
succor, the Devil had devoured me, the Devil had destroyed me for ever and for
ever; for I was his captive, his vassal, his slave, I did his will, I obeyed
his commands, I did even run when he ^id me go.

But ever praised be thy transcendent glorious name, O God of all goodness, and
Father of Love, mercy and compassion, that were pleased to make my calamity and
extremity thine opportunity; that then even then when thou saw that all help
(out of thy self) was in vain, thou should be pleased to come and succor
me, and set me free, to break the fetters and chains, by which I was led as a
most miserable Caitif and Captive almost into Hell it self, thou have, O God,
thou have broken the snares and I am escaped, thou have delivered my Soul from
death, and my Songs shall be to praise thee; whilst I live I will praise thee,
O Lord, my deliverer, and never keep silence; rather would I that my tongue
should cleave to the roof of my mouth, than not declare the mercies and the
loving kindness of thee, my God, to my poor Soul; and I trust as well as pray
and beseech thee, O my God and Father in Jesus Christ, that thou will daily put
new Songs of praise into my mouth; and that thou will in some measure enable me
to speak fitly, worthily and opportunely, of thy gracious dealings toward me,
that those that hear and know thee, may with me labor to be more affected and
delighted with thee, and prize thee yet at a far higher prize, and that others
that hear and know thee not, may so hear, as that they may resolve to seek thee
with us, and may see thee to be the fairest of ten thousand, yea the only fair,
lovely, beautiful and desirable.

But O incomprehensible, unconceivable, unexpressible goodness, love and
bounty, the Ocean and Fountain of all bliss, blessedness and happiness, how can
I, how shall I, worm I, nothing I, speak of thee, and of thy gracious dealings
unto my poor Soul? O the height, depth, length and breadth of thy Love, it is
as the Heavens for height, as Hell for depth, as Eternity for length, and as
from Everlasting to Everlasting for breadth; nay all this is far short of it,
it is much more than all this, by much; for it is thy self, O God, thy only
self, thy very self that thou have given me, thy Kingdom and thy Glory, and not
only in Heaven hereafter, but even now, now, have thou done this for my poor
unworthy Soul, having often fed, feasted and solaced my Soul with those
ravishing joys that thou have laid up and prepared for those that unfeignedly
love thee, thou have in thy goodness, bounty and love often caused me to taste
of that hidden Manna, that bread of Life, and to drink of those Rivers of
pleasures that flow from thine own right hand, thou have many times (as it
were) carried my Soul into that mountain of happiness, where I have seen thy
glorious back parts, thy gracious transcendent goodness, and have beheld in the
Spirit, the Celestial Canaan, the new Jerusalem, the City of God, even God in
Man, communicating himself unto him; for Christ the hope of glory is in us,
dwells in us, and makes his abode there, which is thy Tabernacle, O God; thou
have not only given him for us on the Cross, but thou continually continuest to
give him unto us to crucify our sins and sinful lusts and affections in us,
to put them to death, that he himself may live, and reign and rule in us, that
we may be thine, and thou ours; Ah Lord God, I praise thee, thou have often
given me the seal of thy Love, thy Holy Spirit, witnessing, assuring,
establishing and persuading my Soul, heart and conscience of the free, full and
gracious pardon of all my sins, past, present and to come. Thou have often, O
God, I praise thee, thus covered me, thus spread the banners of thy Love over
me, thus made me sit under the shadow of thy branches, thus feasted my Soul in
thy banqueting house of Love, rest, peace, and joy, thus shown me thy beauty
and thy glory, thus allured me and tied me fast unto thy self with the cords of
thy divine Love, thus shown me thy great Salvation, thus given me wisdom and
knowledge to know thee my God and Father, and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent,
thus caused me to believe, and hereby made my joys full to admiration,
adoration and astonishment: On this glorious Mountain of Grace, have often I
desired to abide, that I might continue to abide with thee, to enjoy thee who
only art full and perfect joy; but I know that these changes shall and must
come (as Winter and Summer) whilst we are here in the flesh, but the time will
come that thou will change us but once more, and then we shall live with thee,
in thee, and to thee, for ever and for ever.

Ah Love, who can speak of it fitly, or as he should, it is thy Divine Nature,
O God, it is thy self, and therefore men nor Angels cannot declare it, this
threefold Cord (thy Love, O most blessed and glorious Trinity) cannot be
broken, and against it the gates of Hell shall never prevail. Ah greatness that
(...) good, although thou have in Heaven Millions of Millions of most glorious
Creatures, to look on and converse with, yet notwithstanding such is thy
profound humility and condescendence, love and goodness, that thou will and
do behold, yea and delight too, to behold and communicate unto us poor worms,
sinful dust and ashes, the richest, choicest, greatest and most peculiar
treasures of thy grace and glory, even of the very same (though in a far less
degree and measure) as thou do unto them that are with thee in Heaven, thou
give us knowledge to know thee, love to love thee, joy to rejoice in thee;
and rest to roll and rest our selves on thee; they indeed eat and are filled,
drink deep and are resatiated, see thy face and are altogether satisfied. But
we indeed here, do eat but the fragments or crumbs of their so Royal Feast and
Banquet, we do but sip of the cup of which they drink so deep, and this to us
is but at times, but they are always thus replenished and filled with the good
things of thy House; we indeed see thee, O God, but very darkly at the best
sight of thee, to their sight, we know but in part, at the highest pitch of our
seize here in the flesh, and joy and rejoice but at times; the World, Ah
this wretched World, and the things of the flesh, as cloggs, yea as Mountains
of Earth, pull us down to the Earth; when our Souls are as on Eagles wings
soaning up to Heaven, and pull us back when we are as it were peeping into
Heaven, yea when, O God, thou do as it were pull back the vail that we might
see even into the Holy of Holies; thus thou feedest and feastest us (at times)
with the very bread the blessed (with thee) feed on, and causest us to drink
the Wine of the same Vintage, and we (in thy Son Jesus Christ,) see our selves
clean, undefiled, without spot or wrinkle, pardoned, justified, sanctified, yea
as if we were already glorified, with thine own glory; true they have their
portion in hand in possession, ours is by promise yet to receive, but we have
thy Word (O God) who art just, true and unchangeable, and therefore we can and
do rejoice as well as they, and with the same joy.

And thus O Christ, my Savior and Redeemer, I know thou will present me unto
thy Father, even in thine own righteousness, worthiness and obedience, they
shall all be imputed unto me as if they were mine own, and in these thy
glorious robes I am sure, and certainly persuaded, I shall find acceptance
before God thy Father, who will not be ashamed to own me for his own, nor to be
called my God and my Father. I know, and confess, Ah my dear Redeemer, that all
my bliss, and happiness, present and future, consist in being united unto thee,
and as having an interest and sure title to thy worthiness and obedience; for
in thee, and in thee alone we are heirs of all mercies and blessings, out of
thee we are heirs of all miseries, in thee we are children of the Father, but
out of thee children of the Devil; in thee we shall be accepted and accounted
worthy, but out of thee rejected and esteemed unworthy; in thee we shall pass
for obedient, even as if we had never transgrest, nor sinned, but out of thee
we can be looked on but as disobedient, and transgressors of all thy most holy
Laws and Divine Commandments; in thee, O Christ, I say in thee, we (...) fit
for Heaven, but out of thee only fit for Hell; in thee, O Christ, in thee, we
are the Fathers delight, but out of thee his hatred; in thee, O Christ, in thee
we have much boldness and free access to the Throne of Grace, but out of thee
only shame and confusion of face; in thee, O Son of Righteousness, we are more
resplendent, glorious and beautiful than the Sun, but out of thee, Ah out of
thee we are blackness, ugliness and deformity; in thee, O thou the only all, we
have all things, but out of thee we want all things. Ah that thou would give
me more and more of thy self, that I might give thee more of my self. Ah that
thou would so live in me, that I might only live to thee and for thee, who
art the li^^ of my li^e, yea much better than ten thousand lives. Thus even
thus, thy blood, O Christ, speaks good things to us, and for our souls, for
whom thou have dyed, it opens Heaven gates unto us, when it shuts them against
others; it appeaseth the Fathers wrath toward us, when it causes it to burn
against others; it procures us all good, when it preventeth all against
others; it makes our peace, so that we shall ever live in rest and peace with
thy Father the God of Peace, with thy self the Prince of Peace, and with thy
Holy Spirit the Spirit of Peace, when to others it shall make War for ever and
for ever. Ah my dear Savior, send down I most humbly beseech thee thy Holy
Spirit into my heart, to sanctify, purify, and purge me from all dead works,
from the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, that I
may live as thou did live here in the flesh, doing all the good was possible
to be done, from the highest of Grace to the very lowest of Nature, that it may
be no longer I that live, but thee in me, and that even whilst I live here in
the flesh, it may be by thy Faith, and in thy Faith, O Son of God, who have
loved me and given thy self for me: O Lord, I believe, increase I beseech thee
my Faith, that I may increase in strength, grow in grace, from one degree unto
another, that having finished my Course here in thy fear, I may dye in thy
favor, and after this life ended live with thee and in thee, in bliss and
glory, world without end.

Ah Lord God, seeing I have taken upon me to speak, be thou pleased to hear me,
and to continue to inspire and teach me, to direct and instruct me by thy holy
spirit, that I may yet prize thee and praise thee, for thy late great and sweet
mercies, poured and showred down so graciously and plenteously into my heart
and soul on my Bed of Sickness: Ah how greatly have thou been pleased to
strengthen and comfort me, and to make me to rejoice in and over all my pains;
yea making the thoughts of Death, and that King of terrors, to be pleasant and
comely in my eyes. Ah the Mountains, the Mountains, the Floods, Rivers, Wells
and Springs of true Joy, that thou have been pleased, O God, in Jesus Christ,
by thy holy Spirit, to communicate unto my Soul, Heart and Conscience, feasting
and filling me in the assurance of thy gracious and divine love, and the pardon
of all my sins: the floods, O God, of thy most sweet and blessed presence have
often covered me, and swallowed up my soul into the Ocean of thy unexpressible
and infinite goodness; Thus, even thus, thou raisest up those that are fallen,
comfortest those that are afflicted, healest those that are sick, strengthenest
those that are weak, enrichest those that are poor, cloathest those that are
naked, and set poor Prisoners free, that they may freely rejoice in thee;
and this Joy I am sure none can, nor none shall take from me, for being thus
redeemed and made free by thee, O Christ, we are free indeed, and shall with
thee enjoy perfect Freedom and Liberty.

And now, O Lord God, what shall I render unto thee for all thy many and
special mercies which thou have been pleased so richly, graciously, freely and
plentifully to pour down upon my poor soul and body; I have nothing to offer
thee but what is already thine own, all is thine, O God, I confess all mine is
thine; and I am thine; give me I most humbly beseech thee in Jesus Christ, who
is worthy, a heart according to thine own heart, that I may walk worthily
before thee all the remainder of my days, not turning aside or going astray, to
the right hand of pleasures, or the left hand of profits, and that I may make
it my daily food to keep thy holy Laws, yea my Heaven here on earth, to do thy
will on earth, as it is done in Heaven. Let henceforth all my thoughts, words
and actions tend to honor, and glorify thee, my good God and Heavenly Father,
making thine honor only my honor, and thy glory my glory, redeeming the
^orepast time of my life, by an exact, serious, careful, watchful and holy
walking in thy most holy ways, and never be truly satisfied, till thou have
altogether sanctified me in spirit, soul and body; so that I may always see my
self in thee, and thee in me, and know my self to be thine, and thee to be
mine. Ah Lord, thou know all my thoughts, affections and desires, yea my
very heart; what then shall I say unto thee, make me I beseech thee such as
thou would have me to be, fit me for thy self, and take me to thy self; do
for me what thou know to be best for me, that I may glorify thee, not what
I will, but all that thou will, both on soul and body, that I may live that
life, and dye that death, by which I may glorify thee most, is all and the
only desires of my heart and soul, so be it Lord, so be it, Amen, Amen.

Ah Lord God, that know all things, thou know what is my end and aim in
publishing this thy work, thine it is, and I trust thou will own it; and
therefore I seek no other power to patronize or protect it, and thou owning of
it, I care not who disown it; thou esteeming of it, I care not who dis-esteem
it; thou approving of it, I care not who dis-approve of it, and that thou will
do this, and bless it too, unto the hearts of many, O Lord, I believe, and
therein rejoice, that it shall prove a Cordial to some, and a Corrosive unto
others; a plaster of healing to some, and a sharp Lance to make the wound
deeper of others, even as a savor of life to some, and of death to others, to
cast down some, and to raise up others, to condemn some, and to justify
others, to give trouble to some, and peace to others; for some scoffing,
deriding Ishmaels, railing Shimeis, sinful Critical censures; I cannot but
think it will meet with in this sinful ignorant Nation, and times, because it
has not the false visage on which they prize, that is the invention and
flourishes of the brain of humane Wisdom; for such, Ah Lord, it is not
intended, neither by thee I know, nor by me, so I shall not I trust care for,
or be a whit troubled at such Curs snarling or barking, for power, I know they
shall not have to bite or hurt me. But some true Nathaniels in whom there is
neither gall nor guile, some spiritually wise unto Salvation, that are able to
judge of all things, having that anointing in them that is truth, and no lie,
and which teaches and instructs them in the truth, many such I hope and
trust it shall also meet with, and for them, and for them only, it is I hope by
thee, O Lord my God, intended, and so thou know it is by me that they with
me may together laud and praise thee, and give thee the honor due unto thy
holy Name, for all thy gracious works of wonders wrought in and on my poor
Soul. I know, O Lord, that what thou have thus in the abundance of thy mercies
given me, is not for my self alone, neither may I monopolize it to my self;
hide away this my Talent in this my house of Clay, not keep this Star, or
rather Sunlight from others; but thou expectest and requirest, I know well,
that as I have freely received, so that I freely impart of it and give it as
thine unto others, that I should refresh them with the same refreshing
wherewith thou have refreshed my poor unworthy Soul, and comfort, and make glad
their hearts with the same comforts, that thou have made glad and comforted
mine, and give them to eat and drink of that true bread and water of life,
wherewith thou have so abundantly and frequently fed, feasted, solaced and
refreshed me; and as it were enrich them with the true riches of saving
knowledge, to know thee the true God and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent,
which thou have, I praise thee, in some measure caused me to know to my
Everlasting comfort; thus, even thus, I am sure, O God, is thy good will and
pleasure that I Communicate and forget not what thou have in so much love
Communicated unto me, impart unto them all that thou have imparted unto me. And
I praise thy goodness, O God, for that thou have given me a heart in some
measure, heartily to desire it, and longingly and lovingly, to embrace with
much comfort, joy and content, all occasions whatsoever to do it unto all,
without any respect of Persons to the poorest and meanest Creature (according
to the flesh) as well as unto the highest in degree and honor among men, and
that their Conditions, blessed be thy Name, makes no condition with me, for I
account my self in very truth, Servant and Debtor unto all, both bond and free,
young and old, and would with all my heart and soul do for any of them what
thou requirest and command, yea methi^ks I would give them what I have, and
be without it, that they might have it; I would be hungry and thirsty, and
poor, and naked, to feed, refresh, cloth and make rich their souls. I would
most sincerely and willingly that they had all of them a double Portion of the
gifts and graces of thy holy Spirit, which thou have given me, to the end it
might be well with them, and they might doubly praise thee.

Ah Lord, Stamp on their hearts the seal of thy Divine love; hide them under
thy most sacred and glorious pavilion, that they may be kept safe from the evil
day, and from the evil one, who continually seeks to devour them; swallow
them up, O Lord, into thy self, that they may be ever secure: dart, O God, a
beam of thy Divine love, that by its reflection, they may have love to love
thee again as thou love them, not as to measure or degree, that I know well
is in none, either on earth or in Heaven, nor cannot be, the most blessed
Saints, Angels, Archangels, Cherubins and Seraphims, were the love of all those
lovely blessed and glorious Creatures emptied into one alone, then even I know
his would come short of thine, of thy love, O God, to that Creature whom thou
love in the least degree (to Salvation;) for thy love is the love of a God,
who is love, that would be but the love of a Creature, thine would be from thy
self alone, that would be from thee, and given by thee, so that the love (which
in sincere love) I thus in Jesus Christ beg of thee for them, is, that they may
have true love for thee and thine continually, that it may continue with them
and in them unto the end, till that thou shall so fill them with that first
choice, and chief grace, that they all may be as thou art (in a degree) all
love.

Ah Lord God, confound I pray thee the wisdom of the wise (I mean thou know)
the worldly wise, bring down their pride, and stain their glory, such as will
go about to condemn what they cannot mend, and to mar what they cannot make;
turn, O God, their wisdom (as thou did Achitophel's) into foolishness, but
preserve them unto the end from such a like end, and open the eyes of their
understanding, that they may see and acknowledge the errors of their ways and
come speedily out of them, and before ever converted unto thee, that their
souls may ever live with thee.

Ah Lord God, what a most pitiful thing is it, and of all things to be lamented
with, and in tears of blood, that any poor soul should either live or dye in
sin, that a soul which is of much more value than ten thousand worlds, should
be for ever lost and undone, for such a base, vile, filthy thing as is sin, the
very excrements of naughtiness; and by which, O God, thou that art worthy of
all honor, art so much dishonored, and the Devil so much honored. Ah how is
it to be pitied, and dolefully lamented, that so many poor souls should
believe lies, and the Father of lies (the Devil,) before thy word and thy self,
who art the God of all truth and love; how great, Ah how great was thy love, O
God, to save poor lost sinners, in sparing and giving thy own only dear and
beloved Son, to the most shameful and most painful death of the Cross, to
redeem them from sin, death, Hell, and the Devil; and have thou not promised
with him to give them all things. And Ah how great was thy love, O most sweet
Jesus, who did so willingly submit to thy Fathers will, and for the glory
which was set before thee (for us sinners) did cheerfully endure the Cross,
and despise the shame, and so sits down at the right hand of thy Father, to
prepare there a place for us, and by thy continual intercession to prepare us
for that place; and this thy sitting down in glory at his right hand, shows
plain that thou have done all that is to be done, that can be required, all as
thou said when thou gave up the Ghost is surely finished, our Redemption
fully wrought and completed, thy Fathers wrath appeased, and he well pleased.
Ah Christ (with and in all humility of heart I speak it) thou had this
spirit in thee, thou did even as it were thus complain, ye will not come to
me that ye may have life; and did weep for and over Jerusalem, because her
day of salvation was past, and thy holy spirit in the mouth of thy Prophet
complains, and as it were lamenteth their sad condition; saying, Ah why will
you dye O House of Israel? And further, how often does this thy gracious and
blessed spirit, O God, leave (as it were) thy bosom, and comes and sues and
wooes us, that he may sanctify and make us chosen and fit Vessels for thy use.

Ah Lord, thou know how often such like considerations have sadened my soul;
that thou who art the God of truth, should be thought by so many (as it
were) a liar; for thy Word is not believed by them, but made as a thing of
naught, trampled under foot, and cast behind the back; and Drunkards,
Whoremongers, and such vile persons words be received, entertained, taken up,
welcomed and preferred before thee, O God, before thee, and thy Word, and all
thy most gracious offers of grace. Now if such by thy good and gracious
Providene, come to read these words, or of that which thou have made me to
write, I humbly pray thee in Jesus Christ thy Son, to pity him and pardon him.
Ah fetch home, O God, all wandering Prodigals that are in far Countries (that
is) far from thee, seeding on Hogs and Harlots, which is, on their own fleshly
Carnal Lusts, and vile affections. Ah Father, I know thee to be full of love
and compassion; Ah be thou pleased to do for all such as thou have done for me,
for such was my most miserable and woeful condition; But I praise thy glorious
Name, thou have washed, and cleansed, and sanctified my soul. Ah be thou pleased
to let them all taste of the same love and kindness, let them drink all of the
same Cup, and eat of the same meat, and be clothed with the same Robes, and
have a like ring of Love put on their fingers. Ah let them, O Father, Lord of
Heaven and Earth, be thus welcomed by thee, and owned by thee for thine own,
and adorned thus graciously with thine own glory, that thou may delight in
them, and they may make thee only all their joy, delight and rejoicing. Ah that
the Devil had fewer Servants, and thou, O God, who art all goodness had
more, that he were cast off by all, and thy grace and favor accepted of; that
he were disowned; and thou, O God, for ever owned, to be only worthy to be
believed in, feared, loved, prized, magnified and praised; let these, and a
thousand-fold more of thanksgiving, honor, and glory be given unto thy most
sacred, and most glorious Name, who art God of gods, and Lord of lords, the
very and only true God, blessed for ever and for ever.

Thus, even thus, O Lord, I have taken on me through the guidance of thy good
spirit, to chatter a little as a Crane or a Swallow, and to speak unto thee,
and of thee with a stammering tongue; thou know how far short and scant it
is, to what I might, would, and me thinks could speak; if thou would be
pleased to enable me to declare and show forth what thou have in love and mercy
stablisht and rooted within me. But in my weakness and seantness, I trust, O
Lord, thou will be large, and by and with my little, speak much to their
hearts, souls and Consciences; unto whom I can speak but to the hearing of the
^ar, and though I had the tongue of an Angel, yet my words could not be
effectual. Paul could speak but to Lydia's ear, it was the sweet charming voice
of thy holy spirit that spoke to her heart, and begat in her holy and Heavenly
affections. Paul's planting and Apollo's watering without thy blessing would be
in vain; all man's all is nothing at all but emptiness, it is only thou, O God,
that made the soul, that only can satisfy the soul; and thou, who only art
above Conscience that can quiet the Conscience: That thou will thus
graciously and powerfully work on others hearts and lives, with this thy
gracious work of grace, with which thou have so richly and plenteously wrought
on mine, and in me, are my hopes, desires and hearty, humble and affectionate
prayers, and for this end, and to bring glory to thy Eternal, most holy, and
most glorious name, I send it forth under the shadow of thy wings, to be
protected. Ah Lord, hear me, and graciously answer me, and do for me and all
thine, much more abundantly than I or they can ask or think according to the
greatness of thy goodness, and the goodness of thy greatness; and all I humbly
beg, ask, and crave in the name, and for the sake and worthiness of Jesus
Christ the Righteous, thy dear Son, and my dear Savior and Redeemer, for whom
my soul does, and shall ever praise thee, and to him with thine own sacred,
holy, divine and glorious Majesty, and blessed spirit be now and always given
by me and all thine, as all due is and to none else, honor, glory, power,
might, dominion and thanksgiving for ever and for ever, Amen, Amen. So be it,
Lord, so be it, Amen and Amen.

IF then all this thou will receive,
Thou must thy self of all bereave:
Thou must thy self for ever loose,
If Christ thou will for ever choose:
And if this choice thou here do make;
Christ will thy soul never forsake:
For if thou do to all sin dye,
Thou shall with him live Eternally:
Where all his glory thou shall see,
And live in him, and he in thee:
Ye shall no more be two, but one,
As is the Father and the Son:
Eke with the Holy Ghost, all three
Shall give themselves to live in thee:
Ah blessed gift and blessed life,
Where all is peace, no war, no strife:
Where time shall never wear away,
Where is no night, but all is day:
Which day shall never have an end,
And all our work shall only tend,
To give God praise for all his love,
Who sits above all powers above:
Those three in one, and one in three,
That blessed were, are, and shall be:
Beginning they had never none,
And therefore end shall not be known.
All time that is past, is with them present,
And that to come is never absent.
Therefore in them thou all shall see,
That passed is, and what is to be.
Which shall thee fill with such great joys,
That thou shall still lift up thy voice:
And with the Angels, and blessed sing,
Praise to our God, Praise to our King.
Let all praise, honor, and glory be given to God, the God of all glory, from
whom I have received all that I have, both to will, and to do.
