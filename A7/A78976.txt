A Proclamation commanding the use of the BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER according to
Law, notwithstanding the pretended Ordinances for the New DIRECTORY.
WHEREAS by a Printed Paper, dated the third of January last past, entitled,
An Ordinance of Parliament for taking away the Book of Common Prayer, and for
establishing and putting in execution of the Directory for the public worship
of God; It is said to be ordained amongst other things, That the Book of
Common Prayer should not remain, or be from thenceforth used in any Church,
Chapel, or place of Public Worship within the Kingdom of England, or
Dominion of Wales; And that the Directory for Public Worship in that Printed
Paper set forth, should be from thenceforth used, pursued, and observed in all
Exercises of Public Worship of God in every Congregation, Church, Chapel,
and place of Public Worship. And by another Printed Paper, dated the 23 day
of August last past, entitled, An Ordinance of the Lords and Commons assembled
in Parliament, for the more effectual putting in execution the Directory for
Public Worship, etc. particular Directions are set down for the dispersing,
publishing, and use of the said Directory, in all Parishes, Chappelries, and
Donatives, and for the calling in and suppressing of all Books of
Common Prayer, under several forfeitures and penalties to be levied and
imposed upon Conviction before Justices of Assize, or of Oyer and Terminer, and
of the Peace, as by the said two Printed Papers may appear. And taking into
Our Consideration, that the Book of Common Prayer, which is endeavored thus to
be abolished, was Compiled in the times of Reformation by the most Learned and
Pious Men of that Age, and defended and confirmed with the Martyrdom of many;
and was first established by Act of Parliament in the time of King Edward the
sixth, and never repealed or laid aside, save only in that short time of Queen
Mary's Reign, upon the Return of Popery and Superstition; and in the first
year of Queen Elizabeth, it was again revived and established by Act of
Parliament, and the repeal of it then declared by the whole Parliament, to
have been to the great decay of the due honor of God, and discomfort to the
Professors of the truth of Christ's Religion: and ever since it has been used
and observed for above fourscore years together, in the best times of Peace
and Plenty that ever this Kingdom enjoyed; and that it conteines in it a
excellent Form of Worship and Service of God, grounded upon the Holy
Scriptures, and is a singular means and help to Devotion in all Congregations,
and that, or some other of the like Form, simply necessary in those many
Congregations which cannot be otherwise supplied by learned and able men; and
keeps up an uniformity in the Church of England; And that the Directory, which
is sought to be introduced, is a means to open the way, and give the liberty
to all ignorant Factious, or evil men, to broach their own fancies and
conceits, be they never so wicked or erroneous; and to mislead People into
sin and Rebellion, and to utter those things, even in that which they make
for their Prayer in their Congregations as in Gods presence, which no
Conscientious man can assent or say Amen to. And be the Minister never so Pious
and Religious, yet it will break that uniformity which hitherto has been held
in Gods Service, and be a means to raise Factions and Divisions in the Church.
And those many Congregations in this Kingdom, where able and Religious
Ministers cannot be maintained, must be left destitute of all help or means
for their Public Worship and Service of God. And observing likewise, that no
reason is given for this alteration, but only inconvenience alleged in the
General (and whether Pride and Avarice be not the ground, whether Rebellion
and destruction of Monarchy be not the Intention of some, and Sacrilege and
the Churches Possessions the aims and hopes of others, and these new
Directories, the means to prepare and draw the People in for all, We leave to
him who searches and knows the hearts of men.) And taking into Our further
Consideration, that this alteration is introduced by color of Ordinances of
Parliament made without and against Our Consent, and against an Express Act of
Parliament still in force, and the same Ordinances made as perpetual binding
Laws, inflicting penalties and punishments, which was never, before these
times, so much as pretended to have been the use or power of Ordinances of
Parliament, without an Express Act of Parliament, to which We are to be
Parties. Now least Our silence should be interpreted by some, as a Connivance
or indifferency in Us, in a matter so highly-concerning the Worship and Service
of God, the Peace and Unity of the Church and State, and the established Laws
of the Kingdom, We have therefore thought fit to Publish this Our
Proclamation; And We do hereby Require and Command all and singular Ministers
in all Cathedral and Parish-Churches, and other places of Public Worship
within Our Kingdom of England or Dominion of Wales; and all other to whom it
shall appertain, That the said Book of Common Prayer be kept and used in all
Churches, Chappells, and places of Public Worship, according to the said
Statute made in that behalf in the said first year of the said late Queen
Elizabeth; And that the said Directory be in no sort admitted, received, or
used, the said pretended Ordinances, or any thing in them contained to the
contrary, notwithstanding. And We do hereby let them know, that whenever it
shall please God to restore Us to Peace, and the Laws to their due Course,
(wherein We doubt not of his assistance in his good time) We shall require a
strict Account and prosecution against the breakers of the said Law, according
to the force thereof; and in the meanetime, in such places where We shall come,
and find the Book of Common Prayer suppressed and laid aside, and the Directory
introduced. We shall account all those that shall be Ayders, Actors, or
Contrivers therein, to be Persons disaffected to the Religion and Laws
established; and this they must expect, besides that greater loss which they
shall sustain by suffering themselves thus to be deprived of the use and
comfort of the said Book.

Given at Our Court at Oxford, this Thirteenth day of November, in the One and
Twentieth year of Our Reign. 1645.
