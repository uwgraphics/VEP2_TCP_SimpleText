The Batchelors Ballad, Or' a Remedy against Love.
Thou little Peevish God! whom heretofore,
The Blinder World, so highly did adore;
Bor whom the loving Fools a Quiver found,
Fows, Arrows, Wings; nay more, Power to wou(...)
Know, I defy thee, boy; not all thy art,
Can reach my eye, much-less enslave my heart:
If thou have any, come and show thy skill,
Fain would I love one hour against my will;
Alas poor God! men will no longer now,
To thee, thy mother, or thy Minions bow;
Your power and fame which has so long been gre(...)
Upon Examination proves a Cheat.

With Allowance,

NO more silly Cupid,
will I pine and complain,
What slave is so stupid,
To suffer the plague,
Of an amorous League,
To be laughed at in vain?
No more silly Cupid,
I Will court a coy Mistress no more,
He Is a Sot and more blind,
Who to one is confined,
When there is hope for a score.
When I meet with a beauty,
that is loving and kind,
I Will pay her my duty,
And when i have enjoyed her,
O then i will recruit me,
With love and brisk wine.
No more i will adore her,
When once I have got my desire,
She then may refuse me,
But cannot abuse me,
For then I defy her.
The amorous Cully,
Whom love has undone,
Protests as fully,
To every complaint,
That he makes to his Saint,
As a mortified Nun.
Alas for the Cully,
How poor the reward of his Love is
Then let him deceive her,
And manfully leave her,
Or else he is a novice.
For why should a Bubble,
Whom passion ensnares,
Be put to the trouble,
In spite of his senses,
And other defenses,
To marry his cares.
Yet who is such a bubble,
If honey and sweetness you bring,
But his reason and conscience,
Will tell him it is nonsense,
To play with the sting.




They say when a Negre,
Would Elephants win,
To make them more eager,
The female entices,
With lustful devices,
And wheadles 'em in.
A Woman's a Negre,
And works by the arts I have told ye,
But were we advised,
They Would all be despised,
And quickly grow moldy.
For though they are wary,
and stoutly defend,
They love not to tarry,
But 'cause it is the fashion,
They Will stifle their passion,
And yield in the end.
For though they are wary,
Yet try 'em a Sennight or more,
If still they deny,
And refuse to comply,
I Am the Son of a Whore.
Persuade the young Ninny,
that boils in his blood,
To part with a Guinny,
His amarous rage,
He may quickly assuage,
And 'twill do him much good.
For ask the young Ninny
They heat of whose passion is over,
If he tells you his mind,
I Will be hanged if you find,
Him so zealous a Lover.
Unhappy the wretch is,
that is yoked to a mate,
His conscience he stretches,
To tell you more Lies,
Than old Argus had eyes,
Of his blessed estate.
Unhappy the wretch is,
Be warned by another man's harm,
For the Boys in the River,
That chatter and shiver,
Will tell you it is warm.
A curse on those Noddies,
Dull-rhiming complaints,
Who cringing their bodies,
In all their caresses,
And tedious addresses,
Turn Women to Saints.
A curse on such Noddies,
By whom we in general suffer,
But before i will be ruled,
Any longer or fooled
By a woman, i will huff her.
Then females adieu to ye,
Your reign's at an end,
A fig for your beauty,
Your painting and patches,
In hopes of good matches,
In vain you may spend:
Adieu silly Females,
Go find out new arts to delude,
But if you expose 'em,
I faith i will disclose 'em,
And so I conclude.
