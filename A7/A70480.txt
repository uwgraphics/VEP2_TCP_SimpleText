HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT

May it please your most Excellent Majesty;
YOur Majesty's most loyal, humble, and affectionate Subjects, the Mayor,
Aldermen, and Commons of this Your City of London, being this day assembled in
Common Council, received Your Majesty's gracious Letter and Declaration of the
4/14 April last, by the hands of the Right Honorable the Lord Viscount
Mordant, and Sir John Greenvile, in which they find, that God has been
pleased at last to give a bountiful return to their constant Prayers, patient
hopes, and loyal endeavors; by Your Majesty's owning and acceptance thereof,
and by inclining Your Princely heart to descend so far, not only to impart to
them Your Majesty's benign Declaration of Grace extended to Your Majesty's
Subjects in general, but also to conveigh it to them under a particular
assurance of special Love and tenderness to this City, to which they presume
not to entitle themselves on any other account, then upon that of Your
Majesty's gracious inclinations; for they confess that all those manifestations
of their affections, for which Your Majesty is pleased to put those signal
marks of favor upon this City, were but a partial payment of that duty which
they owe to Your Majesty's right, as Subjects, and virtues, as Christians. And
therefore, as they desire to bless God for inclining the hearts of both Houses
of Parliament this day to express their joyful sense of, and their humble and
hearty thanks for Your Majesty's gracious offers: And to profess their loyalty
and duty to Your Majesty, so they desire, that their entire and unanimous
concurrence therein, may in its place find Your gracious acceptance, which
they hope Your Majesty will give them leave in all humility to claim when Your
Majesty shall have seen their enclosed Declaration and Vindication, which their
innocence and affections warranted them to publish to the world, before they
received the honor and encouragement of Your Majesty's Letter. And they cannot
omit to acquaint Your Majesty, that the most eminent and clear characters of
Your Princely goodness expressed in this Your Letter and Declaration, has, as
by a miracle at once, bound them all up in one common band of Loyalty to Your
Majesty, and affection among themselves; and given them more then pregnant
hopes, that God will suddenly establish Your Majesty in an honorable and
peaceful Government of these Your Kingdoms, and fix You among them as the
Center; in which all the opposite Lines of the distracted interests of this
Nation will meet and acquiesce, to the glory of God, and the perpetual
settlement, peace, and welfare of Your Subjects. They have entrusted their
fellow Members, Thomas Adams and Abraham Reynardson Aldermen, William Wild
Esquire Recorder, John Langham, Sir James Bunce Baronet, Richard Brown, William
Tompson, John Frederick, John Robinson, Anthony Bateman and William Wale
Aldermen, Sir Nicholas Crisp Knight, Theophilus Biddulph, William Bateman,
William Vincent, Thomas Bludworth, Thomas Chamberlen, Richard Ford, Laurence
Bromfield and John Jews Esquires, to present to Your Majesty's Royal hand this
their humble and hearty profession of duty and affection, and with it a small
earnest of the reality thereof, which though it be extremely disproportionable
to Your Royal Dignity, and the measure of their zeal to Your service, yet they
beg most instantly that it may find Your gracious acceptance, as coming
from that City which have been the greatest sharers in the many and heavy
pressures and losses that have befallen Your Subjects during the want of Your
Royal Protection. And assuring Your Majesty of their continued prayers to God
for Your Majesty's speedy and safe return into these Your panting Dominions,
that Your Majesty may enjoy your undoubted legal Sovereignty, and we your
Subjects, the longed-for influence thereof, by your maintaining them in the
exercise of the Protestant Religion according to the Scriptures, and the
example of the best Reformed Churches, and enjoyment of our civil liberties and
properties according to the ancient fundamental Laws of this Nation, and those
other immunities and favors expressed in your Majesty's Letter and Declaration;

We do most humbly take leave, and have hereunto set the seal of this your
Majesty's Royal Chamber the City of London, the first of May 1660.
