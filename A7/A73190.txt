A New little Northren Song called, Under and over, over and under,
Or a pretty new Jest, and yet no wonder,
Or a maiden mistaken, as many now be,
View well this glass, and you may plainly see.

To a pretty new Northern tune.


AS I abroad was walking,
I heard two lovers talking:
One to the other spoke,
of loves constancy:
I ore a meadow turning,
upon a Summers morning:
I heard these Lovers mourning,
cause of loves cruelty.
For under and over, over and under,
under and over again,
quoth she sweet heart I love thee,
as maidens should love men.
The young man he replied,
and not her love denied,
Quoth he I am affyed:
in constancy to thee,
Then cast all sorrows from thee:
for I will never wrong thee,
Sweet pleasures shall o'rethrong thee
so thou be true to me.
For under and over, over and under,
under, and over again,
I mean sweet heart to love thee,
as mayds are loved of men.
(Quoth she) my only sweeting,
men fail often in their meeting,
Let me have faithful greeting,
or else depart for aye:
O say not so may Jewel,
for then you are to cruel,
Yield Cupid's fire more fuel,
let not true love decay.
For under and over, over etc.
I love thee mine own sweeting,
as mayds are loved of men.
Said she, you men can flatter,
(quote he) sweet no such matter,
With that amain flung at her:
and the began to play,
Such kisses sweet he gave her,
and often time did crave her,
That he in love might have her:
to sport with him all day.
At under and over, over etc.
yield thou to sport with me sweet
as mayds do sport with men.
He by the white hand took her,
and then in kindness shook her,
Swearing he had mistook her:
if now she proved unkind,
Oh, yield my sweet unto me,
or else you will undo me,
If thou no love wilt show me,
to grief I am assigned.
Then under and over, over etc.
come sport with me my sweeting.
as mayds do sport with men.
At length this Less consented,
they both were well contented,
And often times frequented,
the lovely meadow green,
To gather lovely dazies,
or sport in Cupid's mazes,
I speak it to their praises:
they merry there have been.
With under and over, over etc.
These two did sport together,
as women sport with men.
E're forty weeks expired,
this bonny Less was tired,
Her heart with love was fired:
and grown so round before,
This young man from her wanders,
to France or else to Flaunders:
Thus was she served with Flanders,
her heart then waxed sore.
With under and over, over etc.
this maid was wronged in earnest
as mayds are wronged by men.
The second part
To the same tune.


THen she began to prattle,
like one of Cupid's cattle,
And daily would she tattle,
That her love was too unkind:
Thus in distress to leave her,
and by his words deceive her,
Which did of joys bereave her,
that she was left behind.
With under and over, over and under,
under and over again,
she rayl'd against her sweet heart,
as women rail against men.
Then she unto her mother,
complained before another,
This fault she could not smother,
her belly was so round:
Quoth she) some comfort yield me,
and from all shame pray shield me,
For sorrows Tide has filled me,
that I am like to sound.
With under and over, over and under,
under and over again,
she against her love complained,
as mayds complain against men.
Her mother straight perceived,
her daughter was deceived,
Which very much her grieved,
but now for help she seeks,
How to keep her daughter
from shame should follow after,
And this same shameless matter,
in private close she keeps.
With under and over, over and under,
under and over again,
she says unto her daughter
these are the tricks of men*
In brief she was delivered,
the Carryer he was hired.
And she from thence was carried
to London with all speed:
No one could be demurer,
nor seem a Virgin purer,
Her carryage now did sure her,
to be a maid indeed.
With under and over, over and under
she vows never to sport that way,
that maidens use with men.
Then in short time came to her.
a Tailor and did woo her,
He never could part fro her,
till she was made his wife:
He for a maid did take her,
and vowed never to forsake her
But still be her partaker,
And love her as his life.
With under and over, over etc.
She vowed ever to love him still,
as women do love men.
Thus were her griefs converted,
and she was now light hearted,
Being so well supported,
by her new wedded mate,
She now was freed from mourning,
her grief to joys were turning,
She now lived void of scorning,
dissension and debate.
With under and over, over and under,
she vowed ever to love him still,
as women do love men.
