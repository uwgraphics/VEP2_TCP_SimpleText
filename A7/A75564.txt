The Marquess of ARGYLES Speech to the Grand Committee, concerning
Propositions of Peace to be sent to his Majesty.
My Lords and Gentlemen:
THough I have had the honor to be named by the Kingdom of Scotland, in all
the Commissions which had relation to this Kingdom, since the beginning of this
War; yet I had never the happiness to be with your Lordships till now, wherein
I reverence Gods providence, that he has brought me hither at such an
opportunity, when I may boldly say, it is in the power of the two Kingdoms,
yea, I may say, in your Lordships power to make us both happy, if you make good
use of this occasion, by settling Religion, the Peace and Union of these
Kingdoms.

The work of Reformation in these Kingdoms, is so great a work, as no age nor
history can parallel since Christ's days, for no one Nation had ever such a
Reformation set forth unto them, much less three Kingdoms, so that this
Generation may truly think themselves happy, if they can be isntrumental in
it. And as the work is very great, so it cannot be expected, but it must have
great and powerful Enemies; not only flesh and blood which hate to be
reformed, but likewise Principalities and Powers, the Rulers of the darkness
of this world, and spiritual wickednesses in high places. As the dangers are
great, we must look the better to our duties, and the best way to perform
these, is to keep us by the Rules which are to be found in our National
Covenant, principally the Word of God, and in its own place, the example of
the best Reformed Churches; And in our way we must beware of some Rocks, which
are temptations both upon the right, and upon the left hand, so that we must
hold the middle path. Upon the one part, we would take heed, not to settle
lawless liberty in Religion, whereby, in stead of Uniformity, we should set up
a thousand Heresies and Schisms, which is directly contrary and destructive to
our Covenant. Upon the other part, we are to look that we persecute not piety
and peaceable men, who cannot through scruple of conscience, come up in all
things to the Common Rule; but that they may have such a forbearance as may be
according to the Word of God, may consist with the Covenant, and not be
destructive to the Rule it self, nor to the Peace of the Church and Kingdom,
wherein I will insist no further, either to wrong your Lordships patience or
judgments, who I doubt not will be very careful to do every thing according
to our Covenant.

As to the other Point, concerning the Peace and Union of the Kingdoms, I know
it is that which all profess they desire, I hope it is that all do aim at;
sure I am, it is that which all men ought to study and endeavor. And I think
it not amiss to remember your Lordships of some former experiences, as an
argument to move us to be wise for the future. If the Kingdom of England in
the 1640 year of God, then sitting in Parliament, had concurred, as they were
desired, against the Kingdom of Scotland, no question we had been brought to
many difficulties, which, blessed be God, was by the wisdom of the Honorable
Houses prevented. So likewise when this Kingdom was in difficulties, if the
Kingdom of Scotland had not willingly, yea cheerfully, sacrificed their peace
to concur with this Kingdom, your Lordships all know what might have been
the danger. Therefore let us hold fast that Union which is so happily
established betwixt us, and let nothing make us again two, who are so many
ways one, all of one Language, in one Island, all under one King, one in
Religion, yea one in Covenant; so that in effect we differ in nothing but in
the Name (as Brethren do) which I wish were also removed, that we might be
altogether one, if the two Kingdoms shall think fit; for I dare say, not the
greatest Kingdom in the Earth can prejudice both so much as one of them may do
the other.

I will forbear at this time to speak of the many jealousies I hear are
suggested, for as I do not love them, so I delight not to mention them, only
one I cannot forbear to speak of, as if the Kingdom of Scotland were too much
affected with the Kings interest. I will not deny but the Kingdom of Scotland,
by reason of the Reign of many Kings his Progenitors over them, has a
natural affection to his Majesty, whereby they wish he may be rather reformed
then ruined; yet experience may tell, their personal regard to him has never
made them forget that common Rule, The safety of the People is the Supreme Law.
So likewise their love to Monarchy makes them very desirous that it may be
rather regulated then destroyed, which I hope I need not to mention further to
your Lordships, who I trust are of the same mind.

I know likewise there are many jealousies and unjust aspersions cast upon our
Armies in England and Ireland, I can, if it were needful, presently produce
heads of a Declaration intended by the Army in England, for vindicating
themselves from such injuries, and showing the clearness of their resolutions
and integrity, both in the Cause, and toward this Kingdom, wherein their
undertakings and coming in at such a season of the year, their hard
sufferings, and constant endeavors since, may be sufficient testimonies.
Therefore I am the more bold to desire your Lordships, that so long as they
stay in England (which I wish may be for a short time) they may be supplied
with some moneys, and their Quarters enlarged, least their lying in too narrow
Quarters, make the burden insupportable to that exhausted corner of the
Country where they now remain and so beget outcries against them, when they are
not able to discharge their Quarters, as other Armies within the Kingdom.

As for the Army in Ireland, I have been an eyewitness to their sufferings,
and so may speak of it likewise upon certain knowledge, That never men have
suffered greater hardships, who might have been provided, for they have lived
many times upon a few Beans measured out to them by number, and never had any
other drink but Water. And when they were in some better condition, they had
but an Irish peck of rough Oats for a whole week. And now at their best
condition, when they are quartered upon the Country (which is able to
entertain them only for a very short time) they have only an Irish peck of
Oatmeal^, or a shilling in the ten days, both for Meat and Drink. Therefore
according to the many desires given in to the Honorable Houses for that end, I
humbly entreat that your Lordships will take care to provide for them, so long
as it is thought fit they remain in that Kingdom.

For a renewed testimony of our earnest desires to comply with the Honorable
Houses for settling the Peace of these Kingdoms so much longed for, we do
return unto your Lorships the Propositions of Peace (which we received on
Tuesday last) with our consent thereunto, wishing they may be hasted to his
Majesty, who has so often called for them. And I likewise offer to your
Lordships the Copy of his Majesty's Letter to my Lord of Ormond, discharging
him from any further meddling in any Treaty with the Rebels in Ireland, I hope
in order to his Majesty's further condescending to the settling of that
Proposition concerning Ireland, and the rest of the Propositions now to be sent
unto him. Another Paper there is which concerns the supplying of the Scottish
Armies in England and Ireland, and the perfecting of the Accounts between the
Kingdoms, together with a Letter from General Monro to the Committee of
Estates of the Kingdom of Scotland, concerning the state of affairs in
Ireland. All which when your Lordships have considered, I trust you will take
such course therein as man satisfy our just desires, may put an end to our
present troubles, and settle these Kingdoms in a happy Peace.

A Paper delivered in from the Commissioners of Scotland, concerning the
Propositions.
IT is a twelve month since we did earnestly press the sending of
Propositions to the King for a safe and well-grounded peace; In answer
whereunto the Honorable Houses were pleased to acquaint us, That they had
resolved Propositions should be sent to his Majesty, but did intend to make
some alterations in the former Propositions, and after eight or nine months
deliberation, we received from the Honorable Houses some of those
Propositions; and though we did find therein very material additions,
alterations, and omissions, which for their great importance, and the interest
of the Kingdom of Scotland therein, might very well have required the delay of
an Answer until the Estates of that Kingdom had been consulted; yet so
unwilling were we to retard the means of peace, that in a fortnights time we
returned an Answer upon the whole Propositions; and the Houses of Parliament
not resting satisfied therewith, in less then ten days we prepared a further
Answer; wherein we did very much comply with the desires of the Honorable
Houses, especially in the matter of settling the Militia of England, and
Ireland, and in other things did show our readiness to hear, or propose such
expedients as might determine any differences, so that in a whole years time
the Propositions have not remained in our hands the space of four weeks,
which we only mention to clear our proceedings from mistakes and aspersions;
and the Houses having now after two months farther deliberation, delivered
unto us upon the 23. of this instant June, all the Propositions they intend to
send to the King at this time; We do, without any delay, return such an
Answer and resolution thereupon, as will be unto the present and future
Generations, one undeniable testimony (besides many others) of the integrity
and faithfulness of the Kingdom of Scotland in their solemn League and
Covenant, of their love to Peace, and earnest desire to satisfy their Brethren
of England in those things which concern the good and Government of this
Kingdom; being further resolved touching the Kingdom of Scotland, That as
nothing of single or sole concernment to that Nation did engage them in this
War, so nothing of that nature shall continue the same. Although these
Propositions now to be sent do much differ from the Propositions formerly
agreed upon by the Parliaments of both Kingdoms, and the most material
additions, omissions, and alterations are in such particulars as concern the
joint interest, and mutual confidence and conjunction of both Kingdoms, which
were, as we conceive, much better provided for, and strengthened by the former
Propositions then by these. Although the particular Propositions presented by
Us, concerning the Kingdom of Scotland are not yet agreed unto by the Houses
of Parliament, as was offered in their Papers of the tenth of April. Although
diverse Propositions of joint concernment be now superseded, and the sending of
them delayed to a more convenient time, as is expressed in the Votes of both
Houses of the twenty sixth of March; and although (which is to Us more then all
the rest) those Ordinances of Parliament unto which the fifth and sixth
Propositions do relate, (and were therefore communicated unto Us upon our
desire to see what the Houses had already agreed upon concerning Religion) do
not contain the establishment of such a Reformation of Religion, and
uniformity as was expected, and was the chief end of our engagement in this
War; and as all these Ordinances put together come short of what we wished,
so there are some particulars which we conceive to be inconsistent with the
Word of God, and the example of the best reformed Churches, and therefore
cannot in our consciences consent unto them; which particulars were expressed
to both Houses in the Remonstrance of the Commissioners of the Church of
Scotland of the date, March 26. 1646.

Yet nevertheless we do so earnestly desire and so highly value the easing of
the heavy Pressures under which both Kingdoms groan, and the bringing of this
bloody lasting war to a speedy and happy end, considering with-all that not
only the Book of Common Prayer and the Prelaticall Government are abolished,
and a Common directory of worship established in both Kingdoms, but that
likewise the Ordinances before mentioned do contain diverse Parts of a Positive
Reformation and uniformity in Church Government, unto which we formerly gave
our consent in our answer upon the whole propositions of Peace, of the 20. of
April, and for so happy beginning, and so good a foundation laid for the future,
we heartily thank God, and do acknowledge the zeal, Piety and Wisdom of the
Honorable Houses therein, remembering also that those Ordinances do not
contain the whole moddell of Church government and that the Houses have been
Pleased to express [ that it cannot be expected that a perfect Rule in every
Particular should be settled all at once, but that there will be need of
suppliments, and aditions, and happily of alterations, in some things, as
experience shall bring to light the necessity thereof] upon these
Considerations as we do cheerfully consent to many material Parts of these
Propositions so we Resolve to make no let, but to give way to the sending of
such other particulars therein contained, with which we are unsatisfied in the
matters for the Reasons formerly Represented to both Houses, of which some
still stand in force, though others of them be taken away by the new expedients
it being always understood that our not Dissenting from, nor our opposing of
the sending of the Propositions as they now stand, shall be no prejudice nor
Impediment to all or any one of the Articles of the Solemn League and
Covenant, especially to the first Article, concerning the preservation of the
Reformed Religion in the Church of Scotland in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline,
and Government, against our Common enemies, the Reformation of Religion in the
Kingdoms of England and Ireland in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and
Government, according to the Word of God, and example of the Best Reformed
Churches, and the bringing of the Churches of God in the three Kingdoms, to
the nearest conjunction and uniformity in Religion, Confession of faith, form
of Church Government, Directary, for Worship, and Catechizing; Which thing both
Kingdoms are by Covenant obliged sincerely and Really to Endeavor, and that
not for a time, but constantly, so that neither of the Kingdoms can be loosed
or acquitted from the most strait and solemn obligation of their continued and
constant endeavoring these good ends so far as any of them is not yet
attained, it being also understood that our concurrence to the sending of the
Propositions shall be without prejudice to any Agreement or Treaty between the
Kingdoms, and shall not infringe any Engagement made to the Kingdom of
Scotland, nor be any hindrance to our insisting upon the other Propositions
already made known to the Houses; and it being understood that it is not our
Judgment that every Particular and Circumstance of these Propositions is of so
great Importance to those Kingdoms as Peace and war should depend thereupon.

Upon these grounds which we make known only for clearing our consciences, and
for discharging Our selves in the trust put upon us, without the least thought
of Retarding the so much longed for Peace, We Condisend and agree that the
Propositions as they are now Resolved upon be in the Name of Both Kingdoms
presented to the King, whose heart we beseech the Lord wholly to incline to the
Councels of Truth and Peace.

June 25. 1646.
FINIS.
