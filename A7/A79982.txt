To the Reader.
Courteous Reader,
YOu have now the Second Part of Cloria and Narcissus, sooner sent after the
First then was determined, in regard the Stationer was something pressing to
have it with the former: perhaps it may give more satisfaction then the other,
for that (according to my apprehension) it does as much clear difficulties, as
can well stand with the nature of a Romance: More I shall not need to say, to
any other purpose, then what you may read in the Epistle to the first part.

Only, judicious Reader, craving your favorable construction of all such
faults as may have escaped in both parts, either by defect of printing, or
otherways by oversight of the Author.

THE SECOND PART OF Cloria and Narcissus.
AS the Princess Clorias thoughts now were reasonably well settled, concerning
the safety of Narcissus, in regard of the messengers relation, so Roxana with
more alacrity and cheerfulness, summoned a a new Dedalus, to make an end of
those passages belonging to the Island of Crete; whereupon one day meeting in
the same walk that had entertained the Princess, upon her first arrival in
the Country, they both seated themselves together under a tree, artificially
made into an Arbor of pleasure, that had its full prospect toward the sea;
whilst he gave her this further account:

Madam said he, as for the interests which I formerly mentioned unto you not
many days since, you may be pleased to know, that as Evarchus our King in his
Wars with the Senate of Lydia, must be forced upon all occasions, to court
any assistance whatsoever for his best advantage, so of the other side do the
Cretans resolve to make use of their present power, to gain benefits to
themselves, and party in any thing they can procure, either from their Prince
or any other: to this purpose, after the agreement that I told you of, which I
made with the Natives of the Country, (however many of the most rigid sort,
would not at all come within any manner of communication, whereby to be subject
to the Lydian power, thereunto encouraged as it is supposed by a messenger from
Delphos, that neither understands the Islands interest or the peoples good)
they designed Commissioners to be sent to Philadelphae, where the King then
remained, to Treat upon such conditions, as they conceived most necessary for
their commodity and security: Thus arriving at court, in a short time they were
not only admitted to kiss the Kings hands, but withal permitted to present
their Petitions and requests; for this ceremony (and so I may well call it,
since it produced but small effects, to the advantage of any party) there was
appointed a great Hall in the City of Philadelpha, into which place the
messengers were brought with some State, as soon as the King was seated in his
Throne, because they should not complain of the want of any circumstance, that
belonged to the solemn entertainment of Ambassadors of other Nations, to
make them the willinger to comply toward the assistance desired: After they
had been in this manner received, as also with good language from the Kings
own mouth cherished, they presented a paper that contained these peremptory
demands: First they desired to have, not only the free exercise of their
religion through the whole Island, notwithstanding the Lydian laws to the
contrary according to the rights and customs of Delphos, but withal to enjoy
the use of the best Temples, alone appropriated to themselves, with all the
rents and privileges that of old at any time belonged unto them: Secondly,
they expected an absolute concession from his Majesty, that no governors
whatsoever of any foreign Nation, should be appointed over them in Creet or
in any Fort or Island belonging to the same; besides they refused to admit of
those of the very Country it self, unless they were confirmed and approved of
by the gentrall council, which they had established to manage and odered all
their affairs both in peace and War: And lastly they expected, (as the
writing which they had delivered the King expressed) an absolute restoration of
all those lands to the true owners, that had been taken from their possession,
by reason of any former pretended rebellion, and given to the Myssians or
Lydians, either by the old Queen of Lydia, or Evarchus father: The King, as I
was informed after he had read these propositions, seemed to the outward view
of the assembly, extremely troubled in his apprehensions, as if he had been
exceedingly deceived in his expectation, concerning the good nature and reality
of our countrymen: however, notwithstanding he was by this means sufficiently
inflamed in his thoughts, in regard of these proceedings; (not only in some
sort disdaining to be thus handled by his Subjects in his necessities, but
being also with some reason suspicious of their intentions, as fearing that
they aimed to become Masters of the whole Island, and so by consequence to be
possessors of most of the Lands of his best friends, who were actually employed
now with him in his Wars) yet conceiving that he was not at the instant, in a
capacity to show much discontent to any party, that could either good or hurt
him in his present differences with the Senate, he gave their commissioners at
leastwise fair words in the general, promising speedily to send particular
messengers of his own into Creet, not only more knowingly to Treat with them
concerning their demands; but withal, if it were possible, to conclude with
them concerning his own desires, which he conceived would be for both their
advantages, against the common enemy, that had an intention to destroy either:
in this manner they were dismissed into their own Country, partly pleased, and a
great deal more unsatisfied, in regard no more life remained from their
employment, then the expectation of the coming of the Kings officers: But in
the interim whilst these messengers were looked for, both the Kingdom of Syria
and the Country of Egypt put in for their several interests, as well
concerning the government it self of the Island, as to be supplied from hence,
with Soldiers in their Wars, one against another; the State of Syria went
only upon the score of Evarchus right and Titles, though Sorastros challenged
their affections in his service, by an ancient Tie as he said they owed the
Egyptian Nation: neither as I told you formerly, was the Arch- Flamin of
Delphos backward in maintaining to the uttermost of his power (by the industry
of some instruments he employed) his own jurisdiction above either; as
pretending the best right to the same, by reason of those agreements that had
been made with the Kings of Lydia, who first conquered this Island.

These attempts I must say, extremely divided the inhabitants both in their
actions and opinions: for as the more moderate sort of people (especially those
that had any correspondency with the Lydians, either by extraction or commerce)
were willing enough to continue the old government, and retain both their
laws and customs they had formerly used, so the violenter part of the
Natives, that had time out of mind contracted a certain kind of barbarism
in their manners and dispositions, would hear of no agreement, but what was
prescribed them by a few commanders, that were sent from the Egyptian Wars,
who seemed only to comply with the religion of Delphos for their own ends:
The people I may affirm with some confidence, were so far transported, and
infatuated with this spightfull ambition (their governors in the interim,
supposing they should be made petty Princes in command, amongst the more
ignorant sort of Natives) that they did not only decline violently all manner
of reasonable accords, but even were persuaded to hate with an exact spleen
and malice, all their own country men, friends and kindred, that had any
manner of correspondency, or almost the least communication with those of the
Lydian race and interest: In the Interim the Senate of Lydia, finding this
violence and distractions amongst us, resolved to put many of the strong Forts
of the Country (which from the beginning of the troubles, they had kept in
their possession) absolutely into the hands of the Myssians, the better to
avoid the expense; and inconveniency of the War in their own particulars,
having as they thought enough to do with their King in in Lydia; and the
rather for that they knew, that as Myssia was most proper, to send Soldiers of
their own Nation into the Island of Creet, whereby to contend with the
inhabitants, so was there such an inveterate spleen and hatred between the
Natives of both Countries, not only in regard of their possessions, but their
religion, that no reconciliation was at any time to be feared: besides the
Myssians with others of Lydia of their faction and interests, supposed the old
Cretans owed them a secret revenge, for having injuriously outed them of their
lands and estates, in the time of the late King Evarchus father.

These Transactions I say, filled the whole country a new with blood and
slaughters; and the more confused it proved; (and so consequently the more
horrid) in regard that for the most part, we fought dividedly upon the general
score of three interests: sometimes two against one, and then again each for
it self, as often as any opposition was found, which not seldom happened, in
regard of the many jealousies and suspicions, rising daily out of the variety
of apprehensions by reason of frequent accidents: so that in a short time,
almost in every place the Towns were fired, the people destroyed, and the
country depopulated; being no safety in any place, or scarce the least means
of subsistence out of Armies, unless it were under the walls, and protection
of some few garrisons, that secured a kind of small circuit, for necessary
provisions, to maintain themselves and the inhabitants of their jurisdiction:
but the King at last receiving from me and others intelligence of these
lamentable proceedings, in the Island of Creet (as truly in a manner it was
past all examples, since the intention of all sides, was not alone to contend
about disputable rights, occasioned by some former oppression, but even to
extirpate not only whole families, but the very remembrance of the Nation it
self, that should have the unhappiness to be overcome by the other) gave
order to me if it were possible to reconcile these bloody differences and
horrid contentions, with all the speed I could, especially amongst those of his
own party, neither was he determintd to exclude out of this number the old
Cretans themselves, however depending upon other interests, only in regard
they seemed by their declarations formerly in words to stand for his Title and
authority, against the proceedings of the Myssians, though publicly, they
contended violently with his Forces in the field: It Is true I cannot deny but
in some things they had reason enough for their jealousies, the King very often
being constrained, to go even from his own resolutions, to give satisfaction
to those Councels that were continually about his person; who persuaded him, he
lost the love of his people in Lydia, by seeming in any kind to favor or
countenance the Cretans in their demands, who as they pretended were enemies to
their general established religion; Of the other side the Natives were again
by much too covetous and mistrustfull not only to desire violently other men's
possessions and estates from them, but so entirely to doubt the Kings
performance of his promises, when as they knew he did but endeavor for his
better advantage, to contract privately with them in most particulars, in such
matters as appertained to the Temple of Delphos, for giving as I said too
general a distaste, to those of his own party, within the Kingdom of Lydia.
But to be short, it was not very long, before the King sent a most intimate
councellor of his own into the Island of Creet, as well to inform me
particularly of his pleasure by word of mouth, as also to join himself with
me and others in commission for the better and speedier effecting of his
designs: presently as soon as he arrived, we sent out our summons to the
whole Country in the general, either to meet themselves, or to appoint
Deputies for each division in the Island, to attend the Kings orders and
direction upon a certain day at Pergame, not only to hear what should be
propounded in their Princes behalf, for their future peace and advantage, but
also we our selves would be ready to hear what the people would demand, to
their further satisfaction, whereby their enemies, the Myssians, might be
opposed in their intentions; who endeavored not only to beat down all Kingly
authority in the Island, but to become absolute Lords, over all the inhabitants
ancient liberties: I must tell you, whilst we expected a joyful issue of these
purposes, we understood another great Lord of Lydia, was newly arrived with
certain directions as was pretended from the King, independent to that power
was granted us, whereby as we were informed, only himself was empowered
underhand, to deal more intimately with the inhabitants concerning matters of
religion: as this something startled our expectation having no such notice from
the King, so did we resolve to send for the party upon our authority, who upon
his appearing, neither obeying our commands, nor giving us the satisfaction was
desired, we at that very instant restrained his person, until the Kings
pleasure in that particular (as we said) should be publicly known: but
whether these proceedings of ours (which however we esteemed for the best) or
that the Natives in truth were otherwise settled in their resolutions, hindered
the success, when the day came according to the appointment for this assembly
to meet, there appeared none at all of the ancient inhabitants of the Country,
so that upon some conclusion of a few things between us and the rest of the
Cretans, who were not altogether so spightfull against the Lydian customs as
the others, we for the present dissolved any further Treaty, which in a manner
is as much as I can say of our present state and affairs, ^ntill I shall be
better instructed, either by the Natives inclinations, or concerning the Kings
fortunes and success; it not being yet a month since the intended Treaty was
broake up:

Roxana as she had been very attentive to all Dedalus discourse, for that she
was extremely desirous to inform her self in what particulars she could,
concerning the passages of the Island, so when he had absolutely made an end of
what he would say, she used these words unto him, truly my Lord, said she, I
must needs confess, this seems to my imagination to be a most unfortunate
Country in the general, if not to be threatened by some desperate fate from the
heavens, to its destruction: however of the other side, it seems something
doubtful as yet to my apprehension in what things the Natives are so much to
blame according to many men's thoughts, since it is but reasonable, as the King
is to expect from them their fidelity and assistance, so they should in some
sort, be assured in their religion and possessions; especially in a conjuncture
of times when there are so many enemies of all parts that conspire their ruin;
not only in respect of the Myssians that are in open hostility against them,
but in regard also of those that attend about Evarchus person at the Court; who
are no way inclinable as you have already intimated to favor their proceedings
or interest. Truly Madam answered Dedalus, if there were no more in it then
those generals you mention, there might be much said in their behalfes, but
being pleased to admit so far of a tedious discour^^, that I may a little
take apart the particulars of their demands, I make no question but you will
easily perceive, that as they were unreasonable, to exact from the Kings
necessities such conditions, so was it unpossible for him to grant them their
desires, without endangering in a manner the whole frame of his affairs, both
in Lydia and Creet it self.

Dedalus finding, that Roxana was most willing to hear all his arguments for
her better satisfaction, he began thus to dispute: First, said he for their
propositions mentioned, not only to have a free liberty to exercise their own
Country rights, in the worship of the gods, according to the use of Delphos,
but to have most of the chief Temples, belonging to the Island delivered into
their hands, with all the rents and revenues belonging unto them, it cannot but
evidently appear to all knowing judgments, what a distraction it would soon
have made in Creet, when as in many places most of the inhabitants themselves,
are contrary in their opinions to those principles, whereupon would follow a
most desperate confusion amongst all sorts of people; when such should be of a
sudden, debarred of the usual place of their sacrificing to the gods, by
those that formerly were subject to their laws and customs; and much more
strange and distasteful it would be, to have the maintenance of all their
Priests and Flamins (being for the most part Lydians by birth) taken from them,
and they turned with their whole families into the world without any substance
at all, after so long a time of possession and settlement: besides it is very
well known, many of the Noblemen and Gentry of the Country it self, upon
whose fidelity and power the Kings present affairs depended, were actually
vested in a great part of those Titles and rents (in a manner beyond any
remembrance) either by gift or purchase: who no doubt upon such a
disadvantagable change, merely out of spleen and distaste, would have quickly
turned their endeavors and affections, to the countenancing absolutely of the
Myssians proceedings, against Evarchus their Prince: In the next place whereas
they demanded, that either no strange governors should be appointed over any
part of the Island, but merely Natives, or at leastwise such as should be
approved by the general council instituted by themselves, I pray consider but
with indifference, which I know you do, what an extraordinary (and I may say)
a most preposterous inconveniency, it would have brought upon the Kings
designs, not only by reason of those contemptible opinions, it would have
created in all men's minds concerning his actions and want of spirit, but also
have given so general a distaste to all his Subjects of best quality in both
Kingdoms, that the effects must needs have been of a most dangerous
consequence, when as the principal men of honor should be absolutely outed,
both of their present command or future expectation, to give way to the
advancement of such people, that neither knew well how to govern when they
should be employed, or the King himself could be at all certain of their
fidelity, when they were in office; as well in regard of the fantastical
inconstancies of their own natures and dispositions; as also in respect of
their several interests depending upon other Nations. And last of all, whereas
it is desired, that all those lands be again restored to the ancient Natives
of the Island, which had been at any time forfeited, for what pretended
rebellion soever, either in the reign of the father of Evarchus, or the old
Queen of Lydia, and so consequently in the possession of any Lydians or
Myssians, would have proved as dangerous an inconveniency to the Kings
affairs, as any other thing we have yet mentioned; and in truth would have
been a work (besides the general distaste) of a most stupendous labor to
have effected: not only in regard of the several intricate Titles, that must
of necessity depend upon the long continuation of them from one family to
another, by reason of alienations and bargains of diverse natures and manners,
made between man and man, but also would be a most difficult matter for the
Natives themselves, justly to distribute with an indifferent equality and
content, to each party who should make their demands, since as many would
pretend to what was none of their own, so others again being but very young
(if at all then borne) when their ancestors lost the possessions of their
estates, (the property of them being also since that time changed, either by
cutting down of woods, erecting of building, or peopling of Towns and
Villages) would be defrauded of their dues, for want of certain knowledge,
what belonged to their Parents: besides how many hundred of families, would be
turned to a most miserable begging posture? who as Tennants to their Lords, had
laid out their money of a confiderable value upon purchases, either for lives
or years, and knew not where to seek other habitations with their wives and
children for their subsistence; neither truly could the Natives make any
considerable profit of the said lands, for want of people to mannure them,
since it is very well known, they in their own persons are not any way
husbandmen, or at all industrious without the Lydian assistance; wherefore
consequently, this course and alteration must bring a general devastation upon
the whole Country: but put case some would readily yield to these orders and
injunctions, by reason of quietness and possession, yet no doubt but the most
part would oppose, being by birth or extraction either Myssians or Lydians,
which of necessity would procure confusion enough, as also be a means that
Evarchus enemies, would dispossess all his friends under their jurisdiction in
like manner, wheresoever they had gained by their swords any thing over the
Kings fortunes in Lydia, Myssia, or Creet. Of the other side, if we do but
consider, the small aid and assistance, these people could have afforded their
Prince at the best, we shall find these concessions (upon the matter) would
have been wholly lost, since they undertook only, to procure him ten
thousand men to be employed in his Wars, without paying them for any
considerable time; and the gods know perhaps, they would not fully have
performed those promises; being as uncertain in their undertakings, as
unreasonable in their demands: No no, Madam, said he, these were but mere
chymeras, broached by some of their eminent commanders for their own ends, to
render themselves great and potent amongst the people, and afterward would have
made use of their power, as their ancestors did before them, to no other
purpose but to exercise Tyranny and nourish rebellion: And however, I say, that
the messenger sent from Delphos seemed to concur in these designs, yet I
will not say he erred, so much in will and intention, as out of ignorance and
want of judgment: nevertheless though he imagined only perhaps to reduce the
inhabitants to their ancient obedience to the Temple of Delphos, without
prejudicing much others rights, yet his complying so much with their rude and
barbarous customs in outward show, according to the old Natives humors; with
his publicly discountenancing all others of a more civil conversation,
notwithstanding they professed the same religion and worship of the gods, gave
not only cause of too much suspicion, concerning his designs and purposes,
but occasioned a great deal of confusion and distraction in the general as
well to the overthrow of the Kings ^^^^est, as to the hazard of the Natives
subsistence in their own Country, in regard of the advantages their enemies
the Myssians make of their differences. But hear a messenger sent from the
Princess Cloria stopped their further discourse, who as he said desired to
speak with Roxana: so that the old woman, only thanking Dedalus for what was
past; and promising too meet him often upon the same subject, made have to know
her Mistresses pleasure:

When Roxana came into her Chamber, the Princess told her, that she had been
lately troubled with a most untoward and fearful dream, which however in her
thoughts she was not at all superstitious as she said, yet she could not
absolutely free her apprehension from the consideration of it: she imagined
her self and Narcissus to be upon the Sea together in one Vessel, when of a
sudden an extreme darkness seemed to cover the face of the water, in so much
as they could not perceive any thing at all about them, whereupon both of them
remaining frighted, with a kind of horror to see so great an unexpected change
in the weather, from a clear Sun-shine-day, to a time almost as black as
night, they might at last behold themselves encompassed round about with many
ships, belonging to the Senate of Lydia, that bid them presently yield to that
power without resistance, unless they would hazard their own destructions:
so that instantly conceiving themselves no way able to resist so peremptory a
command, their persons were presently not only seized, but separated with a
great deal of cruelty one from anoth^^, to their no small grief and
amazement, whilst in the interim also she heard some of the company say, that
as this design was put in execution, by the authority of young Philos
Philostros nephew, so was it his pleasure to have her self carried prisoner
into her fathers Kingdom of Lydia, as he was resolved to dispose of the person
of Narcissus, according to his own will and intentions in the Kingdom of
Syria: presently upon the apprehension of the dream (as she said) she
wakened, with some kind of seeming trouble more then ordinary as the people
about her had informed her her:

Roxana finding her Mistress notwithstanding her professions, to be something
discomposed, either by reason of the distempers of her sickness, or in regard
of the distraction of her apprehension, having belike before she went to
sleep, filled her imagination with some unprofitable thoughts proceeding from
the discourse of former actions or conceptions, told her, that as it was the
greatest folly in the world (if not a most supreme impiety) to put any manner
of confidence or belief in dreams unpleasant, that were engendered only in
the fancy by mere accidents, meeting with the indisposition of the body, so if
the gods at any time had a will, we should be instructed in things to come
necessary to be known, they would certainly send us for true information to
Oracles, that are not to be held fallible in any kind: of the contrary, the
motions that proceed from our selves are for the most part governed by
passions; and so consequently not to be relied upon, although sometimes I
cannot deny said she but they happen accordingly, though no otherwise then
like as a person should cast a stone over a house, and by mere fortune might
kill a bird of the other side; for though the stone had but that one place to
light in to do the thing, yet by mere fortune it might as well light there as
any where else: but however this short discourse, reasonably well quieted the
Princesses thoughts for the present; yet both she and Roxana fell upon a
resolution, with all possible speed to haste their journey toward the Island
of Cyprus; as well for that they doubted not, but to meet Narcissus to their
extraordinary content and satisfaction there; as of the other side, not
conceiving Greet to be a place of sufficient security any long time, in regard
of those many factions and disturbances in the country, depending upon several
interests, according to the relations of Dedalus the governor; for besides the
inconstant natures of the people, with the small authority the King seemed to
have by way of jurisdiction, over the very actions and affairs of his own
party (as they were informed) could they be very confident of the fidelity of
the City of Pergame, where they for the present remained; in regard the Senate
of Lydia by occasion of Trade, seemed to have a kind of hidden influence, in
the thoughts and affections of most of the inhabitants: nevertheless, although
Cloria and her governesse might have these passionate desires, of removing with
all expedition, yet neither the distempers of the Princess, or the commodity
of the Syrian Vessel that had conveyed them thither, as yet afforded them the
convenience.

But whilst their expectations from day to day waited the opportunity, Dedalus
of a sudden had intelligence, that the old Cretans having newly given the
Myssians in their Country a kind of a desperate overthrow, esteeming
themselves thereby at more liberty to act as they pleased, were marching in all
have against the Walls of Pergame, with an intention as 'twas said, to obtain
the absolute jurisdiction both of the Town and Haven: The Governor upon this,
after he had made the Princess Cloria acquainted with the news, assembled the
chief Magistrates of the City, whereby not only to take their advice, but to
demand their assistance; however all the benefit this congregation produced
toward the end he intended, was to break up the meeting in distracted
counsels instead of more settled resolutions; for he found some were for the
Senate of Lydia and the Myssians; others again declared their affections to be
most inclinable for the proceedings and Religion of the ancient Natives; though
the third sort of people however fewest in number declared for the Princess
Cloria and himself: but Dedalus finding, he could not build his determinations
upon these uncertainties, wherein both the safety of the Town and his own
honor, might probably suffer, by reason of the protraction; as also the person
of the Princess Cloria be endangered by his slownesse and neglect, he quickly
mustered up all the Soldiers of the Castle, with such others of the Kings
party in the City, that were willing to obey his command, with an intention
according to Roxana's persuasion, only to guard and defend the Walls and the
Bullwarkes of the Town from any sudden surprise of the Rebels; not
conceiving himself able to contend equally with them in the Field, by reason
of their numbers and provision: no sooner was this resolution of his publicly
made known in the general to the people, but the most part of them, began
with open mouths to exclame against his intentions, calling him Traitor and
coward, with a thousand other words of most infamous language, pretending he
durst not issue out into the field to fight with the enemy, for fear of his
own person, though it were thereby to secure all their lives and estates: As
this mad rage in the multitude, was kindled by the Myssians faction in the
City, as doubting if it were not speedily prevented, the old Cretan Natives
might probably become masters of the place, and so by consequence they should
be hindered of their Trade and commerce with Smyrna, and other Haven Towns
belonging to the Senate of Lydia, so was Dedalus forced to issue out into the
Field, and venture a Battle with the Rebels, which he performed with so gallant
a bravery, that within few hours time he dislodged most of their Troops from
about and near the walls of Pergame: But three or four days after, thinking
to return again into the Town with both honor and authority, he was
suddenly (contrary to his expectation) violently opposed and denied entrance
at the gates of the City, the inhabitants pretending that he only seemed to
have put the enemy to flight, when he had resolved to deliver up the Town into
their hands: Dedalus in the interim being enflamed with this ungrateful
proceedings of his Country men, resolved by power and force of arms, to gain
a new entrance to his old command; and to this purpose, although his Soldiers
were not many, he began to make formal Trenches, as if he intended a long and
continued siege, whereby again to bring the people, to their wonted and
ancient obedience, to that jurisdiction he held under the King his master, as
supposing neither their strength or skill, would long be able to contend with
his right and power: but alas, they had already too craftily prevented his
purposes, by more preventing designs; for as soon as they fell upon these
resolutions, to keep him by strong hand out of the Town, they sent privately
to those Lydian ships that lay dispersed over the Seas, with a full declaration
of their intentions, which was to render themselves obedient to the Senat's
commands; of which a considerable number was already come into the Haven, to
take possession of the City, whereby to receive the peoples offers in that
nature, with a promise also of their parts, to afford them protection both in
war and peace, against all those that should oppose: This being soon made known
to Dedalus, he had no other way, but to endeavor the best conditions he could
both for himself and the Princess, to which effect Commismissioners of each
side were appointed to Treat; since as he could not altogether have declined
this remedy, so with no probable hope, could he have expected the gaining of
the Town by force, in regard of those supplies which remained in the ships
newly come into the Haven; to strengthen the inhabitants endeavors and
resolutions; of the other side, being obliged to lie with all his Forces in the
Fields before the Walls of Pergame, without either supplies or provision, he
was in certain danger to be destroyed by the old Natives, who not many days
before by his valor and conduct, he had disgracefully chased from the siege.

However the Princess Cloria, when she came to the assured knowledge of these
unfortunate passages, by which her own liberty seemed again to be
circumscribed, by a new though a more inferior jurisdiction, although she
could not be but sufficiently sensible of the unhappiness of such a
subjection, yet she resolved to meet her captivity with such a majesty, as
either would bring revenge upon her person, in regard of her Fathers
contentions, or procure a respectfull compassion from her enemies, that might
defend her Dignity from all oppression: with these thoughts (as if she had
been of a sudden miraculously cured of her distempers) she called for her
Clothes, whereby the better to put her courageous determinations in execution,
when any violence to that purpose should be attempted: but Roxana upon the
instant coming in to her chamber, and finding her body not in a capacity to
answer to that resolution of her mind, not only gave her counsel to lie
still, and expect as yet the farther event of things during the Treaty, but
also entered into more necessary discourses with her, concerning what was to be
thought upon and done, in this unlucky conjuncture of affairs; although she
could not apprehend much danger would happen, either to her person or quality
by this accident: To this purpose she used this language unto her as she lay
in her bed: Madam said she, put the worst, which is to be made prisoners to
this new power, that as you see, has not only driven out Dedalus from his
command, but probably will now circumvent all our other designs, if they can
find the opportunity: they must either carry you into Lydia, or send you home
into Cyprus; if they conducted you into Lydia, they cannot certainly be so
inhumane, as to debar you from the sweet society of your most honored and
noble Father, in whose conversation you will not only be delighted; as it may
be imagined with a most supreme felicity, but also you will have the
commodity, to impart unto him your secret resolution, concerning the intended
marriage, between my Lord Narcissus and your self, which perhaps is a
convenience you would be most unwilling to miss; and in some sort requisite
before you absolutely finish those other ceremonies, which in effect as you
know, must have been performed either in person or by Deputy, to render you
fully satisfied in your thoughts; since as you may remember you made an open
profession to that purpose: besides how do you know, but that you may find
your Father in such a prosperous condition, that by the absolutely subjection
of his enemies, your mother the Queen may again be called home to her old
honors and felicities in Lydia? which would be the convenietest and best
Theater, whereon to act the happy parts of your most glorious Nuptials: of the
contrary if they should send you into Cyprus, certainly you should be in the
place according to your own wishes, since all this while you have endeavored
the expedition and success of that journey, as the last seeming period of your
desires, after all your strange and several adventures; esteeming it as a full
satisfaction from the gods, in recompense of your so many troubles and hazards:
neither let it ever enter into your thoughts, that the Senate of Lydia will in
any kind, either endanger your person or restrain your liberty; for that, as
such intentions would afford them no manner of benefit whatsoever, in their
contentions with the King your Father (since there are already many of the
royal Issue out of their power and possession) so would it not only cause a
more general hate upon their actions throughout all Asia, but highly
exasperate your Uncle Orsames against their proceedings; to the endangering
certainly, of a new War between Syria and Lydia, which no doubt but the
Senate will endeavor to prevent, by all means possible they can invent.

Yet however Roxana might be of these opinions, or that she only used such
discourses, the better to encourage the Princess, nevertheless it was not
many days before the Senates Sea Forces declared their intentions; which was
absolutely to conduct Cloria into Lydia, restrained in her person, until (as
they said) the farther pleasure of the Senate, should be known concerning her
particular; withal pretending they had a peremptory commission to execute
according to this purpose; proceeding belike from the untoward endeavor of
that Ambassador at Memphis, that had been employed by Philos, to distroy the
Loves between Cloria and Narcissus: As for Dedalus, all the conditions he could
procure for himself, was, upon their undertaking to pay him thirty Talents for
the discharge of his Soldiers, and the defraying of his necessary expenses,
presently to lay down Arms and quit the Island of Creet; though if he pleased
being so agreed between them, he might visit the Kingdom of Lydia, until such
time he should more commodiously prepare his occasions, for his absolute
transportation into foreign parts.

It Is true Roxana cast about many ways in her working thoughts, how yet to
alter or prevent these determinations of carrying the Princess Cloria into
Lydia a prisoner: first she fancies to steal out of the Town, to those
Forces which Dedalus had in a body entire without the Walls; and
notwithstanding the agreement to animate their spirits to stand for the Kings
right and the Princess safety: but finding they both needed necessary
provisions, and were in danger in their persons hourly to be cut off by the
old Cretans, that lay every where dispersed over the whole Country; who hated
them as they knew equal with the Myssians, she thought that would be a
project of no great consequence to their benefit; then again she imagined,
that perchance they might use some stratagem, to be conveyed privately out of
the Haven, by some hired ship to that purpose; and by that means concealedly
get into the Island of Cyprus, according to their former intentions: however
when she remembered she was told, that the officers of the Senates forces, had
lately not only taken a strict account of all the Vessels that remained in the
Harbor, but had also put in new Commanders of their own in every ship, she
supposed with no probability what, soever, could they attempt such a design
without being revealed; and then they might come to be worse used in their
confinement. Whereas now the Princess was promised all honor, favor, and
respect according to her Dignity in the journey.

And lastly she conceited, that perchance they might find not only reception
but protection in the Armies of the ancient Natives: but when she considered
the inconstancy of their dispositions, the rudeness of their customs, with
their several particular interests, she thought it a vanity, if not a madness
to put in execution any such design, and the rather for that the Princess
Cloria her self, was not yet so perfectly recovered of her health, that she
could possibly expose her person to those uncertainties, both in travel, and
diet, with other inconveniences, that she would necessarily be obliged to
suffer amongst those unpollisht Troops: wherefore the old woman being in her
opinion convinced in all these particulars, she persuaded her Mistress, with
a kind of a majesty mixed with affability and kindness, to entertain both her
fortunes, and those Commanders that should be designed to conduct her under the
jurisdiction of the Senate, since as yet they could not by any means learn
what probably might be resolved of, concerning the farther disposure of their
persons, upon their arrival in the Kingdom of Lydia.

It was not many days when the Princess Cloria had declared her self, both
fit and willing, to undertake a journey, that the Admiral at Sea, who had been
sent out by the direction of the Ambassador, that remained as was formerly
related at Memphis, conducted the sweet Princess with her governesse into his
own ship, where he had prepared a magnificent Cabin for her reception; but
whether so adorned out of any intention thereby the better to win her belief,
or out of the humanity of his own nature I cannot tell: yet so it was, in that
unwelcome Triumph, that both the Fleet and the Seas themselves received them
with a prosperous Wind, which in two days and a night or thereabouts, landed
them in the fair and ancient Haven of Smyrna. where they reposed not much
longer, before they were conveyed by many gallant Troops of horse (by the
Senates directions) to a brave Castle of the Kings, seated upon a hill not very
far off the great City of Sardis, where they had not only time enough to rest,
but to exercise abundantly their own thoughts, since as they knew they were
confined, so were they in a manner out of hope to know for how long.

Some weeks after the said Princess, and her affectionate Governesse, had
remained imprisoned in the Castle, which the Senate had ordered for their
confinement, spending their time for the most part in fruitless complaints,
accompanied with more Tears, of a sudden Roxana one day as she was sitting in
a low Parlor, that opened a Balcona-window into the park, where many tame
Dear grazed, that all the winter were accustomed to be fed by the hand, for
the pleasure formerly of the King, who upon his retirement from troublesome
affairs, would repair thither for the better privacy of recreation, was
salluted by a young gentleman, of more then ordinary beauty and comeliness of
person, who after he had with a certain winning behavior made up between
confidence and humility, bestowed some complements upon her, he uttered this
language: Madam said he, not finding the excellent Princess Cloria so apt and
capable for my discourse at present, as I wish she were, in regard of those
desparing sorrows, that seem to cloud so many admirable perfections, that were
wont to give new lustres to the world, and may again notwithstanding these
ominous interpositions, that seem to be governed, not only by a cruel but a
most presumptuous and unmannerly fate, if she can but be wrought to such a
confidence and belife of my intentions, concerning her service, as is not only
convenient but most necessary for the season: for however the office I now seem
to hold under the Senats jurisdiction, is cause I must confess of suspicion
enough, to the most strongest persuasions, yet I call all the gods to witness,
who best know my heart, that I harbor never a thought inwardly that does not
entirely wish a most supreme happiness to every action, that Evarchus can
think may again bring him to the uttermost height, of all his ancient honors
and Dignities, though the circumstances and reasons of my affections, in regard
of my present condition, are so many and various at this time to be disputed:
but if this belief of my loyalty, shall take that place with your charity, as
I humbly desire it may, I shall then discover unto you such passages, lately
come to my knowledge, that will not only probably secure the Princess from a
storm coming upon her, which perhaps she would most willingly avoid, but
also put her in a way of so absolute a happiness, that I dare be hold to say,
neither her hopes nor yours can yet arrive unto.

Roxana however she knew not (notwithstanding all his violent professions) how
to be over confident of his intentions, yet in regard both of the necessity of
their condition, as also having some kind of reasons given her, by the
earnestness of his language, and the ingenuity of his countenance, to be
something pliable to his discourse, she thought it at leastwise the safest way,
to comply with his offer without any seeming jealousy, whatsoever: And to this
purpose, after she had abundantly thanked him for his extraordinary courtesy,
she told him, both her Ladies obligations and her own, would be exceedingly
augmented, by any information he should give of the Senats intentions, since as
yet they could sinde nothing but effects of their cruelty; And much more if by
his assistance, they might wind themselves out of their present troubles and
future dangers.

Then Lady said he, as the story I have to tell, concerns Prince Cassianus
fortunes, since his departure out of Lydia, wherein the Princess Cloria is
involved, so must I desire your leave to prosecute all those circumstances that
belong to the relation, however perhaps they may not be altogether judged so
necessary to the matter, by your discerning judgment, yet in regard the
passages cannot be but something delightful to your fancy, I shall make bold
to presume upon your patience, since truly they are both admirable and almost
past all belief:

Know then, that Cassianus at his being at the Court of Lydia, though his
business in outward view seemed to pretend to nothing, but the procuring
assistance from the King, to regaine his lost Country of Iberia, yet secretly
I must tell you, he fell in love with the Princess Cloria, which however he
durst not discover: In this posture he continued between hope and despair,
until the arrival of the old Queen Anaxia, as he believed drowned all his
encouragements, in a vast Sea of impossibility, for that she brought with her
in her journey, certain propositions full of honor and benefit to Evarchus
Court, from the King of Egypt, concerning a marriage between the fair
Princess and his Son and Heir Osiris, which caused Cassianus that night, when
all the world was employed about the triumphant sports, that were designed for
the entertainment of the Queen of Syria, to leave Lydia: belike being put on to
those resolutions, by his melancholy apprehensions, which however as you very
well know so enflamed the whole Kingdom, by the spightfull practices of
factious Dimogoras joined with the crafty insinuations of others of the same
interest; that it proved a maine occasion that since has disquieted the King
in his government.

But Cassianus himself who had left Lydia ingendring certain black clouds of
malignant vapors, that afterward became furious storms of blood and
slaughter (though I cannot say he was any way guilty in their effects; for
Princes Titles and interests are oftentimes abused to sinister ends and
purposes) retired in person, under the jurisdiction of an ancient Forest, not
many days journey from the Court, where sometimes he privately lived,
delighting his solitary intentions, with the exercise of hunting, and other
rural delights, which those pleasant woods, and that fruitful Country
plentifully afforded his nature and fortune: but not long it was before
Hyacinthia our Queen also, by reason of the inflammations of Lydia, was forced
to quit her Husbands Kingdom by which accident as you know she met in that
place, with the company of her banished brother Candalus, outed in like manner
of all his happiness, by the powerful authority of Philostros great favorite
to Orsames.

As most of these passages were within the compass of your own intelligence,
which I have related only for my stories better method, so now I shall presume
to inform you of such particulars, as you have not yet heard of; for Cassianus
remaining as I said in the delightful Forest, and going under the borrowed
and abbreviated name of Cassa, being disguised in the habit of a young
huntsman, upon the Queens arrival, presented himself to your view though not
to your knowledge: by which encounter, he was encouraged, again to prosecute
his old love (almost laid asleep by time and separation, to the Princess
Cloria since the convenience (as he thought) could not be bettered; and in that
manner resolved to wait upon the Queen undiscovered into Syria: Nevertheless
in that intended voyage as you know, both himself and Eumenes suffered
shipwreck; however Cassianns (though the other perished) by the
prospitiousnesse of the heavens, escaped in a manner miraculously the desperate
danger of the Sea, and entered into such adventures as scarce can be paralleld:
for his body being supported, upon a flat chest full of Jewels belonging to
himself, by the only flowing of the water, was carried into certain Nets
belonging to poor fishermen, who finding a young man full of beauty, though
almost dead by the violent agitation of the waves, after they had recovered
some life in him, presented him to a Lords daughter of the Country called
Brisania, as a subject worth her best compassion; but the Lady-whether taken
with the youth and beauty of her patient, or having an inclination to affect
that she had once preserved, of a sudden fell in love with his lovely person,
since she had no motives to be enticed by the knowledge of his Titles, he
having concealed himself, the better to perform his intended journey into
Syria: and this love at last from small sparcles, began to increase to a great
flame, though for a long time Cassianus was not informed of the Ladies
passions; for her virgin modesty ever suppressed the declaration of that which
she had much ado to hide, until the secret fire was discovered by the sharp
sight of another Suitor, that had already procured the good will of her Father
for their future marriage; notwithstanding another Rival by a more noble love
contended with the former for pre-eminence: In the interim that these intricate
affections seemed to act several parts, the old Lord by his unexpected death,
left his fair daughter to inherit rather misfortune, then jurisdiction; For
Fridius her hated Lover (being so called) presently seized both upon her Person
and Country, pretending that her Father in his last will, had instituted him
the sole governor of her Minority, least she might endanger both her honor
and safety by some inconsiderable match; resolving withal to make Cassianus a
Sacrifice or a Petitioner to compass his ends: to which purpose, he caused him
publicly to be accused, that he intended to have betrayed the Town and
Conutrey to a foreign power; under pretense of freeing Brisania from prison,
who seemed also to have consented to the practice, whereby to have procured her
own releasement. And this being falsely laid to his charge he was unjustly
condemned; however Fridius suspended the execution until he had not only
again attempted the Ladies consent to his offered Love, but procured
Cassianus, who went by the borrowed name of Cassa, to be himself a Solicitor
in his suit; which opportunely gave Brisania occasion, instead of granting
Fridius his request, to discover her own love; but Cassianus became rather
confused then pleased at this discovery, since the hazard of his own life could
but purchase the acceptance; in so much as only with a sorrowful courtship he
entertained her discourse, however she gave him leave to depart, and carry her
peremptory denial to the proud Tyrant. Nevertheless poor Cassa was to be
made the object of his spleen, since Brisania would not be the subject of his
love; for some few days after he was brought to a public scaffold erected
before the Castle window, where Brisania remained, that she might be the better
witness of the bloody Tragedy intended; Cassa appeared in a mourning habit,
becoming the sadness of his present condition, but much more clouded in his
sorrowful countenance, that showed his dejected mind; though his beauty had
yet so large a possession in his person by the opinion of the people, that he
seemed a Sun shaded in a dark sky, that notwithstanding shot forth bright
beams under the black coverture; And in this manner was lead to the Theater
of death in the view of the people, who accompanied him all the way with their
liberal lamentation, since these were the only sacrifices they could offer in
his behalf; for although he was esteemed amongst them but a private Gentleman
of Iberia, yet could they not choose but grieve to see a Youth of his natural
perfections, untimely brought to his destruction, by the cruelty of a wicked
Tyrant: But in the mean time poor Brisania summoned to the spectacle by the
noise of the spectators, at the first sight began to feel new passions in her
gentle bosom, not so much of love as pity, since the prisoner himself had by
diverse messages solicited her to yield, rather then to make him the only
object of Fridius his hate: wherefore, first she laid before her thoughts the
innocence of the prisoner that was to suffer, only because she continued
wilful. Then she began to think there was nothing but her own miserable
captivity could redeem his life, religion, charity and affection pleaded of one
side, as hatred, honor, and courage contended of the other, which made her
sometimes resolve to break through the crowde, and fling her self at Fridius
his feet to beg his pardon: But then her spirit again disdaining such a
submission, rather choosing to cast her person amongst the people, and by her
own death incite their revenge, Whilst these considerations tormented her
gentle soul, and that his approaching execution seemed to exact from her
consent a speedy resolution, at the further end of the Market place appeared a
confused fear amongst the common people, which was quickly seconded, not only
with cries of Treason, but with the noise of many warlike instruments, tending
to the surprise of the Town, so that the scaffold that was ordained to be the
stage where Cassa was to act his last part, became soon emptied of all those
unwelcome assistances, and he left only to be his own prisoner; an accident
certainly that sufficiently pleased him, although his amazed joy had scarce
belief enough to apprehend he was freed, which made him longer continue that
posture the executioner had put him in, then his good fortune required at his
hands, so that he moved not until one of the Soldiers wished him to pray for
the life of Saxanius who had delivered him from death. By which declaration it
was quickly known throughout all the Marketplace, that Brisanias first Suitor
had both saved Cassa from destruction, and possessed himself of the City, who
hearing of the cruel captivity of his dear Mistress by the wicked tyranny of
Fridius, had assembled all his friends to her rescue, and by a neat stratagem,
had happily brought about the design for her delivery, and her enemies
punishment: Fridius sufficiently apprehensive of the guilt of his own Treason,
staid not to dispute the right of his cause with his victorious rival, but
presently retired under the safe protection of the strong Castle, where he
supposed was a Garrison able to contend, whilst other succors came to his
assistance; besides he had Brisania in his power, by whose authority and Title
he imagined the better to retain the obedience of the People. But Saxanius
intending neither to be slothful in his love or hate; after he had given some
orders for the surer obedience of the Town, soon placed a formal siege before
the Fort where his Mistress was imprisoned, with so great a probability of
prevailing that within some few days he received a Message from wicked
Fridius, that if he did not presently retire himself and his Troops from
before the Castle, he vowed by all the gods that Brisania should act the first
part in that Tragedy was intended: And for the greater assurance of his
intention, he caused the Lady to be brought upon the Leads, where were already
prepared the circumstances of her death.

Saxanius after he had understood this peremptory demand from the proud Tyrant,
and beheld with his sorrowful eyes the threatened danger of his fair
Mistress, for whose safety he had engaged not only his own courage, but the
valors also of all his friends and kindred, became tormented with many
thoughts, and diverse resolutions, since if he absolutely performed the
commanding request of his hated rival, he was no more secured (as he supposed)
of Brisania's preservation, then if he should yield to nothing he desired, but
rather gave Fridius the more liberty to be cruel, when he had no occasion to
fear; And for any promise he could make, it was to be esteemed like the rest
of his false actions: wherefore he almost determined to send away the Harralde
with a threatening denial, instead of a submissive consent. But then reflecting
upon the apprehensions of his dear love, who as he believed, would imagine
that he esteemed much more a little honor then the saving of her life, it
destroyed his former half resolution, and entered him again into new and
confused considerations, which were lost in his desperate breast with diversity
of passions, until casting his sad eyes toward the place where Brisania was,
as a pure sacrifice to be offered according to his imagination, who seemed in
his apprehension already to accuse him of unworthy love, that could so long
dispute in his mind her preservation; of a sudden he might see one cast
headlong from the top of the Castle into the ditch; which too soon persuaded
his belief that the wicked Tyrant had prevented his judgment, by performing
the execution before the return of his messenger: so that he remained like one
that seemed to be changed into a marble Statute, until a flagge of Truce
appeared joyfully upon the Castle, as a testimony of future friendship: however
Saxanius could not be satisfied in the Omen, until a Messenger from the Fort
assured him not only of the Ladies safety, but also of the death of Fridius;
with this relation, that the Soldiers of the Fort, neither being able to
endure their Princess captivity, nor the Tyrants cruelty, had by force rescued
their Mistress, and committed a supreme Justice upon his person; who now was
sent from Brisania to know what conditions the besiegers expected both for her
liberty and the Town they had already conquered. But Saxanius would make no
Articles at all with his Love, for after he had disposed of his Troops into
several Quarters, he went to present himself a slave to the fair Captive he
had redeemed, where he intended to chain his freedom for ever. However
Cassianus finding that he was not only fallen into some disdain by reason of
those desires he expressed for his own preservation, as also Saxanius likely to
take possession of those favors he might have enjoyed, imagined there was no
way to preserve him still in the good will of his Lady, but to discover his
quality, which he supposed would both advance his esteem, and lessen his
rivals credit; and by that means become a public pretender to Brisania;
which notwithstanding produced no other effects then a challenge from Saxanius,
which Cassianus in honor could not refuse, after he had given sufficient
testimonies of his condition to be a Prince and no wandering stranger. Yet
however the day was appointed for the combat, and every ones expectation
attended the final event of the quarrel, Brisania's nurse called Rhena
promised to satisfy all parties without danger or blood, provided her
Mistress would be directed by her Counsels, and become wife to him whom the
heavens had ordained to be her husband.

This strange intricacy gave curious desires to multitudes of people to be
present at the wonder, since both the Champions were resolved not to be foiled
in their honor, scarce in their loves; Wherefore they came into the Field
armed, to supply the defect of the old woman's performance, according to her
bold promise: but when they were prepared to have ended the difference by a
bloody encounter. Rhena entreated them they would first repair to the great
Temple to sacrifice to the immortal gods, where she said, she might perhaps
relate such a story, that would satisfy all their desires. This proposition
from the old woman, although it carried not with it much probability of
according the rivalls, their quarrel being grounded upon a difference that
knew not how to admit of any competition, when gratitude it self seemed to
have no place in Cassianus disposition, though he enjoyed his life by the
fortunate favor of Saxanius; yet by the importunate cries of the people who
began to be less curious and more pitiful, they were persuaded to follow her
directions; and being before the Altar encompassed round about by the expecting
multitude, Rhena after she had called the heavens to witness of the truth of
what she intended to utter, delivered this relation, which as she said, she had
bound her self by a vow never to declare, until some necessity not to be
avoided forced from her the discovery.

When beauteous Elizana said she, the virtuous mother of Prince Cassianus here
present, was constrained with her dear Husband, to fly from the Country of
Mesopotamia by the prevailing power of Artaxes general, in the way being great
with child, she was forced to retire to the house of my late Lord, Father to
Brisania, whose wife was her near kinswoman, and at the same time great also,
where she had not remained many days before she was delivered of a fair
daughter, as my Lady not long after of another, to the joy of the whole house:
however, the gods esteeming my Mistress too good for this life, took her out
of this world before she had finished the month of her childbirth, to the
unspeakable sadness both of her husband, and all her servants, leaving no
issue to inherit her singular virtues but a daughter only. Elizana also being
quickly called away by her own troubles, left her little infant unto my
education, as my Lord also trusted me with his jewel: but accidents and the
wars in Armenia growing every day more hot then other, for the better
security and quiet, I was persuaded with the two children, to retire to my own
house, where we remained for some years, they contented to be each others
companion, as I happy to be both their Foster mother, since they increased not
so fast in days and nights as in beauty and goodness; but alas the Fates
were envious at our felicity, and took one of them out of the world, and with
these words, the old woman wept with the remembrance of her dear loss, until
her many Tears running down her aged cheeks gave some interruption to her
discourse: but finding her grief was scarce seasonable to the passionate
multitude, she wiped her eyes, and then proceeded: When the violence of the
war said she became so qualified, that Parents had some leisure to enjoy the
comfort of their children, I presented my Lord with a beautiful daughter;
though for the other I had in charge, I desired his favor to make my excuse,
since it was not in my power to prevent the will of the gods, which gave him so
much satisfaction, that he persuaded Elizana by letter to be content that had
many more, which continued until my Lady Brisania by his late death as you
know became heir to all his possessions, though interrupted some time by
wicked Fridius, and redeemed by valiant Saxanius, to whom without a great deal
of ingratitude she cannot but give her self, and all that she has, since she
has received it from his hands. At which words Cassianus began to muster up
within his breast a multitude of passions, until the old woman turning toward
him told him, that presently she would render him satisfied also: wherefore,
after the people were a little quieted in their confused murmur, she thus ended
her story: But now said she to unriddle this mystery, and fully to perform my
promise, I must let know, that Brisania wat not child to your late deceased
Governor, but daughter to worthy Elizana; I only using that fallacy upon the
death of the other, because I feared the loss to my Lord would have proved a
vexation intolerable, since he wanted children to inherit his fortune and
honor; and for Elizana, I supposed the cross would not appear so great, in
respect of the bountifulness of the issue which the gods had bestowed upon
her; however I made a private vow to my self as I said, never to discover this
mystery, until some pressing occasion forced from me the declaration, as well
to retain Brisania in her supposed Fathers possessions, as to take from their
Parents all jealousy of my fraud. But since the heavens by the power and
right of conquest, have now established my Lord Saxanius in that government
which Brisania did intend innocently to usurp, and that his noble pretentions
to her love deserve her best entertainment, as if the Gods intended a
perpetual unity in their hearts against all obstacles, I hope it will be the
opinion of all here present, that the marriage between them be solemnized
instantly in the Temple; and the rather for that I cannot doubt Prince
Cassianus will forbid the conjunction, since nature denies him the capacity of
such a happiness. This declaration was quickly warranted by the desires of all
the people with loud acclamations, so that Brisania turning about to Saxanius
with a blush that more enflamed his joy, after a little pawse saluted him with
this language: My Lord said she, for so it should seem the destinies have
designed you against all difficulties, though whether I shall be now esteemed
worthy in your virtuous thoughts to give you that Title may be some question,
since your noble addresses formerly received not those ready entertainements
they merited: however, I shall endeavor to persuade you to believe that the
heavens have had a secret influence whereby the better to unite our selves,
since my preposterous affection to my Brother upon small grounds endeavored
something to obscure your perfections in my apprehension, which now appear to
my knowledge in a most full and affectionate prospect, that absolutely delights
all my senses. And with that, as if she had been too liberal in her language,
like a Rose over-prest with the nights dew, by little and little cast down her
lovely looks upon the ground. Saxanius instead of delivering his judgment
concerning Brisania's plea, put in execution his intended decree by a gentle
kiss upon her fair lips, which gave the people sufficient intelligence of his
thoughts, so that the marriage became presently solemnized, to the content of
all the standers by, but more specially to themselves, whose happiness could
not fully be apprehended but in the fruition only. And this Madam, I say, is
the delightful, though intricate story of Cassianus adventures, since his
departure out of Lydia, which he was pleased to signify in writing under his
own hand; however to none but to his faithful friend and chiefest counselor
Dimogoras.

But now that I have entertained your ears with these strange though pleasant
passages; as I may say, seemingly rather miracles, then accidents, I shall come
nearer a great deal to your concernments: This intelligence of the safety of
the Prince, you must know, enflamed the thoughts of Dimogoras; whereupon he
began to consider if a marriage could be compassed, between Cloria the Kings
daughter and Cassianus, it would undoubtedly, not only strengthen his own
greatness, but exceedingly fortify all manner of contentions of the Senate,
with Euarchus the King, since by this means his daughter should not be matched
to any foreign Prince, that might give her father assistance; but rather by
degrees would be wrought to be an enemy to his pretentions and desires.

With these considerations he went presently to the Senate, whereby to make
them acquainted with the intelligence he had received. To this purpose, being
sat in the Council, he uttered this kind of speech, with as much eloquence as
his natural roughness, and want of education could deliver.

My Lords, said he, as it is most evident, the gods have hitherunto prospered
our attempts in a most admirable manner, to the wonder of all Asia, so of the
other side may we again behold, a kind of miraculous influence depending upon
those accidents, fignified unto you by Prince Cassianus Letters: These things
being considered, I see no reason, nay I may boldly affirm there is a great
deal of piety in the resolution, both belonging to the service of the gods, as
also toward the establishing of our own affairs, to endeavor all ways
possible, to unite the persons and affections, of Cloria the Kings daughter,
and Cassianus the adventurous Prince, in such indissolvable ties of love and
marriage, that may not only render them happy themselves, but secure us from
all fear of a foreign conjunction, that undoubtedly would disorder (if not
destroy) that work we have already wisely begun, and hope shall fortunately end
in this Kingdom. For my part, I must confess, I do almost tremble yet, when
I consider in how great a hazard our affairs stood, before your Admiral
surprised the Princess at Pergame; for that the alliance intended between her
self and Narcissus, could not have been other than ominous; when as of the
other side, we are most assured, to find Cassianus upon all occasions, not
only a furtherer of our designs, but a lover of our persons. Perhaps you may
be a little startled with the doubts, that Cloria will scarce be brought to
think of such Nuptials; but truly these are merely frivolous considerations, in
comparison of benefits of States, and Kingdoms; wherefore I say, If she cannot
be persuaded to yield her consent, by the influence of his Courtship, she must
be compelled by your power and authority. So that my opinion is, that Cassianus
be presently sent for, not only to put in execution, with all expedition, what
we shall determine for our own happiness, and the Kingdoms welfare; but also
to be honored and maintained by our loves and affections, according to our
former resolution and promises. Let it suffice there seems already (...) them
sent by the gods for their good) yet she resolved in her thoughts to enquire
after the party and his interest, by which she intended to lay the ground of
those Councels she would use. To this purpose, after some few days she became
informed, that he was a young Nobleman of Lyria, called Creses, employed by the
Senate in the government of the Country about the Castle, which made her also
observe his actions, whereby she might learn, whether it were a new instructed
duty that taught him better obedience to the Kings service then formerly; or
whether some discontent of his other Lords proceedings at Sardis, in regard of
his own person, caused him revengefully to put off his trust. But as within the
compass of some weeks she was satisfied it was neither of these reasons that
gave him an appetite to leave his command, and begin a new loyalty to his King;
so of the other side she became assured in her opinion, that his secret love to
the Princess Cloria was the principal cause that made him offer so acceptable
a service, to the hazard of his own life; and with this knowledge fell into
many considerations with her Mistress, whether it were better with security of
their persons, still to remain in the Castle, where they were under the
jurisdiction of the Senate, and to expect the vexations of Cassianus
importunity upon his arrival, as Creses had informed them, or hazard
themselves under the protection of the new lover, whose disposition and
intention they were not acquainted withal; nevertheless, after long debate
they fell upon the latter, which was rather absolutely to trust his passion,
then expect the Senates goodness; And to that purpose Roxana told Creses in
the Princesses name, that she was resolved wholly not only to rely upon his
fidelity, but to be directed in her journey to her Father by his care; which
gave Creses a wor^ ^f content, not alone that he was thought wo^^^^ of so great
a confidence, but by this means he should free his apprehension from the
danger of Cassianus courtship; so that within a weeks space he provided all
things necessary for their escape: whilst in the mean time Cloria pretended a
sickness that caused her to keep her chamber, whereby no suspicion of her
flight, might remain for some days after her departure, as Creses did of
important business, which called him to a necessary attendance at Sardis:

When the designed night came that they were to begin their journey which was
expected with some impatience, the Princess Roxana, and their entrusted
dwarf, the only attendants they would use for fear of discovery, repaired to
a place at the foot of the Castle hill, where one Sentinel being more curious
then the rest, would have interrupted their passage, but their ready knowledge
of the word, gave him a quick discharge, and so consequently set them free to
take their Horses, that were provided not far off by Creses care, who was
there also attending himself to mount the Princess and the other company: But
scarce had the cheerful morning appeared in the East, after a tedious nights
travel in rough and unbeaten ways, when they arrived at an even plain, that
not only afforded them some consolation to sweeten their past inconvenience,
but gave opportunity to Creses, reflecting upon his own trust, and enflamed by
his secret love to use this language to the Princess.

Madam, said he, as I envy not the Gods happiness in the conversation I have
(...) to enjoy, so the trust that is committed to (...), deserves a diligence
beyond expression, wherein if I had a thousand lives they were all too few to
be employed in such a service; yet give me leave to say without profanation of
your sacred self, that love is the only price that ought to purchase your
person by an honorable pity, which cannot be wanting where there are so many
other admirable perfections; for since none can merit your virtues, your
goodness will appear in the greatest luster, when it shall be seen you
choose, because you intend absolutely to oblige, like the heavens that take most
pleasure in forgiving highest offenses. It may perhaps be esteemed by ignorant
apprehensions, a kind of an equality in worth, when Titles are united; but you
know that dark foyles are used to illustrate bright Diamonds, wherefore let
not honors be the object of your looks; which however, although they cannot
outshine yours, yet cettainly the clearness of your beauty will best appear
when others are removed, like the fair Moon when the Sun is most obscured
that offends by his too much violence; Flowers seem more delighfull in
innocent fields, then in stately Gardens; and crystal streams are
plentifuller replenished with variety of watery inhabitants, when the green
meadows give them bounds, rather then where Marble structures enrich their
aboade; then kissing her hand with a passionate earnestness, he bathed her
white glove with a few of his own Tears, that quickly gave Cloria Items of
his intentions; but she would take no notice of his discourse being unwilling
to disquiet her protection, since she could not condescend to his desire, so
that she was constrained prettily to divert the occasion by calling her
Governesse to the communication, pretending that else her rigid gravity might
chide them both for their dis-respect; when Roxana was arrived at a nearer
distance, the Princess perceiving her to be much troubled, if not altogether
tired with the past nights travel, by her often removing her self upon her
Saddle, not being accustomed to many such exercises, after she had bid her be
of good cheer, began to question with her concerning the practice and
employment of her youth; and whether or no women in those days did use to ride
a hunting according to the fashions now of Lydia? faith no Madam said Roxana,
in those times maids were more modestly bred then to exercise such hoyting
recreations; for if their mothers suffered them to walk a turn or two in the
garden, after they had performed a good days work upon their Samplers, and of
holy days to go eat a mess of Cream in some honest neighbors house, it
was esteemed a large liberty; besides there was a careful provision by their
parents, that no men of any sort should accompany them; although they were such
as pretended to be Suitors, and the conditions of marriage already agreed upon;
but now by my truly there is nothing but private courtship, and public love
with continual divertizements, from one pleasure to another; so that young
girls endeavor nothing more, then to become bold and scandalous: nay I can
assure you Princess said she, a Maid durst not so much as smile before her
Father and Mother, scarce looking upon their woers before they were married; in
which bashful posture on the night of their Nuptials, they entertained their
husbands with tears only.

This discourse or rather passion of the old woman, proceeding as 'twas
supposed from the hard going of her horse, gave Cloria occasion to tell her in
a gentle smile, that the reason why they did not practice such pastimes, was
because they wanted good horses for the sport, and Coaches at she had heard
were not then in use: good horses said Roxana, I cannot tell what you call
good, but for my part I was never worse carried then at the present; at which
the Princess began to laugh outright, since she had so directly hit upon the
disease of her Governesse. However Creses that he might prevent all quarrels
told her, that since she found hers not easy, she should ride on his, which
perhaps would better please her, although he protested he had no design but to
accommodate her before himself; whereupon taking her down from her saddle, in
a quarter of an hours time made the exchange, though the labor seemed
fruitless; for the old woman being no whit amended in the choice, showed the
defect proceeded from her age, and not from her Steed: Nevertheless, most
courageously (though she did sweat for the business) she arrived at the
Forest, where they intended to repose themselves for the noone season, that
required some shade against the Suns violence; Creses chose a flourishing Tree
for the Princess accommodation, which contented her thoughts as well as the
richest Canopy of State in her fathers Court, and the provision that the dwarf
had brought with him abundantly satisfied instead of other curiosities: these
satisfactions exacted from Cloria another necessary duty, that the night past
had absolutely debaured her of, which was showed by the gentle closing of her
fair eyes from the days light; whilst in the mean time Roxana had
convenience, after she had put something under her Ladies head, to retire her
self under another tree to be indulgent also to her own senses.

But Creses whose love and care caused him to be a diligent Sentinel over the
Princesses rest, afforded him also the happiness of this contemplation, in
which feign he would have stolen a kiss, but that he feared the heavens would
have revealed the theft: can the gods (thought he) be altogether stupid to
suffer so divine a creature upon earth, and leave their own habitation barren
of such excellence, since more then a thousand Cupids are ready to offer
sacrifices upon the pure Altar of her fair forehead, perfumed by the incense
of her odoriferous breath? can these two illustrious cherries said he, that
only kiss one another, because they cannot meet with the like perfections, be
less powerful then to invite Jove from Olympus to taste of the dainties; but
beholding a presumptuous fly boldly to entertain it self in the delicious
garden of her face, where mixed Roses and Lillies gave it both nourishment and
delight, notwithstanding the many gentle prohibitions of her white hand, he
began passionately to exclame against the rudeness of the creature; yet when
he saw its black color and curious shape served instead of a foil to become
her beauty, as if put there rather by art then nature, he not only let the
silly beast alone, but commended his industry; however finding her sleeping
importunity, desired something earnestly to berid of that troublesome ornament,
he could do no less then contribute his assistance, and hastily endeavored
to chase the fly from that paradise, where it wanted neither flowers nor
exercise; at which the Princess suddenly wakened with a demand what had
disturbed her in her rest: But poor Creses durst not own the disquiet, and so
she fell asleep again, in which innocent calm she remained until Roxana's
confident authority made her know, it was time to prepare for the afternoons
journey; and this injunction was sufficient to render her obedient against the
inticements of her wearied senses.

Many days they had not traveled in this large Forest, to seek out obscure
ways to prevent surprise, since they supposed they should hastily be pursued
if not encountered by some of the Senates Forces, lying in a manner every
night, either in a poor Cottage, or in the open air, which the courageous
Princess underwent with an admirable fortitude, hoping her reward at last
should be not only to see her dear Father, but to hear some news of her
love Narcissus, for whose sake her thoughts were chiefly tormented; before they
arrived at a small plain encompassed with wood, which the more flourished,
because Phoebus had not so absolute a dominion in that place as elsewhere. At
the farther end of the Plain upon the rising of a little hill, that directed
its view toward the East, they might behold a house; though not of any
appearing capacity, to contain many persons: but long they had not
contemplated the commodity of their supposed nights lodging, ere they spyed an.
old Father with his book in his hand, sitting under a Tree, which gave
occasion to Creses, whilst the Princess and Roxana were content to take some
pleasure in that solitude, to present himself to the aged man, as well to be
informed who he was, as also to receive some benefit by his assistance.

Wherefore after they had civilly saluted one another, and that Creses had told
him he conducted certain distressed Ladies toward Philadelphia, where their
friends remained in the Kings wars, and also that they wanted for the present
accommodation of lodging for the approaching night, the old man seemed not
only willing to pleasure him in any thing, but of the sudden burst forth into
abundance of Tears and complaints, as it should seem at the remembrance of
Euarchus and his fortunes, which made Creses the more passionate to be informed
of his condition, and to that purpose desired him that he would be pleased to
let him know what accident had driven him into that solitary course of life; so
both seating themselves upon a little rising hillock, because the old Father
was not capable of a long discourse without some repose, he uttered this
language:

Sir said he, since you will needs be acquainted with my fortunes, you must
know in my youth I was bred by the careful industry of my parents a scholar,
which profession brought me first in credit with my Prince Euarchus Father, who
was himself not only learned, but exceedingly loved the conversation of those
that were possessed with such qualities, which at the first joined with the
ambition of my own nature, made me a Courtier, and that vocation as I thought,
exacted from me a diligence to preferment, however, honors were but moderately
conferred upon me, during the life of the old King; though after his death his
son Euarchus, whether mistaking my ability or being in love with my fidelity,
showred down so many favors upon me, that I not only in a short time, became
chief Flamin of all Lydia, but in a manner governed the whole State under the
King, which heaped on me sufficient envy; and the rather since I conferred many
offices possessed formerly by the Nobility upon those of my own profession,
whereby the better to strengthen my party, and dignifie my condition: In this
posture I remained until the great Senate that now rules in Lydia chaced me
from Court and Commonweal, which made me seek out this private habitation,
until the fa^^ of Euarchus government shall be so determined that I may again
return to his service, or resolve to end my life in this solitude; and with
that wept, which for some time continued them both in a pensive silence, until
Creses importuned the aged father to put off his sorrow; or at leastwise suffer
him to be a sharer with him in his grief, by letting him know more
particularly the causes: this gave occasion to the old man to tell him that
many Soldiers were newly arrived in the Forest to shelter themselves by the
protection of the woods, from the rage of their persecutors, who followed them
after a Battle that was lately fought between Thyasmus and the Senates Forces,
where both he and almost his whole Army being surprised by an Ambuscado of the
enemy, had lost the day to the absolute destruction of the Kings affairs, and
an utter undoing as 'twas believed of all his friends, since Euarchus expects
every hour in person to be besieged in Philadelphia.

This unexpected news did more then trouble Creses, not only because it did
in a manner destroy his own hopes that seemed to depend upon the success of
the journey he had in hand, which was to present the Princess Cloria an
acceptable offering to her Father, but in denying them all means to avoid a
dangerous consequence, fince they neither could advance toward their first
intention, for doubt of interruption in the passage by scattering Troops of
the Senates garrisons, nor durst retire back again to the Castle for fear of
being cruelly punished for the escape: so that he was ^orced to make the old
father acquainted with the personal presence of the Princess Cloria, and the
rather since he could no way entrust his fidelity, but of the contrary by that
knowledge procure a reception of her in his house until his own return from
Philadelphia, whither he intended secretly to go, that he might the better be
informed of the Kings condition, and by that direction more conveniently secure
the Princess Cloria either by flight into some foreign Country, or deliver
her person into the protection of her own Father as he had promised: yet he
conjured the Flamine, after he had laid open unto him his thoughts,
intentions, and desires, not to discover the least syllable of these
disasterous accidents to the Princess, for fear of disquieting her gentle
bosom with misfortunes, no care of hers could remedy; though he determined to
persuade her to be contented to dispense with his own absence for some time,
to perform pretended necessary service for her safety. When they had
sufficiently digested these resolutions and agreements, they both rose from
their seats to present themselves to Cloria; the Princess at their approach
entertained the Flamine, with the same affection she conceived to be due to
one, that had been formerly honored by her Fathers favors; whilst he with
Tears in his eyes, presently conducted her and the rest of the company to his
small habitation; excusing notwithstanding in a courtly phrase, the poorness
of the welcome she was to expect: but long she had not enjoyed the pleasing
security of that retirement, before she was overtaken with a most horrid and
insolent treason in this sort.

The Soldiers that cowardly were fled from the battle, as the Flamine had
related to Creses, and were retired within the Fortifications of those woods,
for their better security against their pursuers, understanding by some
intelligence that the Princess Cloria was lodged privately within the old
Fathers house, began to consider, that if they returned her back again to the
Senate at Sardis, from whence they understood she was escaped, it would prove
so acceptable, that they should not only thereby purchase all their pardons,
but probably many of the chief actors might receive considerable rewards. This
opinion they no sooner entertained in their wicked and disloyal breasts, but
the execution followed with so much violence, that they not only seized Cloria
and Roxana, but also carried with them the old Flamine, as a full period to
their supreme villainy, notwithstanding all the persuasions could be used
toward them; but the gods hating the traitors, though the Senate made use of
the treason, all they could procure for this acceptable service, was to have
their lives saved, upon condition, they should within ten days depart the
Kingdom; or else, to suffer present death wheresoever the could be found after
the limited time, which ^^used them to curse the very day of their births.

However this just sentence was a deserving reward for their offenses, yet
poor Cloria enjoyed no comfort in her captivity, but rather her crosses were
augmented by the arrival of Cassianus: one day when she was retired into the
innermost part of her lodgings, with an intention to contribute a large
proportion to her sorrows, esteeming it the best conversation she could
possess in these sad times, she was of a sudden saluted by the Prince, who
conceived his power gave him a sufficient warrant for any intrusion; where,
after he had continued his courtship with a few complements, he strived to
protest his affection, with all the reasons that the same religion, neernesse
of kindred, and his vowed service to her father could pretend unto; which
plucked from the Princess this sharp and sudden reply, contrary to her nature.

Cozen, said she, although your own thoughts can best witness the Religion you
hold, yet give me leave to tell you, that my knowledge receives no satisfaction
by your profession, since you violently seem to run along with that current,
that seeks by all means possible to destroy the Lydian rights, in taking away
the Flamins out of the Temples, the only pretended occasion now of these wars
between my father and his Senate, in which customs I have been brought up from
my cradle. Again, for your blood, I must confess it is of so near kindred
with mine, that I wonder you do not bl^^^ to see me suffer an injurious
captivity, without revenge or assistance; much more, to be a principal cause
of my imprisonment, since your preposterous affections adds flames to the
Senates cruelty; when as my love in all justice should rather be persuaded then
compelled. And lastly, concerning the service you profess to my father, as I
would be glad to see some effects thereof by real actions, instead of ayerie,
and perhaps of false professions; so of the other side, I must desire you to
remember, that Prince Cassianus was always entertained, and cherished by King
Euarchus, with all humanity and bounty, when his regal power was not
diminished: Wherefore in my opinion, you have no reason to side with that
faction, that strives to pluck the Diadem from the brows of him and his
posterity; in which number I have, or ought to have a confiderable interest.

Cassianus, after he had received this bitter reply, with a certain pale, if
not guilty look, rested for some time, as it were frozen in a kind of despair,
not being able to utter one syllable in defense of himself, against such
desperate language, as he thought delivered by a heavenly Oracle: yet at last,
lest he might seem altogether conquered by the force of her reasons, when it
was impossible her sweet words could wound, but with the darts of Cupid, he
fearfully returned this answer, which reached her ears, but not her belief.

Madam, said he, for the differences in Religion between your father and his
Senate, I esteem them no way essential; consisting only in matter of
ceremony, which with a little labor may easily be reconciled to both their
advantages. And for that blood of yours, that so much honored my birth, I
could wish to have an occasion to let it out from nourishing my heart, whereby
to do you the least service; though your release cannot fall within the
capacity of my power, since it is the command of the whole Kingdom that
restraines your liberty; nevertheless without any thought of injury intended
to your person: for, if I believed the Senate had any determination to
diminish, much less to deprive your Royal father of those flowers which
belong justly to his glorious Crown, I should be so far from countenancing of
their endeavors, that I would contend with all difficulties to tear the
remembrance of their intentions from the face of the earth; however, I cannot
deny, but I merely subsist by their extraordinary bounty, since I have lost the
possession of mine own Country, that should maintain my condition. At which
words the Princess with a disdainful smile gave him a dissembled thanks,
accompanied by so sweet and becoming a scorn, that Cassianus seemed more
bitter at her silence then by the dispute; though Roxana could not choose but
take her Mistresses part, and consequently made this choloricke answer to that
little he had said in his own defense.

My Lord said she, I cannot but wonder if the points in Religion be of no
greater difference then you speak of, that the Senate should disturb the quiet
State of Lydia with so much blood and slaughter, to compel Euarchus to change
the government, when it is evident he desires but to maintain the profession
of his Father without alteration; nay rather me thinks it would have been
greater marks of their piety, to have given way to the Kings humor in so
small a thing of consequence, then to have bought the alteration at so dear
and dangerous a price. And for the latter part of your discourse, I shall only
put you in mind, that as your Uncles love and bounty never failed you, when he
was in a flourishing prosperity, so you may do nobly to pay his actions past,
and his necessities present, with testimonies of gratitude and duty. Cassianus
although he vowed to the uttermost of his power, he did and would render him
his best endeavors, yet he quickly changed the subject of the discourse,
pretending that love at the present, was more suitable to his disposition then
hate, and therefore began again to court the Princess with fresh complements:
however when he found with a neglectfull silence she only seemed to hear his
words, without a will to understand the matter, as if she were less pleased
with those smiles then with the Senates frowns, he abruptly quitted the room
with a kind of a dark cloud in his looks: within two days after this
encounter the old Flamine, was brought before the great Senate to receive his
trial, not only for having been in his court employments a disturber of the
State as 'twas pretended by his ill council to Euarchus, but at the present
for being an instrument to convey the Princess out of the Senates protection,
and conceal her person in his house, whereby to marry her to some foreign
power that might endanger the prosperity of Lydia. Which accusations were so
spightfully alleged against him, with such prejudicate resolutions for his
ruin, that the old man had not force enough, to sustain the weight of the
prosecution, though he expressed a competent courage in his defense, and so was
condemned publicly to lose his head upon a Scaffold in the view of all the
people, who at leastwise appeared contented if not pleased at the novelty.

But Cloria when she heard of this sudden, and as she conceived horrid
determination, was possessed with a noble compassion, not only considering the
old man to have been a most faithful servant to her Father, but unfortunate by
this intended Tragedy, only for entertaining her at his house, as a testimony
of his loyalty to the royal Family, which wrought in her gentle soul diverse
perturbations: First she considered, that if he suffered, it would be some
stain to her honor, since he appeared rather to be a Martyr for her, then for
himself; which obligation she was unwilling to undergo without some
testimonies of a supreme gratitude; yet then when she reflected upon that
submission she must use to beg his life of the Senate, she thought the
sacrifice of an old Flamine, who e're long could not choose but be an offering
to the earth, would not prejudice his own happiness, much less tax her of
ill nature; And therefore became half persuaded to let him run his last
period with glory, rather then become a supplyant to her Fathers Subjects for
mercy: yet after much contestation with her self, the virtuous Princess fell
upon this apprehension, that she in a manner became the author of ill, by
omitting that good she had power to do, and by that means should deserve the
worlds censure: so that pity, gratitude, and religion, seemed to contend with
courage, honor, and disdain, till at last she flew to this resolution, to
send for Cassianus, and conjure him by the hopes of his desired love, to be so
far an intercessor in the poor Flamins behalf, as to preserve him from
destraction by his power or interest; though again when she entered into
consideration what a jealous scruple the request might raise in Narcissus
thoughts, if ever he should come to know of the action, it almost destroyed the
piousnesse of her intention: nevertheless she called Roxana, and wished her in
her name to fetch Cassianus to speak with her, since her resolutions were not
long to be protracted, if she had a will they should prove effectual; yet as
the old woman was going out of the door to perform her message, she suddenly
commanded her back again, laboring as it were in her inconstant constancy,
until Roxana her self being displeased with her fruitless irresolutions, at
length went without her leave.

When Cassianus came, he found the Princess seated not only in a dark
chamber, but environed with those mourning Curtains about her bed, which she
had caused to be hung up since her last imprisonment, as testimonies of the
discontented State she conceived her self in: when Roxana had informed her of
the Princes presence to attend her pleasure, after she had with a low voice
desired him to sit down in a chair near her, she used this discourse unto
him.

Cousin said she, is it possible you can think, that the bload of the poor
and aged Flamine may be so acceptable an offering to the gods, as to make them
thereby more propitious to your desires? or do you believe, that my love which
you seem to hope for, will be persuaded easily by the cruelty of so horrid a
sacrifice? if you mean to threaten instead of intreaing, perhaps you may
please your own nature, but never I can assure you, compel my liking, since I
find in my soul so much courage yet left, notwithstanding all my misfortunes,
as not to give away my affections to one that has merited so much just hate
from me. Certainly you are mistaken to think Cypres branches are fit
ornaments to become a marriage bed, for the many examples in that kind have
been always prodigious; can you flatter so far your own imagination, as to
apprehend the slaughter of my friends, and slaughtered chiefly for my service,
can create less effects in me, then a revenge when I shall have power to
execute it according to my will, upon those that have occasioned my
displeasure? It should be strange they should expect to be entertained in my
bosom, that have spightfully procured my disgraceful discontent. No Cousin,
assure your self, these are not the ways to captivate a Virgins gentle heart,
or to trust protestations of such a Suitor, that wanted not hate in the highest
professions of his love.

Cassianus after he had heard these words from the Princess, hastily without
any reply at all took his leave; which not only gave occasion of many
conjectures both to Cloria and Roxana, but also of some discourses that
produced hopes and fears, until within three hours of his departure, he
again returned into the Princess Chamber, with a reprieve for the old man's
life, signed by the hands of the Senate; though with this condition, that she
must be pleased to follow the direction of the whole Kingdom in her marriage,
however Cassianus vowed by the heavens, he employed all his power to have
procured it absolute.

Cloria notwithstanding she was not well satisfied with the restriction, yet
she was pleased with the pardon, and presently sent it by Roxana to the
officers that had the custody of the old Flamine, whilst in the mean time she
conceived some dissembled satisfaction was necessary, that he might continue
still his begun courtesies to the aged father; withal to possess him with the
knowledge of the impossibilities that hindered the progress of his love,
whereby he might be less violent in pressing the Senate to the accomplishment
of his desires; and the rather she fell upon this resolution, for that
Narcissus absence secured him from all danger by underhand practices, though
her self could not be confident of his safety, since she had heard nothing
from him; which consideration at the present drew from her fair eyes some
tears before she used these words to Casstanus:

Worthy Cousin said she, (for so I will now call you, since I find your words
real, and your love noble) if the Gods did give me the possibility of being
your wife, I should a great deal rather, declare my self persuaded to the
choice by your own virtues, then by the Senates wisdom, since the interest
of a kingdom is not to be put in the balance with the unity of affection; the
one proceeding only from forced reasons, that last no longer then the motives
have power by the operation of private ends, when the other arising from the
secret influence of the heavens, engraves a perpetual affection in the heart,
not to be removed by humane Tyranny. Wherefore I say, interests of Crowns
cannot contribute any thing to the felicity of Nuptials, however sometimes
they pretend false shows to cover hidden discontents, and so by that means
conzens the world into a belief of what the married couple never enjoy, of the
contrary enduring millions of concealed torments, that are increased in
violence when they burst forth like imprisoned flames, which by accidents
procure their own liberty: Therefore I say, nay I will boldly profess the
undergoing the punishment of a thousand deaths, before I be ever compelled to
marry by the prescription of earthly respects, much less be commanded to take
any for my husband, that has not really persuaded my judgment, or absolutely
wrought upon my fancy; let it suffice your perfections carry with them more
powerfullnesse in my consideration, then the Senates desires do weight in my
understanding, though I should be sorry to choose rashly, or to be guided wholly
by mine own opinions; which is enough to let you see my unconquered, and I
hope pure love cannot be constrained, although my dear life pay the ransom of
my seeming wilfulness: for though Tyranny may shut up my weak body within
strong Walls, until the just gods punish the wickedness, yet my resolved
soul will be free to make election of death, or life, as the occasion shall be
presented; so that as your actions have changed already my belief of your
intentions; do not again change your actions, that I become of an other
mind, wherein you will but lose honor instead of gaining love; and that loss
perhaps may make you incapable of all other fortunes; it is enough, I value
your blood, I esteem your person, and love your virtues; however I cannot be
yours in possession as long as Narcissus lives; and with those words wept
again, as at her former apprehensions of his safety, which continued her in a
silence, until Cassianus reply gave her thoughts new matter to work upon:

Madam said he, as I cannot but be persuaded, though unwillingly by your
powerful and excellent Rhetoric, yet give me leave to tell you, that I
understand not your conclusion, since you have been pleased to say in your
discourse, that as long as Narcissus lives you cannot be mine; a choice I must
confess, that the gods have never to this hour revealed unto me, since at my
leaving of Lydia, a match of a far greater dignity in Titles, seemed to be
the obstacle that destroyed my hopes, and so consequently all motions I could
make of my secret love: but however, if my ears have not much deceived my
knowledge, I have heard it generally reported, that some accident many months
since has deprived Narcissus not only of the share you pretend he has in
your affection, but also of all the claim he can expect in this world. If it
have said Cloria, your pretentions are the nearer; and with that fell a weeping
again so bitterly that Cassianus could not choose but accompany her in her
grief; but after some time that his thoughts had liberty to enter into
consideration both of the Princesses words and of his own concernment, scarce
yet believing her relation, he told her, that he had no reason to claim the
interest of another; yet if Narcissus were dead, he hoped his love and service
should expect the next place in her affection: and with that parted from her,
with an intention to make a more particular enquiry, into the truth of the
intelligence, which afforded the Princess a kind of a calm for the present,
that contented her thoughts.

And this calm having made her discontents something tolerable, she was
persuaded one afternoon by her Governess, to take some little delight or
recreation, in a green Meadow within the limits of her imprisonment, that
usually was not frequented by strangers, where a River in the midst divided the
field by a seeming equal arbitration; which afforded a kind of a sad
entertainment to the Princess, whilst Roxana was persuaded also by her many
solicitous thoughts, to search out solitary walks in the neighboring woods,
for the exercise of her contemplation: To this purpose Cloria sitting down by
the Brook side, supporting in the interim her fair cheeks by her white hand,
whilst her knee underpropped both, as a rich foundation that nature had
created, for the establishment of a most noble building, her fancy was carried
as it were with a steadfast melancholy to behold the running stream, that
represented to her troubled imagination, her own inconstant fate, that had
formerly afforded her some moments of happiness, in the conversation of her
dear Narcissus, whom now she was not sure ever to enjoy again, which by a
quick course seemed to hasten to the Sea to be drowned in that vast confusion,
as her past delight was buried in her Fathers misfortunes and her own. And as
she was sending also her tears along with the course of the River into the man
Ocean, to be confounded in the multitude of those rude waters, of a sudden she
saw a Pilgrim to travers the Meadow, as if his ignorance in those parts had
rendered him altogether unskilful in the ways: But the Princess being yet
fuller of charity then sorrow, dispensed for the present with her grief, to
give him some instruction; and to that purpose calling him to her, began to
question with him about his name and business: The Pilgrim in a kind of amazed
reply told her, that as his name scarce deserved any remembrance amongst those
that enjoyed happy conditions, by reason of his many misfortunes, so for his
business, he should be loath to impart it to any, before it did reach the
ears of the Princess Cloria to whom it was directed, whose abode as he was
informed was not far off that place. Truly answered the Princess if you
mean that happy condition by my self, you are as much mistaken in your
opinion as you were in your way; however perhaps I may prove so fortunate to
your intention, as to help you to the speech of that Lady you mention,
although I must tell you, this passage is not open to all travelers, being
only kept for the Princess private recreation, and such company as are
confined with her in the Castle: At which words the poor Pilgrim fell upon his
knees to ask pardon for his fault, though he protested he was altogether
ignorant that any prohibition, had forwarned passage into those private walks
reserved for the Princess pleasure; however his journey into Lydia was chiefly
intended to her presence. The Princess quickly commanded him to rise, assuring
him, that as the limitation of those fields did not belong wholly to her
jurisdiction, she being her self a prisoner also under authority, so if she
were an absolute commandresse (as he did imagine) she was so well acquainted
with the reverence due to his sacred habit, that his free absolution would
soon have been procured at her hands. At which words the Pilgrim began to
weep, and notwithstanding her earnest entreaty, would by no means rise from
the ground where he kneeled, which made Cloria wonder, though not more at the
business then at his passionate carriage. Wherefore, after some few
circumstances, finding no importunity of hers was able to remove him from his
settled humility, she told him she was the Lady to whom the intention of his
travels was directed. When the Pilgrim had received this information, he
beseeched her a new to pardon his rude error, since as he said, being lately
come out of Syria, he could not be informed of the dignity of her person, not
having any attendants about her to instruct his knowledge; and then wept again
as if his business had been nothing else, but mere expressions of sorrow;
until at last having wiped his eyes with a Handkerchiefe hanging at his
girdle, he entertained the Princess with this language:

Most virtuous Princess said he, be pleased to know, that it was my fortune to
be in the City of Tire, when young Narcissus was brought into the Town
mortally wounded by a ship of the same Town, where by the courtesy of the
Captain he was soon provided of convenient lodgings for his repose, and an
assembly desired of the best Physicians of the place for his cure, although his
name and condition was concealed from all but those that had conveyed him
thither: thus he remained with some hopes but more doubts for many weeks of
his recovery, until at last a dangerous Feavour made every one in the house
despair of his safety: amongst which number it was my chance to be preparing
my self for a voyage to Delphos, according to a serious vow I had made to the
Gods for the expiation of certain offenses. But he understanding of my
intention, and conceiving my best way would be to pass by the Kingdom of
Lydia in the journey, one day when the violence of his sickness gave him some
more ease, then accustomed, and that the chamber by hazard was freed from all
company but my self, by reason of a certain holy day near the Town, he
desired me to approach his bedside, where after I was seated, and that by many
sighs, he had made me acquainted with your unfortunate loves and his own
condition, he conjured me by all the charity that ought to accompany my
thoughts in so sacred a journey, that in my passage I would visit you in Lydia,
where he understood you were newly arrived: and not only declare unto you all
the circumstances of his untimely death, with the assurance of his most
constant love to his last end; but withal obliged me to deliver this Ring
which he said was the dear testimony of the contract that had been between
you; and presently putting his hand in his bosom drew out a paper wherein was
contained that unwelcome token.

When Cloria beheld the pledge of their unfortunate loves now ended in the
worst of periods, she looked upon it as if she expected a miraculous remedy, or
a miserable distraction; till at last conquered by the very depth of her
desperate imagination, she became exceeding pale, and scarce was so for any
time before a more earthly color, by little and little seemed to change that
yet lovely white, which death it self a great while had no power to overcome.
But alas the procession was too wilful, for not long after her dainty,
though weak legs not being able to support the weight of her fair body, since
her pure soul could contribute no assistance, she sunk down to the ground,
like a rich marble statue built upon snowy bases: which caused the poor Pilgrim
with a haste, composed of an amazed sorrow, and a desperate fear, to fly to
her relief, cursing not only his relation, but his very journey that
occasioned it: his violent execrations had not power to breath the least show
of life into her sweet body, as if the gods were resolved to keep possession of
so heavenly a spirit (notwithstanding he continued the rubbing of her Temples
with more then ordinary passion) until he spoke in her ears, that Narcissus
was not dead, but falsely so alleged by his malicious and wicked tongue; and
for a testimony of his last affirmations (which he wished might be confirmed by
his perpetual torment, as a punishment for his offense) he sudden pulled off
that deceitful beard, that had so unluckily disguised his person from her
knowledge. Cloria after she had for some time continued in her sad sleep, that
feign would gently have sent her without noise to a better habitation, she
softly again opened her eyes, that seemed something ecclipsed of their former
brightness, and fixing them upon that object that only had power to keep them
from entertaining an eternal darkness, she used these low words: And is it
possible that Narcissus still lives? or is it my flattering fancy that ever
couzens me into new miseries? then shut them again, as if either yet she was
not absolutely persuaded of his truth, or had a mind to reprove him for his
unkind concealing of himself; But Roxana's arrival, both afforded Cloria
more remedy, and proved a means to beg Narcissus pardon, who was not able by
any Rhetoric to excuse the sin, he had committed against the Laws of love, in
borrowing a disguised shape, to hide that which Cloria had only a desire to
see: however lovers quarrels although they are violent, yet never or very
seldom are lasting; beside the sweet Princess had no room left in her bosom
for revenge, where there was already inspired so much joy; so that in a short
time a perfect truce was not only made between them, though chiefly expressed in
contemplation, wherein their hearts spoke more then their lips: but after they
seemed sufficiently to have surfeited of their joy, Narcissus was persuaded to
make a perfect relation of his own adventures: Wherefore, taking her fair
hand, and gently kissing it twice or thrice, as a sworn testimony of the truth
of his story, he began in this manner, whilst in the mean time the poor
Princess read a lecture in his looks, that appeared amply to instruct her
thoughts.

Most sweet Princess said he, as I know not what accident, or rather I may
call it a fate, separated our ships one from another coming from Egypt, so no
sooner were we out of sight of your vessel, but the winds, as if they intended
again to remember us of a meeting, though they seemed to deny the opportunity,
began most furiously to rage upon the waters; in so much as being tossed from one
billow to another, with a kind of a rude uncertainty, we became at last in a
manner desperate of our own safeties: but then O you gods, how were my thoughts
transported in your behalf, knowing you to be in the same condition of danger
and hazard? how many lives would I have willingly sacrificed of my own, with
what torments soever, but to have rendered you secure in my own thoughts, in
some Haven or Harbor of quietness, free from the inconstant cruelty of the
winds; and raging tempest that appeared rebellious to all our wishes? what
infinite damages did I conceive the whole world would sustain by your loss,
since with you went away all virtue, honor, and beauty from the face of the
earth? sometimes I would call the Mariners from their necessary employments,
to ask their opinions concerning your danger and condition, whilst they
barbarous and ignorant wretches, rather minded their own present affairs, then
gave me any satisfactory reply, as if they understood not the consequence of my
demand, but rather amazedly preferred their own safety, before those thoughts
appertaining to your particular: which caused me equally to bestow both curses
and prayers in your behalf: The Princess finding Narcissus in some sort
transported with these imaginations, whereby probably she should be delayed
from hearing the story of his adventures, with a pretty kind of jeering smile,
wished him to leave off now any more care for her particular, since as she said
he found her safe, and rather follow that relation she expected from him, as a
more necessary duty for the present; This made him quickly fall to his task
with fewer circumstances then formerly in this manner:

A night and a day said he, having kept us upon the Seas in this storm, at
last the sky cleared it self from its cloudy incumberance, which made us
perceive, that we were near the Island of of Rhodes: wherefore finding our
ship was much beaten with the Tempest, and most of our company unable to
undergo a farther journey without some refreshment, I gave my consent to have
the vessel put into the Haven, the rather because I hoped to hear some news
of your safety in that City. The chief commander of that Island for the
present is a great noble man of Lydia, who however he keeps a certain
correspondency with the Senate for his own more convenient security, yet in his
heart he is an entire servant to the King your Father, which not only made me
think my welcome so much the better in his Country; but his wife being my most
near kinswoman, I was persuaded to make my abode for some few days in that
place, whilst in the interim we sent out many small vessels, to enquire after
your condition: but however I could have been very well content, to have
remained there longer, in regard of the virtuous and noble entertainment both
of the Lord and Lady, yet upon the messengers return finding no advertizement
could be given concerning your particular, with a certain kind of melancholy
rage I retired into my chamber, where I continued notwithstanding any
perswation to the contrary, until another ship was fitted for our
transportation, in regard ours was held for the present altogether incapable of
another voyage, without a great deal of mending and reparation: within two or
three days I took my leave of my kinswoman, and her Lord; though the gods knew
in a very blunt manner, (my thoughts being over burdened for complements) and
presently directed my course to the Island of Cyprus, where I hoped you were;
or at leastwise by my coming thither would be arrived; notwithstanding I could
not in my fearful apprehension but doubt the worst, notwithstanding those in
the ship, endeavored by many circumstances, to confirm me in a certain belief
of your safety, which made the journey something less tedious and distasteful:
I conjured the whole company entirely to conceal my name, from any person
whatsoever until you were found: when we landed at Salamine I understood the
Queen your mother and my father were both lately removed from thence to
Paphos, where again strictly enquiring after you, and not hearing any news
whatsoever either of your abode or safety, after I had spent some time in
tearing my hair, and using other fruitless complaints, I resolved in a
disguise to seek you out in the country of Pamphylia; whither very probably I
conceited the winds and the storm might have driven your ship, and by that
means have committed your person to a new imprisonment, since that Territory
is known to belong unto the King of Egypt: To this purpose having changed my
habit (being only accompanied by a few of my attendants I could best trust) we
put Egyptian colors upon the top of our vessel, as if we had only belonged to
the principality of Pamphylia: thus we sailed with all possible speed toward
the confines of the lesser Asia, in regard we understand by certain Merchants
of Syria remaining in Salamine, no news had been heard of you in that
Kingdom, since your departure from the City of Memphis: but the gods perhaps
intending by this diversion, to bring about other purposes according to their
divine and inscrutable decrees, before we approached the shore of Pamphylia by
some hours sail, we were suddenly set upon by two vessels of Tire, and
presently commanded to yield our persons to their power and dispose, without
dispute or contradiction, unless we would hazard our selves in a contention
most dangerous and desperate. This language meeting my discontents and
despair, caused me to make a greater resistance, then was either convenient or
necessary for our welfare, until at last being wounded in many parss of my
body, and not a few of the company slain or hurt, our ship was not only seized
upon, but my self carried to the Castle of the Town, where an Officer
belonging to Philos commanded me to custody, for that Philos was for the
present gone to Damascus; within three days Philos returned from Court, and
not long after coming into my chamber, he quickly knew who I was: so bestowing
upon me some few complements (I desiring him in the interim to conceal my name
and qualisy) he presently gave order, for my respectfull attendance and
necessary cure: also he appointed me to be removed to the best lodgings in his
Castle, with a promise absolutely not to discover my person to any, but his own
sister Artemesia, who, as he said to his knowledge, would contribute her best
assistance to my recovery: in this condition (though extremely afflicted
inwardly by reason of your self) I remained for at least a weeks space; when
again one day Philos came and feated himself by my bed side, telling me after
some few complements, that as his sister had provided such rare simples for the
practice of my Physicians, as could not otherwise be procured, by all the power
and art of the great and rich Kingdom of Syria, so was she resolved shortly in
person to give me a visit, if not daily accompany me in my distempers, when I
should be rendered as he said more proper for the conversation of ladies: then
he made me exactly tell him the story or manner of our unfortunate separation
at sea; seeming extraordinary inquisitive, as well in what posture I left you
at parting, as what my opinion was concerning your safety: Although this
relation with so many particulars, brought to my remembrance by the discourse,
increased my torments, like so many sharp daggers piercing my heart, with a
thousand mortal wounds, yet I could not well deny the civillity, in regard
that I was not only in the Country of Syria, where I knew it would have been
held a kind of a rude barbarism in conversation, not to comply in all
discourses whatsoever, notwithstanding any discontent or passion, but that for
the present, I seemed to be also entertained with the best expressions of love
and kindness, could be imagined in his house: after I had made answer to what
he could possible require at my hands in that nature, I both desired and
conjured him to send speedily, what ships he could spare out of his Harbors,
to enquire after your welfare and aboade: which being promised (some of the
Physicians at the same time coming into the room) he necessarily left me to
their dispose and directions.

As I began to recover my health, I became every day more then other persuaded,
and satisfied concerning the certain hopes of your safety, in regard we cold
not hear of any shipwracks, that had happened upon any of those coasts, or seas
near Syria, Pamphylia, or Cyprus, how diligent soever the messengers had been
in their enquiry: which in a short time so mended my condition, if not repaired
my disability, that oftentimes I was not only able, but prescribed to walk into
the garden, and other places of pleasure for my better recreation: And this was
an occasion, that one afternoon I was sent for by the Lady Artemesia ( Philos
being for the present somewhere out of the way, attending upon his necessary
occasions) at my arrival I found the Lady her self seated at the upper end of
the room with a Sampler in her hand, and a waiting woman attending by her, that
furnished her with those silks she had occasion to use; however at my approach
she rose up, to give me a respectfull salutation, and that drew from me some
complements in regard of the dainty work she had designed, which in truth
appeared excellent to my apprehension, being only the pretty banquet of the
gods, where Juno sweld with over much jealousy because Ganymed was so near her
husband: but that which pleased most my opinion, was to see the angry looks of
Cupid, because his mother courted her deformed Vulcan in such an assembly,
whilst Mars appeared to be out of countenance at the action. After I had not
only viewed but commended the artificial hand, that had so lively described
the delightful story, Artemesia made me this reply; that it was no wonder if
humane creatures were given so much to love, when the very gods themselves were
troubled with those passions. Truly Madam said I, although I cannot but allow
of the passion, when it is ordained to produce only noble effects, yet
certainly the gods could never be subject to those imperfections, when for the
most part their flames were unlawful, as either preventing of other men's
loves, or destroying the chastity of virgins, as the Poets mention: for my
part said she, I am of opinion, although most of their actions described by the
wandering fancies of Poets, were but mere fictions, yet it cannot be but the
stories of Perseus and Hercules, both sons to Jupiter were true, and
consequently do show to our example, the lawfulness of the passion, when such
Heroes were produced: the one of a married wife, the other of a maid, to free
the world from oppression and injury, since they appeared busied in no other
employment; who for their excellent qualities and justice, have been since
esteemed gods. This discourse I must confess coming from a virgin, did
something amaze me, yet we continued our disputation until the time of the
day, and Philos coming into the room, prevented any further contention, in a
subject I as much delighted in as her self. At which expression the sweet
Princess smiled, as if some cause had been given her of jealousy, however she
told him, although his story began to be suspicious, yet she had so much
justice in her resolution, as to attend the end of his discourse, hoping that
his relation at last would clear all difficulties: but by my honesty Madam
said Roxana, you will perchance be deceived in your confidence, when you may be
sure he will never accuse himself what fault soever he has committed
privately; which words proceeded so sharply from the old woman's delivery, that
it might be easily conjectured, that in her youth she had been sometimes
couzened in her love; or at leastwise was of that opinion: nevertheless Cloria
bid Narcissus go on, protesting she would not do that wrong to her own
innocent and noble thoughts, as to suspect him whom she had in her judgment
esteemed worthy of her affections: At which declaration the poor Pilgrim
seemed to be transported with a new joy; and after he had given her humble
thanks for the confidence she had of his virtues, that became increased by
that opinion, he took her white hand again, upon which he imprinted a
multitude of vows able to drive jealousy out of the world, and then proceeded
in this manner.

But this interruption as I said, not only put off the exercising of my wit,
and perhaps Artemesia's intention, but also carried us all to supper, where
many looks of the young Lady to invite my eyes to the like encounter, gave my
thoughts more then enough suspicion, and so consequently my mind a great deal
of trouble all the night following; until the morning brought into my chamber
an old woman, whom I had often seen in those visits her mistress had bestowed
upon me in my ficknesse, and boldly seating her self upon my bed, abruptly
used these words:

Of all the men in the world said she, I wonder at your stupidity, fince your
youth and beauty should be such flames to love, rather to consume your quiet
rest, then coldly thus to entertain the more then offered affections of
another Venus, whose perfections are only subjects of admiration. Is it
possible that so bright a star as Artemesia, has not a powerful influence
in your dull soul? When the earth seems to tremble at the greatness of her
Uncle, which renders all people in a mauner willing to become his slaves,
whilst you appear loath to be his friend. Can you think these frequent visits
that this fair and great Lady made to you in your sickness, and since her
free conversation, proceed from ordinary respects, when the greatest Princes in
Asia are not thought worthy of the favors without coming clothed with the
pretensions of being her husband; And alas, who can be esteemed so happy as
to merit such a Title, however far above you in dignity, though I could wish
she had chosen long ago to have prevented her unhappy fate, by casting her
eyes and heart upon such a subject: if you do not yet understand this old
Philosophy, at leastwise believe the new logic I deliver that am her nurse,
and consequently should know her mind. Let it suffice, if you list you may be
happy beyond Kings; but if your perverse fortune intend you not such a
blessing, certainly no less a curse then destruction will accompany the
disaster; since there is no mean to be expected, between possession in love or
ruin by hate; And after some time left me to be accompanied only by my own
imagination, which soon represented unto me these considerations. First the
dangerous consequence of being in the custody of Artemesia's brother, who had
the commodity as well to destroy as to speak the word; and next the rage of the
whole family if they should conceive themselves dishonored by the refusal.
Yet dear Cloria said he, my not to be conquered loyalty to you, was sufficient
to resist, though not to prevent all difficulties. At which expression, the
Princess only with another pretty smile, bid him go on in his story; but the
first said he, most troubled my thoughts, since Philos love to his sister as I
believed, would easily be persuaded by my death to make a greater distance
between our affections, when he should find my constancy could not be removed
by his milder art, rather then hazard Artemosia's honor; but for the second,
although I supposed the whole family would hold it for a supreme indignity, to
have their kins-woman refused by my neglect, yet the revenge could not well be
executed without the discovery of the Ladies passion: but I re-resolved as my
best defense, neither to take notice of the old woman's discourse, nor of her
Mistresses courtship, until I were yet pressed by some new overture, not to be
waved without a peremptory reply, and then to show my courage in our loves;
fince the Ladies passions, I supposed would not break out to any dangerous
violence, until she became absolutely desperate in her hopes. After I had
dressed my self, and was entertaining my thoughts in a retiring place belonging
to my lodging, I became suddenly invited by a messenger sent by Philos, to
accompany him to a certain place belonging to his Uncle Philostros, not above
four hours voyage in a Coach; where the great favorite had employed
abundance of wealth, with more industry, to render it an habitation both
curious and stately, as being the place not only of his birth, but bearing the
name of his family. The first object that presented it self to our eyes, was a
beautiful Town, though more in the quality then in the quantity of the
houses, built in such a just uniformity, that it became a question to my
imagination, whether the order or the materials should have the greater
pre-eminence in my opinion, since the one in a pleasant prospective pleased the
sight, as the other in a mature consideration satisfied the understanding: for
as Cypres trees being mixed with the several buildings, afforded a most
delightful variety, so the richness of the stone showed it was designed to be
lasting; both which being joined together, the whole could not choose but be
admirable, in so much as I had much ado to get my looks off those rarities,
until greater wonders appeared ready to entertain me, which was the Palace it
self seated in a convenient ascent, built all of Tuscan work, with such exact
skill, that the Architectures of the wonders of the world, might have been
present at the design: It was framed into a perfect square, each angle
supported by a goodly Pavilion, elevating their gilded heads above the rest of
the Fabric, whilst two Galleries of either side joined by a portall of
several colored Marble, enclosed in a large Court that only at the further
end made a brave Tarras, paved artificially with Moysayck work, and bounded by
rail and baller of Corinthian Brass, where upon both sides the stairs upon
double pedestalls of Porphir, were placed the two statues of Saturn and
Jupiter: The outward Court round about the walls seemed to be crowned with
Urrnes, mixed with half statues of the ancient Grecians, whilst the entrance
being open at the top the architrave freeze and cornish were cut off in the
middle, and finished with Cartooses instead of meeting. The gate of either part
was supported by Jonick pillars, two behind and one before, which made a
return in the building, and four gilded Lions upon low pedestals seemed to
guard the passage. After we had traversed these beautiful enclosures, we were
let into the gardens for the more convenience of shade, since the day already
began to be enflamed by the Suns violence, which for the more curiosity were
ordered into several discents, supported by huge Arches of white Marble, and
in many places so covered with excellent Fruit trees, that they seemed a far
off, to be painted over with delightful Landskips of woods, whilst the Birds
and waterworks enclosed in the vaults sent forth a pleasing murmur to the air.
The first garden although it were less then all the rest, because it might
afford a better prospect upon the other, was divided into four squares, each
containing a magnificent fountain, the one having the brazen statue of
Hercules with his club in his hand, environed about with a Crystal lake,
wherein were Fishes so gentle by education, that they waited in the water to be
fed by those that viewed the curiosities. The superfice of the pond was formed
into twelve angles, and raised three foot high by a certain call of cut
stone, that resembled a hedge, whereupon each point was put, one of his labors
artificially cast in mettle. The second water work represented the naked
figures of Diana and her Nymphs in white Marble; however so shadowed by a
dainty grove planted by Art for that purpose, that their whole shapes could not
perfectly be discovered, though there appeared enough for delight and
admiration, whilst poor Actaeon without the trees in a green plat of ground
seemed to be torn in pieces by his own hounds, according to the judgment
given against him by the revengefull goddess, though his friends in every place
out of the bushes, appeared to haste to his rescue. The third fountain was
only of Perimus and Thisbe, with the tragical event of their loves. And the
last figured the fates of Hero and Leander, where her Tower being built in a
certain other lake, which received its current from the first, made a kind of
confused, though little Sea, wherein the compassionate Nymphs by exact
expressions, were apprehended to bewail the lovely Youths death, whilst his
distracted love, cast her self from the battlements of her own lodgings, to
accompany him in his burial. But that which most delighted my senses (because
it afforded a pleasing prospective between diverse rows of even set Trees) was
a certain banqueting house, built after the form of a round Temple, with
large windows of bright glass, divided by gilded pillars, notwithstanding it
had a portall, to give it entrance, of many transparent columns, or at
leastwise they so appeared to my view at a distance; the materials that built
it, were yellow minerals, enterlaced with shells of mother of Pearl, so that
the structure resembled a Tower of gold garnished with jewels; and being
sheltred over head in every place but before, by united cypresses, it
represented to my imagination, a rich Tabernacle in a stately Pavillion; since
the Trees were so tall, that they gave it rather a shady luster, then a dark
coverture. Scarce had I contemplated this pleasant object, but that Philos
invited me to a nearer taste of the beauty, it being to be past over by a
Bridge silvered over, since the house it self was seated in an Island made by
the winding course of a natural River, though many artificial streams from
it, seemed to contribute some assistance to the running Brook.

At our arrival (having spent a quarter of an hours time in descending the
several sorts of stairs, that carried us into the lower Gardens) we might
encounter with our eyes, at the first opening of the door, the Lady Artemesia,
newly come out of the water, scarce having covered her modesty with a Lawne
smock; neither did our surprisall seem to hasten the accommodation of that
light coverture to the best advantage, as if she were so far from being
ashamed to be taken in that posture, that she rather expressed a desire to have
her beauties still seen; her hair was at full length, though curiously curled,
which pretended to design, and not to accident, since two waiting-women in
Nymphs attire, held a great Looking-glass before her, whilst she carefully
dressed her face with certain black patches, cut into the forms of Flies, and
other small creatures, for the better ornament of her looks: her legs were
bare, only she wore upon her feet a pair of rich embroydered pantobles: This,
as near as I can remember, was the state we found her in. And very near
certainly you were, said Cloria, that you could discover so much. At which
words Narcissus began to blush, protesting also with a pretty violence; that he
was so far from liking her in that posture, that he was as much displeased as
ashamed at her immodesty. Well, well, replied the Princess, go on in your
story, without these impertinencies, since none lays any fault to your charge.
Which command was too peremptory from his fair Mistress, to continue him in
any longer disputation; so he proceeded.

But however, said he, although she put on no bashful amazement in her
countenance, yet with a disdainful frown she seemed to entertain our company,
which was a sufficient injunction to cause us speedily to retire; and that gave
occasion to Philos (since we had already traveled enough over those walks) to
command us to be conducted up into the house, where we might be more
conveniently shaded from the heat of the day; and that quickly brought us into
the Galleries, where excellent pictures, not enough to be esteemed, and rich
cabbinets beyond valuation, gave our thoughts and eyes an abundance of
employments, until a delicious dinner called us into another room, where we
found Artemefia, scarce seeming to be the same woman we left her in the Garden;
having not only put off altogether her choler, but also being trimmed up with
so exquisite a neatness, as if she had been prepared for her Nuptial Feast;
which confirms my opinion, that all those postures were designed of purpose,
to make me think she was admirable in every shape, as well when nature played
the careless wanton, as when art became the curious painter. But in
conclusion, a few complements set us all at table, where lovely pages like
Ganymeds filled our Wine rather in Diamonds then Christiall glasses, whilst our
fruit seemed to be fetched from the Hesperides, all so excellent, that could not
be imitated, much less equalled; yet that excellency was elevated, I will not
say augmented by ravishing Music, both of voices and Instruments, that with a
gentle harmony, rather bewitched then burdened the ear; which continued until
direction was given to take away the cloth, that the room might be emptied of
all attendants, to give us the greater liberty for our private conversation, a
custom in that Country for the better recreation, since they used not to
remove presently after dinner: however we all continued for some time in a
perfect silence, they perhaps expecting what I should say of my noble
entertainment, and their uncles greatness; and I, not being over willing to
administer occasion of discourse, till at last Philos himself brake out in
this manner.

Sister, said he, although I must confess we have largely tasted of your
bounty, though more of your neat curiosity, a property I must acknowledge, that
better becomes youthful Ladies; yet it should seem before dinner, you were too
careless of your retiredness, in suffering strangers to be eyewitnesses of
those beauties which you have designed only for him that is to be your
husband, as rich Jewels that are to be locked up in close Cabinets, not to be
exposed to the vulgar view. Brother, answered Artemesid, with a spightfull
haste, although it be true that it was contrary to the intention of my innocent
modesty, in that posture to be surprised by your wandering intention; yet
certainly I am less ashamed of the accident, when I consider you beheld
nothing, that either I may be deprived of, or easily can be equalled by other
Ladies of my years; only all the fear I have is, lest the scandal may prove
offensive to this worthy stranger, that I have so great ambition to content,
that I should beshrew any occasion that might render me suspected in his
opinion, since the interest of my blood and conversation I know must always
keep me safe in yours:

I must confess this complement, or rather strange expression of Artemesia,
put me in some confusion; considering of one side; if I gave her no answer at
all, it might be interpreted an ungrateful rudeness, having received such
exquisite entertainment, pretended only for my disvertisement, after my long
sickness; and of the other part, what reply soever I could make, proceeding
from accustomed rules of civility, would of necessity engage my words to the
acknowledgement of her perfections, which might encourage some other passionate
progress of that love I so much disliked: however, at last I fell upon this
resolution, to involve my answer into such a riddle, that either could not be
well understood, or being so, it might imply a double sense, which I delivered
in this sort: Madam, said I, your beauties resemble the innocence of the first
Ages, that thought virtues were not to be hid from the ignorant world, nor
imperfections to be masked by any art, whereby the rude multitude might always
have a book open, to learn knowledge, and practice goodness, which was the
best way to avoid ill, when naked truth was the only written character for
their instructions. This reply, although it did not for the present well
satisfy, because it seemed not to flame by the stroke of the flint, that had
produced sparkles, as they believed, to set on fire the youthful Tinder of my
heart; yet of the other side, it left not an absolute despair in their
opinions, that at last I might be warmed by their motions: nevertheless, for
that time the coldness of my answer, changed the subject of our discourse to
other talk, that I confess, I approved of; which with many varieties,
continued us until the evening warned us to depart, and brought us to our old
habitation; where, at our arrival, we found a Messenger newly come from
Damascus, attending to certify Philos, that his great uncle Philostros was
taken suddenly with a dangerous sickness, insomuch as many of his Physicians
very much doubted of his recovery; but however he concealed the news from all
the house, yet the next morning very early, it caused him to take his journey,
leaving me in the interim only to be accompanied by his gallant sister; who
having the raines absolutely in her own hands, let her passions run with a
full careere; for finding that all these trials had not wrought at all upon my
affection, or got the least ground of my constancy, since the burning coals
brought by Cupids diligence from his mothers luxurious Altars, had not yet
thawed my icy thoughts. Artemesia fell to work new stratagems, so that one
morning, I being in a private Library belonging to my lodgings, where commonly
I spent some hours in the day, in conferring with those books I most desired
to read, and viewing the Maps of several Countries for my recreation; of a
sudden I might hear the doleful voice of a certain person, divided from my
knowledge by a partitian wall at the end of the room, which quickly made me
curious enough to be informed of the nature of the complaint: wherefore
approaching nearer and leaning my head close to the division, I became
instantly satisfied, that the noise proceeded from no other then from
Artemesia, which did not a little increase my wonder, since I conceived her
much beyond all misfortune: however I was resolved to be fully instructed, and
to that purpose settling my ears to an entire attentiveness, in distinct words
I heard this language.

O unhappy Artemesia, said she, is it possible that thy own beauty is of so
poor a value, that it has not the power to attract the least regard from a
youthful eye, which has been accustomed heretofore, to inflame all the hearts
of Syria? or is thy Uncles dignity fallen in the estimation of all the world,
since a stranger in thy power as a prisoner contemnes both? O you gods of love
and honor said she, permit not our family to be disgraced though you be
determined I shall perish, since I cannot persuade him I must hate my self;
and by consequence become a destroyer of us both; for as I am resolved not to
breath only to suffer, so must not he live chiefly to triumph; with much other
goodly stuff of this nature, which I leave to repeat, because I will not
profane your most chaste ears, with all the particulars of her violent and
ridiculous passion; however I was forced to dwell with my consideration upon
two points in her mad expression; the first was, that she seemed to declare me
a prisoner, which until then I never understood; though I must confess, I
found my liberty oftentimes restrained under the pretense of a loving care of
my health: And the other that appeared more terrible, her seeming resolution,
either to enjoy or to destroy. Which made me when I had heard enough, to retire
to my own chamber; but many days I had not continued there, before I perceived
by the apparent neglect of the whole house, Artemesia not sending for me
according to her custom, that I was held for no other then a prisoner, being
every night locked into my lodging by an officious Groom. All which was done as
I understood to bring down my proud and Icy heart, to comply with her desires;
her nurse in the interim giving me many items of her intention; besides, I
might behold every day out of my chamber window, the rich and glorious
triumphs of my insolent Mistress, when she mounted her Chariot to take the
air for her recreation, or performed some other visits for her pleasure. And
that the splendour might more appear to my thoughts, as intended affronts,
contemning my low condition and captivity, she caused an ordinary way to be
made by my door, where she daily past with mirth in her countenance and scorn
in her language; to show she had not only forgot her old love, but the very
remembrance I was in the house; whilst in the mean time the foresaid nurse
would now and then give me a visit, as it were covertly out of pity, to
comfort up my thoughts against her Ladies rigor; however I very well knew her
intention was but the better to discover my resolutions; nevertheless, with
all which humors I was content to play, to avoid any further encumbrance of
her Mistress offered affection, not doubting but at her brothers return I
should be able to procure my releasemtnt, the only happiness I aimed at,
though my endeavors were not of force to prevent this following mischief; for
Artemesia finding that no artifice could make me entertain her love, or adore
her person, since the heavens knew I had a brighter deity to worship, which
kept me from all superstitious Idolatry, began to be enamoured with her own
revenge, and so resolved to make me become a Martyr before my time: wherefore
one day coming into my chamber, when I least looked for her company, her own
pride as I thought, having forbid her entrance, bearing in her hand a short
dagger, as in her countenance a rough tempest, saluted me with this desperate
language: Villain, said she, do thou think to carry the Trophies of my
dishonor into thy own Country, to adorn the chariot of thy Mistresses
triumphs, with those spoils thy disdain has purchased in this Castle, to
the disgrace of our whole family? and with that struck at my naked breast,
being newly unbuttoned by reason of the heat of the weather, with such a woman's
violence, that I must confess, my quick prevention had fortune enough to avoid
the danger of the stroke, though not so much power as to hinder her rage; for
finding I had not only defended my self against her intended and malicious
fury, but endeavored to become an absolute conqueror over her mad passion, by
striving to dispossess her also of her weapon, with a spleen more infernal
then humane, because she could not hurt me, she resolved to wound her self,
whereby I might be esteemed the greater criminal, to take off that blemish
which hung upon her reputation by her too violent love; but the stroke proved
more deadly then perhaps she imagined, for it not only pierced her arm, where
she only intended it, but by reason of the sharpness of the point, entered a
great depth into her naked side, which with the effusion of a great deal of
blood (that at last called up most part of the house to her assistance) left
her dead in the view of all the spectators. This sad disaster, as you may
imagine, sufficiently enraged the whole company, and conceiving me either the
actor, or the instrument of the Tragedy, with all violence haled me to a closer
prison in the Castle, whilst according to the custom of those parts, my
process was to be made the next morning by the Justice of the Town, before
the body could either be buried or imbalmed. This accident gave my confused
thoughts sufficient employment; however I made a great question whether I
should confess my name, or conceal my condition, finding by my citation, I
was only called the ungrateful stranger, which gave me some opinion that my
quality was not generally known in the City; believing as the one would not at
all help to lessen the crime pretended against me, but rather give the more
suspicion of a hidden design, in that I durst attempt a murder of that horrid
nature, which an ordinary person would never have performed, so the other might
in some sort help to hide the shame to our Family, in being called to a
public defense in a case of such a wickedness: wherefore I determined not to
reveal my self, until some apparent necessity procured it.

At my arraignment, there was alleged against me besides the breach of the
rules of hospitality, how that it was impossible any other could commit the
murder, since Artemesia was found alone with me in my chamber; and it was not
to be supposed she had killed her self. On the contrary, I pretended that
being a mere stranger in those parts, it could not be imagined I should harbor
so much malice in my breast, as to become the murderer of one that had treated
me in my sickness with abundance of humanity; besides I said, the weapon which
had given Artemesia her deadly wound, was found by all the company in her own
hand: but the business being thus to and fro violently disputed, Artemesia's
nurse was sent for to give further testimony of my carriage toward her
Mistress during my aboade in the Castle, which could not choose but give in the
opinion of all there present, a great deal of light in the disputation;
however, the malicious old woman imagining her declarations might afforde me
some assistance, refused to come, pretending she was necessarily employed in
the Funeral of her dead Mistress, being locked up with the body in her
private chamber; though the truth was, she thirsted after my life to save the
honor of Artemesia, and the whole family, since by that means I should not
have the opportunity to divulge her preposterous love; so that at last I was
not only found guilty, but condemned privately to lose my head within the
Castle court; fearing belike in my last speech I would publish some passages,
that might render the people satisfied of my innocence, and Artemesia's
lasciviousness, Thus finding all my honest Rhetoric, could not prevail in my
just defense to secure me from condemnation, I resolved to declare my person,
hoping that although it might not prove of sufficient force to divert my
judgment, yet nevertheless it would be a motive to protract my execution
until Philos returned from Damascus; which declaration happily me with my
expectation: For after the Judges with much amazement had entertained the
knowledge of my condition, being the son of him who was esteemed so intimate a
friend to the Kingdom of Syria, they not only presently signed my reprieve,
but conveyed me with all the respect their laws would give them leave, back
again to the prison, where I remained until Philos return, who brought with
him the news of Philostros death and burial, though four days time was
spent after his arrival before he offered me a visit, in which space I had
liberty enough for consideration what would be my fate: At last he came and
saluted me with this discourse to my no small adn iration.

My Lord said he, I must not only desire you to forget all your ill usage in
this Castle, but to interpret the reasons, to have proceeded from a woman's
unruly passion (for I cannot give it a better Title) without my privity, which
my future actions, and my present discourse shall testify, if either you will
believe my words, or pardon my intentions. Be pleased then in short to know,
for my resolution is to make unto you a particular confession, and after commit
my self unto you goodness and mercy, that when you and the fair Princess
Cloria were at Memphis with Orsames, it was my fortune to be conquered by the
power of love, proceeding not only from the excellency of her beauty and
conversation, but as I may say was thrust upon me by such a forcible and
precipitate fate, that could not to be contradicted by the power of any reason
or temper; in so much as I must tell you, in regard of those passions, I could
neither eat, sleep, nor rest with convenient satisfaction; so that I conceived
my self obliged for my preservation, to contrive a project with the Lydian
Ambassador then remaining at Memphis, which was to interrupt your passage at
Sea going into Cyprus, whereby the better to make a separation between your
love, and that which the Princess bore you, that both mine, and my sister
Artemesias might succeed in the places: And however the gods prevented rather
the manner of the execution, then the effect of our designs, by contrary
storms and accidents at Sea, yet I must now inform you, that as your self by
fortune were taken by our ships, which has since produced this late dismal
mishap concerning my sister, so the Princess Cloria, by chance falling upon
the Coasts of the Island of Creet, is now delivered into the possession of the
Senate of Lydia; and they as I am informed, from those Ambassadors of our
Country that are at Sardis, intend with some violence to bestow her in marriage
upon her Consin Cassianus Prince of Iberia, whereby the better to fortify
their pretentions and Titles against King Euarchus her father; however they
seemed for a long time to play with my hopes, as if they only intended her for
my satisfaction, belike imagining that such an expectation would always be
sufficient to continue our family faithful to their purposes, and so
consequently make my Uncle Philostros ever willing to employ his power with
Orsames for their advantages; but he being now dead (which news they have
already received in Lydia) they publicly disclaim from having any such
intention, as believing now we can no more contribute profitably to their
designs: wherefore as my thoughts and resolutions intend a present retirement
in some place of religion, to seek pardon of the gods for my many violent and
unjust ambitions, so did I very well know, their mercies in no kind were to be
obtained, without such a particular declaration of my own faults, which I have
now made unto you: as I can no way doubt of your charity and compassion in my
behalf, according to the nobleness of your nature; so may you be pleased to
take what free liberty you please for your departure, with a promise also on my
part to be ready to assist you with my best services, either in your loves to
the fairest Princess, or upon what other occasion soever that may make you
better honored and esteemed in the world. After he had delivered thus much, I
must confess I was so well satisfied with this discourse; not only in regard
of your safety, but also in respect of my own releasement, that Philos imagined
as I then thought by my present actions and expression, that I meant to run
away from him, for suddenly taking me by the hand, he said he had a few more
words to deliver unto me, that concerned his sisters proceedings, since he held
it most necessary his own innocence might be cleared; for that in no particular
he protested, was he guilty of my last usage.

As I cannot deny said he, but that I kindled the first sparkles by my
commendation of your person and worth, that afterward flamed so violently in my
sisters bosom; so of the other side, I never expected it should have broken
out to such an ominous passion, whereby you were to be injured without measure,
as my sister destroyed beyond example: But as the Gods have their secret
workings in all humane things, we must with patience and reverence submit all
our endeavors to their pleasure, which will for the most part keep us from
extravagant and wicked actions; since however sometimes we might fail by
misprision, yet by a small repentance we should again be brought into our
accustomed temper, when as letting loose the reins of our desires without
moderation, we are borne into a vast Sea of confusion, that produces nothing
but prodigious destructions, as it fared with Artemesia, who was resolved
because she could not obtain suddenly what her own thoughts perhaps esteemed
lawful, to convert that passion to so strange a hate, that of necessity would
not only render the object of her wishes nothing, but her self miserable
without hope of ever being able to enjoy what she so much longed for; however
her old nurses counsels, although they did not contribute to her passions, yet
they produced those projects that caused your ill usage; for finding you were
not by any fair means to be won to my sisters desires, she advised her to
assay the contrary, to try if that course could terrify you to consent: All
which Artemesia confessed before her death, her body again reviving after it
was brought into her private Chamber, as also with many Tears and fighes
entreated your pardon, which I thought good to acquaint you with, that her
unfeigned repentance might procure your charitable forgiveness: And with that
taking me by the hand again with terres in his eyes, he desired me as a
testimony of a perfect reconciliation, I would vouchsafe the pains to visit
the dead Corpse before the Funerals, which shortly were to be performed.

Although I went with him as fully contented in my mind, as he seemed
oppressed with sorrow for his sisters death; yet I could not choose but have a
noble compassion at the remembrance of the Ladies hard fate, especially for
that the cause was only for over much loving me, but at my arrival instead of
embracing the dead body, to my wonderful amazement, I was saluted with these
words from living Artemesia.

My Lord said she, that you may not think you converse with dead, (though
changed) Artemesia, you must first know, that after I had performed in your
Lodgings that unparalleld action of my mad rage, bathed all over with mine own
blood, I was carried into my chamber, whilst you unknown to me was in danger
to have suffered unjustly for my fault: And being there by the careful
industry of mine own Physician, without the privity of any, but such as were
entrusted about my person, I was not only recovered from my trance, but before
my brothers arrival put out of danger of death; however, I desired the
business might be kept secret from the knowledge of all but my intimate
servants, since I was resolved to quit the world by a more religious way, not
being willing to support the shame of so detestable a fact: yet considering
that an absolute repentance could not be, where there wants an intention of
full satisfaction, I was desirous with my own mouth, to make this declaration
before I enter into the strict rules of my penance, by which I humbly and
sorrowfully beg your pardon, wishing a perpetual prosperity to the chaste
loves between you and the Princess Cloria. And this, my Lord, being all I have
to say to you, I desire you will have no more remembrance of me, then merely
what charity instructs your pious thoughts. And with these words she drew close
the Curtains of her bed, not willing to be seen, or any more spoken withal.

These things, I must confess, rather appeared to my imagination visions then
actions, until with as much honor as could be devised, I was set free by
Philos, who also courteously offered to accompany me with his best service in
my journey; but because I was resolved to visit the place of your abode in a
disguize, not only for that I knew you were in the custody of your enemies;
but also in that I had a desire to understand by the way, the secrets of the
Senates intention concerning Cassianus love, which I must confess gave my
thoughts some trouble, I refused his offer.

As this discourse seemed to give a singular content to the lovely Princess,
demonstrated by many visible signs, both in her eyes and blushes; so Roxana,
who had all the while, with a most exact attentiveness, given ear to his
several relations, uttered this language, with a kind of a formal gravity:
Truly my Lord, said she, you have not only gallantly now cleared all our
doubts and fears, but also in my opinion have carried your self in your
difficult adventures, more like a valiant Martyr, then a constant lover, which
I must confess deserves both praise and requital: and yet Governesse, said
the Princess, we must not commend him overmuch, lest he expect a greater
reward then we shall be willing to afford him. Dear Cloria, replied Narcissus,
I cannot but confess my own covetousness, since no less a present can
content my thoughts, then your admirable self, which is a Jewel beyond the
price of the whole world: But said Cloria, the chief property of Jewels, are
to be looked upon at a distance; wherefore, if you will be satisfied only with
that liberty and moderation, perhaps I shall without much difficulty grant your
request. Yet Madam, replied Roxana, it is most necessary he make choice of some
other apparel, better to become his person; so may you have both the
convenience now and then to meet in these walks without suspicion, until the
confusion now in the Kingdom afford you a greater liberty. But Narcissus most
earnestly entreated to be entertained at a nearer distance; however without
fruit, in regard both Cloria and Roxana apprehended, that his passion to see
Cassianus sometimes received as a suitor, though but with appearing
complements, would provoke him to some actions, which might either prejudice
their liberties, or discover his person; for that neither of them could yet be
over-confident, of Cassianus intentions and fidelity concerning the old Flamin,
although he had not since their late discourse, either showed any manner of
discontent, or so much as troubled them with visits. Narcissus, when he saw he
could not by any means prevail in his desire, as if he had been at the instant
possessed with some Poetical fury, began this complaint in verse; which the
Princess, being excellent also in that faculty, as quickly answered extempore.

Narcissus. Most dearest Love, recall thy hard decree,
that seems both rigorous to thee and me;
The coldest rocks, though covered all with Snow,
upon the Suns approach begin to thaw.

Cloria. But virtue must not so admit a flame,
to be it self end angered by the same;
As appetites do kindle false desires,
discretion must oppose to allay the fires.

Narcissus. O do not so profane a holy name,
by scruples that do only virtue stain;
Long since I have your word, yours is a debt,
wherefore unjust the payment to neglect.

Cloria. Yet it is extortion, not a lawful due,
to take by force, and never rightly sue:
When contracts name no time (you know) we may
defer the payment to a longer day.

Narcissus. But its unjust for to defraud a law,
only by sleights, that feign would overawe
Prformauce: No Cloria, you ought to know,
The race being won, the prize you must bestow.

Cloria. I partly grant your argument; howere
you must not be the judge, my parents bear
The greatest share in government, since I
am theirs, and borrow but my liberty.

Narcissus. Surely that Tye's dissolved and free, when they
have neither power to give, or we to pray;
If the exigence be such to them and we,
no reason that our right should hindered be.

Cloria. You still mistake; I do no right refuse,
but for prevention only physic take,
To temper heady sense, which well I see,
looks chiefly at it self, and minds not me.

Narcissus. O heavens above, when did you ever read,
of such a temper, which you seem to plead?
Have not the gods approved the influence,
that your philosophy would make but sense.

Cloria. Such false Deities as you example were,
but only Poets gods, whose lust and fear,
Rendered their Nuptials rapes, vice their design,
and did but cozen fools with names divine.

Narcissus. Where shall we seek to find Religion then,
if not in love of either gods or men?
This paradoxe observed, will surely turn
the world into a Chaos, and men to burn.

Cloria. Rather such loves were naught but sensual dreams,
that made their thoughts a Chaos of extremes;
Still craving more, without the harmony
of souls, that only us can satisfy.

Narcissus. Alas, dear soul! although your rhetoric,
would fain persuade my trembling heart that is sick,
To what you please; yet 'twere hypocrisy,
for me to seem to like your tyranny.

Cloria. Nere did a tyrant practice temperance,
my innocence seeks only to advance,
The laws of love and honor, those being left,
marriage is a thraldom or a theft.

Narcissus. How should I plead for love, much less contend,
when you in love will not become my friend?
But leave me with tortures the fruit to catch,
that you with crafty slights from me do snatch.

Cloria. It Is passion not craft, that injures love,
and from your self not me, your torments move,
Which ought be checked, least our expected joys
in future times prove but confused joys.

Narcissus. At leastwise I must call that temper cruel,
that starves my flames for want of fitting fuel,
Since I can neither quench those fires that burn
or warm my self which way so ere I turn.

Cloria. There is no means so good to still a flame,
as for to cast on milk upon the same:
Calm then your thoughts, and be content to bear
the just decree, which passion will not hear.

Narcissus, Certainly fair Creature you feel no pain,
that wooes me thus my passions to refrain;
For those that tortures taste upon the rack,
cannot be blamed if they some courage lack.

Cloria. Yet such as fail in their own constancy,
imply a guilt, and do as faulty dye;
When others that their trials overcome,
do save their lives, and gain a laurel Crown.

After the Princess had thus persuaded Narcissus to be contented, finding the
time of the day gave them no more opportunity, she rose up to return to the
Castle; however assuring him as often as she could without danger to her self
she would frequent those walks for his satisfaction; This being the decree all
the favors poor Narcissus could obtain further of the wilful Princess was,
only one parting kiss, in recompense of all his travells; which being
obtained, she and her Governesse went home joyfully discoursing of their good
fortune, which continued Cloria's thoughts in such a paradise all the night
following, that scarce did her fair eyes entertain any rest at all; Thus as I
say, she took pains to please her imagination, whilst her body wanted that
sleep it necessarily required; which was an occasion that after dinner the next
day she cast her self upon her bed, something to supply the defect of the
night past; but presently upon her waking her Dwarf told her, that a young
handsome Priest at the gate, humbly desired to be admitted to the speech of her
highness, having as he said, business of great consequence to impart unto her.

This sudden intelligence gave Clorias thoughts some trouble, doubting a
disasterous adventure, the rather for that her newly being wakened from the
Ideas of her chief delight, it seemed to interrupt her apprehension with a
contrary fear, of being dispossessed of what she had enjoyed by her flattering
fancy; however she called Roxana to accompany her in the expectation,
commanding the little messenger not only to usher in that stranger, that seemed
so importunate, but afterward himself to wait in the outward room, because
she would have none privy to the business, before she and her Governesse were
informed of the contents.

But no sooner did Cloria view this new intruder, but but she knew him to be
him whom she most desired to see, her young servant Narcissus, who had borrowed
the habit of one of Apollos Priests, in a Temple where he lodged the night
past amongst the woods, to keep him from every ones knowledge but her own, and
her entrusted Governesse Roxana: nevertheless the rigid old woman began to
rail down right at his presumption, vowing with his too much passion he would
destroy the^ all; this gave Cloria occasion to laugh heartily, seeing her poor
servant with innocent looks, to undergo the choleric reproof of Roxana,
without replying one single word to her hasty language, yet his patience not
only by little and little procured him his peace; but after a long conference
with his compassionate Mistress, by the free consent of her Governesse, who at
last became persuaded, he was entertained for a household servant; however the
sweet Princess seemed unwilling to prophance his sacred robes with any
hypocrisy.

But one day Cassianus coming to visit the Princess, the gods know with what
an envious jealousy Narcissus underwent this ceremonies; sometimes he had a
will to have interrupted his passage at the entrance into her chamber; other
while again he thought to have alleged she was asleep, and could not be
disquieted in her rest; and last of all he began to have a resolution to quit
his borrowed habit, and challenge him for his boldness, in pretending in his
presence to his right: And a thousand other fancies entertained his
imagination, almost in an instant, when there was no more time left him for
these considerations; but whilst Cloria was advertized of Cassianus arrival,
and he admitted into her chamber; whither Narcissus followed him with greedy
steps to be a curious eye witness of his behavior: And when he saw Cloria
with a gentle modesty admit of her Cousins salutation, she being not willing to
give him any discontent, by reason of the old Flamine that was at his mercy,
his color began to change in his face; one while the beautiful red seemed to
claim an interest in revenge, notwithstanding all the prohibitions of his
sweet Mistress: then again the fair white had the prerogative, and pretended
fear to Clorias commands; so that in this manner they never left combating in
his lovely countenance, until he was rid of the occasion of those disorders.

Not many days after Cassianus had performed his unwelcome visit, the Senate
belike jealous of the Princess safety, in regard the King her father had been
strangely rescued from their power by that Army that not long before they
esteemed their Subjects, suddenly commanded not only those servants to be
removed from their accustomed attendance that had been about her person, but
her self and Roxana to be conducted to a stronger Fort, there to remain with
better security, and more honor as they pretended, until the present
distractions of Lydia could in some sort be pacified; in which number poor
Narcissus became also prescribed, which converted his past content into an
unexpressible rage; some time blaming the heavens for not punishing the cruelty
as he interpreted it, of the unjust and barbarons decree, then again he
absolutely fell out with himself, that he had not ability beyond humane force,
to prevent the execution of such a pernicious command. But alas, his vain
passions were so far from defending the Princess Cloria against that
violence offered to her person, that he had not so much liberty as by one dear
kiss to take leave of her white hand, amongst the rest of her train, who were
admitted to that sorrowful honor: for the rigid guard finding by his
distracted looks, and extravagant words, that he had not patience enough in
his breast, to comply punctually with their strict commission, quickly
discharged him from his ordinary attendance, before they disposed of the rest
of the servants. This accident soon retired Narcissus into the neighboring
woods, there to complain only to Rocks and stones of the greatness of the
Princess injury, and his own misfortunes, in which place he remained in his
wild passion, until want of food and lodging, constrained him to turn his
thoughts to consider his present necessity, and to that purpose resolved to
seek some habitation, where he might receive entertainment, until he could
further dispose of his determination; since he found these fruitless sorrows
and distracted expressions, neither eased his grief or profited his love.
Wherefore after he had traveled three or four days in the vast Forest, with
such provision only as he could get in poor and contemptible Cottages, as he
past through a thick wood, which seemed to obscure a certain Plain that lay
beyond it, his melancholy ears of a sudden were saluted with a certain kind
of rude music, that appeared also more confused, for that it was at many
periods accompanied with the loud acclamations of common people. As this seemed
a strange adventure to his imagination, after such an absolute silence for so
many days in his solitary perambulation, where doleful echoes appeared to
have been in a manner his only companions; with the uncouth fall of waters
from high and unaccessible precipices; so the unexpected newness again of
probability of humane conversation, put on a little his desire to be curious,
though scarce was he willing to allow himself any content at all, since she
that was the delight of his soul, had been forcibly separated from his sight;
nevertheless prosecuting his intention, he directed his steps toward the
place where he heard the noise, through the entangled Briars, and almost
impassable bushes, which sufficiently moderated his haste, and protracted his
march, yet at last with much pain, he arrived near the outside of the wood,
where he might perceive through the branches of the trees, in a spacious
Plain, a great many of Country people gathered about a little Altar, raised
six steps above the ground; at which stood an old Priest offering sacrifice to
the god Pun, as appeared by his statue placed upon certain bases composed of
rough stone, and with more unpolished workmanship. This discovery invited
Narcissus to attend the issue with silence, and the rather for that at every
full point, and stop of the Priest in his devotions, the multitude suddenly
took hands in a joyful agreement one with another, and danced many rounds,
about the Image in a rural manner, to the only Music of their untunable
voices, though a certain ditty, which he could not understand by any words
they uttered, appeared to express the intention of their mirth, though only
known to themselves in respect of the rudeness of the language, and the
harshnesse of the delivery.

When Narcissus had a long time enterteined his wonder with the sight of this
extraordinary pastime, desiring also to satisfy his understanding of the
reason of their assembly, he approached nearer the company, with an intention
to enquire of some standing by, not only what the occasion might be of that
solemnity, but how he should the readiest way find out the next convenient
Town to give him reception; And the opportunity fitted well with his desire;
for the Priest having performed all the rights and ceremonies belonging to his
office, was newly retired some distance from the multitude, to a small rising
bank; as well to repose himself, as to behold with greater convenience the
continued sport, wherein he seemed to have more then an ordinary interest,
which made Narcissus quickly address himself to him with this courteous
language.

Father said he, I hope it is the custom in these parts, especially amongst
those of your profession, not to take ill any curiosity of a stranger, that
seeks civilly to be informed as well in the manners of the Country where he
passes, as of a convenient place that may give him entertainment: And that I
may prevent your demand which I make no doubt will seem necessary to your
judgment, be pleased to know that I am by birth of the Island of Cyprus, and
intending a pilgrimage to the Temple of Delphos, am by chance fallen into your
company.

The Priest seeing himself saluted by a young man, though in his own habit of
such an excellent beauty, and so perfect a shape, presently not only rose up
from his seat, to give him the more respectfull welcome, but told him for his
lodging the night to come, since the time of the day perhaps might prevent him
of a better convenience, he should hold it an extraordinary honor, that his
own poor habitation might perform the service: and the rather as he said for
that their professions seemed to agree by the outward resemblance of the Robes.
Narcissus was not much displeased with the offer, as well because he found
himself something weary by reason of those extravagant and uncertain
journeyes he had made, as also that he might hope by this opportunity to get
further information concerning his own resolutions, that yet he had not fully
determined. Wherefore after he had returned the Father a civil thanks for his
favor, with an intimation he was willing to accept of his charitable
kindness, they both sat down together upon the bankside, to behold the
finishing of those rural delights, that passionately seemed to employ the
Country people, which gave occasion to Narcissus to demand the reason of that
extraordinary mirth, that possessed the thoughts of the whole company. The
Priest after he had a little smiled to think of the strangers apprehension,
told him, since he perceived his curiosity went so far as to be satisfied in
those petty affairs, he would take the pains to let him know the original
that produced the effects, which as he said was the more proper for his
entertainment; since the occasion at the present detained almost all Asia both
in expectation and wonder; however he feared his story might be too tedious for
his patience. But Narcissus seeming rather passionate at the satissaction then
distasted at the offer; the Priest retired something further into the woods, to
be more out of the noise of the people, where after he had settled the strangers
expectation to a silent attentiveness, he began this discourse.

Sir said he, you must be pleased to know that our King Euarchus grandmother
called Minerva, (by whose right he came to wear all those Crowns he was once
possessor of, and might still have enjoyed in a prosperous measure, if his
fortunes had been equal to his goodness, or his Subjects loyalty answerable
to his own eminent worth) was a Princess of such excellent virtues, that it
had been a controversy between art and nature, whether had more bountifully
contributed to the adorning of her royal person; however, she only reigned in
Mysia, a Country not only barren in production of the fruits of the earth, but
luxurious in the unfaithfulness of the people, though her birth justly claimed
the inheritance of this rich Kingdom of Lydia after our Queen then reigning
here; I say this admirable Princess had a base brother also, named Leonatus,
who wanted not ambition enough to desire the Crown of Mysia, though he were
not furnished with sufficient virtues to merit such a dignity; and to this
purpose left nothing unattempted that might either advance his own esteem or
deprave his sisters actions; and to that end insinnated himself by all means
possible, not only into the good opinion of the Lords, but much more into the
favor of the common people; in which interim the young Princess being
furnished with youth and beauty, was persuaded by the chief nobility to think
of a noble husband that might accompany her in her conversation, and give the
Kingdom a hope of posterity, two essential parts as they pretended of her own
happiness; in prosecution of this desire, there was presented unto her view a
handsome Lord of this our Country of Lydia: in conclusion the nuptials were
quickly solemnized to the appearing content of both parties; and the rather for
that the then Queen of Lydia was well satisfied with the choice, not doubting
to maintain by this means a continual and strong interest in the Kingdom of
Mysia, since she had married to the Princess one of her own Subjects.

But now Leonatus began to play his part; for finding this conjunction proved a
bar to his pretention for succession, he thought it his best way to establish
himself notwithstanding, a certain power in the government, and to that
purpose strived by all means his malicious will could instruct, to gain the
good opinion of the young King, whereby to set him at difference with the
Queen, who began to be a little distasted, to see his wife take upon her so
absolute authority, he only bearing the name of a Prince; which at last grew to
such a height, by the underhand provocation of wicked Leonatus, that one day
when the Queen (being great with child) was retired into her private chamber,
to confer with a certain Secretary of State, most employed in the Kingdoms
affairs, her husband of a sudden rusht into her presence with his sword
drawn, and there before her amazed eyes slaughtered her poor servant. However
this was an act of some horror to the great bellied Queen, and so consequently
might be thought sufficient motives of her lasting indignation, to see her
self and authority so affronted by one she had lately raised from being a
Subject to be her husband; yet religion and good nature proved so powerful in
her noble disposition, that upon the Kings sorrow and submission, she was
content both to forgive the injury, and forget the dishonor by a perfect
reconciliation. But Leonatus not weary yet of his own wickedness, though
despairing of his further ability to retain his interest with the young King,
since the Queen as he thought had so absolutely circumvented him in that
project, of a sudden stroke into friendship with certain factious Priests,
that had newly brought in a religion into Mysia, that taught this dangerous
Doctrine; That Princes deserved no longer to govern, then whilst they
contented the People. Which opinion you may very well imagine, took feelingly
with the multitude, in so much as in a short time the Queen had employment
enough, to defend her person from reproaches, as her Kingdom from civil
war; This exceedingly tormented her thoughts, until the birth of her young
son again revived her spirits: however Leonatus still prosecuting his horrid
designs to supplant the Queen in her just right, whereby to bring the
government of the Kingdom under his own jurisdiction, one night secretly
caused not only the young King to be cruelly murdered in his bed, in execution
of his revenge, because he had quitted his party, but also laid the bloody
slaughter, by way of private aspersions, upon the innocent and religious Queen,
the more to bring her in hatred with the common people, who seemed already
sufficiently poisoned, by the late pernicious doctrine brought into the
Country by the turbulent Priests: Although these crafty practices had not as
yet power to shake, or rather absolutely to destroy her grounded authority,
which had been cast upon her by so rightful a succession, yet by little and
little they so wounded her reputation, that they made her desire to have a
faithful companion, to assist her in her government; which politic Leonatus
perceiving, judging it a love passion in the Queen, put on some of the nobility
underhand to persuade her, not only presently to marry, but to take for her
husband a valiant Gentleman his intimate friend, who a long time had pretended
unto her love, however he was not without some suspicion, that he had been an
actor in the Kings death; with these baits I say Leonatus so far entangled
the Queens innocence, that she was won by persuasion to make this election,
being councelled thereunto by the chief nobility, set upon her to that
purpose, though she first caused a decree to be past by the unanimous consent
of all, that this Lord had been no way guilty, of the false aspersion his
enemies had cast upon him, concerning the Kings murder. No sooner were these
nuptials solemnized, which was the thing Leonatus desired, but secretly he
admonished the new King to fly, assuring him as his friend, that either he
would be suddenly slain by many that had conspired his death, or publicly be
apprehended and brought to his Trial by the consent of the whole Kingdom; so
that he, whether knowing himself faulty indeed, or fearing the power and
injustice of his enemies, since emulation amongst his equals had procured him
a world of envy, quickly followed his advice, and privately without the Queens
privity, quitted his Country and Fortunes.

Leonatus conceiving now he had compassed the hardest part of his projects,
sent secretly into Lydia to possess the Queen there, with an assurance of
Minerva's guilt, since she had married the murderer of her first husband; too
apparently, as he pretended, discovered by his strange flight: at the same time
also, by the help of his factious priests, he raised tumults against her, in
her own kingdom, whereby she became imprisoned, because she would not quit her
government. This you may believe, gave the poor Queen sufficient employment;
insomuch as being wearied by continual troubles, and invited to the Court of
Lydia by her kinswomans promises for her better and quiet protection, she was
content to resign the Crown to her son, and accept of those offers she
esteemed real. But alas, no sooner was she arrived within the bounds of this
kingdom of Lydia, but contrary to her expectation, wherefore amazed in the
execution, instead of being admitted into the Queens presence with love and
honor, she was commanded as a prisoner to a Castle not far off; whilst in
the mean time her young son was committed to the tuition of Leonatus her
worst enemy; however with this pretention, that as soon as she could clear her
self of those aspersions and accusations that her subjects brought against
her, she should enjoy those respects at Court which had been largely promised
her; though in the interim she must be content with her fortune, since the
State of Lydia thought it not fit for one in her condition, bespotted with the
opinion of so black a crime, should have any correspondence with their Queen,
as 'twas pretended, of so bright a virtue; when the gods know, it was either
the too much cleernesse of her own good parts, or the rightfulnesse of her
title, being of a contrary Religion, that was the only obstacle of her
happiness. But whilst Minerua under-went for many years a hard imprisonment
in Lydia, since the Queen her self was so far from easing her of her bonds,
as she would never give ear to her complaints; the King her young son began
to approach to man's estate, and that maturenesse in age, gave him a feeling of
his mothers oppressions; but her enemies in Mysia being also backed from the
States in these parts, who had an intention all they could to suppress his
greatness, that he might have no power to claim his right in the kingdom of
Lydia, gave his thoughts and actions not only continual interruptions, but at
last imprisoned his very person in his own kingdom. Notwithstanding all this,
the wise King bore these insolences with unexampled patience, knowing that as
it was not in his power to free himself from their tyranny by any Kingly
pretention; so of the other side he hoped that factions amongst themselves
would at last purchase his liberty. In this state he continued, until his
Guard found that it might be prejudicial to his Titles in Lydia, after the old
Queens death, to keep him thus as a prisoner, whereby they might also be
debarred from a plentiful share of the gain, when Lydia by succession should
fall to him; upon these considerations, they of a sudden, not only released
him, from his confinement, but every one of these men themselves strived who
might be most in his favor; when as he not only as a good natured Prince,
forgot all his injuries, but became sufficiently pleased to be at liberty, upon
any terms. But the old Queen of Lydia, drawing now to her last period, both of
life and Kingdom; conceiving it was reason sufficient for a just jealousy, to
have the heir apparent so near her jurisdiction, whom she imagined looked
upon her continuance; like a young blossom, that strived to thrust out the
ancient and withered flower from its stalk, began suddenly to question the
poor Princess (her self also being almost worn out by her hard usage) about
her correspondence with those foreign powers, who were of her kindred; And not
content with any answer the truth of her proceedings could make, called her to
her trial before ordinary Commissioners. As these might be evident marks of
Minerva's ruin, so were they not undiscovered by the sharp apprehension of the
wise Lady, though her spightfull fate, would not afford her preservation,
notwithstanding her excellent endowments: yet as she had good cause, she
excepted against those partial Judges designed for her destruction, by all the
pretentions that a free Prin cesse, or an oppressed woman could allege, though
the Queen seemed as deaf to her just and reasonable request, as her enemies
were violently bent to satisfy their cruelties; until in the end she was
forced to desist from her importunities, and stick wholly to the confidence her
goodness had merited in God mercies. This not only brought her to a
judgment seat, prepared with some outward circumstances fit to entertain her
dignity, but to a condemnation prepared with ceremony, to bewitch the
understanding of the common people, who rather desired to behold strange
spectacles, then to be delighted in just actions; and in this May Game, as I
may call it, of the worst cruelty, when the form of Law was only made use of
to hide bad intentions, was this brave and religious Queen, as a period to all
her fortunes, sentenced to lose her head. Notwithstanding this condemnation,
the Queen of Lydia for some time deferred the execution, conceiving her own
honor could not but suffer abroad, in the opinion of all other Princes, her
equals, as her kinswoman in person did at home, under her jurisdiction. But
ambition, jealousy, and revenge, at last got the victory over all her other
virtues, by the malicious and crafty persuasions of Minerva's enemies; who
believed, they could not be safe as long as she lived; since it was probable,
if ever she came to wear the Crown of Lydia, she would always be mindful of
their disaffections; these reasons procured the Queen underhand, to sign a
warrant for Minerva's death, which by the Laws of the Country could not else
be taken away by any power; and with this authority a messenger presently was
sent to the chief officer of the Province, to give Minerva warning of her
approaching doom. When the sad Princess beheld this bloody character written
with the royal hand of her nearest kinswoman, it was a question whether
amazement or courage governed most in her noble thoughts; for as of one side
she could scarce believe, that the Queen had been drawn to an act so
prejudicial to the honor of her Sex, so of the other side, she entertained
the news with a gentle smile, as a wished period of all her miseries, only
with three or four deep sighs, she desired these requests of those
commissioners that had authority to see the sentence put in execation: First,
that she might have all her servants about her at the time of her death, to
bear true testimony to the world, that she neither staggered in her religion,
nor derogated from her sons honor: next that the Queen would be so
charitable, as not only quietly to suffer those that attended about her person
in safety to quit the Kingdom, but to pay them their due wages, if not reward
them according to the just service she had received: and lastly, that she might
have a Priest of her own profession, to comfort and instruct her in her last
suffering. To the first, they only answered, that as they could not give her
leave to have all her attendants about her for fear of tumults, by reason of
their multitudes, so were they willing to allow her some few to satisfy her
desire. For the second, they promised to be intercessors to the Queen in her
behalf. But for the last, they absolutely refused her request, pretending it
would be a dishonor to the religion professed in Lydia. With these answers
Minerva retired into her chamber, the better to prepare her religious thoughts
against the next days combat, where she remained all that night with so
constant a zeal to the worship of the gods, and so cheerful a demeanor in the
persuading of her servants to patience, by contemning of all worldly
prosperity, that it was easily to be perceived, she rather entertained death as
a kind friend, that intended to put her in possession of a better life, then as
a fierce enemy that set before her imagination frights of a horrid destruction;
Thus she continued her employment, until the early morning, and watchful
cruelty brought to her chamber door the instruments of her destruction: This
warning was sufficient to make her prepare with Majesty, to act the last scene
that should render her famous to posterity. Wherefore with a pleasant look, as
if she intended to laugh at deaths worst shape, when she came out she bid the
company good morrow, and then proceeded to the Scaffold with all the
circumstances belonging to her dignity, that was covered over with black
Velvet; where being set in her dismal Chair of State, she told the
spectators, that as they must not expect many words from her, in regard her
sister the Queen of Lydia was not present, to whom she would only have directed
a discourse; so of the other side, she wished them all to bear witness, that
she constantly expired in that religion she ever professed to the world, for
which she both did, and was joyful to shed her best blood, which being said,
by one and one she took leave of her servants, who being over pressed with grief
and tears were scarce able to perform their last though constrained duties to
fit their glorious Mistress for her execution; And with another sweet smile
holding up her white hands to the omnipotent gods for mercy, not long after
without the least unquiet motion, she received that fatal stroke that sent
her soul to an eternal habitation.

When this unexampled Tragedy became spread over Asia, which gave sufficient
occasion of large discourses, it could not but with speedier wings fly to her
Sons Court, with all the particular circumstances of her death, where it rested
until an Ambassador from the Queen of Lydia was sent in some sort to lessen
the fact, as being absolutely done without her privity, as he pretended, to
which purpose some of her principal Counselors had been punished: but this
Balsame a long time had not power to heal the deep wound this apprehended
cruelty had made in his dutiful bosom, until his people finding that Myssia
was not able to contend with Lydia in any revenge, and that the smallest
attempt offered by way of force to vindicate his honor, might interrupt his
quiet and peaceable succession to a Crown so rich and flourishing, which ere
long he could not by course of nature but expect, since the Queen was both old
and decayed, not only dissuaded him from any hostile evasion, but also
counseled him to entertain a firm correspondency with the State, he was to
possess; and the rather, for that the Lydian messenger threatened him with a
legal deprivation from his royal right, by the consent of the whole Kingdom,
by whose judgment as he said, his mother had been condemned, if any way he
stirred violently to disturb the peace established in both Countries.

These reasons I say rendered him as well satisfied in show as in effect, who
was esteemed extremely peaceable if not slothful in his nature; which was the
occasion, that as he could never be brought willingly to enter upon any actions
of glory, so did it make him for the most part as it were a captive, to the
pressing importunities of his covetous, and insolent Country men the Myssians,
who scarce would be satisfied with any gain or preferment whatsoever he could
bestow upon them: But to be short, at last the old Queen of Lydia dying he
without any contradiction, quickly took possession of her Kingdoms, in which
government he continued with all the prosperity in the world during his life;
but that finished, the Crowns of Lydia, Myssia, and Creet, descended by a just
right upon his hopeful Son and Successor Euarchus, then newly married to
Hyacinthia, Orsames sister, our now Queen, who enjoyed also those possessions
((...) must needs say) with as much happiness (until these last stirs) as
it was possible for mortality to expect.

But the Myssians who as I said before received golden liberalities in the time
of the old King, (he being a Prince that knew no way how to be provident) when
they found that Euarchus numerous issue, and the Queens necessary expenses did
in a manner drown all their expectation; first, began to mutter in words
against the accustomed vanities of the times; and lastly they found fault that
only smooth faced boys enjoyed, as they said, all the credit of the Court, when
Soldiers and men of valor wanted both countenance and means to live, the
King being so bewitched to his own ease, and his wives content, that he could
not be drawn to help his own brother in law, against the oppression of the
King of Armenia; by which war many might be employed that now wanted
subsistence: nor was there wanting in Lydia it self many factious spirits,
that not only received encomagement by this bold language, who also coveted
state preferment in the government of the Common weal; yet these begun
discontents lay hid in the cinders of some duty, until new taxations of the
Subjects gave more desperate distastes; besides, the accidental arrival of
Prince Cassianus in Lydia after his Fathers death, stirred up the pride of one
Dimogoras to a new spleen against the King, by which means he believed he
should be the sooner employed. But that which seemed most to contribute to
Euarchus prejudice, was the sudden arrival of an old Mission Captain out of
the wars of Armenia called Lycius, who having gained in those services good
store of wealth, sued to the King to have himself rewarded by Titles of
honor; which being denied him by some neglect, as also Cassianus request for a
competent assistance, a little protracted, this insolent Commander quickly flew
from the Court with execrations in his mouth, and malice in his heart; and
coming into his own Country omitted no diligence that could withdraw the
people from their lawful obedience, which he had the better opportunity to
effect, since he found not only the nobility ambitious, but the Priests
violent. The one he persuaded with brave spirits again to look upon the
courage of their Ancestors, who had by force of Arms torn privileges from
their King; the other he admonished to cast their thoughts upon the recovery of
that religion now almost lost, that had formerly chaced their former Queen both
from her Kingdom and life; and for the common people it was sufficient to
plead to their imaginations liberty; by whose persuasion the nobility not only
raised a power absolutely to contemn the Kings authority, in their own Country
of Myssia, but also led a great Army into Lydia, whereby to compel Euarchus to
summon the great Council of the Kingdom.

To be short, when this eminent assembly was met, as it was designed in the
City of Sardis, which was also assured to be made a free Town (as much as to
say, as not to be compelled to any obedience to Euarchus and his posterity) the
chiefest discourses that were made there, were in disgrace of the Kings
actions, and almost all the Acts that past were to destroy his authority: All
which the mild King suffered with a world of patience, hoping that time, after
they had wearied themselves with their violent passions, would let them see
their own mistakes, or the gods at leastwise would defend his innocence:
however these unexpected proceedings not only continued, but their rage grew to
such a height against his person whereby as 'twas thought to bring him into the
greater contempt amongst the common people, that by diverse tumults countenanced
in the multitude, he was at last forced from the City of Sardis, whilst the
Senate in the interim iustituted a strong guard of Soldiers of the Town
Forces, to wait upon their Councels, because they would show to the Subjects,
greater marks of Sovereignty in their Assembly, then in the Kings dignity.

But whilst many were brewing their own passionate designs with uncredible
insolency, being chiefly supported by the votes of the common people, who were
persuaded they should recover by their authority an absolute liberty, the poor
King with a very small train retired to the City of Theatyra: where however,
contrary to the expectation of the Senate, who believed that their
discountenance, was sufficient to render him abandoned by the whole Kingdom,
he not only received better welcome, but was entertained with the general
commiseration of most of those parts, who bitterly complained of his hard and
as they thought unjust usage; and the rather did this pity prevail for that
by his eloquent and fluent Pen, he seemed fully to beat back all the aspersions
his enemies sought daily to cast upon him, which brought as I say to his Court
multitudes of gentry and nobility, both from the City of Sardis and other
parts, who vowed perpetual faithfulness to his person, with other essential
services.

These encouragements by the persuasion of his trusty Counselors, made him
employ his best industry to raise Soldiers, whilst in the interim he sent to
the Queen, whom he understood was in the Island of Cyprus, to procure him
Arms, by the credit she had purchased with the Duke of that Country, since the
Senate had already seized upon all his Magazin and ships: After which he went
from one Province to another, to feel the inclination of the people; yet as he
found most of them for him in their words when he was amongst them; whether out
of the inconstancy of their own natures, or unwilling to be at any charge to
maintain new troubles; as soon as he left them personally, they were for the
greatest number carried from their former professions, so that he perceived the
success of his whole fortunes, was chiefly to depend upon the gallantry of the
better sort. And truly this expectation did not deceive him; for in a short
space, beyond all belief they so furnished him with moneys, besides their own
attendance; that he became master of a brave Army commanded by his nephew
Prince Thyasmus, who was newly arrived in his Camp from the Armenian wars.

The Senate, who before had raised Forces to contend against the Kings
intentions, according to the intelligence they had received not to be
sloathfull in their affairs, quickly created Dimogoras general in the
design, whom they knew was a man never to be reconciled to his Sovereign, by
reason of the spightfulnesse of his own violent ambition; no sooner was he
established in his office, but he was commanded to march, as they pretended to
separate the King from pernicious Councels, and bring him safe to Sardis, there
to be better governed; to which purpose that City had plentifully furnished
money, conceiving their prosperity depended upon their Princes ruin.

This resolution was quickly known to Euarchus, and not long after considered
by his Council that it was high time to advance with the whole Army, to try
the fortune of a battle with the Senates General, since the King wanted
provision, and could not expect supplies of money to furnish out the necessary
expense: with this determination after two or three days march, they met the
Senates forces upon an ample Plain, spacious enough to have desided the
controversy for the worlds Empire: the conflict of a sudden grew so desperate,
that it was a question whether they sought more to satisfy their own spleenes,
or to gain a beneficial Victory; which however was prosecuted for some hours
with doubtful fortune; for although the Kings horse commanded by Thyasnius in
person, at the first charge defeated their enemies, in so much as for many
Furlongs, they had the chase of their Troops, yet the Foot Forces in their
absence, that for the most part wanted arms, had sufficient employment to
sustain the fury of the Senates Soldiers, being better provided: which
however was bravely supplied by the noble valor of the King himself, in so
much as he sustained the violence of the tempest, until his own horse again
came into his rescue, though with such a slaughter of his poor Subjects, that
it created a passionate compassion in his royal breast, although the
determinable fate of his Crown might very well have given a full employment to
his thoughts: Upon Thyasmus appearing with his victorious Troops, Dimogoras
retired with his worsted Forces, and the night hindered further prosecution for
the present, which as I may say, enviously shaddowed the Kings glory, who else
could not have been defrauded as 'twas thought of a most absolute Conquest to
his immortal honor, if not to his Kingdoms prosperity.

However he resolved the next morning early, again to set upon his enemies,
who were retired for their better safety, within the protection of their secure
Trenches; but contrary to his expectation Dimogoras (belike fearing Euarchus
intention, and unwilling to hazard the Senates fortunes in one doubtful
adventure) had made use of the dark coverture of the night, to convey himself
and his whole Forces, to a strong Town not far off, remaining under his
jurisdiction: Nevertheless, so much opinion this half Conquest got amongst
the common people, that many Cities presently returned under the obedieuce of
their lawful Prince, whilst in the mean time, the King made Philadelphia the
chief residence of his Royal Court, where again he began to rule like a
Monarch, and suffered his other Generals in many parts of the Kingdom, to
prosecute his commands with such prosperous success, that in a short space he
became in a manner master of all Lydia, though the great Town of Sardis seemed
still with most obstinate pride to contemn his power, being more in love with
that passion, that made them hope to be a free City, and the covetousness to
obtain that money they had disbursed, then mindful of their own safety and
obedience. The King who began to think now the difficulty of his affairs were
past all danger, began a little to play with the weakness of his enemies, in
so much as his Soldiers became neglected in their discipline, as the
commanders licentious in their course of life, which certainly contributed
extremely to all his misfortunes: for being provoked either by unwise, if not
Traitorous Council, or put on by his own just spleen, to see himself in the
height of all his Victories disobeyed by weak Forces, suddenly besieged a
small City that lay in the very heart of his new Conquests, conceiving his
enemies wanted power of refistance, or at least ability to bring him any
incommodation, which made his Troops less careful to prevent correspondency;
But the Town finding it could not hold out long against so strong a siege,
gave private intelligence to the Citizens of Sardis, who apprehending the loss
would absolutely turn to their ruin, since the King would be sure, as they
believed, after to employ the rest of his endeavor in their subversion, when
he should have finished the design in hand that only opposed him, of a sudden
sent out under the command of Dimogoras the Soldiers of Sardis it self, that
until then were never known to remove many Furlonges from the smoke of their
own chimneyes, to try if it were possible to raise the Kings siege; and with as
quick an expedition as they were able, marched toward the Camp, imagining
that the success of this voyage was to determine their fates, whether to
remain free Citizens, or become conquered slaves. Euarchus when he heard of
this new and unexpected supply, so much contrary to his imagination, however
rumors thereof had formerly come to his ears, thought it his best course,
rather to fight with them in the open Fields, then in continuing in his
Trenches, to hazard the danger of being starved for want of provision: with
these purposes, after he had quitted the Walls of the Town, he advanced
toward their quarters, with a hope to set upon them in the plain Champaine,
since he conceived he had much the advantage of horse, though his foot was of a
far less number. But though the King omitted no industry to compass his
design, yet being betrayed by the common people in his intelligence, who ever
favored the Senate more then their Sovereign, Dimogoras got some days
journey toward the City of Sardis, before Euarchus knew of his remove; the
design of the General being no other, now he had freed the City from danger,
but to get again safe with his whole Army to the place from whence he came:
The King as he was enraged with this secret escape, so was he resolved if it
were possible to fight with him upon any terms, since the contrary as he
imagined, would prove in the opinion of the multitude of no less a
consequence, then a Victory obtained by his adversaries: To that effect, as
soon as he had overtaken his enemies by tedious marches, he set upon them with
desperate inconveniences, not only for that they had locked themselves in
enclosed Countries, but never came out of their Trenches to skirmish, by which
means the Kings Cavalry proved of no service; so that as I may say by reason
of these unfortunate disadvantages, Euarchus after twelve hours fight could
pretend but to a very small Victory; which success returned Dimogoras to the
City of Sardis with some honor, in regard that however he had not beat the
Kings Forces, it might be said upon the matter he had worsted his designs.

Nevertheless, although this gave the Generals party not only encouragement
for the present, but hopes in abundance in the future; especially for that the
Kings Soldiers every where; began both to be negligent and treacherous; more
seeming to rely upon the supposed justness of the cause, then resolving
constantly to defend it by any hazard, yet the Senate at Sardis doubting
something their own fortune or success, notwithstanding what policy soever
they could use in the Kings Camp, resolved again to bring in the Myssians
into Lydia with a powerful Army: To this purpose they made a contract with
them, not only to pay them a very great sum of money, both to defray their
charges and reward their endeavors, but also promised to establish in the
Kingdom of Lydia it self, the same manner of worship of the gods as was
practiced in Myssia: As this seemed in effect to be the whole agreement between
them; so the Myssians wanted not in their meaning, underhand designs, which
was to bear at leastwise an equal share in the government of both Kingdoms,
whereby the better to satisfy their pride and avarice; for the latter which as
'twas said they would have sold the gods themselves, if they had been upon the
earth vendible.

By this means again Euarchus became involved in new troubles; for presently
after the Myssians having made this unhandsome accord to the Kings
disadvantage, notwithstanding their so many vows and promises to the contrary,
there was employed at the same time an Ambassador from the Kingdom of Syria
to Euarchus, not only to persuade him to entertain a new Treaty and friendship
with his Senate sitting at Sardis, but also absolutely to break all
correspondency and friendship between himself and the State of Egypt; which
being condescended unto by the King he undertook, as well to keep back the
Myssians from entering Lydia, as to settle an absolute peace in all the rest of
his dominions: whether these were only brags or no is altogether uncertain;
rather may it be thought, either the Kings Fate or unhappy Council, thrust him
on upon those ways, that were most prejudicial to his affairs: in conclusion
he did not only deny the Ambassador the least entertainment of these
propositions, but at the same time also was persuaded to publish a declaration
against the City of Sardos; though at present it seemed to contend with the
Senate, about the payment of that money promised to the Myssians, in recompense
for their expedition into Lydia. This I must needs say, so much exasperated the
Town, that presently they went on with their accord by the general consent of
all: when these sums were received, presently the Myssians marched into the
Country with a huge Army, whilst another was sent with Dimogoras against the
Kings own person: As by this means Euarchus was constrained to divide his
Forces, so he sent the greatest part of his Army along under the command of
Thyasmus his Nephew, for the necessary raising of the siege before the City of
Theatyra, where the Myssians were already encamped, however their power was
increased with such Troops, as the Senate had commanded to join with them in
that service: Prince Thyasmus upon his approach (whether being as I may say too
precipitate in his conduct, or that he was betrayed absolutely in his
intelligence) when he came near the Town, thinking either to surprise or
defeat the enemy in an instant, of the contrary suddenly he became involved in
a most desperate Ambuscado, which in a manner destroyed the persons or the
courages of his whole Army, though in truth the Myssians performed the least
part of the service: But the King being followed and furiously attempted in his
march as I said by Dimogoras, he kept himself and Troops (though fewer by many
in number) upon such sure and courageous grounds, that the General at last was
brought into so many desperate inconveniences, by reason of his want of conduct
and providence, that although Euarchus at that time fought not one stroke, he
was forced to compound for the lives and liberties of all his Soldiers, which
was an occasion that presently turned out Dimogoras out of his office, whilst
in the interim there was put into his place one Farezius, whose melancholy
valor in a very short time prevailed exceedingly, for that the Myssians had
caused the King to divide his Forces into so many several commands, that he
could not conveniently maintain a considerable body together under any
Captain, to be able to contend with power sufficient: wherefore after some
Council taken with his best friends, the King resolved himself in person, to
endeavor to stop the fury of this new and prevailing General, that seemed
like an outrageous Torrent, to carry all before him, whether he marched against
Towns or Armies.

The King besides the inflammation of his own natural courage, was put on to
fight with Farezius, as 'twas thought upon these reasons: first to prevent a
conjunction between him and the Myssians, who were as yet at some distance:
next to continue a life in his own party, that seemed something to decline his
assistance in many places of the Kingdom, in regard of the others
extraordinary success: And last of all, for that both money and other
provisions failing, he began to contract many necessities in his army: It was
not long before they both met upon a large Plain in an open Country, that
afforded room enough for an equal contention, if the Fates had at all proved
indifferent in the encounter; The first charge was given with fury sufficient
by both sides, however the Kings horse without any known cause whatsoever of a
sudden gave back, and not long after most shamefully turned their backs, though
the foot with incredible gallantry, still continued the fight with honor and
safety: Euarchus upon this (however not being so much amazed as displeased)
presently rid amongst the flying Troops; as it were calling both gods and men
to witness, concerning the justness of his cause, and the unfainednesse of
his intentions; withal persuading them either to show more courage or less
disloyalty: not only in his words, but by his own unexampled courage,
evidently expressed before their faces, he conjured them to fight, or at
leastwise to stand their ground at some distance, whilst he and the rest
exposed their lives to the fury of the enemy; calling them sometimes his
country men and subjects; otherwhile he termed them no better then unworthy
slaves, that precipitately followed their own destruction and captivity; when
as they had a fair occasion offered them to be both glorious and happy: but at
last seeing nothing would prevail, he looked up to heaven with tears in his
eyes, beseeching that the gods would take pity on him in his necessities, at
leastwise prove propitious to the Monarchy of Lydia, that seemed absolutely to
depend upon this days adventure: Thus between praying, fighting, and
persuading, he continued, until he saw most of his Soldiers either taken or
slaughtered: so that at last, being constrained with a very few number in his
company to quit the Field, he left his Camp to the courtesy of the enemies
mercy, whilst by obscure passages he got again safe in person (though much in
his thoughts dejected) to the strong Town of Philadelphia, where not long
after by the whole power of Farezius, he was besieged with the rest of his
Court, friends, and family.

As this, said he, was the proceeding of that fatal day, so may I suppose by
the dispersing of the most part of the company, it will be also time for us to
retire: so taking Narcissus by the hand, he promised he should have the rest of
his discourse at home.

His house was seated at the end of a small town, only divided by a pleasant
grove of wood, that encompassed a round Temple, built with Jonick Columns;
within which was the statue of Apollo: when they had performed some few
devotions, according to the manner of the country, amongst other Priests of
their own order that remained in the place, the old father led him to his
habitation; being entered into the Parlour, he presently showed him the picture
of Euarchus, which for some time he had kept as he said in an obscure corner of
his house, though now he seemed to expect more freedom; whereupon he began to
read a lecture concerning his life and disposition: which gave him an occasion
to discourse in this manner:

The father of Euarchus our now King, being a Prince wholly given as I may say
to his own pleasure, only studied ways to keep himself during his life in a
quiet security: and to this purpose he not only brought up his son, after the
death of his elder brother in learning and domestic exercises, under the
protect of his own eye and jurisdiction, but when he came to years of consent,
he endeavored with some violence, to marry him to the King of Aegypts
daughter, by whose greatness he thought to establish his own regal power the
better in Lydia, perceiving his subjects were apt enough upon all occasions, to
kick against his authority: But finding the Treaty was protracted, he sent his
son in person with an intimate favorite of his, into Africa to court the young
Lady: To be short the journey produced no effects at all answerable to his
desires: for the two favorites of each Prince clashing together, although a
certain day was appointed for the marriage, yet the match broake, though upon
what grounds I neither know, or can well dispute: after this breach Euarchus
made presently his address to Hyacinthia our now Queen, being sister to
Orsames King of Syria, esteemed a most mortal enemy to the greatness of the
Kingdom and Monarchy of Egypt: no sooner was this match concluded, but the
old King dyed, leaving young Euarchus to inherit in outward appearance, as much
glory and prosperity, as was possible to be enjoyed by mortality upon earth;
and so continued for many years, until these late unhappy difference
obstructed his felicity: which truly I must the rather bewail, in regard that
he is a Prince given to no manner of vice: however perhaps some will say, he is
more beholding to nature for his inclination, then to resolution for his
temperance, unto which I must needs answer, that as the world ought not to take
any notice of the inward thoughts of man, when people receive a general
commodity by the outward expressions of virtues; so of the other side, when
good and laudable actions are accompanied with an entire justice in appearance,
it is unpossible but either the gods have placed such upon earth, to become
rare examples for imitation to others, or else have ordained them to be
extremely beneficial to themselves; so that both ways deserve singular
countenance and preservation: and this without any partiality, may be said to
be the right character of the disposition of Euarchus: now for his active
parts, that are and have been obvious to all the world; no man can accuse him
of cruelty or pride: his dear affections to his wife and children, are beyond
the pattern of all his predecessors: his activity and solicitation almost not
to be imitated: his moderation in Diet and Apparel, scarce equals any of his
subjects: if his parcimony can be imputed to him for a fault, let his numerous
issue, and the small extent of his own revenues, make for him at leastwise a
probable, if not a sufficient excuse: besides, and over and above these
specified virtues, I must commend his discreet valor, and entire patience,
since as in the one he never declined any engagement, when the necessity of his
fortune, did any way stand in need of the demonstration of his courage, so did
he never yet appear overcome by passion, when he tasted the greatest
bitterness of what affliction soever: with these words the Priest, as if he
had been transported with the very apprehension of his suffering, seemed to end
his discourse both in tears and sighs; and certainly had so continued for a
long space in a certain kind of ecstasy, if an old woman and a little youth
(the whole family with himself of his private habitation) had not interrupted
his sorrowful contemplation, by bringing into the Parlour Wine and other
junkets to entertain Narcissus, who notwithstanding, after he had tasted
sufficiently of that civility, put him in mind again of his promised relation
in the field, which was to make an end so far of his information, concerning
King Euarchus fortunes, that he might be instructed in the reasons of the
joyful assembly of the people, dancing about the Altar and Statue of god Pan.

The Priest, after he had acknowledged in some sort his own digressions from
the matter intended, he let him know that as it was no part of his meaning to
deprive him of his due, according to his own obligation, so he desired him to
excuse his passion in the Kings behalf, occasioned only by the sight of the
picture that suddenly brought into his mind a certain kind of representation
of his heroical virtues, proceeding from his nature and education: whereupon
presently leading Narcissus into his Garden furnished him with many dainty
flowers of all sorts, in which curiosity he seemed to take an extraordinary
delight, at last they both seated themselves in one of the Arbours, neatly
contrived to defend the inward part of the habitation from Phoebus oppression,
which afforded a sufficient convenience for discourse, and that joined with the
opportunity, quickly entered him into his new relation after this manner.

Euarchus said he, being as I told you retired to Philadelphia after the
Battle, as soon as he came into the Town, he went presently to his Garden
without speaking one word to any person, although many Troops followed him
with passion to know some particulars concerning his fortunes, the rather for
that they conceived themselves also to be sufficiently interested in his fate;
There he walked with a quick pace according to his custom, sometimes casting
his arm abroad, and otherwhiles again beating his breast with no small
violence; then would he look up to the heavens, as if a little he accused the
gods determinations, to suffer him that intended nothing but justice and
goodness, to be so cruelly persecuted by his own Subjects, without any known
cause whatsoever; so that in truth the whole company with tears in their eyes,
began more to consider his inward sufferings, then their own outward state and
condition: thus I say he continued, until Prince Thyasmus, his unfortunate
Nephew (who not long before had retired thither with his beaten and scattered
Troops) came also with a few Attendants into the Garden: when he had saluted
the King with a sad look (walking with him in that manner two or three turns)
he at last humbly desired him to let the company understand a little of his
unfortunate passages, since they could not be worse as he said then they
imagined them to be, and for ought they knew they might be better then they
supposed: the King went presently and seated himself upon a Bench, whilst all
the company flockt about him, though he only made a discourse to them in this
nature:

Gentlemen, said he, you now behold Euarchus tumbled from his Throne: it is
apparent the gods are displeased with our actions; neither do I well know what
will become of this unfortunate Kingdom, for however they punish and
demonstrate their indignation oftentimes by evil and wicked instruments, yet
they never show their displeasure and indignation, but where offenses are
apparent enough to deserve that chastizement: whether these faults (for which
for the present we are scourged) abound most in my own Court, or the poison
has too much dilated it self over all my dominions I will not say; only sure
we are, that sins of all sorts are increased in such a measure, that it is
probable the gods no longer could abstain from demonstrating the very height of
their fury and wrath; I could be contented to suffer for you all, so that would
be sufficient to pay the score of our obligations, we owe the heavens justice
for our crimes; but I fear me we are designed to be more generally involved,
whereby to satisfy the divine exasperated indignation, who can be no more
cozened in its knowledge then restrained in its power? In my opinion the best
way is, instantly to take asunder by way of profitable consideration all our
particular actions and thoughts; and so by wholesome, and true repentance if it
be possible to give some stop to the furious Torrent of our misfortunes, before
they come to such a Sea of confusion, that necessarily a general destruction
must follow: when I consider the pride, covetousness, and dissimulation of my
own family, I am partly convinced in my thoughts, that the ills we have
suffered, wholly proceed from that original: again, when I look upon the
disobedience, luxury, and atheism of the whole Kingdom, I may suppose from
the peoples impieties have come our misfortunes: If I have been too blame for
either, I must rather implore the gods pardon for my omissions, then overmuch
accuse my own intentions that made them so; since however my nature may be too
passively indulgent in such particulars, yet my disposition was not at all,
prone to give them allowance and approbation: I must confess I cannot
altogether free my self from every imputation, that has been cast upon my
government; for it is no small fault to be remiss in punishments, where crimes
may be encouraged to example; though much more to be countenanced in
oppression: And where inferior officers are permitted though not commanded to
be unjust, the Prince ought to bear a share in the active part, for that he
had the power to have restrained the mischief; which perhaps is the occasion
of my present suffering with the rest of my Subjects, and what more indignation
the gods have in store, I cannot be certain to prevent; only I am confident,
without a deep examination of our inward thoughts, the conscience will not be
sufficiently understood, whereby to be clear in any kind to purpose, however
our principles may be right and good, for without it, neither sorrow nor
satisfaction can follow of any considerable value to blot out the remembrance
of such evils, and so consequently a continuation of the punishment due to the
nature of our offenses will not be taken away. It is not enough to say our
enemies want justice and legality in their prosecution, for that they may be
made for the present only devine revengers, though themselves be reserved for a
higher and more exemplary torments: for however actions of prosperity and
success, be not always marks of favor and approbation, yet ought they
justly be esteemed testimonies of distaste against those Nations, and such
persons that unfortunately are rendered Subjects of misery and chastizement,
since none ever suffers without a cause: when revolutions happen (if we would
but seriously enough look after the reason) in the general we should find,
matter sufficient to convince our belief, that we are not totally innocent
almost in any particular; when as the gods are oftentimes accustomed to
preserve the whole, for their sakes, that may pretend justly to any thing
extraordinary: No my friends, this Kingdom has been for some years past,
involved in too much superfluity, to expect long a continuation of their
felicity; which no doubt made us too unmindfull from whence proceeds originally
all good and commodity: when peace and tranquillity exceedingly abound in any
region, without being at all bridled and restrained, by voluntary temperance
and consideration, there is nothing to be expected soon after but captivity or
destruction, to recall again men's thoughts and actions to moderation,
necessary for a new settlement and preservation: this world was created but as
the tryer and touchstone of our dispositions for the better establishment of
our eternal condition hereafter, since otherwise certainly it had not been
made at all: In this consists the only mistake of mankind; that we look at
present as essential acquisitious belonging properly to our persons, without
any relation to the future, when as they are I say intended either as
accidental benefits, or natural consolations, necessary in some sort for our
temporary subsistence: if we be great, mighty, and prosperous, we expect ease,
pleasure, and observance, as mere duties that should attend us, instead of
making our thoughts thereby become more grateful, humble, and solicitous in
all our endeavors, not only to augment virtue and purchase grace, but to
distribute our endeavors also by charity and reason, to those that are more
indigent upon earth: what a King or commander has in honor and power, should
be employed in care and industry for the general good: and if a beggar or
inferior person wants in riches and prosperity, it ought to be supplied by
being free from hazard and perturbation: by which means all sorts of people
may participate in a kind of an equality, according to the intention of their
first creation; since the gods certainly intended no absolute difference but
what their inscrutable decrees have determined in the future, answerable to the
endeavors of every one in particular: for however the things belonging to this
life sometimes may vary by way of accident in the world, yet the reasonable and
more noble part of man, should be alike free in every one of us by the same
rule of estimation and pretention. This consideration makes me at present look
upon my self and you in this common misery, with the same eyes of pity and
commiseration: wherefore being determined to call my own thoughts to a most
strict account, what I have acted, and how I may suffer; so would I have you
also examine your consciences, wherein you have offended, and in what nature
you may be remedied; by this means, if it be yet possible to procure some
mercy from the gods in our pressing necessities; These I say are intentions not
only most pious, but extreme safe: with these words he instantly rose from
his seat, and retired into his private chamber, that not only forced tears
but occasioned discourse from most of the company.

But whilst the King, and the Inhabitants of Philadelpha with desparing
thoughts, were busily employed about the better fortifying of the Town,
against the expected siege of Farezius, who every day was looked for which his
Troops to attempt the same (though most part of them intended, rather to mend
their conditions by yielding at last upon milder terms, then entertained in
their hopes any probability of prevailing against his Forces) of a sudden the
Myssians fearing lest they might be deceived in their expectations, both in the
money they expected from the Senate, as also concerning an equal share in the
government of the Kingdom of Lydia, for that they had procured, to themselves
and nation in the Battles, rather contempt for the little valor they had
showed, then any way gained credit in the Wars, besiedged another Town
belonging to the Kings party, not yet reduced under the Senates jurisdiction;
where however they had continued for some weeks, yet at length they were
beaten off both with loss and disgrace; in so much as then not knowing well
how to play their Cards with any advantage, they began as their last refuge,
not only publicly to dispute the Kings Titles, whom as they pretended the
Senate had oppressed beyond their intentions; but employed the interest of a
certain Ambassador of Syria in their Army, to persuade Euarchus, if it were
possible to make an escape from the City of Philadelpha, whereby to put his
person into their hands, promising in the interim his hopes, both present
safety and future prosperity, as people being (as they said) his own native
countrymen, who intended his condition nothing but good and advantage by their
assistance according to his own desire.

The King having received this comfortable message, which pretended a lucky
Omen as he imagined to the rest of his occasions, notwithstanding Farezius had
newly besieged Philadelphia, one day he called me privately into his
Bedchamber: when he had made fast the door with a certain kind of
extraordinary earnestness in his countenance, according to the manner he used
in any thing he went about (being in truth a Prince, that is not only
sollicitous in his thoughts but indefatigable in his pains and actions) he
told me, that as he had a secret of much consequence to impart unto me, so was
he afraid left it should come to the knowledge of any that were not intended
to be employed in the business, doubting he had so many Traitors attending
about his person, that it was impossible almost, for any design to be put in
execution, without the Senates privity and knowledge: wherefore though he were
sufficiently confident of my fidelity, by reason of the long experience he had
had of my service, and the trial he had experimented of my honesty and
religion, yet for that one or two more were necessarily to be used in the same
adventure, he resolved to exact from me, not only my faithful promise, but a
religious oath, concerning the performance of my trust tending to his commands:
after I had assured him by verbal protestations, that I would be ready to lay
down my life in any thing his Majesty should think me capable, either of
acting or suffering for his advantage, he made me presently kneel down before
the Statue of Jupiter, which he had always standing in his chamber: and where
most commonly he made his own morning prayers: there most solemnly I renewed
those undertakings: after which he discovered unto me his designs, which was
in a disguised habit as my servant to pass through Farezius camp in my
company, and so privately to convey himself into the Myssian Army, whither as
he told me he had been lately envited, with assurance of their assistance
toward his prosperity and protection: although I must confess I was not much
enamoured of the project, knowing the base esteemed falsehood of that people,
yet lest the King might suspect any unwillingnesse in my disposition, to
hazard my person in his service, I durst neither open my thoughts, or deliver
my opinion, although perhaps I might have showed him some reasons, that would
have procured alteration; however I knew of the other side, his straights and
necessities were sufficiently pressing in regard of the siege, to cause him
almost, to venture upon what desperate design whatsoever: in conclusion I
undertook to provide within three days space, both horses and other
conveniences to that purpose, whilst the King in the interim writ a Letter with
some few directions to his Nephew Prince Thyasmus, whom he had lately made
Governor of Philadelpha, which was to render the Town to the enemy after such
a time mentioned, with the best conditions he could make for himself, a
consideration also being had both of his Court and friends: besides he directed
other writings to his eldest Son Arethusius, who remained then in the farthest
part of the Kingdom, attended by some few Forces of his own, to transport
himself with all expedition to his mother the Queen, to whose commands he
wished him to be obsequious in every thing that concerned all their affairs;
she being in truth not only a Lady he loves beyond measure: but whose birth and
interest may procure him assistance.

To be short, within three days time I had provided all things necessary for
the Kings journey: To this purpose he was clothed after the manner of the
Grecian slaves, who are accustomed to be employed about servile works in the
field; only he had over his under apparel, a blew mantle with short and
large sleeves: he wore upon his head a high bonnet in color red, with three or
four feathers taken from a cocks tail: upon his legs were fastened certain
black buskins of leather, with buckles; betimes in the morning we issued out of
the Town both on hors-back, my servant riding before a great bag that was oyled
all over to prevent the prejudice of rain, since I had put some necessary
accommodations for our voyage therein; however nothing at all that could be any
way suspicious, although it might be our fortunes to be taken by the enemy,
which in truth so fell out accordingly: for passing through the first watch, we
were not only commanded to stand, the soldiers presently demanding of us from
whence we came, but also as suspicious persons we were carried before an
Officer of the Army to be examined: I did not deny but that I came out of the
Town of Philalelpha; however I told them, that as I was only there by
accident, to visit some friends and dispatch other necessary businesses, with
certain scholars that lived in the Academy, who meddled with nothing but what
concerned their studies, so was I again repairing to the City of Sardis, where
for the most part I remained, being by profession a Priest that observed the
Myssian rights in my ordinary sacrificing to the gods. This smooth tale I had
hoped would have freed me presently; yet they kept us all that day and the next
night, with a pretention the general was not at leisure, without whose
discharge and allowance (as they said) we could neither pass, or be at
liberty: it is true, their chief intention was to get money from us; but I must
confess I durst not overbountifully offer them any, in regard it would have
given the more occasion of jealousy and suspicion: Nevertheless,
notwithstanding they seemed to detain me as a prisoner, yet I got leave for my
servant, to be in some sort free in the camp, whereby to have the convenience
(as I pretended) to provide some accommodation necessary for the horses, who in
that office performed his duty so diligently, that I must tell you he was
constrained all night to lie in the open field, without any coverture
whatsoever over his body, though in truth it proved to be a very tempestuous
season: in this manner we were perplexed between fear and suffering, however I
must confess I little doubted the Kings discovery; not only in respect of his
habit, but that he had also shaved his beard in a most antic fashion. In
conclusion the good humor of the General the next day, or rather the
Soldiers finding there was but little to be got from us, not only discharged
me from my further attendance, but gave a Pass for me and my servant to
travel freely to the City of Sardis, without any let or hindrance from any of
their party; which proved to be of no small convenience unto us in all our
journey: for although the protection only mentioned that Town, where we least
intended to go, yet as soon as I was out of the camp, I so finely mended the
writing with my own pen, that I made it most aptly serve for every place and
region; in so much as by reason thereof in our journey, we were neither let
nor troubled to any purpose, having a discharge presently amongst all manner of
Officers of theirs, as soon as we produced the paper, when as without doubt
otherwise we had been infallibly taken and imprisoned, since those parts where
we traveled, were become extreme suspicious by order from the Senate, in
regard of the Declarations of the Myssians, of purpose so commanded, the better
as they thought to prevent all intercourse and correspondency between the Kings
party and the people of that Nation.

In this manner at last we arrived in the Myssian camp, and with a great
satisfaction (I must needs say) to the Kings thoughts, however his resolutions
were not presently to discover his person; so that retiring into a little
Village not very far from the Army, he sent me (after I had taken some small
refreshment) to enquire for the Syrian Ambassador, upon whose score he rather
seemed to have put his undertaking this dangerous adventure, then upon any
absolute confidence he could have in the Myssians fidelity, in regard that they
had already so often deceived him with their fair promises and false actions;
it was my part, in complements to tell him as much, after I had made him
acquainted with the Kings arrival. As the Ambassador appeared somewhat amazed
at the news, so did he not stick to assure me, that he knew his Majesty would
be received by the Army with all honor and safety, and presently went along
with me to find him out. The King after some few civilities, used this
language to the Ambassador.

Sir, said he, as you now see me in a posture far below my birth and dignity,
so the gods, to let us know we are but men, have for the present suited my
person according to my misfortunes, whereby to comply the better with my
necessities; this I hope is sufficient to show what a desire I have to put my
self into the hands of my native Countrymen: if either the consideration of
my past benefits, bestowed upon them in the general, or any compassionate
reflection upon my unfortunate state, at the instant are motives sufficient to
work upon humanity, I shall be safe here, and may be prosperous hereafter;
wherefore, as I would not have them to work upon my miseries for poor and
contemptible gain, so shall not I remember them any more of their former
ingratitude and disobedience: but rather let us both unite in such a constant
conjunction, that as by their means I may come again to be King, so will they
ever by such an act of kindness oblige me to govern for their benefit: they
cannot but consider with what little probability they can hope for any
establishment in Lydia, but by my means, when as already the Senate does not
only disvalue their actions and proceedings by most disgraceful and
contemptible speeches, but now that they have brought (as they believe) their
affairs to a prosperous issue (whereby they have no more need of their
assistance, and so consequently would be rid of the trouble) they not only
dispute with them the Titles and reasons of their own interest, but even deny
them the payment of their just due, for all those services they have performed
for their advantages in Lydia.

As the Ambassador did not make any great reply to the Kings discourse, but in
a few complements, concerning his own services, so did he presently conduct him
to his house for his better accommodation; where he gave present order to have
him furnished with apparel and other necessaries, whilst in the interim (as it
was supposed) he acquainted Lycius the General, and the rest of the Officers
of the Army, with his arrival in the camp: After two or three days time the
Ambassador not only exposed the King to the view of the people, but delivered
him into the protection of the soldiers; where however Lycius and some of the
principal of the Nobility, entertained his presence with an extraordinary
outward humility; yet nevertheless with certain kind of sad and distrustful
looks and countenances, they performed their duties and respects in kissing his
hands, and using other ceremonies, as if they were not any way privy, much
less consenting to his journey; the King, notwithstanding he seemed not to
take any notice of their actions in public, but of the contrary gave
testimonies of joy and gladness, at the apprehension of his happy fortune; yet
in private, by many words and sighs, he expressed his own doubts, and opinion
concerning his future entertainment; the rather, in regard they presently set a
strict guard upon his person, though pretending it to be done for no other end
but for his greater honor and safety: however his hopes became something
better satisfied, for that they admitted freely to his conversations, not only
many of his household servants that were come from Philadelphia, after the Town
was surrendered to Farezius, but some of those Priests also of his own
faction, that were under the jurisdiction of the Flamins.

In this manner the King remained for diverse weeks, delighting his thoughts
with such recreations, as had been almost made customary to his nature, by
continual practice from his infancy, which made not a few wonder, how he could
seem pleased with such trivial things in the height of his vexations and
discontents. Again, it was spightfully laid to his charge by his adversaries,
that he had no great prejudice in being tumbled from his throne, when as he
appeared not to have apprehention enough to be sufficiently sensible, of what
consequence the loss of a kingdom was: but probably either he had so much
wisdom, as to reflect upon the uncertainty of all worldly things with a right
consideration, or was endued with such a supreme goodness in his disposition,
as persuaded him to bear his afflictions with no ordinary temper and
pacification.

In the interim the Myssians were not idle, to play their game to the best
advantage, both with the Senate and the King: for as of one side they made the
Senate believe, they had a mind to dispute the Kings injuries and sufferings,
both out of honor and Religion; so did they always tell the King, that he
must give satisfaction to the demands of either Kingdom, before they could
become isntrumental in his establishment; which drew on their consultations to
the length of many weeks expectation, the Senate urging the delivering of the
Kings person into their possession, out of right and justice, in regard they
had been only hired in the wars and service of Lydia, by their money; so
that consequently they were obliged with a punctual decorum to observe their
commands in every thing: of the other side Euarchus party affirmed; that he
being King of Myssia, as well as Lydia, the Myssians ought to have as
particular an interest in his person and preservation, as the Senate of Lydia,
in prosecution of which, they were to see him again restored to his Crown and
dignity, notwithstanding any desire to the contrary: but whilst these
disputations lasted, as I may say, with some seeming bitterness of either
side, which as 'twas thought, would instantly have caused a cruel and bloody
war between both Nations, one Argilius a Nobleman of Myssia came suddenly
from his own Country into the Camp, who from the very beginning of the stirs
had been a main opposer (by reason of his own covetousness and ambition) of
the Kings interest in that Nation: intending thereby more absolutely to govern
all the affairs of that kingdom himself: when he arrived he presently went
to the counsel of the Army, where he made this oration unto them.

Gentlemen said he, I understand you are now assembled about these
consultations, that may belong to the Kings particular concernments; partly
proceeding from the earnest solicitation of the Syrian Ambassador: and partly
in regard Euarchus is now present amongst you in the Camp: In my opinion it is
more just and convenient, in the first place to look upon the gods worship: in
the next to mind our own preservations: to this purpose in my judgment it
ought to be considered, why we took up Arms at all in the beginning to oppose
our Prince, if now without any other condition whatsoever we should lay them
down, and again restore him to his ancient dignity without conditions? I
pray, remember we have made a solemn protestation to the gods, as of the other
side a confederation with our friends: and if we break with both, no doubt but
heaven and earth will accuse us as well of perjury as indiscretion; since we
should seem, neither to reverence sacred things as we are bound, nor preserve
humane obligations as we ought: may you not remember, we took from our King his
power for no other reason, but because we thought him not fit to reign over
us, accompanied with his stubborn and wilful crimes; and shall we presently
restore him to that State again without amendment? are we not tied by promises
to the Senate of Lydia, faithfully to perform their businesses in these
Wars, whilst we are under their pay and jurisdiction? and shall we detain
the very object of their intentions against their minds, as a protected person
by our Army, who was the only booty they aimed at to purchase by our
endeavors? O horrid injustice and more pernicious indiscretion, since in the
one undoubtedly we exasperate the gods anger, as in the other we apparently
endanger our own safeties; for as they cannot but revenge, their own dishonor
in the highest fury of their wrath, in regard of our perjury, so justly may the
people of Lydia overrun our Kingdom, for not performing those conditions we
contracted for, before we entered their Country; which however may be a War
of some long contention and dispute; yet the effects must needs be bloody and
expencefull; whereas, if we go hand in hand with our friends, (I mean the
great Senate at Sardis) we shall not only preserve such an amity, as probably
will make both Nations happy, but for the present fill our coffers with
sufficient gold, to render us in Myssia, equally rich with other Countries of
Asia.

By releasing the King I say without their consents, we give him only power and
convenience, instead of being grateful for the benefit, to punish us for
having been at the first the chief occasion, that made him at all stand in need
of such a kindness: This disposition of his has bin sufficiently experimented
in his necessities, when as he will not so far gratify us as to put the
Flamins out of the Temples: These reasons being considered I say, let us
presently dispatch messengers to the Senate of Lydia, with full power and
commission from this Army, not only to Treat of conditions, but to conclude
with that Council, concerning those conditions and Articles which shall be
thought fit to be offered to the King to confirm, either before he be restored
to his Crown, or released from his imprisonment: so shall we be pious to the
gods, just to our friends, and beneficial to our selves.

Although there was much contradiction, and strong disputes concerning this
oration of Argilius; yet in regard Lycius the general, with many others of his
faction in the Council, were against the Kings desires; An absolute
determination was presently there taken, to send Argilius with some other
Commissioners to the City of Sardis, whereby to conclude such propositions, as
should be held most advantagable as they said for both Nations; Though it was
well known the Myssians had only an intention to good themselves; not only in
the payment of that money, which they expected from the Senate, but in regard
of their secret intentions by Euarchus suppression, to have an equal share in
the government of the Kingdom of Lydia: but however they concluded, to put in
execution their resolutions with all expedition, yet they still kept the King
in hopes by fair promises of his restoration, as well to cousen and deceive
his expectation, that he might not entertain new thoughts, or fall upon other
Counsels, as that he might not be irreconcilably distasted with their actions,
if they should miss of their agreement with the Senate of Sardis, who they
doubted might be something unwilling, to part with those vast sums that were
demanded; which failing, they intended to make use both of the Kings Titles and
countenance, to prosecute their other designs, either in Lydia it self or any
other part of Asia, as there should be occasion.

The propositions they offered to the Senate were these: First, that the
solemn protestation formerly agreed upon should be taken by every person of
both Nations without exception, out of which not the King himself to be
exempted: secondly not only the jurisdiction but the very name of the Flamins
to be absolutely abolished, and no other rights and manner of worship of the
gods, to be used but according to the customs of Myssia: Thirdly, that both
Euarchus and his posterity so far to be disinabled in their authority, that
each Senate in both Kingdoms might be sufficiently confident of their power,
whereby to be freed in their own opinions from all danger and suspicion in the
future: Fourthly, that such sums of money should speedily be paid to the
Myssians as was promised for their satisfaction; and Lastly, Commissioners to
be chosen out of either Country, to whom the common transaction of affairs
should be equally committed.

Although these two latter Articles were something disputed, yet it was not
long before it was agreed, that these conditions being presented and the King
refusing to subscribe them, he should be detained as a prisoner, and not
acknowledged for a Prince: Argylius and the rest returning to the Camp, (where
the King to be short refusing his subscription and consent) within a very few
weeks, employed for the circumstances necessarily belonging to every
performance, Euarchus was by the conduction of some Troops of horse, delivered
into the custody of Farezius, who presently conveyed him with his own
Soldiers, to a fair house formerly belonging to the Kings of Lydia: Of the
other side, both Argylius and Lycius, marched into their own Country of
Myssia, with money and triumph, as if they had deserved immortal fame, for
their disloyalty, which for the present must end my doleful story, since the
time of the day envites us to take part of a slender supper, according to the
warning of the little Bell I hear: however before you go to bed, I engage my
self, to furnish you with another relation, much more pleasing to my thoughts,
that occasioned the late meeting of the people in the Fields, with such
expressions of joy as you beheld: so taking Narcissus by the hand, he led him
into a pretty room, where they found two or three dishes of meat newly set
upon the Table, attended only by the old woman and the youth. After they had
given thanks to the gods, within an hours space they ended their supper; the
cloth being presently taken away, and some few other discourses of delight
fittest for digestion past over, the Priest again began this new relation.

Euarchus said he, being thus entered as I told you into a new captivity
(though far more nobly used) was constrained to attend the coming of the
commissioners of the Myssians to Sardis, for the further disposure of his
person and affairs: but in the interim the Soldiers, whether contrary to
their custom and vocation, reflecting principally upon the miseries and
afflictions of the King, or rather being willing to make that the ground or
pretentions for their future intentions, to quarrel with the Senate, about
their own discontents, in seeing the Myssians esteemed and themselves
neglected, not only by degrees began to use the King gently, but openly to
complain, that themselves were so far from receiving rewards for their
services, as that they had not been justly paid their wages: when as the
Myssians as they said, received great sums of money, for doing nothing else
but running away, and betraying their King: also they seemed exasperated, to
have them countenanced in setting up their manner of worship of the gods,
throughout all the Kingdom of Lydia, to the enslaving as was urged of the
Nation in the free liberty of their consciences; when as the people according
as had bin promised them, could not exercise their own manner of worship:
besides they seemed extremely to repine that Myssian governors should be
joined with those of Lydia it self, in the management of State affairs, that
belonged properly only to the Nation: neither did these discontented
discourses end in this manner; for they daily assembled in private Counsels, to
produce something for their advantages, though they yet knew not very well what
either to demand or act: however these proceedings were soon brought to the
knowledge of the Senate, who being jealous also of their own intentions, were a
great deal the more fearful of any dangerous accidents; so that presently
they sent messengers to the Army, though as 'twas said with intentions to
persuade, yet with authority to command the Soldiers to a better obedience:
but as these officers were extremely deceived in their expectations,
concerning their own power and interest in the Camp, so were they forced with
expedition to return to those that sent them, with some terror in their
countenances; As this for many days, caused sometimes distracted Counsels,
otherwhiles more peremptory discourses, so was it not over long before the
Senate, was saluted with a declaration from the Soldiers, wherein they not
only taxed them, with want of justice and extreme ingratitude to the Army,
that had fought so many Battles, and shed so much blood for themselves and the
privileges of Lydia, but also presented their considerations with these
following proposals, wherein they wished to be speedily satisfied: first, that
they might with all expedition not only be paid their just dues, but in a
convenient time be farther rewarded according to their deserts: Secondly, that
no part of the Army should be disbanded without their own consents: Thirdly,
that such laws and decrees might presently be established, to assure the
people of Lydia of their convenient liberties; and Lastly, that the worship of
the gods according to the Myssian rights, might not be imposed absolutely upon
any person or condition: These demands being sent to the Senate by messengers
of their own, that before never expected to be contradicted, much less
circumscribed by any power whatsoever, began to think, that it would be now
their safest way, rather for the present to endeavor to temper the Soldiers
passions, then further either to tempt or hazard their fury; To this purpose
they returned back their messengers, with faithful or at leastwise fained
promises, that speedily they should receive satisfaction, according to their
hearts content: Nevertheless the Army finding after some weeks expectation,
that the Senate endeavored, rather to deceive their expectations by sowing
underhand and private factions among the Soldiers, then that they intended
really to perform in effect, any thing that was actually for their good, after
they had as it were chosen Farezius as their Captain General for their
privileges, as well as the Senate had chosen him for the Wars, not only
seized presently upon most of the Magazins of the Kingdom, but also sent some
Troops to take the King out of prison where he remained: Euarchus being a
little amazed at this new and sudden attempt, as he could not well interpret
their meaning, although it is probable he might like well enough of their
actions, so at the first, did he make some stand at their proceedings; yet at
last being persuaded of their fair intentions, and having of the other side
assured them of his affection, they instantly carried him in a certain kind
of triumph through most part of the Kingdom of Lydia, until at last they
lodged him in a brave Castle of his own, where he now remains (as it is
believed) with a great deal of satisfaction; And the rather, for that (it
being so given out) they do not only in an honorable manner, suffer him to
exercise his own rights concerning the worship of the gods, with a free
admittance of all companies to be entertained, with what conversation he
pleases, but have lately envited him to send for the Queen and all his
children, who shall be as they say joyful witnesses of his being again
established in his Throne and dignity: and however they be something suspicious
of the practices of the Commissioners of Myssia, and those belonging to that
faction, least they might persuade the Kings heart from the interest of the
Soldiers, yet the better to give him satisfaction, concerning the opinion of
his own liberty; neither they or any else are debarred either from his presence
or communication; whilst of every side they have promised the common people a
happiness according to their expectations, both in their manner of worshipping
the gods, as well as belonging to all other privileges, that can possibly any
way appertain unto their future condition: which in truth I must tell you was
the only occasion of our assembly this day; Not only to thank the gods in the
general for this appearing happy change, but also a little to exercise their
ancient decorums in their rural sports, in regard they had been for some time
debarred from such sports, by the rigid severity of the Myssian customs; which
as I told you have been brought into Lydia, by the Priests and others of that
Nation, that at last was imposed upon the people, as an absolute injunction by
the authority of the Senate: This being what I can say for your satisfaction,
concerning the present affairs of the Kingdom, wherein I fear me I have too
much offended in the general by my long discourses, though upon the matter I
do not see how they could have been well omitted in any particular, so I hope
you will now give me leave to end. After that Narcissus had thanked him for the
pains he had taken, and the favor himself had received, (having past away
some time longer in other discourses upon the same subject) the Priest calling
his boy to take the lights, he conducted Narcissus into his chamber, where
after a while, with some Court-complements, he left him to take his rest,
promising in the morning to show him the Liberary, as one of the best
curiosities he could present him withal.

It was not very early the next morning, that the Priest interrupted Naroissus,
conceiving belike that his travel required something more then ordinary rest,
though in that he was much deceived; for he was not accustomed to let pass
much time, without thinking upon his dear Cloria: when he came into his
chamber, he invited him, according to his promise to the sight of his Library.
As in that place they turned over many books of diverse kinds, so beholding
amongst other things, Maps and Spheres of the world, they fell in diverse
discourses concerning the opinions of some in the Primitive age, that did not
believe there were any Antipodes; as also, others again, that thought the Sun
stood still, and the earth turned round; besides, a third sort of people which
would not believe, but that there was another world in the Moon. This gave
occasion to the old Priest to say, that as he would not much trouble his
thoughts with the disputation of those questions, since it could no way
concern either his present or future being, so was it an unanswerable argument
for the immortality of the soul, that the Sun being of so vast a greatness,
and of so excellent a clarity, no way to be known or imagined, of what matter
it was made of, could not in all reason but be created for a thing more worthy
then it self; and that not appearing in this world, of necessity it must be the
reasonable soul of man, and nothing else, which was at first ordained to be the
object of such an intention, in regard that only remaining here, pretends to
eternity, and so consequently more worthy then all other things. From this
discourse, they fell to a disputation about the privilege of Arms and
Learning, which of both ought to have the greater prerogative in peoples
esteem: Narcissus said, that as action was more Noble then contemplation, since
the one did but think what the other performed; so in probability arms was to
be preferred before letters, in that it created really the subject for the
others employment: besides, he said that action did not only nourish it self,
but gave life to other things, as namely History, the worlds looking-glass,
and times recorder: again, the undergoing of dangers and difficulties, as he
said, was a means to warm men's apprehensions, and desires with Noble flames;
whilst Learning, in a more obscure way, did but hold it the best honor it
could merit from posterity, to remember truly what other people did worthy of
commendation; however perhaps it self was only contented to lie drowned in a
certain kind of sensuality, pleased with an imagination, that coveted but to
know those things perfectly, which it never intended at all to practice; since
the dignity of Crown and Empires depended not upon the information of who
possessed them, but in having the free dispose of such glories themselves, for
the most part not to be compassed and enjoyed, but by active valor; when as
books did no otherwise then make relation of those passages, like Generals in
triumphant Chariots after the battle, showing to the people what was deserved
in the field; or rather representing an excellent Comedian, appareld in most
glorious attire, that plays to the life without wounds, the part of him that
acted nobly and dangerously against his enemy. Books I must confess, said he,
are commodious pictures, to teach present times by predecessors examples, what
men ought to do in their own persons; whereas by activity and arms, we are
put in possession of the honor it self: The one, as I may say, being only
the shadow, that may in some sort satisfy a soul not sufficiently knowing or
inflamed; like old people that repeat with delight their old stories in their
youth, when they have no more power or will to act to any purpose: whereas the
other continues us enjoying our own virtues, like a plentiful and flourishing
Harvest, producing variety of new fruit to the industrious Husbandman. He
further said, that Letters were only useful in seasons of quiet, whereas
arms could only secure and protect learning at all times, to make it become
profitable, for that men's unruly and preposterous courses, and actions were to
be restrained and regulated, more by power then persuasion. This being said,
Narcissus with a gentle smile, gave the Priest also occasion to show his
reasons.

The Priest told him, as he hoped without offense he would give him leave to be
of a contrary opinion, however he honored sufficiently the profession of
arms, so with a courteous smile he began the question also in this manner:
although I will not deny, said he, but my self to have been a soldier in my
youth, yet I cannot but stand for the privilege of the pen, according to
reason and justice; wherefore as contemplation does not destroy the exercise of
the body, so of the other side, books render a man more capable to act with
advantage, without which attempts would not be much profitable, since man's life
is too little a space to learn sufficiently, what were best to be done in many
things: he said further, that Military discipline it self, could not subsist
to any prevailing purpose, without those rules and orders which were before
thought upon, and learned by method and instruction; for that it is not only
the running precipitately into hazzards and dangers, that ought to render a
person deservedly admired, though sometimes blindfold fortune, crown the
action or attempt with success; but rather when as by a knowing valor, we
have either prevented a mischief or procured a victory, deserves estimation: A
prudent and valiant General, said he, goes not so much into the field to
hazard and destroy, as to preserve and overcome; which certainly cannot be so
well effected, as by least slaughter, and most policy; for although Monarchies
and Countries are oftentimes conquered by force of arms and power, yet seldom
without stratagems and prudence can they be long and quietly enjoyed, for want
of good established laws to maintain them in peace and security; Wars he
affirmed resembled furious winds and storms that overthrow buildings, and
productions, but order and quiet like good builders or provident husbandmen,
make up again the breaches to fairness and commodity: even as a rough and
harsh hand may quickly disorder the strings of instruments for want of
sufficient skill, but it must be skillful Artists that makes them sound
delightful to the ear: A disorderly commonwealth said he, may sometimes
necessarily be chastized with the sword, as dangerous putrifactions, which are
to be cut away from the rest of the members, to save the whole body from
perishing; yet good and knowing government must be always applied as a salve
to render the rest again whole and sound: in conclusion, said the Priest, a
State or Kingdom may stand without War, but without learning it cannot
possibly subsist, since armies themselves that are esteemed the very
instruments of glorious acquisitions, must, to preserve their own being, much
more to purchase them considerable success, be obliged punctually to observe
those rules prescribed them in times of peace: To this discourse Narcissus only
replied, since he had so well defended learning by learning, he had no reason
any more to endeavor by the sharp lauguage of his tongue to destroy the
excellency of the subject.

These and the like discourses at last carrying them to dinner; which being
finished and the cloth taken away, of a sudden the Priest was whispered in the
ear by the little youth: Narcissus civilly removed from his place to give them
the more freedom of speaking: when he had done, the Priest told him that he
was sent for by one Creses, a young Nobleman of Lydia, unto whom he had been
formerly beholding, not only for the saving of his Library, but for many other
courtesies, during his being employed in the Senates service; who was just now
(being come out of Syria) arrived in the Town hard by, from whom he doubted
not as he said but to have some relations of consequence, to which purpose he
did intend to bring him along with him to supper: He farther informed him, that
he had formerly enjoined him to write the passages of these Times which gave
his studies some daily exercise: with this he took his leave of Narcissus;
wishing him to think upon what employment he pleased in the interim, either in
his gardens or amongst his books.

Narcissus after the Priest was gone, as he reflected upon Creses arrival, who
might bring news out of Syria as he hoped toward the establishing of Euarchus
in his Throne, by which consequence he doubted not, but the sooner to come to
the period of his own love, so of the other side did he resolve, upon his
quitting suddenly the Priests house, to put himself underthe command of the
revolted Army, not knowing which other way to do his sweet Princess any
considerable service; especially for that the King her father seemed now to be
only under the care and protection of the Soldiers: The next consideration
that came into his mind was, by what means he might with the least suspicion
provide himself with horse and arms to that purpose; since he durst not
discover his intention to the Priest, for fear of the more notice to be taken
of his quality and condition: The whole afternoon in a manner he spent in
these considerations, until the old Priest returned with Creses in his
company; who yet had not informed him of any news at all concerning his
Travels, by reason they had neither privacy or convenience, in regard of the
many visits and other complements they received from the Townsmen: As soon as
Creses entered the room, the Priest made him acquainted with Narcissus, who was
one as he said that belonged to the Country of Cyprus: whereupon Creses
replied, that as his person merited in outward appearance, the best respect
that could be given by all civil people of any Nation, so was he extreme
happy in the encounter, for that his Travels perhaps might furnish him with
something out of his own Country, if lately he had not heard from thence, of
some consequence: after that Narcissus had returned him a suitable complement,
both the Priest and himself seemed somewhat passionate to hear his relation,
which quickly carried them all three to a convenient feat in the garden, where
Creses without much circumstance used this discourse unto them, whilst their
supper was preparing in the kitchen in the interim.

As it is sufficiently known said he, how unfortunately the Princess Cloria
(after she was delivered out of the Castle by my self) was carried back again
to the Senate, by the Treason of certain Soldiers fled from the Battle which
Prince Thyasmus lost to the Myssians, so will I only begin my relation from my
own quitting of Lydia upon that occasion: to which purpose you must know, that
it being my intention in the first place to visit our Queen Hyacinthia, to
inform her fully of all occurrences in Lydia, since I was rendered by reason
of that accident, altogether incapable of other services any way beneficial,
either to the Princess or her self; finding upon my arrival in the Island of
Cyprus, that the Queen was newly parted from thence, I had some leisure granted
me to be informed of the late strange news of that Island, which were
delivered me in this manner: the passages I am the more willing to relate for
the satisfaction of this stranger.

The Dukes daughter of that Country named Eretheria, one day walking by chance
by the Sea side with one attendant only, near a certain kind of religious
house where she was retired for her devotions, of a sudden casting down her
eyes toward the bottom of the rocks, she might see something lie, that
however so far off she could not perfectly distinguish; Nevertheless
continuing her looks fixed for some time upon the object, which she thought
according to the fancies of her imagination, not only to be a body that had
been cast up by the Sea, but that it also appeared to have some motion in it:
so that there being in that place certain steps cut in the stone, that
afforded convenience enough for descent, she resolved her self in person to
make the experiment, whereby the better to satisfy her curiosity: where being
arrived with her maid servant, she soon perceived a handsome young man lying
upon the sands, with a piece of round Timber under his body, as it were
infolded within one of his arms, whilst the other lay at some distance: This
prospect however it something startled her thoughts, with a little kind of
horror, yet her courage more prevailing then the natural fearfulness of her
sex, as she approached nearer, the youth seemed to have some motion, and this
gave both her apprehension and charity a Subject as she thought to work upon:
wherefore presently sending her attendant to call some Fishermen at a pretty
distance that were mending their Nets, she caused them presently to transport
the youth to a small house by the water side, who in the interim began to
recover more and more life: To be short, within a while she applied so many
remedies with her fair hands to his distempers, that in a few days he
recovered from the greatest part of his danger, though not altogether out of
the troublesomenesse of his sickness; which kept him in his bed for a very
long season, though in a manner daily visited by the fair and charitable
Eretheria; not yet having yielded an account to any of the accident by Sea,
that was the occasion of his being cast in that sort upon the shore: But
finding at last, that he not only had gained a competent strength for what
expression soever, but also that that faculty restored to him was at present
necessary to be used for his advantage, one day when Eretheria came according
to her custom to visit her sick patient, the room being freed by accident
from all company else, the youth to her no small amazement prosecuted this
discourse.

Alas sweet Eretheria said he, what serve these outward remedies you apply to
my weak body, when you leave my heart still subject to a dangerous and
painful disease? these words seemed so strange to the ears of the young Lady,
that with a certain kind of amazed look, she only entertained his expectation
for some time; but at last apprehending a few sparcles of love might proceed
from her frequent visitations, that hadimboldned the youth to higher ambitions,
then any way his condition could merit, or she admit of, had drawn from him
these extravagant expressions; turning her countenance instantly into a frown,
she told him, she was of opinion that his distracted spirit, by reason of his
long sickness, had caused him to very ridiculous fancies instead of using
fitting respects: To which he suddenly replied; no, no, most dear Eretheria,
know that I am not mad by these new distempers, but long since wounded by your
bewitching beauty; so that as the guilt justly belonges unto you, so ought you
also to take upon you the blame: for you may be satisfied if you please, that
your patient is no other but your unfortunate servant Eumenes, preserved as I
may say miraculously from the rage and violence of the Seas unkindnesse, to be
more again tormented and endangered by your cruelty: This was enough to have
put Eretheria beyond all degrees of wonder and amazement, since Hyacinthia our
Queen had brought news of his and Prince Cassianus miscarriage, as she had
been informed by an unfortunate shipwreck in her company: but when again she
had computed inwardly in her mind the time of the accident, and the finding of
his body lying upon the sands, to agree punctually together, it rendered her
absolutely certain in her belief, that he was no other then the right
Eumenes: besides both his voice and countenance, though much changed by reason
of his sickness, at last lively came into her apprehension: so that after she
had a long time rested silent, as if her consideration labored to digest her
thoughts into a method, or rather seeming to labor inwardly by the force of
many passions, she at last broake out into these expressions, wherein both her
words and her tears were sufficient witnesses of her extraordinary distemper:
O you gods said she, must I be an instrument to protect murder, under the
pretense of using charity; much less certainly ought it be imagined, that I
should embrace such a love without my fathers consent; who undoubtedly can
never be pleased with an election of these oppositions; And with that flew out
of his chamber with some violence: This gave Eumenes considerations sufficient
employments, since he was not only in despair that Eretheria would never
entertain his affections, but doubted whether or no she might not deliver him
up into the hands of justice: but again reflecting upon the nobleness of her
nature accompanied with so many rare perfections, he could not believe so pure
a whiteness of disposition like the rich Ermin, would suffer it self to be
defiled by any provocation to false-hood: Nevertheless the grief to be left
in that manner by the fair Eretheria, as it were confounded in a vast Sea of
confusion, when as before he had raised his hopes to some pitch of probability,
by reason of the opportunities he enjoyed with those respects he had received
from her after the tilting, continued his distempers a long time upon him;
which also became extremely augmented, in regard that Eretheria absolutely
forbore her accustomed visits: that caused her belike in the interim, more
closely to retire her self amongst the holy Virgins, in the place where she
then remained; either being struck perhaps with the sensible feeling of the
youths sufferings (withal a little jealous of her own honor) or the more
conveniently to avoid the importunity of such suitors, that her father had
proposed to her choice: however not to detain me over long in the relation, or
(...) in the hearing, by laying open all the circumstances, that might
appertain to so passionate a story, Eumenes, after he was in a sort perfectly
recovered of his sickness, found means by a certain disguise he borrowed of a
young Novice belonging to the order, not only to procure admittance into the
conversation of Eretheria (who not being absolutely professed, he might the more
conveniently do) but in a short time after he had one day discovered himself
to her knowledge, with tears, sighs, and other services, obtained some kind
of entertainment in her favor: Nevertheless in the interim she conjured him,
by all those affections that he could expect from her condition, so to conceal
his person from the knowledge of any, that her father might never suspect
either his pretentions, or that he was living: Eumenes although he thought
himself sufficiently honored, that his beautiful Mistress, would in this
manner allow him the freedom of her chaste conversation, yet considering he was
not much nearer his journeyes end by the favor, then the Suns revolution, that
did but rise and set, to prosecute the one course without alteration, conceived
himself to be in a manner in the same predicament as tormented Tantalus; her
permittance being only remedies to keep his thoughts always in an appetite,
without tasting of that fruit which he so much coveted: however his hopes were
sufficiently encouraged to keep despair from seizing upon his soul: Thus I say
he continued enjoying though he never enjoyed, until the unexpected death
(...) the Duke her father, gave Eretheria full liberty (as she thought) to
dispose of her self without contradition; At these words Narcissus began to
grow pale, in so much as the Priest asked him how he did? but he reflecting
upon the necessity of concealing himself, in regard of the Princess Clorias
desires, where as she only upon those conditions, was content to allow him her
conversation, and besides considering that the demonstration of any passions
could not again call his father to a new life^, told them, that as a little
quame had something overcome his stomach so was he for the present pretty well
recovered: wherefore desired Creses, without any more interruption in his
behalf to prosecute his story, which made him quickly return to the matter in
this manner: Eretheria said he, being thus the absolute possessor of her own
liberty, as by descent the only heir to her fathers fortunes, since her
brother Narcissus had miscarried unfortunately some time before at Sea, as was
generally conceived throughout the whole Island of Cyprus was presently
persuaded by the States of the Country, to make election of some Noble and
worthy husband, that might be capable to execute that charge and command, that
belonged formerly to the Duke her father; for that by reason of her sex, she
could not entirely of her self enjoy the office; being willing as they said,
if it were possible, to continue the jurisdiction in the same blood, in regard
of those extraordinary benefits the Island had received by the government of
the late Duke her father: As Eretheria could not but accept of these
propositions, that pretend to so much love to her self and family, after she
had returned them a grateful acceptance of their kindness, with all the
fitting expressions she could use to that purpose, within a very few days,
Eumenes was produced to the consideration of the people, as the person she most
desired to affect, which without any great opposition was approved of in the
general, as being a man who had not only borne a long affection to the
Princess, but upon all occasions had demonstrated a sufficient courage and
judgment, worthy of any employment: As in this manner he was created both
Prince and Governor at the same time, so I left the Island of Cyprus,
providing not only for the Nuptials of the young couple, but for the Funerals
of the old Duke: whilst my occasions and passions carried me after the Queen
Hyacinthia into Syria, being thither retired as I heard after the death of
Philostros, who during his life had absolutely obstructed her passage and
intention: where being no sooner arrived, but as the world had bin turned into
nothing but wonders, I found also Orsames dead, and his Queen newly brought
abed of two sons, which afforded the Kingdom of Syria an equal share both of
joy and sorrow: This notwithstanding so far protracted my designs, that as I
had but little convenience to present the State of our Lydian affairs to
Hyacinthia with all the particulars concerning the Princess Clorias fortunes,
so had she less hope her self to determine of any thing speedily, in regard
of the unsettlement of businesses and governments in Syria, by reason of those
new changes that had so lately happened: so that for some time I was constrained
to quit the City of Damascus, and to retire my self to a more private place of
habitation, finding at Court how unwilling they were to entertain any occasion
of charge and expense; the rather for that Prince Arethusius the Kings eldest
son, was only to be furnished out of his mothers pension and allowance: but
long I had not continued in my voluntary retirement, but sudden intelligence
was brought to Court, not only of the general revolt of the Senate of Lydias
Army from their service, but also that it was reported they had taken King
Euarchus out of Prison into the Soldiers protection: as this gave all our
thoughts, fresh hopes of something speedily to be acted for his good and
restoration, so am I at present sent to him with Letters from the Queen, though
to what effectual purpose I cannot tell, for that I find not only her self,
but the whole State of Syria to be extremely addicted to the Myssian interest,
which as I suppose the Army will never willingly consent unto, in regard they
have already so publicly and violently declared to the contrary; having made
it the chief occasion of the quarrel between them and the Senate, which in
effect is all I can say either of my journey or employment: Then turning
himself to the Priest he told him, that he must entreat his company to Court:
and this presently carried them all three to supper.

When they had ended, the Priest told Narcissus, that although he feared his
occasions would constrain him for the present to take a journey to Court,
whereby to have the happiness again to see his old master the King, and so by
consequence not to be longer in a capacity, to do him that farther service in
his own house he desired, yet he hoped they should have the honor of his
company along with them, where he durst undertake his reception should be
equal with either of theirs, in those contents they should receive by so
fortunate an occasion.

Narcissus after he had thanked him, as well for his past favors as his
present offers, assured him that as he could not but be extremely joyful at
the opportunity he should have by that voyage, again to behold his great
master in some probability of being restored to his ancient right and dignity,
so did he wish him unfainedly to believe, that notwithstanding he could most
willingly participate of his good luck in personally accompanying them to
Court, whereby to be an eye witness of their entertainments, yet such were his
pressing occasions (especially in regard of those accidents that had lately
happened in the Island of Cyprus) that he was obliged to make what have he could
possible into his own Country, where notwithstanding he should study what
requitals he should be any way able to perform in lieu of those civillities he
had received by his means in the Kingdom of Lydia: These complements with
other discourses continued them in communication, until the time of the night
caused them all to retire into their several lodgings: and the rather was the
have more necessary, for that the Priest was to make some convenient
preparation for the next days journey.

When Narcissus was come into his chamber, and being there only accompanied by
his folitary thoughts, instead of sleep he fell upon these melancholy
considerations: First it came into his mind, that he had not alone lost a
dear and loving father, whose wisdom would have been a continual support
unto him in all his difficult affairs, but by that unreparable loss, he was
also in danger to be deprived of the best part of his esteemed hereditary
honor, and command, by the marriage of his sister with Eumenes, fince in his
room he was elected chief governor of the Country, in regard of the
general opinion was amongst the people of his death: yet again
notwithstanding this possession, he had some hopes by the affection of the
Inhabitants to be restored to his right, when they should by his personal
appearance, be made fully acquainted with the mistake of his death without
either blood or trouble, since as he doubted not of the natural affection of
his sister Eretheria, so would he not suspect the noble disposition of Eumenes:
but when he reflected upon the luster and sweetness of Crowns and Dignities,
being once enjoyed either by ambitious and high spirits, he conceived there
might be more difficulty in the attempt then ordinary, and so consequently an
occasion given of contention and slaughter, not possible to be ended between
them without destruction to one or other: besides he doubted for the present
which seemed most to trouble him, that these sudden changes, might so far
alienate the thoughts and affections of the Princess Cloria from his
parsicular, that she might be induced in the interim, to entertain the
addresses of Cassianus, that were most violently as he knew proposed to her
choice by the powerful Senate of Lydia; And as he imagined would be the sooner
entertained, in regard of the King her fathers present necessities, who by that
means might hope the easier to come to the possession of his rights,
especially when all opportunities were afforded, either for courtships or
solicitation; and probably could not long be resisted, by reason of her
constrained condition, that obliged her without prevention, to endure all
assaults and affronts to that purpose, that should from time to time be
attempted upon her person: As these last considerations most strugled inwardly
with his uncertain thoughts, not knowing well whether he should leave Lydia or
not, so did he begin to think, that there being no Army in the Field that was
in action, and not knowing how to be admitted to Clorias presence, it would be
too little purpose longer to continue in the Kingdom; and therefore resolved
presently to go for Cyprus; where he seemed not to doubt, but that the people
(if not Eumenes himself) finding him alive contrary to their expectation,
would soon be persuaded to reason in his behalf: And to this purpose being
settled in his fathers command, he should be not only able to bring assistance
to King Euarchus occafions, but also contribute much to his dangers
releasement; whereas the contrary would both confirm the opinion of his being
dead, and in some sort accuse himself of too much sloth in his own nature,
for not appearing activer in those concernments of his own that belonged so
exceedingly to his honor and welfare: with these resolutions he quickly fell
asleep.

In the morning the old Priest came to Narcissus to take his leave with these
complements, that as he had hitherto been ashamed, that his own disability to
render him those services due to his worth, had made him want he feared such
entertainment as was fitting in his poor habitation, and much more since he
was now forced to leave him by the accidental journey, he was constrained to
make to Court in the company of Creses, so if he pleased to design any longer
stay in the Kingdom of Lydia, he should take it for some part of satisfaction
to his fortunes, that he would resolve to make use of his house in his absence,
a place should be always ready he assured him, to afford him the best
convenience it was able for his aboade: which he refusing with the like
complements, they both presently descended into the Hall, where they found
Creses ready prepared to take horse: After they had eat a bit or two, and
performed some other few ceremonies belonging to their departure, they quickly
mounted their Steads.

The Priest and Creses had not traveled many Furlongs together, ere they met
with a most even and direct path way; and that commodity as it should seem
invited them both to a new discourse, since the Priest seemed extremely
unsatisfied as yet, why the State of Syria, and much more the Queen Hyacinthia,
should be so unwilling to entertain a correspondency with the Army, that had
delivered the person of Euarchus out of Prison, though passionately desirous to
retain an interest with the Myssians, that had apparently betrayed him
thither, according to the common opinion almost of all Asia.

Father, said Creses, as I have already made unto you a relation of my voyage
into Cyprus, with some part of my proceedings in Syria, so having for the
present so fair an opportunity, I shall endeavor to let you know my thoughts,
in many other particulars that I have not yet mentioned: To this purpose you
must understand, that however the people of the Island of Crete, seem to
profess the same worship of the gods with the State of Syria, yet cannot they
obtain the free exercise of their religion, either from King Euarchus or his
Queen Hyacinthia: though Euarchus by the Court of Syria has been pressed not
only to sign all the chief articles of the Myssians, but also even to
subscribe to their tenants in matter of Doctrine, notwithstanding they be
altogether destructive to Kingly rule or the religion of Syria: As this gives
me not so much encouragement in my journey as I could wish, in regard the
Soldiers will not be willing to allow of any interest but their own, toward
the placing of the King again in his Throne, so the Commissioners of the
Myssians as I hear, are extremely busy about the Kings person, to the no
small coffeehouse of the army, that has him now under their jurisdiction:
the Queen when I parted from her at Damascrs gave me express order, that
however I might complement with the Soldiers, and draw from them all the
advantages that possibly I could, tending to her husbands service, yet I must
be sure as she told me in the first place, to possess the Myssians with an
opinion, that Euarchus chief trust must still rest in their fidelities and
assistance, though he be forced for the present to comply with the Army, that
delivered him out of the hands of the Senate: but here I make no doubt but you
will ask me why the State of Syria, much less our Queen Hyacinthia, should be
so wedded to the Myssians particular? when as probably they can never be
brought, to be hearty in the Kings affairs, since not only in the beginning of
these times they opposed his authority, with all the craft and violence they
could possibly use, but at last as I may say delivered him betrayed and bound
hand and foot, into the hands of those that were esteemed by himself his
greatest enemies, when as he had chosen for his protection, rather the Myssian
Army then the Senate of Lydia: And this expression of ill nature and treachery,
was only to obtain the payment of a small sum of money, not to be valewed in
regard of a Kings ransom: so that I say it may be supposed, they have some
other hidden mystery in their thoughts against his prosperity, which perhaps
the State of Syria will never be able sufficiently to understand, whilst it be
too late to repair the Kings losses only procured by those people: for it is
well known, during the time they gave Euarchus the best hopes concerning their
affections and fidelity, they were then by their false instruments, contracting
with the Senate for his speedy imprisonment; a plain demonstration of their
harsh and cruel intentions toward his particular; for that when they most
betrayed him, they professed themselves then his faithfullest servants; as it
were smothering him in a bed of roses, and killing him with deceitful
language: whereas of the other side, these Soldiers that have not only the
Kings person, but his authority under their jurisdiction; and so by consequence
may either shorten his life or preserve his dignity, notwithstanding they have
heretofore always declared themselves mortal enemies to his interest, and
proceedings, as never having any dependency upon the Court or his affairs, yet
now appear to the outward view of the world, to be his greatest friends,
either being converted and altered in their opinions, or more compassionate and
just in their dispositions: which certainly cannot but extremely augment the
Kings obligations, if they perform any thing remarkable according to their
professions; but as I will not trouble you with my thoughts, what may be the
issue of their intentions or actions, so must I a little discourse unto you,
what may be the suppositions of the Syrian State, that seems so much to
countenance the Myssians before the Soldiers; and to say the plain truth do
more favor them then any other people, that have seemed most affectionate
toward the Kings interest.

First you may suppose, that they think the Myssians, not only in regard that
most of the gentry and Nobility, have either command or employment in the Army
or Wars of Syria, but the common people and inferior sort, have such a
dependency upon the Nation, by reason of certain privileges granted them time
out of mind, by way of a free Trade and commerce amongst them, that it is
unpossible for them to quit their interest, for any other benefit that can be
proposed to their consideration: And the rather for that the Court maintains
always some Ambassador or Agent in their Country, both to direct their
actions and designs, and to inform the State upon all occasions of their
proceedings; which joined with the large pentions are bestowed amongst their
rulers, and other eminent persons of Myssia, will prove as they believe
necessary ties and obligations to retain their fidelities constant to the
Syrian ends; And so consequently can they never attempt the destroying or
lessening of Monarchy, but as they shall direct and approve of: besides most of
the factions now prevailing against Euarchus authority in Myssia, are composed
either of Lords or Priests, who are most commonly not so envious to royalty (or
at leastwise as they may believe more to be persuaded by reason) then
extravagant people, that have learned no rules necessary to government and
order, by any manner of fitting education; wherefore not so much to be feared
in their courses and prevailing jurisdiction, if they should be suffered
something too much to prosper in either proceedings against their King:
Secondly, it cannot be doubted, but that Monarchy in the general, is a great
deal more conducing to the commodity of the Myssians, then a common
government, either in Lydia or Myssia; and therefore not probable they should
join in such a strict amity with the Senate, as absolutely to destroy the
prerogative, and Kingly jurisdiction of Euarchus, since by that conclusion,
they would neither be able to temper their own factions at home, amongst the
Nobility and persons of greatest quality, nor have any hope to receive benefit
from other Princes abroad in their occasions: and whereas many may be persuaded
to believe, that by agreeing in those designs, for the absolute overthrowing
of Monarchy in Lydia, they might in time come to be equal sharers in the
government of both Kingdoms; and so consequently participate alike in the
profit and gain, being the chief (if not the only) thing their covetous
dispositions look after, such thoughts are mere fancies and chymeras: for
certainly the Senate understanding well the poorness of the Country of Myssia,
and not being ignorant of the secret intentions of the people, withal how
insulting and encroaching they are in their natures; will be sure to take
order, they shall have no more interest in the affairs of Lydia, then is
entirely necessary for their own service and commodity: so that when the
Myssians shall find their aims to fail in these particulars, it is to be
imagined that they will not only be persuaded, upon the least endeavor of the
State of Syria, to fall off from the Lydian faction, but even to make a War
with that Nation it self, for the establishing again of their King in his
ancient glory and command; and to that effect adhere either to Syria or any
other Nation that may assist them in those proceedings: only this doubt in
some sort may be made, that Argilius and Lycius, who so unworthily have
betrayed the Kings person for a sum of money, will never by their good wills
trust themselves any more under his power, for fear of revenge answerable to
their deserts; And they being the most principal men of the Country, it is to
be suspected, they will have so great power and influence, over the actions and
determinations of the rest of the Inhabitans in the general, that they can
never be brought in any kind to own the Kings interest to purpose,
notwithstanding all the labor and industry of the Kingdom of Syria: But to
this I shall only make this answer, that however these people prevailed in the
Myssian Army for the selling of the Kings person, against the thoughts and
wills of many, yet that very action of theirs, has procured them since so much
hatred in their own Country, that it may very probably be believed by the State
of Syria, there must of necessity arise daily new factions amongst them,
neither want they intelligence at the present, that assures them that an Army
will suddenly march into Lydia from Myssia, in King Euarchus behalf: which
advertizement I suppose is sent, them by their Ambassador there remaining:
Last of all I may add that the Court of Syria may imagine, the Soldiers who
have now the King in their possession, having no other relation but to their
own wills and uncertain principles, will prove from time to time as inconstant
in their resolutions, as they have been heretofore desperate in their fortunes,
and be rather in the general inclinable to affect equality, then continue long
contented to be governed by Kingly authority, or to say the plain truth
willing to be under any jurisdiction whatsoever; witness their falling off
from their command both under the Senate and their old General: besides it is
esteemed a maxim among their tenants, to have scarce dependency upon any
power, neither in those things that belong to the gods worship, or concerning
other their humane actions, pretending by such constraint, an absolute freedom
cannot be enjoyed, either in mind or body; so that however the King may seem a
little to revive by their proceedings, yet I can assure you in Syria, there is
a great doubt made of the reality of their actions: but whether these opinions
be grounded, either upon the persuasions of the Myssians, or upon other more
solid though secret reasons, I will not take upon me at present to determine,
but rather shall expect, both with hope and patience the issue, in the interim
apply my self to my direction and commission, as well in keeping a
correspondency with the Soldiers as with the Myssians: by this time again the
way began to be something uneven, so that they could not well prosecute any
farther discourse.

At night they took up their lodging; not above half a days journey where
the King remained, and not much farther distant from the City of Sardis, where
encountering with a jovial companion master of the house, as appearing also
faithful to Euarchus in his intentions, after they had accommodated themselves
to their minds in their chambers, they desired their host with an equal
indifference to let them understand, as well the news that concerned the
proceedings of the Senate, as that which belonged more properly to the Army,
since as they said, they could not choose, but be of a nature something more
remarkable then ordinary, in regard of the late transactions of both parties,
which seemed at present to put most of the Kingdom to a kind of a vast
consideration concerning the issue: the rather were they curious of this
information, the better thereby to taste the inclinations of the people.

Truly gentlemen, said the Host, as I must not take upon me the understanding
of either of their proceedings and determinations, when as perhaps they are not
very well acquainted with their own intentions themselves, so shall I to supply
that defect inform you if you please, of those discourses that have lately
passed in the Senate, concerning the Kings government, notwithstanding the
Soldiers have him personally at the present under their jurisdiction; who to
say the plain truth, use him with that civility and respect, that it gives his
friends more then ordinary hopes, of his speedy restoration again to the
honor of his Crowns and Dignity; however the gods only know what the issue of
their determinations may be: some of the Senate would have no King at all,
pretending that it would be too miserable a condition for all sorts of people,
to be Subject both in their persons and estates to an entire Monarch, not
suffering them so much as to ask a reason concerning any thing that should be
done amiss, although their purses and pains were forced, upon all occasions
to pay for the honor, and the pride belonging to the dignity: whereas a common
government as they say, gives a certain kind of encouragement pleasing, in
some kind or other to all sorts of people, as having an appropriated share in
every action, that concerned the good or ill of the Commonwealth: others again
of a contrary spirit pretended, they are afraid, that if the government should
be absolutely changed to a popular State, though it might seem in outward
appearance, to have more freedom, it could not nevertheless but be of less
security, in that it would be always Subject to faction and confusion, in
regard of the inconstancy of dispositions, and therefore are rather of opinion,
that the government remain in the same nature as it does, with some necessary
restrictions to their King: A third sort made some doubt, how to find out
ways to limite a Monarch in any kind, by what laws soever could be
established to that purpose, it being almost impossible to take from a Prince
altogether the sword of Justice and power, and yet suffer him still to remain
in the condition of a governor; which in effect would be no other, then a
common government varnished over, with a glorious Title to no effect, leaving
the whole as subject to faction and confusion, as if there were no King at all;
in that he should want the authority, although he were honored with the name
necessary to that purpose: there were others that suddenly started up in the
Senate House, who imagined they had thought upon a way, to remedy all
inconveniences; which was to have only a King by election, either of Euarchus
family or some other: but the proposition was quickly answered with these
doubts: that if the Prince intended, should be elected out of the same blood,
if not according to the direct line of succession, it would endanger a new
slaughter and faction, through the whole Kingdom, by reason of several
ambitious interests; of the other side, if he were absolutely chosen out of
another family, as no doubt but there would be many opposers, in the very
election it self, so not possible to have any, of an extraction illustrious
enough, to warrant his kindred from being a burden to the Commonwealth in
their maintenance and support; which probably would prove a sufficient
inconvenience to the people; for that oftentimes justice would be sold, and
other oppressions committed, only to supply a needy and indigent family: in
conclusion, however many seemed willing again to restore Euarchus, and his
posterity to their ancient rights and dignity, yet fearing in regard of their
own proceedings, that they might be strictly called in question for their past
actians, they utterly desisted from that resolution: and notwithstanding these
several and violent discourses, for that time they settled upon no
determination whatsoever; only at last they ordered, the government should
remain as it was at present in the Senates power, though bearing still the
name of Euarchus, until farther confideration: I must tell you, as these were
the manner of disputations in the Councels at Sardis, both before and since the
revolt of the Army, so now by their favors as we suppose, they must ask leave
of the Soldiers, before they settle either a government in themselves, or take
it away from others; And the rather am I induced to this belief, for that the
common people, appear not yet much scandalized at the late revolt; but of the
contrary, as it is thought, would be extremely satisfied with the Soldiers
proceedings, if they should speedily again turn the stream into its right
course; however in that I shall say the least that may be, until I be more
instructed in the constitution of the world: with these words he ended his
discourse, and presently took his leave; pretending some other company in his
house, needed also another part of his entertainment.

This information of the Host, gave Creses and the Priest occasion, to fall
into a more serious disputation, concerning the nature and property of Monarchy
and other governments, according to diverse opinions and judgments, with the
several benefits and inconveniences belonging to them: The Priest would needs
take upon him the defense of the Kingly part; whilst Creses was to be content
with the more inferior degree: both notwithstanding grounding their
discourses, from the hopes they had, that the Soldiers would shortly again
restore Euarchus to his Crown and government: The Priest first began in this
manner:

As Monarchy in the general, said he, has been held by writers, to be the
best and most absolute way of government, so ought it as well be granted, that
a Prince by descent and inheritance, is the freest of all others from burden
and inconvenience to the people; since the making up of new families upon every
exchange, and the many dangerous factions would arise by reason of elections,
would at one time or other, either hazard or ruin the Commonwealth; for that
all ambitions, could never be suppressed totally in every person, with the only
consideration of the common safety: but that I may more particularly make good
my argument, I shall endeavor from certain principles of Divinity, nature,
and institution, to prove my affirmation and opinion: In the first place
according to the example of the divine providence, there is but one God that
made and now rules the heavens, since if there were more, none could be
absolute, much less omnipotent in any kind, and so consequently the
government, should still be subject to variation, both in part and in the
whole; for as diverse persons must have several wills, so that of necessity,
would confound commands and distract obedience, whereby executions, could not
choose but be protracted to the rending of all actions and endeavors, of no
considerable force and validity to the convenient and orderly rule of the
world: wherefore we see, subordinate offices are appointed in every degree, by
this great and all powerful God; every distinct orb being so involved one
within another, until they all become governed by the first motion, only to
avoid equality and confusion: so that we may easily perceive by that decorum,
that there is an entire necessity of one governor: As for example, there is
but one Sun that governes the day, as another light shines in the night,
neither of which being accompanied with any of equal authority or influence;
as it were both pretending, to a certain manner of absolute Monarchy in their
several kinds of motion and luster: in the second place, by the very rules of
nature we have experience, that some one in every species pretends above the
rest to dominion and jurisdiction: as for the purpose, the industrious and
painful Commonwealth of the Bees, have always one to go before them, whose
person and voice they only obey and follow, with a seeming care and
extraordinary obedience: The silly Ants in like manner, have their Prince
amongst them, who seems by his absolute authority, only to govern and direct
their labors, tending to unity and benefit in their small and innocent
Commonweal'h: so that these being creatures no way given to exorbitancy of will
as men are, if it be necessary for them to have but one governor, much more
for us who are given in a manner to nothing but malice and pride, whereby to be
kept in order and regulated in our dispositions; which certainly cannot long
be without the authority of some single power, that must not be equalled or
contracted by any other: we see if two strange Bulls be but turned loose
together in any pasture, their contention one with another never ends, whilst
one of the two have gained the absolute mastery over the other: with what
extraordinary hatred and malice will two little Cocks of the game, persecute
one another in blood and wounds, until the one of them have obtained the
victory by the others death and ruin? Ney example me if you can, any two Males
of any generous kind whatsoever, that will endure the others society, without
an absolute subjection to his power and courage; as it were never but striving
till one have procured the entire jurisdiction of the place; as if nature by no
means could admit of an equality in government; whereas of the contrary, the
Females, as being not at all ordained for rule and command, are seemingly
contented with the society, and company of their fellows: which shows in my
opinion a certain kind of necessity in all governments of one only Monarch,
not only to avoid faction and confusion, but to unite desires and industry,
toward the welfare and benefit of any Commonwealth; since without such a
known power and command, it is almost impossible, to bridle and keep in order
at all times, the unruly fancies and exorbitant desires of mankind: whose very
nature or inclination, does swell as it were with nothing but appetites of
contention: Lastly concerning the very institution of governments upon earth:
the first certainly was Monarchy; for as in the beginning a man in his own
private family, appeared to be the only absolute Prince to be obeyed, so
dominions and Kingdoms, became no other way established in the infancy of the
world, but by the uniting together of several households, either by accident or
conquest; And though sometimes people merely out of necessity, to keep
themselves the better in peace and quietness, were forced to choose and form
commonwealths, yet we scarce read of any juridiction to be enterteined (at
leastwise to be continued for any considerable space) but where one single
power chiefly if not absolutely commanded over the whole; as if the multitude
by the very light of nature, being led thereunto by the mere dictates of
reason, without any manner of science or experience, were constrained to
believe, that no other government could be safe and lasting; however their
Lords not seldom proved the cruellest Tyrants could be imagined: as I cannot
deny, but by reason of the exorbitancy of pernicious and wicked Princes, a
State has been changed from a private to a popular Commonwealth or
government; yet scarce did I ever hear of any, but that both began and ended
in Kingly authority; as being still by some accident or other, constrained to
that election or conversion, either in absolute power, or mixed representation,
as if some kind of necessity, required such an establishment to render it
lasting, and convenient to the people.

Nevertheless said Creses, it is a most miserable condition for the people, to
be in a continual subjection, under the power and command of either an
impotent or an exorbitant Prince; for though he should know what were best to
be done, yet his perverse nature and disposition, would not suffer him to put
it in execution. And if he knew not how to govern, he becomes led by the pride
and covetousness of others: Again, put the case government might fall into the
hands of a mad man or a fool, what remedy then could be expected, whereby the
people might in any kind have the least hope of redress? since by the Laws
and rules of inheritance, he were to continue still without prevention and
obstacle; which of necessity sometime or other would happen; and consequently
cast the government into the hands of such as he should choose, that probably
were not far from his own temper in any thing: in like manner, it must be the
same during the time of the Princes infancy, being by that means rendered
altogether incapable either of governing himself or others.

It Is true answered the Priest, the misfortune to a Kingdom is not small when
either of these happen: but however as no private interest can be so destroying
as general confusion, so can it not be but much safer for a Commonwealth, to
be under the jurisdiction of one vicious or impotent Prince (who it is likely
will be glutted by his excesses, or may be assisted in his Councels) then for
it to be wholly governed by many disagreeing heads, and factious dispositions,
that direct several ways in their intentions and consultations, which of
necessity must distract all profitable determinations, and at the best cannot
but protract, if not absolutely hinder those executions tending to peace and
prosperity; being scarce to be avoided in a common government, where opinions
and interests are several in the rulers: besides, it is well known that in
such Councels, secrets of the most highest nature (for that they are committed
to many) are subject to be revealed if not betrayed.

But according to my sense and belief said Creses, such a Magistracy might be
created out of the whole, that when good and necessary fundamental Laws were
agreed upon, might easily govern with secrecy and moderation to the benefit of
the people, who would be pleased sufficiently, in having the name of the
election of such Ministers.

If you mean said the Priest, that this jurisdiction should be eternal, it
were a great deal worse and more dangerous in matters of Tyranny and
injustice, then to be under one single Pritce, by inheritance, since he might
dye, and by that means, his successor might again bring ease and remedy, but
the other assembly being once in the greater part corrupted, it were unpossible
ever to expect any redress at all; for that those that should happen to
succeed, would come to their places but one by one, and consequently could not
have voices in number sufficient to countervaile the opinions of the rest,
remaining in the Council or Magistracy: besides if any should have received
injury, or endured oppression by the casting voices of the whole assembly, to
whom should he fly for remedy and redress? since every one singly would put
off the blame from himself; pretending not to have authority and power
sufficient, without the generality of that congregation, to repair the injured
person; which seldom or never could be procured: whereas being wronged or
oppressed by a Prince, or any of his Officers or Ministers of State, it would
be no great difficulty, to make the particular complaint understood at one time
or another to himself; And more facile it would be a great deal, for the
Monarch or governor speedily to afford the remedy, either in that, that
concerned his own person, or belonging to any of his Commissioners; for else he
should be forced to take upon him the blame, before the face of all the world;
whereas the others actions, (that is to say concerning the particular) would be
so involved in the dark, that it were almost impossible to make it appear
where the fault lay but in the general assembly; who without an infinite
labor could not be brought to understand, much less to redress the
grievance: And if you mean this magistracy or supreme authority, should be
only temporary, and so consequently be made subject upon all occasions to the
election and questioning of the common people: what a world of inconveniences
would it bring? not only by continual factions and disorders, in the choosing
these new Magistrates, but in the very spite and heartburning, would be
occasioned thereby amongst the people, being carried on to this election, by a
certain conceived greatness in their own opinion, that might render their
rude ambitions extremely unsatisfied, if they should be at any time crossed in
their choice; with a thousand other inconveniences that I cannot mention.

Yet said Creses, alshough it should be granted, that in those particulars you
have mentioned, Monarchy were to be esteemed the most convenient government of
all others; however it cannot be denied, but that the common people are in that
slavery under such a jurisdiction, that they cannot possibly have hearts
sufficiently affectionately to render them entirely industrious, toward the
profit and good of the Commonwealth in the general, in regard that however
they toil and take pains in abundance, they can never attain to any places
of dignity or respect in the Kingdom, either to content their thoughts or
advance their esteem; whereas in a popular state, the meanest is in the same
capacity of preferment, as the highest borne person in he Country.

Although this be true said the Priest; yet the defect proceeds not from their
natural unhappiness, but from their disabillity or want of knowledge in
regard of their deficiency in education, which inconveniency and defect, they
will as well suffer in a popular government, as in a Kingly authority, since no
worthy person whatsoever is debarred from preferment in a Monarchy, if his
industry and parts can merit the honor and advancement; and although he should
in any kind miss of his expectation, yet it would not grieve him so much to
be under the jurisdiction of the Nobility, that are by birth and extraction
above his condition as to find himself much subordinate and inferior, to
those of his own rank and quallity: to be esteemed of all others most irksome
to humane nature: so that you see it is but mere fancy, that engenders these
considerations and opinions: besides there are other inconveniences and
omissions appertaining to a popular government; as for example, it seldom or
never preferres or rewards worthy persons according to their deserts and
merrits; when as for the most part smallest crimes and defects are punished by
most fearful and horrid severity; proceeding either from envy or jealousy,
which is the occasion that oftentimes, when Generals, Commanders, or States
men have procured a sufficient interest and esteem amongst all sorts of
people, whereby to be able to contend, doubting their own safeties from the
Magistracy, they enter presently into such rebellions that either turn the
Commonwealth into a Tyrannical Monarchy, or occasion at the best so much blood
and slaughter, that every Subject thereof has reason enough to fear his own
loss, if not general destruction; whereas a Prince being of so eminent a
condition himself, not to be equalled by any of what quallity soever, has no
cause to be envious or suspicious: again the Prince has a more near interest
in his Countries good then all his subjects besides by way of personal honor;
wherefore a greater benefit or loss attends him in every thing, that is acted,
since he creates not only the officer that commands or executes, but enjoyes
the profit or disprofit of the success, whereas the people in a Commonwealth
receive it but in the general, no one man being able to appropriate any
public action particularly to himself; which is a principal motive to enduce
the Prince to attend earnestly the prosperity of the government, because he may
be said truly to esteem it his own, which no other prison can do in what
constitution some ever, if there be others in equal authority with him; for to
join interests, will never take so much the fancy and opinion of the owners,
as those which are singly appertaining but to one only.

Well said Creses) although I see upon any terms you will needs have a
Monarchy, to be the best government, yet nevertheless I must not have a Prince
altogether unlimited, as it were threatening a kind of a fearful apprehension
of Tyranny to his people; by which means they would be hindered from
endeavoring industriously, either the common good or their private welfare:
but rather I should wish a king, in some sort bound by laws fundamental,
established by a lawdable constitution at the first; however not to be so
strictly chayned up, that he were left no any power or prerogative at all,
without his Subjects leave, or be so let loose to his own will and pleasure,
that he might injure, and oppress his people as he list: that is to say, to
have the government to enjoy such a mixture in the whole, that the Subjects
might not be over-bold, to approach his presence without an awful reverence,
or he to be puffed up with a vain opinion (by reason of his dignity) that the
Kingdom or commonwealth was bestowed upon his condition, more for his own use
then the good of his people, nor I neither said the Priest: whereupon being
called away to supper they suddenly broake off the rest of their discourse.

The next day about noone they arrived at Court, or rather was it to be called
a camp, since the Soldiers seemed to bear all the sway, notwithstanding
others had a civil liberty allowed them, to be admitted upon every occasion
needful into the Kings presence.

When Euarchus was informed not only of their arrival, but that Creses had
brought him letters out of Syria from the Queen, he with a great deal of
passion sent presently for them into his presence: upon their entrance they
found him seated in a kind of a confined Majesty, Farezius being on his right
hand not far from his person, and a little below him stood one Hercrombrotus
his Lieutenant General, a man that seemed to carry not only design, but
policy in his countenance: about them, were placed many common soldiers in the
nature of a guard; however expressing more then ordinary freedom both in their
looks and demeanor: Creses after he had performed his wonted reverencies,
approached the King with a humility answerable to his Titles, though not his
condition; presenting him with the Queens letters, which Euarchus hastily
taking out of his hands read them with tears in his eyes, and then asked him
sundry questions both of his wife and son Prince Arethusius; wishing withal he
might once more have the happiness to enjoy their company in Lydia: whereunto
Creses soon replied, that he did not doubt but that the gods ere long, would to
that purpose be favorable to his pious intentions: Truly said the King turning
at the same time to Farezius, this brave commander, does give me more then
probable hopes to this effect: but Farezius made him no other answer, then by a
kind of humble bending of his body, seemed to intimate a willingness in any
thing to comply with his desires.

Having for some time thus discoursed together in public, the King (also
taking notice of the old Priest with more then ordinary affection) he led
Creses into an out window in the same room, that was sheltred from the view of
the common people, by large Curtains that reached to the ground, where after
they had continued for the space of an hour in private conference, the King
calling unto him Farezius used this language, with such a look, as might
procure compassion from the cruellest Tyrant in the world.

Farezius said he, as I have sufficient experience of your civilities, since it
was my good fortune to be absolutely under your jurisdiction, so cannot I but
presume upon the continuance of these courtesies, finding your nature to be both
noble and constant: wherefore to this purpose I would have you know, that it is
not alone my own desire at this present, to have some comfort and consolation
by the sight and conversation of my children, kept so long from my possession
by the power of the Senate sitting at Sardis, but also have received
conjurations by these Letters from my wife remaining in Syria, if it be
possible so far to procure my own information concerning their particulars,
that I may give her a true account both of their comportment and education,
whereby the better to satisfy her motherly affection, and natural
inclination: when the King had ended this supplication, so far (as I may say)
beneath his dignity, though consonant in some sort to his condition, Farezius
after a short pause returned him this answer.

Although I must confess your Majesty's desires, are grounded upon all the
principles both of nature and morallity, yet you must be pleased likewise to
know, that at present I find my own power and interest so far weakened in
Sardis, by the prevailing faction of the Myssians, that I dare not be over
consident of any request I shall make in your behalf; especially for that I am
neither assured to continue still the Senates General, or can procure those
Senators to be punished that with so much violence, exclaim howerly at that
attempt of ours concerning your releasement: but nevertheless if you please
that Creses now in communication with you, may be employed as a messenger to
demand these conditions, I shall procure him as large a commisson as possibly I
can from the whole Army to that effect, and being denied by the Senate any of
our just desires, we may add your authority to the willingness of the
Soldiers to force them from the opposers: as these motions were quickly
embraced by the Kings apprehension and consent with many thankful expressions,
so Creses wanted neither courage nor loyalty to take upon him the execution to
the best advantage both for Euarchus service and the armies profit.

When Creses arrived at Sardis, and had with some eloquence and more judgment
delivered his message, being again retired for about half an hours space, he
received these answers to every particular from the Senate: first it was told
him that whereas it was desired, the Kings children might not only perform
their natural duty to their father by a speedy visit, but might also for some
considerable time remain in his company and conversation (however they
conceived it against the rules of State policy to have any single person
pleasured before the public good) yet that Farezius should see how much they
valued his request, the Senate had determined the children might make a journey
to that effect, upon assurance given for their safe return after some few
days of salvation: again whereas the General seemed to desire a continuation
of his power and command under the Senates authority, they not only granted him
his own demand, but wished Creses to assure Farezius, that as they had never
any intention to out him of his office, contrary to his own consent, so would
they ever be most sensible of his brave and gallant services: but for the
proposition that concerned the accusation of some of their fellow Senators,
they conceived it a derogation to the high places they held in the
Commonwealth, to have them so much as suspected, much less to suffer them
brought as guilty Malefactors before another Tribunal then their own, being
persons (as they said) whom they had found most true and faithful to the
common interest: Nevertheless they condescendedby way of persuasion, to cause
them voluntarily to leave the Kingdom for some small time, whereby the better
to allay the rage and discontents of the Soldiers, until they could be fully
satisfied in their endeavors and fidelities; these answers did but in part
give content to Creses expectation; especially for that the Senate seemed, not
only as he conceived, to put on a kind of more then ordinary insolency in
their demeanors, but withal did not so much as take any notice at all of
Euarchus dignity, or that they intended any of those respects for his sake.

Though Creses with a great deal of indignation had attended their
deliberations, yet he was content with some humility, to beg leave to visit the
Princess, which being obtained, he found her seated in a melancholy room,
that had no more light bestowed upon it, then what was merely necessary, for
the performance of those services due to her condition, her person being shut
up in a black Couch, so obscured with diverse Curtains, that scarce could her
rare beauty be otherwise discovered, then as the fair Moon, shaddowed by too
many black clouds; however, now and then as the Princess moved, there
appeared bright and gentile rays of those perfections, which could not be
altogether hid; in this manner being admitted to kiss her white hand, with
many sighs, and not a few tears, she asked of her fathers health, with some
other circumstances; but the uncompassionate guard would not suffer her to be
so punctual in her questions as she desired, until at last Creses was
separated again from her presence by those watchful spies, that had the
nearest custody of her person, who belike as guilty men, feared Treason in
their very looks, since no words were uttered but what they understood; so
that he was conducted to the Castle gate only by Roxana's ample complements,
instead of her Mistresses more full expressions.

But however the Senate had made these large promises during Creses his
presence; yet afterward upon other considerations, they not only denied the
Princess Cloria access to her father, being unwilling belike to hazard so
precious a Jewel out of their custody, but those Senators accused of Treason,
with the City of Sardis assistance, within a very few days beset the Senate
house with multitudes of their faction, not only denying to stand to the
former Orders of giving Farezius possession of the Castle of the Town; but also
professing, not to consent to their own banishment, alleging that the General
rather deserved to be punished as a Traitor; for having made so unjust and
insolent a demand, then themselves to be judged for any crime, and were not
only liberal in their language, but caused the Senate to disannul their
former Decrees.

The news of this enraged multitude was quickly brought unto the knowledge of
the whole Army, and so consequently to Farezins, who after he had for some
hours consulted with the rest of the Officers, resolved to march toward the
Walls of Sardis; where after a short siege, and no great slaughter, the proud
Inhabitants yielded absolutely to his mercy, whilst the chief Magistrates of
the City, issued out to give him friendly entertainment, finding he had the
greater party in the Town. In this manner, with a most magnificent Triumph,
they brought him to take possession of that command, that before with some
obstinacy they had refused, and afterward most ceremoniously conducted him to
the very Senate, in which place he was received with new honors.

Cloria having notice given her of the Generals intention, to visit her, began
to consider with what reception she should entertain his presence, since he
appeared to her thoughts not only one, who had lately conquered the whole
Kingdom by his prosperity; but seemed at the present to graspe the very fate of
her Father, and therefore believed she was not to receive him in her accustomed
sad posture, least he might interpret it either a contempt of his power, or a
sorrow for his fortune; so that she commanded her Chamber to be adorned with
Hangings of green Velvet, belonging to the Kings Wardrope, imbrodered with
compartments of gold, wherein was wrought the several armories of her
ancestors of both sides, divided by certain colors of rich cloth of Tissue,
interwoven with such variety of beautiful flowers, that it seemed the Princess
had placed her self in a delicious Garden, to give Farezius the more
delightful welcome; which was increased by her own sweet countenance, seated
upon a bed of the same Livery: though the infide differed in invention, however
it exceeded in curiosity, wherein with artificial needlework, was designed the
story of Venus and Adonis with that lively art, that the blushing anger
appeared in the boys cheeks, at the lascivious carriage of the Queen of Love,
whilst in other places he seemed to have put on a smiling countenance, that he
had broke from her forcible imbracements: but that which was admirably
expressed in death it self, accompanied with a lively sorrow, was the amazed
grief of the Goddess, when she beheld her slaughtered Servant, lying in his own
blood, torn with the rude Tusks of the salvage Boor, and his dejected
followers, seemingly confounded at the object: Nor was it little less
pitiful, to behold his poor Dogs here and there dispersed, as if also they
apprehended their own loss, by their Masters destruction. Over the Chimney was
a large Picture of most excellent workmanship, wherein was set forth the
banishment of proud Tarquin, by his enraged Subjects.

As soon as Farezius entered the room, he pawsed a while (being surprised with
an entire amazement) before he approached the Princess, as if he apprehended
some fear of sacrilege in attempting such an appearing deity; but being
invited by a gentle smile, that afforded not only a greater encouragement to
him, but added new grace, to her own beauty, he advanced with slow steps to
perform those reverences due to her dignity, which at last brought him to that
distance, that gave her convenience to ask him concerning her Fathers State;
in which demand she put on such a look, that showed she desired something
(though in words she begged nothing) that easily lay within his power to grant.
But the Gods seemed too cruel to make her a mendicant, whose perfections
deserved rather to have sufficient authority to command all hearts: However,
the General, as if at the present he understood little else but admiration,
for a long time answered not her questions, which gave occasion to Cloria again
to redouble her passion, with other interrogations upon the same subject; so
that Farezius at last breaking through his amazement, told her that he was in
as prosperous a condition, as the unfortunate affairs of the Commonweal
would permit, wherein he had employed his best service with all loyalty.

This answer scarce gave satisfaction to the Princess, since she conceived
Farezius had designed his whole endeavors for the present establishment of the
King in his ancient dignity; and therefore turned away from his sight with a
few gentle tears in her fair eyes; which being perceived by the General, he
humbly besought her to put off all sadness from her heart, for that he did not
doubt, but prosperity would succeed to her Father, according to his merit, and
her own wishes; however the issue as he said, must be attended yet with some
patience, since first the Soldiers were to be paid, who had spilt their blood
freely for the liberty of their Country; and the common people in like manner
must be satisfied, that had hitherto paid for the purchase. But what the sweet
Cloria would have answered to this discourse could not be known, since Farezius
occasions called him suddenly away from her presence into the City, not so much
to receive those Triumphs prepared for his further entertainment, as to procure
money for his Army.

Though the General continued some violence against the rich Town of Sardis in
imprisoning their chief Officers, as also in causing those Senators which he
had formerly accused to be sent into banishment, yet the affairs of Euarchus
became no whit more amended, since he was not only still detained as a
Prisoner, though with something a greater liberty and freedom, but the Senate
was permitted to press his patience, with those former propositions they had
sent by A^gyllius prejuditiall to his Crown, and in truth to the absolute
taking away of all his royal authority; which gave occasion of many discourses
amongst all sorts of people: some said that Farezius was in love with the
Princess Cloria, and by that means endeavored to force the Kings consent to
the marriage, whom he thought else could not be brought to yield to such
unequal Nuptials, much less would his Daughter be won to give up her person
to those disadvantages, who had been courted by all the great Princes of Asia,
with multitudes of glorious offers. Others again believed, the contrary faction
began to prevail, and had by some means either bribed Farezius to their party,
or outwitted his designs. Neither wanted there a third Company that imagined,
the people grew weary of their own sufferings, by reason of the Armies free
quarter, suspecting the Generals power and intentions only to make himself and
his Soldiers mighty, without looking upon their liberties and prosperity. For
a testimony of which as they supposed, the Nobility carried the chief sway in
the Senate House, contrary to their desires; however, certain Trybunes were
chosen in the Army, to prefer the rights of the ordinary Soldiers and common
people.

Whilst these thoughts, or rather fancies were tossed to and fro, almost in every
man's bosom; for that the whole affairs of the Kingdom were at a stand, and
Euarchus seemingly no nearer his enlargement then the first day he was
imprisoned; nay farther off in most opinions: Roxand one morning, according to
her custom (being troubled with more fears than ordinary; for that the
Princess her Mistress, appeared to her imagination, not a little concerned in
the business, since it was not improbable, some sparkles of love joined with
Farezius ambition, might be obstacles against the Kings prosperity) came to
entertain her self, within certain groves belonging to the Castle, which were
ordered into many delightful walks, that here and there crossed one another,
for the more convenience of the Company, that should frequent them for
recreation; where long she had not remained, disputing with her doubts and
hopes, but she met accidentally with Creses, who seemed to be there with the
same intention; they both appeared pleased at the encounter, whereupon Creses
quickly asked her after some short salutation, what she thought of the
strangeness of these times, so much changed contrary to both their
expectations, when as they looked rather for the King to have been royally
received in Sardis, then to have been still continued a prisoner, much less to
be pressed with new propositions, dishonorable to his person, and destructive
to his authority. Truly my Lord, answered Roxana, as my thoughts are in a Wood
about the actions of the times; so no doubt but some mystery waits upon the
issue, however I must confess my fears outgoe my faith, in any good they mean
the Kings power, since both the delays used, and much more these Articles
presented, are no good Omens to Euarchus prosperity; but take off rather that
glory which Farezius should have obtained to himself, if he had made the Kings
restoration to his rights, his first and chiefest work, since by his power and
authority, the rest of the necessary affairs of the Kingdom, would in all
probability have been better and surer settled, when they should have carried
with them both Law and Justice. You are in the right Madam said Creses,
wherefore if I may not be thought over tedious to your patience, I will
discourse to you some things which I have not only heard from the Kings own
mouth, when I last waited upon him; but other observations I took when I was in
Syria, by which you may make what conjectures you please. So taking the old
woman by the hand, he led her to a little banqueting house, not far off for
the more privacy; where, after they were both seated, he made unto her this
Relation.

Madam said he, first you must understand, that Euarchus the King is opposed in
his just government, or rather legal authority, by four factions, that for the
present seek to undermine one another, all having absolutely in their hearts,
cast off their obedience to the Kings Person and Prerogative. The Senate
strives with violence to maintain that jurisdiction, it has extorted from him;
as the Mysians endeavor out of a high covetousness, to be sharers in the
Government and Riches of this flourishing Kingdom. Neither wants the Army
pretentions, by reason of the service they have done in the late Wars, to
claim reward and subsistence. And last of all, the wealthy City of Sardis, in
regard it has for the most part furnished the Soldiers and Council with
money, requires to be made a free Town; that is to say, to depend upon no
subjection, but what Magistrates created by themselves shall prescribe. This
contention of all sides, is the chief occasion as it is thought, that makes
every thing at a stand, whilst in the mean time, the people seem to cry out,
being overburthened with oppressions and payments, which in the end certainly
cannot but turn to an absolute confusion, since there is scarce possibility
left to satisfy all parties: And thus much shall suffice for the common state
of things.

Now concerning the proceedings of Syria, which I have most from the Kings own
mouth, be pleased to understand, that when he was forced to assemble this great
Council, that has proved so unfortunate to his happiness, there was sent into
Lydia from Philostros an Ambassador, as Euarchus imagined for his consolation
and assistance, against the violent proceedings of his Senate; but presently
after his arrival, he was so far from complying with the Kings occasions, that
he kept a frequent correspondence, with those persons that seemed most to
oppose his authority; in so much, as the King was constrained at last with some
violence, not only to forbid him any longer attendance upon his person; but
earnestly to desire the State of Syria, to recall him home from all further
employment in Lydia, which settled the thoughts of Euarchus in some quietness,
whilst his own victories over his disobedient subjects, and the death both of
Philostros and Orssames, gave the King more then probable hopes of a final and
happy success in his enterprise, which was again in a very short time, to
reduce all Lydia under his lawful jurisdiction: but belike the State of Syria
following the same maxims of government, under the young son Orsames had left
behind him, contrary to all humane expectation, sent presently after the death
of Orsames another Ambassador to Euarchus, not only anew to invite him to
break the League which he still continued with the King of Egypt, but to
allow his contesting Senate to be a lawful and continued Council by his
absolute approbation; thinking belike, that it would better conduce to the
affairs of Syria, to have Euarchus power limited, then to suffer him to
remain in his high prerogative: but these demands the King most violently and
disdainfully refusing, the Ambassador not only with some seeming discontent
took his leave, but as it was thought invited the Myssians again into Lydia,
which has been as you know the reason of Euarchus overthrow, since the Senates
single power, had never probably prevailed against his fortune and success;
however, the business did not yet rest; for after the King had notwithstanding
strugled with infinite difficulties, to make good still his declining cause
(his son Arethusius Forces also being destroyed in many set Battles, who after
fled into Syria to the Queen his Mother) Euarchus was forced to put himself
under the protection of the Myssians Army; yet with so little benefit to his
affairs, that in a short time after he was delivered in person into his
enemies hands, who treated him with all manner of hardness, until the Army
took him violently from that jurisdiction: As this Madam, is the sad
particulars I can relate unto you, of the Kings misfortunes and captivity, so
may you very well make conjecture of the consequences.

Roxana after she had thanked him for his discourse, wherein as she said, he
had made her acquainted with some passages, she never understood before, yet he
should oblige her much more if he would be pleased to deliver his opinion, what
might be the intentions of the Syrian State, in thus desiring to lessen, or
rather to outward appearance to overthrow the Monarchy of Lydia, since the
example seemed of a dangerous consequence for its own government, for that
those Subjects might also fall upon the like pretenses.

Truly answered Creses, what I can say of that Theme is, that either they
think it more convenient for the glory of Syria, to reduce all Kingdoms but
their own, into Commonwealths, whereby theirs may appear to Asia the only
Empire: or they have an intention to make a conquest of ours, by reason of
those multitudes of divisions, they see arising amongst our selves; or perhaps
they aim to set up Prince Arethusius in his fathers Kingdom, because he is of
the Syrian blood, whereby they believe they shall purchase both honor and
friendship.

But if I thought I should not prove over harsh in my unpollisht language,
whereby too much to injure your patience by my tedious relation, I would
discover yet a story, though acted long time since, that in my opinion, has
been the original of the sad effects of this last War: it will prove the
longer, in regard it touches the proceedings, not only of the Kingdom of
Lydia, but the Countries of Syria and Myssia, that formerly have been all three
interwoven in dangers, slaughters and civil broils, by the spightfull
proceedings, and factious maxims, of a certain Priest called Herenzius.

Roxana glad to entertain any convenience, that might instruct her farther, in
the Mysteries of these unlucky times, although many things she had read of
Herenzius violent spirit, told Creses, that as no language proceeding from his
lips, could prove tedious to any ear how ignorant soever; so did she not
doubt, but the consequence of the present affairs, required rather ample
stories, then short descriptions, which gave him a sufficient warrant to use
his own pleasure, both for the manner and matter of his discourse, until his
endeavors produced this following relation.

You must know said he, that this Priest Herenzius some years since, when all
the world seemed to yield obedience to the great Flamine of Delphos, as the
only Oracle upon earth to prescribe the manner of the worship of the gods,
suddenly starred up in the Kingdom of Syria, who by reason of an ignominious
punishment he had undergone (as it was reported for a heinous offense committed
against humane and divine Laws) began violently to fall out with heaven and
earth; in so much as in the first place, he quarrelled with the form of the
service to the Gods then used; and in the latter, he denied Kings and Princes
obedience, or rather loyalty from their natural subjects; To this purpose to
execute his malice against all authority, because he had suffered by it; and
withal thinking again in some sort to recover his lost reputation, in doing
notable actions, how wicked soever, of a sudden flew to a certain Town upon
the confines of Arabia, whose people had newly, not only disobeyed their
Flamine but cast off their government to his authority, which quickly gave him
admittance, with his Doctrine, since they knew his opinions suited with their
designs; yet being rather friendly entertained, then perfectly established by
their welcome, his insolency and pride in a short time, banished him again
from the City, seeing he could not show temper in his first entrance; and so
remained until the fear of the inhabitants, of coming once more under their
old government, for that they understood their Prince prepared for a siege,
constrained them, not only a new to desire his company, whereby to be assisted
by his Council, but were forced to bind themselves by a solemn oath, to
submit absolutely their wills to his institutions: with these conditions he
became fully possessed of that power, that gave him opportunity, both to
govern as he pleased, and instruct as he listed, until he had fitted all
their thoughts, for the impressions of his designs by the eloquent language,
and cunning practices he used, which in a short time so prospered, that many
disciples were found of such towardly dispositions, instructed by his
principles, that he sent many of them also into other Countries, to poison the
peoples loyalties, since obedience is the most assured tie, that probably
warrants the safety and prosperity of Kingdoms. But these men having as I
said, taken their journeyes with these intentions, the first prevailing
progress they made, was in the Country of Myssia, where finding some
discontents already ingendring between the young Queen then reigning
grandmother to Euarchus: and some factious and ambitious Nobility, soon
introduced their new and dangerous opinions, into the hearts of the common
people, by which means the Lords became also so powerful by their assistance,
that the poor Princess in a short space, was forced to quit both her Kingdom
and Life, a Tragedy too pitiful now to be related, whilst the Rebels took
possession of her authority, from which usurpation proceeds Lydia's miseries,
since by a continuance of the same desires in those people toward her
posterity, they have now filled this Kingdom with tumults, troubles, and
blood, the better to make good their own jurisdictions so unlawfully purchased
in former times: but however, these opinions of deposing of Kings, and aldering
the worship of the gods, prevailed entirely in Myssia, by reason of those
crafty and factious actors that Herezius had sent; yet his Doctrine found not
so ready acceptance in the Kingdom of Lydia, for that the Queen then reigning,
endeavored against the violence of all their endeavors, both to conserve
Monarchy, and maintain their Flamines, though the State altered many Tenants
in Doctrine, until the late agreements of each Nation to oppose Euarchus in
the same design, contrived an accord to extirpate in effect both King and
Flamines: This may pass my discourse of the Kingdom of Syria, that has not
only formerly borne part in the suffering, by reason of these opinions sowed in
the world, but has been a principal occasion to give the Myssians protection,
by whose power Euarchus has been chiefly destroyed.

To which purpose you must understand, that although Herezius other messengers,
could not so easily beat down the strong Walls of Monarchy, established by
so many ages in Syria, against the power of great Armies always kept in pay by
that Nation, yet oftentimes they filled the whole Kingdom with most lamentable
slaughters, to gain entrance for their opinions, and freedom for their
Doctrine; in so much as the Prince himself then governing, finding the Temples
overthrown, his Country spoiled, and his Subjects destroyed by the fury of
the contention, was forced at last, so far to give way to the Herezians
religion in Syria, that they had not only granted them, a free exercise of
their consciences throughout all his dominions, but many fortified Towns were
delivered into their hands; wherein they put their own Garrisons, to secure
better this agreement, which both afforded him peace, and seemed to give them
satisfaction for the present: however, every year almost after notwithstanding
these benefits, produced new stirs by that faction, to the disquieting of the
Kingdom, that gave sufficient cause of vexation to many good Princes, since
they could not be assured of the loyalty of their obliged Subjects, nor of the
continuation of their own prosperities, when neither graces could win them by
reason of the spleen they bore to Monarchy, or power could compel them in
regard of those Forts they had in their custody.

But to be short, before the great and wise Favorite Philostros, durst take
upon him the huge work he intended, which was to suppress the gloriousness
of the Egyptian Empire, he imagined he could not be absolutely safe at home,
and so consequently not fitted for so large a conquest, as long as he should
leave behind him in his own bosom, so eminent a danger as those he esteemed
lawless Subjects in Orsames Kingdom, knowing they would upon all occasions,
be ready to join with foreign Forces, to overthrow their own Kings
government, and therefore resolved first, before he undertook any new design,
to subdue their power, to the absolute obedience of his great Masters
jurisdiction, as in times past it had been to some of his predecessors; to
which purpose he not only suddenly besieged the strongest Town they had in
Syria, but within a short space, left them never a Fort in the whole Kingdom,
that was not constrained to deliver up the Keys of its Gates, to the will and
pleasure of fortunate Orsames, who began to grow great in the opinion of the
world, by the conquest of his own Subjects, that were accustomed to give
sufficient employment to other Kings.

However, after that Philostros had made this speedy progress in glory, as
well as in security for his Masters; parant advantage, both in quietting his
Subjects at home, and terrifying his enemies abroad, which proved mighty
advantages for those designs he had contrived in his politic brain, because
it was not convenient, and scarce safe to continue desperate discontents in so
dangerous a body, that had vastly spread it self thorough most Countries in
Asia, whilst his thoughts and endeavors were otherwise to be employed; he
began by little and little, to smooth his brow toward that sect, and at last
not only assured them of his absolute forgetting all faults past, but made many
of them chief officers and commanders in that Army Orsames provided, to go
against the Egyptian Forces, wherein he craftily procured a double commodity
to his affairs, the one in winning a party he had good cause to suspect, and
the other in rendering them engaged in the quarrel, he intended against
Sorastros; besides he was most assured, that they would fight with spleen
against that religion by nature they most hated, since the Egyptians of all
others were held obsequious to the rights and ceremonies of Delphos, which also
was a means to bind the Myssians to the affairs of Syria, since no Nation or
people in Asia, professed more violently the same worship of the gods
introduced by Horenzius, and exercised by his followers in Orsames dominions,
which were not only reasons to tie Philostros to that sect, by all the favors
he could procure it in his own Country, whereby to make them serviceable in the
Wars, he had with Sorastros, but by that means gave countenance to the
Myssians against Euarchus: their lawful Prince; which by consequence afforded
the Senate of Lydia convenience also to suppress his power, that they might
not seem to go less in jurisdiction in mastering their King, then those
people they had bought with their money, only to do them service, so that by
this means the Favorite gave work enough at home to Euarchus, that he should
not have the opportunity, although he might have the will to assist the King of
Egypt, which the policy of every Nation requires according to some opinions,
when a Prince is not able to make good his party against another prevailing
Monarch.

This Madam as I say, has been the fate of these mighty Kingdoms, only
troubled by the cunning industry of one factious and ambitious Priest, as if
the Gods had sent him into the world to let man see his own frailty; and the
rather for that Euarchus not many years ago, appeared so glorious and
fortunate in his government, crowned with a flourishing prosperity, in wife,
children, peace, and power, that he was not only the absolute envy of all Asia,
but seemed to carry in his hand the arbitration of the world; being now cast
down into so low, and I may call it miserable condition, by a little faction
of his own people, that he is not only denied to be a King, but deprived of the
comfort of all that ever was his, with an addition of a sharp and lasting
captivity, according to the discretion sometimes of his meanest Subjects;
whilst in the interim, honor, love, justice, and gratitude seem to be laid a
sleep in the deep Center of the earth, other Princes only watching to their own
preposterous spleen, not considering how soon it may be their fortunes, to fall
under the same Fate, for that all men naturally covet liberty; with these words
he rested silent with his arms acrosse, as if yet his imagination, went higher
then his tongue was able to express. This discourse gave the old woman also
some leisure to shed a few tears, in confidering the Kings misfortunes,

But as he was proceeding farther, they were both interrupted by the sudden
arrival of the little dwarf, who told Roxana, that he had been a long time
searching her all over the Park, to inform her, that the Princess was newly
descended into the garden to take some recreation before dinner, and desired
earnestly her company, to impart something of consequence to her knowledge;
This gave Roxana no more opportunity, then civilly to thank Creses for those
informations he had given her, professing again she was instructed in many
things she had never heard before, that might afford light as she said, to her
comportment and conversation, since she was daily to dispute with some enemy or
other in Euarchus quarrel; and withal desired him he would be pleased, to put
on a resolution often to accompany her in that place, not only for her better
information, but for her Mistresses consolation, which you may be sure was a
tickling motive to invite Creses to the service, being persuaded, the Princess
should partake of his discourse; and love speaks the most effectual language,
though it want never so much probability to enjoy,

Roxana when she came into the Garden, she found the Princess retired into a
close walk, defended by interwoven branches of green leaves from the Suns
oppression, which also obscured her in some sort from the fight of her
attendants; so that the old woman had occasion given her by that retirement, to
believe new accidents had caused the solitude: Wherefore approaching at a
nearer distance, she might perceive a paper in Clorias hand, whilst she stood
still lifting up her fair eyes to the heavens, then again cast them down
upon the ground, and in this posture advanced two or three steps, with a kind
of a violent motion; this continued Roxana the longer before she discovered her
being there, until the Princess turning that way, she was necessarily invited
to present her self; however she had not come near her by a few paces, but
Cloria with a deep sigh, instead of other expressions, cast her the paper she
held, which the old woman presently reading, found it spoke this matter:

MAdam,
As I should not for a long season, have omitted those services due to your
person by many visits, that my love and your virtues required, if the
distempers of these times, had not proved prohibitions beyond my ability to
resist, since I durst not contend with the power of the General, whose will I
found absolutely obeyed: so now having an unexpected occasion to give you
advertisement, I cannot again but present my dear affections to your sacred
self, hoping that my former love is not altogether out of your remembrance,
not only since the Senate begins anew to possess themselves of their ancient
authority, but that the King your father is lately fled from the protection of
the Army, though by whose means, or to what region cannot yet be learned by
any examination.

Your most humble Servant, and faithful Lover, CASSIANUS.


Roxana after she had read the Letter, stood still sometime in a Muse, until
at last passionately she broake out into these words: Truly Madam said she, as
I cannot but smile at the former part of the writing, so must I needs wonder at
the latter, since it seems as preposterous, Prince Cassianus should after a
long silence, attempt your love, when he remained quiet during the Generals
supposed greatness, as it appears stranger to my thoughts, the King has now
removed his Quarters, when he was supposed secure in Farezius protection. But
alas said Cloria, I rather marvel whither my Father can possibly be fled to
purchase more hopes, for that all the Kingdom is probably out of his
jurisdiction; therefore I should be glad to flatter my self with some
opinions, that the design was undertaken upon good grounds. As I cannot
promise that answered Roxana, yet certainly the King being so wise, would never
have ventured upon such a dangerous attempt, without long consideration and
assured friends to conduct him to his journeyes end; but if I may rove
according to my wild imagination, either he is gone into Syria, since I cannot
believe he would any more trust his person with the Myssians, who have diverse
times deceived him: or is invited into Creet by his Subjects there in Arms
against the Senate, the better to make good their cause against the new Lydian
Forces, preparing to bring them speedily under subjection. The gods will be
done said the poor Princess, but I fear the worst; These discourses brought
them to the rest of the company in the Garden, to make them also sharers of the
unexpected news.

Roxana the next morning had scarce leisure given her to welcome the day, when
she was advertised by a messenger sent from Creses, that within two hours
space, he would attend her if she pleased, at the banqueting house amongst the
Woods, not only to finish out the rest of their discourse, but also to let her
know other passages worth her acceptance. The old Matron conceiving, it was
some intelligence more particular concerning the Kings departure, sent him
thanks, and promised with all diligence to wait upon the summons, which she
performed a pretty while before Creses arrival, that gave her opportunity to
examine her own imagination; but it was not long before she was interrupted by
his appearance, which with a few ceremonies seated them both together as the
day before, whilst Creses used this language.

Though I may suppose (said he) you have heard something of the Kings departure
from under the protection of the Army; yet perhaps you have not as yet been
informed of the reasons and particulars of his retirement; or rather I may call
it an escape, since he was persuaded it would be for his better safty: Roxana
confessing, she knew nothing of the manner much less the cause, though common
fame had brought the report to her ears; Creses gave her this farther account
of the passage, according to the relation he had from an officer entrusted in
the service as he said.

The King said he, being not only suspicious of the security of his person, by
reason of the many divisions of opinion in the Camp; some desiring a Prince,
others none; especially considering the diversity of humors amongst the common
Soldiers, who generally labored for an universal equality, as also being
credibly informed that unless he would presently condescend to those
propositions formerly sent unto him, with the addition of some privileges
demanded that were more destructive to his Crown and dignity, he should
infallibly be murdered, he was constrained to this sudden retirement: however
I must tell you these rumors were given out as 'twas believed, only to fright
him to seek another station, where he might be again imprisoned with some
color and better security, as pretending his intention was to escape out of
the Armies jurisdiction and power: so that the poor King finding causes enough
for a suspicion, acquainted two of his servants both with his fears and
intentions, who to be short, persuaded him to fly to an Island upon the borders
of Caria, where remains as governor a valiant commander, though formerly
employed by the Senate, yet at the present was conceived to be wholly at the
dispose of Farezius and the Army: this Captain they assured him would be
entirely faithful to his designs, though upon what grounds I can neither
inform you or satisfy my self, since the consequence proved otherwise: for
no sooner was the King arrived under his jurisdiction, but he entertained him
not only with a sad and sour countenance, but after he had secured his person
in the Castle, and sent away his two officers, he presently gave information to
the Senate of all the proceedings, desiring further directions in what manner
he should be treated; though he carries still in his demeanor, a kind of a
reverence to his dignity: all these passages as I told you before, I have from
one of those persons newly returned, that accompanied him in the journey, with
this advertizement also that before the Kings departure from the Camp, he left
in his chamber under his own hand, the reason of his fears and his escape: all
which Madam I may say is in such a mist, that no less a knowledge then some
divine Oracle can inform us concerning the certainty of the mystery: only we
may be confident that Euarchus has employment enough for his courage and
patience: At these words Roxana wept again with the very sense of the Kings
dangers and miseries: Nay said Creses, his suffering of all sides are so
extreme, that notwithstanding he has sent to Farezius and offered to accord
every difference and interest in the Kingdom, being heard; yet neither the
General nor Senate will entertain the motion, or allow him that privilege,
fearing belike he should speak too much reason to render his Subjects
satisfied, whereby they might be endangered to lose that authority which now
they possess without contradiction. But said Roxana, why do the common people
desire violently no King, since Euarchus shows such testimonies of his
goodness? Truly said Creses, as that opinion in the General is erroneous,
since all be not of that faction, so of the other side, there be too many that
wish an universal equality, not considering the confusion it would bring upon
the whole Kingdom, being as it were bewitched with an ignorant pride; for most
of them by such a parity, would be in more slavery then they are now, since
they could never be capable of any command, and necessarily must obey those
that would govern with more rigor, though elected from amongst themselves:
besides they are now so weary of the Senates rule in the same posture, having
had some experience of their managing affairs hitherto, that they believe
their own cure can proceed from nothing but desperate change, which is
incident to all distempered minds; since they that could not be well under
Euarchus peaceable government, wherein they enjoyed all wealth and prosperity
(though no doubt but there was some abuses) certainly now will not rest
satisfied when they shall feel nothing but want, oppression, and instability;
besides many fear that things are not yet at the worst, when so many contrary
interests with violence seem to contend. These discourses brought them both at
last in dispute, whether active valor, or passive courage were the greater
virtue, in that Euarchus seemed to possess them in a high kind. But Creses
who had a dainty wit, defended the latter with these arguments: first said he,
before we can well consider what has been the Kings sufferances, we must
rightly state his misfortunes, which will appear to be the greater, when it is
well known to the world, he has always showed courage in the Wars, by
venturing boldly his person upon all occasions, as also eloquence and judgment
both by his Pen and language, when those faculties of Art and Nature were
thought necessary and useful; a plain demonstration that he wants not sense
and knowledge fully to apprehend his own oppressions: and the rather may it be
so thought, for that those who have most gaiued by his favors, the ungrateful
Myssians, with some others of his own Court, have been the chief Instruments,
or rather I may say the only cause that have deprived him not only of the
privilege of his royal Crown, but of all the personal happinesses he
enjoyed in his prosperity; besides his want of liberty now at last to make up
the full Catastrophe of his misery, none almost giving ear to his complaints,
or pitying his captivity: though they have separated him from his beloved
Queen, in whose beauty and virtues he took an unspeakable felicity, as also
the comfort of beholding his sweet children, being a real part of himself,
which the gods and nature have ordained to man as a humane right; accompanied
with the detention of his revenues that should maintain him and them: besides
prosecuting him with as many slanders as they can invent.

This Madam as it may be supposed, being the true condition of Euarchus
misfortune, it may easily be conjectured, his sufferings are equal, if not go
beyond example, and yet his noble heart holds out still to endure as you see,
what malice can invent without breaking; who notwithstanding offers love, mercy
and patience to his whole Kingdom and worst injurers: things being in this
posture I shall proceed to the making good of my promised argument; which is,
that passive courage is a greater virtue then active valor; if my discourses
do not seem too tedious for your more necessary employment.

As I must call the Kings constancy a noble fortitude, since he has neither
Subject of hope, nor object of diversion, so certainly is it the highest
magnanimity for a Prince to suffer patiently and without confusion from his own
Subjects that owe him duty and gratitude; for those men that hazard their
lives freely in desperate services, either aim at victory or conquest, by
which they intend to purchase gain or glory, which enflames their bloods with
continual agitation, that scarce gives leisure to reflect upon the dangers,
much less time for cold and apprehensive consideration; and yet we see such
have for the most part need of noise of drums and sound of Trumpets to waken
their courages, or lay asleep their fears, to continue them better in action,
whereas suffering has nothing to help or comfort it, since the mind is still
prepared to entertain the misery it sustaineth, with a pale expectation of the
same or worse, when as I say it is known it must be endured without hope,
having no diversion: like a person sick in the night, wanting objects of
variety, thinks that season longer and his torment greater by much then in the
day time; for where the mind is kept high by ambition to compass something it
coveteth, it has power enough in that interim to hold up the body from falling
to its proper center the earth, where naturally it inclines: but being without
comfort, if a man do not make strong use of his noble part his soul, to
maintain his courage and resolution, the suffering or captivating of flesh and
blood, will render a man quickly totally overcome, and that is the reason that
long and tedious persecutions have destroyed more competent spirits, then sharp
and violent tortures, since they were prepared for the one with expectation,
and only weared by the other with continuance. We know that old men strive more
greedily to preserve their lives that short time they are to live, then young
men in their most flourishing years; because diversity of prospects operates
so much in youthful bosoms, by reason of continual activity, tending that
way, that they have not leisure to settle their imaginations upon horrid
apprehension; when old people have so much time to think (wanting power of
action) that the object which is natural appears often before their eyes to
fright them, and so fares it with a person that only suffers, in comparison of
him that does both suffer and act together: wherefore that person has need of
a double courage, because there is nothing to accompany his thoughts of variety
or diversion; for certainly it pleases a man rather to contend for his life,
though he know he shall be deprived of it, then to lose it without any strife
at all; which seems to be the case of Euarchus, since they will not so much as
permit him with reason to dispute his rights, but force him unheard to deliver
up his Crown: and more grievous a great deal is his condition, in that he
appears to be left of all those friends that have been most obliged to his
goodness. What is the reason that a delinquent upon the Scaffold is accustomed
to have his eyes banded before the stroke of death, to take away from him the
apprehension of the blow which he knows he shall receive? When a valiant
Soldier in the Field without shadow will charge against a thousand weapons,
with as much certainty of destruction, but because the ones action frees him
from the others terror: All which show, that a sad expectation of an ill,
augments the suffering, when a diversion by employment of the body, or busying
the senses by diversity of objects, take away that apprehension that makes any
danger or misery excessively horrid; as for example, men for the most part are
put to torture in uncouth places, where there is nothing but silence, or low
whispers, to render the sufferer more sensible of the pain, by the quieting of
the imagination; and so it fares with such as pass through dark places, being
afraid of every small rustle, when in the day time, the same way perhaps is
pleasant; so that as I say without doubt, all smart, grief, and discontent is
increased by want of action and too much leisure for consideration; for I must
conclude, that it is a great deal easier for a person to dye fighting in the
Field, though he should be cut in sunder in a thousand pieces, then to endure a
long and tedious captivity, which is Euarchus present condition; in so much as
at last if he should in some sort yield to this cruelty, I must not find fault
with his courage, but if he gain the victory, I shall esteem him a miracle of
nature.

As I must not said Roxana, go about to disprove your arguments grounded upon
such reasons, and more delivered by the known authority of your excellent
judgment, so of the other fide, I could wish the King had some Counsel to
assist him in these difficulties besides his own capacity and courage, since it
is impossible but humane nature at the length will be tired with over much
suffering, and by consequence fail for want of true information: there is no
contradiction of your opinion said Creses, but such is the crafty spite of
some, that they will permit none to be about the Kings person that dares
loyally afford him any profitable consolation, because they may the sooner
bring him to consent to their desires: Yet replied Roxana, it is not well known
what those desires are, since they never durst for all I could ever learn,
publicly declare their intentions, but do as it were in a dark mist endeavor
to possess the people, that the King refuses something he is obliged to grant
for the good of his Subjects; by which means they strive still to maintain
their credits and opinions amongst the common sort. It is so Madam said Creses;
however since you are fallen upon that point, I shall let you know, how far
the King has yet condiscended to their demands, whereby the better to
dispossess the People of that belief they are persuaded to have in the
Senates integrity, though I verily think, they now more fear their power,
then trust their intentions; for whereas not many days ago, they proposed to
Euarchus to have the power of the force of the Kingdom for twenty years both
by Sea and Land, the King has yielded to grant them that jurisdiction during
his life, though not for that term, which appears now to be the greatest
difference between them, since the Senate seems not content with this offer:
whereupon the Myssians have lately put out a furious declaration against the
Senate pressing the King to such unreasonable conditions: In good earnest
answered Roxana, I cannot tell, whether I have more cause to smile at the
seeming ridiculousnesse of these proceedings, or be amazed to see men grown so
foolishly unreasonable, since Euarchus appears to my understanding, to be
willing to part with more from his own hopes, then what the Senate requires;
for that if he grant the power of the Kingdom out of his hands during his
life, it gives more assurance to the Senate that he intends no more to reign,
if he had quitted his power for so many years only, since he might have some
thought to over live that prescribed term; again for the Myssians I wonder
most of all at their new loyalty to their Prince, when they have been as I may
say, the only cause that has made him no King, though now anew, they seem to
desire to re-establish him in his ancient authority, which certainly cannot be
but upon other designs of advantage to themselves, more then for Euarchus
prosperity.

Truly Madam said Creses, in the general it is as you say, but yet there are
so many mysteries hid under these proceedings, that they are capable to deceive
the sharpest judgment, if some light be not given by information: Wherefore
you must know that both Euarchus and the Senate know very well, that the
consequence of all the Affairs, chiefly depend upon the assurance of the
safety of the Kings person, since he can never hope to be again re-established
in his rightful authority, but either by the humors and inconstancy of the
common people, who when they find the Kings absolute oppression brings no
prosperity to them, will probably become exasperated against the Senates
proceedings and power, or by an unreconcilable difference between the Senators
themselves, who may most command when they shall find no other jurisdiction to
oppose them: both which in all likelihood will conduce to the Kings benefit, if
he sit quiet sometime under his injuries, which I conceive to be the reason
that he has in outward appearance yielded so much to their demands. And for
the Myssians perhaps by this opposition they would persuade the world to a
belief of their integrities, as if at the first they consented not to the
Kings hard usage, whereby to obtain a greater party, not only in the Kingdom
of Lydia, if they have an intention to dispute their own profit: but in other
Countries if they mean to make War upon our people, because they cannot be
sharers in the government as they hoped, the only cause certainly of the now
seeming quarrel; so that in my opinion Euarchus has done like a wise and
politic Prince, in seeming not to contend, where he was sure not to prevail,
especially since by the dispute, he might have endangered those hearts that
will now be of his side, if the occasion be offered, either out of pity to his
sufferings, or our of hate to the Senates government; And besides, it is to be
considered, that no act he shall pass in this condition of constraint, can
bind either himself or posterity by all humane and divine laws, if his Sword
ever become more powerful: in the mean time, the Senate will seek to preserve
the Kings life and person with their best care, since their own authority falls
entirely by his death, which as I say is the reason they desire more a term of
years in the continuation of their required government, then the determinable
fate of the Princes life, because they may have always the liberty to press
him to new conditions, if they find by experience they have not yet obtained
sufficient, since they shall not need to fear the vexations of his person, may
bring any hazard upon him.

I cannot deny said Roxana, but these reasons are sufficient to render me
wholly satisfied in my doubtful opinions, but the gods are only capable to
foresee the event of things. And with that looking upon the Sun, she perceived
the time of the day called her to the attendance of the Princess, which made
her for the present take her leave. Upon her arrival she found Cloria only
accompanied by her Lute in a small withdrawing room belonging to her own
chamber, where none but her self had permission to be admitted: not long after
she had saluted the Princess, she discovered she had been weeping, by the red
circles about her eyes, that gave the old woman occasion further to be
inquisitive after her employment; until she spyed this complaining ditty lying
written before her upon the Table, that quickly gave her satisfaction of the
occasion, though her excellent voice and rare skill rendered the Music heavenly.

Is Justice could some favor find,
Or were not rather truly blind;
Ambition sure durst never wear,
The spoils of such a virtue hear,
When every hour
Does need her power
To set both Crowns and Kingdoms free.
For love I see is but a flame
That only bears a constant name;
And is by interest as a wave,
Tossed here and there as others crave,
If objects seem
Of more esteem
To summon sense unto the call.
But whatsoever dwells more high,
Shoot but your Commets from the sky,
Against the hate that mortals bear,
To such as lawful Scepters wear,
And we will adore
For evermore
That action as a Di^^^
Yet whilst that fate and pride contend,
Whether shall conquer at the end,
The Gods themselves have cause to fear;
A revolution of the Sphere,
And then like we
May Martyrs be
In the vast Chaos of the fall.
But the Princess after she had made an end of her Music, began with many
complaints and more sighs to blame absent Narcissus for his too much
negligence in his love, since in all this time of her last restraint he had not
found as she said some disguise to visit her person, though he might want the
power to procure her liberty; which she continued with a certain passion,
until Roxana not only chid her for those sad expressions, that as she told her
had destroyed in part the ravishing delight of her song, but seemed unjust in
accusing her servant, that had in so many dangerous adventures showed always
the entire constancy of his affection, who was no doubt at the present retired
into some region, where he might best advantage her service. However Cloria was
willing upon any hopes, to be satisfied with the proceedings of Narcissus, and
much more with his intentions; yet could she not but tell Roxana, that although
she was pleased to be his advocate that seemed to have a powerful persuasion
in her belief, yet were the loves she feared from Farezius, and the
importunities she expected of Cassianus, in her apprehension, arguments
sufficient to make her think Narcissus wanted much diligence, at leastwise
violence, that he did not endeavor to scale the very Walls where she remained
a prisoner, rather then to endure her to be so injured. Truly Madam answered
Roxana, as I cannot tell why you should expect miracles instead of services, so
have you no cause to doubt the importunities you mention, since I am not
certain Farezius love was ever presented to your liking: either from himself,
or any of his instruments; And for the Addresses of Cassianus, you have been
already so accustomed to refusals, that I conceive you have not any other hard
part to play then to continue the same course still. Besides, you may well
remember by Cassianus own Letter, that his affections are not so hot, as to
press you upon over great inconveniences; and therefore, in my opinion you may
very well quiet your thoughts concerning his courtships.

O Roxana said the Princess, you are much deceived in both these particulars,
for as to my knowledge (which I have understood since I saw you last) Farezius
has already intimated his desire to my father, whom you may be sure will
comply almost in any thing that concerns the General, So does Cassianus
labor the Senate underhand, to be propitious to his love, since as he says,
their own honors are engaged in the issue, for that the world takes notice of
their protestations, which are to see him established in a prosperous condition
both in power and affection: And the rather as ^retends for that they formerly
sent for him, according to their professions, to see them put in execution.
Roxana replied, as there be many reasons of sufficient force to make me give
way to your opinions, since your own beauty, honor, and virtues are loadstones
attractive enough to entangle all the world in an intricate labyrinth of love
and desire, notwithstanding what difficulties soever, yet it cannot but seem
most strange to my thoughts, that Farezius low condition, though his fortune
has been eminent, should aspire to such a supreme excellency with any hope to
enjoy. Hold your self content woman said the Princess, there is no limitation
of self-love and ambition, when they have once taken possession of a proud
heart, though covered with never so mean an extraction; And you know that
Farezius is a gentleman, which joined with his former success in the Wars,
and his present command now in the Army, cannot want persuasions to make him
attempt any enterprise for his own glory, especially since the King seems
merely to depend upon his assistance, or allowance for his future prosperity;
and being so, what counsel can you give me either to prevent his violence or
instruct his passion, since I dare not be too bold, in hazarding my fathers
fortunes by provoking the Generals spleen by a harsh and disdainefull denial.

In good sooth said Roxana, I am very glad to see, you have learned some temper
since you were in the possession of Osiris, where as you may remember, I had
much ado to persuade you to entertain reason, or ^^^tinue you in patience,
wishing then, you had h^^arded a thousand deaths rather then have dissembled
your love in any kind; but perhaps Narcissus is now farther from your
remembrance, though nearer your person. No by all the immortal gods answered
the sweet Princess, my affection is as pure and constant as it was in Osiris
Court, if not increased by the effects of more trials to render it absolutely
juditious, only the consideration of my fathers present captivity, and future
danger makes me so far willing to dispense with my own dear love, as to
mask it over with some hypocrisy, for his sake, which formerly I was
unwilling to purchase with the assurance of my own life, when I remained in the
City of Memphis; only the consideration of a necessarily jealousy in Narcissus
breast, when rumors shall bring such reports to his absent ears, I must
confess something deterres my resolution, from any dissimulation at all in
love, though no way prejudicially to his right or my own honor.

Indeed Madam said Roxana, I do not now only, begin to love you for your
wisdom, but will endeavor to put a project into your head, that may both keep
your father safe, and perhaps destroy your enemies, at leastwise it will
protract if not divert your violent prosecution; certainly governesse answered
the Princess, if you prove as good as your word, I shall esteem it the
greatest piece of service that ever your wits produced, since in my opinion, it
not only equals all others in benefit, for that the King as well as my self
is concerned in the business, but out goes the rest in difficulty, considering
how many powerful adversaries you have to deal withal. Well then said
Roxana, sit still and hear my propositions, and afterward prepare your self
without resistance to put them in execution, though never so much against your
appetite; if not return me such arguments as may convert my judgment as well
as satisfy your own fancy: Cloria told Roxana that her injunction was so
reasonable, that it was not to be contradicted by any that had common sense, or
was not desperate against their own good, promising withal to be punctual in
her obedience, as a principal duty she esteemed her self bound unto, in
regard of that charge she had had ever since her infancy over her, and then the
old woman began this discourse.

For these two Suitors said she, that seem likely to trouble your patience, and
the Kingdoms quiet, since the one commands the Army, as the other is possessed
of the hearts of the Senate, I make no doubt, but you may oppose their own
interest one against the other, if you can dissemblingly but entertain the
love of either; by which jealousy certainly there must needs rise discontents
and factions toward your safety and fathers advantage; for if you entertain
the addresses of Cassianus, the Soldiers will think their General
undervalued, who appears now to the public view to carry upon the point of
his Sword the absolute power and strength of the whole Kingdom; And if you
accept of Farezius Courtships, no doubt but the Senate will esteem their own
authorities dishonored, since they have proposed Prince Cassianus to be the
subject of their chief care: Besides, if Farezius should fail in any thing he
attempts, many of the common people would conceive with some violence, that the
Senate has an intention to cousen them out of those privileges, they have
been promised when their greatest patron shall be debarred of his own desires,
and if Cassianus should miss of what he has hitherto expected by the Senates
liberal offers, the Nobility might very well imagine, that the people and Army
endeavored to become their Masters, which would not be lessened by other
jealousies already growing between the two factions, since the Nobility does
not only with all the secret policy they can, seek to curb the insolency of
the common sort, who strive for nothing more, then to bring down all dignity to
an universal equallity, but the multitude have already so far declared their
dislike of the Lords proceedings, that publicly they have required to have the
authority of their jurisdiction taken away, and made liable to the peoples
allowance, who now enjoy their privileges by inheritance from their Ancestors,
purchased either by their own merits, or the Princes grace. And last of all,
though the factions of the two Rivalls should not inflame at the particular
disgrace of either Cassianus or Farezins, yet certainly their own Swords in a
private combat would be very likely to decide the quarrel, which would give
you a fair pretense to refuse the Survivor that should covet to embrace you
with hands imbrued in blood.

Governesse answered the Princess, although I should be very glad to be an
occasion to raise any faction for my own present advantage, and my fathers
future prosperity, yet I cannot deny but I am most extreme sorry to hear of
new troubles, whereby the Kingdom should be engaged in more slaughters. You
are very pitiful replied Roxana, but I pray consider, whether it be not
better to procure the discomposure of those that have sought all this time by
their authority to establish another government, destructive to Monarchy,
whereby of necessity a general confusion must follow, for that it is not
probable so many interests can be satisfied, or give occasion to prepare Lydia
for the conquest of foreign Forces, since it is impossible your fathers many
children would be content to sit down quietly with the perpetual loss of
their own Birthrights extorted from the King by his unruly Subjects, during
their minorities, and able enough certainly they will be to contend for their
dues, seeing all the Princes of Asia are interessed as well in the example as
in their blood. No, no Madam said she, rather dispense with your unprofitable
commiseration then be careless of future safety, for it will be much better
now to destroy these unlawful designs by a little civil Wars amongst
themselves, that would but purge the Kingdom of its corrupt humors, engendered
by excess in pride and prosperity, then in the times to come to expose all
conditions to a perpetual slavery, under a Tyrannical government, gained by
the power of lawless Soldiers, brought in by other Princes not acquainted
with the natures of our people, much less senfible of their sufferings, since
they will only consider their faults past, and not look upon their miseries
present, for they would rather judge them by the manner of subjection of their
own Country, then by the sweetness of the Lydian Laws: Wherefore I say you
must think, whether of the two Suitors you will make the object of your
choice, to render the other jealous of his actions and your favors, whereby
some sudden difference may arise between the factions to bring the sooner
confusion into the Kingdom, which certainly is the readiest way again to
establish your father in his right, since the noise of foreign power at
present, will not only be an occasion the better to unite them together to the
Kings disadvantage, but at the best, hazard the destruction of all property and
government, since the Sword will be the principal Arbitrator of every man's
right, and the victory a change of his condition.

Truly Roxana said the Princess, as I cannot in my own reason esteem your
discourse apocryphal, so of the other side, you cannot deny, but that I have
been ever willing in all my necessities to follow your Counsel, and therefore
since you have prescribed the Law; certainly the election will be easy; for
considering that Farezius has not yet publicly pretended to my love, at
leastwise by any expressions to my self, me thinks it would appear some
injustice for me to refuse Cassianus Courtships, who has already as you know a
kind of an engagement from my own mouth concerning the old Flamine, though he
be since destroyed: besides his blood, Titles, and condition, more suite with
my honor and professions, in which the Nobility of the Kingdom will have the
greater share, whose dignities certainly if it were not for particular ends,
would preserve Monarchy; whereas the people and common Soldiers endeavor
nothing more then to destroy it from the face of the earth.

Why then Princess said Roxana, if you be so resolved, I must give you your
lesson; but first I will tell you of a third Suitor, who also as best deserving
must have some employment, and that is Creses; one whose affection might merit
a requital with your love, if your other engagements, and his own
disproportion were not obstacles beyond removal: however, it is your part to
trust his fidelity, and reward his trust, especially since his endeavors may
bring you advantage as well as himself preferment. Wherefore I will design
him to this office though he be not yet privy to my intentions, which is
presently to make a Journey into Syria, where the Queen your Mother, and the
Prince your brother both remain, to expect the pleasure of that State
concerning your fathers affairs, by which means he shall more particularly be
able to inform them concerning the Mystery of your resolutions that may render
the assistance they shall be willing to lend more advantageable, and the rather
for that I understand the Country of Syria, still entertaines an Ambassador
with the Myssians, whose force certainly will conduce much to our projects, if
they can be made faithful to Euarchus good, since the least power will
infinitely strengthen the faction that shall show it self for the King or his
son; and in the Journey I intend Creses shall visit the Cretans see whether
they may also be wrought to join with our party here at home, which is not
improbable, since peace and settlement in Lydia will be an overthrow to their
prosperities, for that those people by this Kingdom are esteemed no other then
pernicious rebels: And let Creses alone to act his part when he is
sufficiently informed of our desires, whose sharp wit and excellent language,
cannot be equalled by any messenger can be sent, which are fortunate properties
to our purpose; besides his entire love to your sacred self, will be always
sure to continue him absolutely faithful, which afterward must be rewarded,
either by your fathers fortunes, or the Queens interest in Syria.

Without doubt Governesse said Cloria, you have hit upon a right plot, and the
rather for that I hear by a late edict sent from the Senate (as it should
seem upon the Kings flight) they have not only banished out of the City of
Sardis, all my fathers friends in general, but Creses in particular, as
conceiving him extraordinarily interessed in the Kings counsel and affairs,
for that he brought as you know to the Senate the first propositions of his and
the Armies desires.

Then Madam said Roxana, your next work must be, anew to invite Prince
Cassianus, by some hopes of your acceptance of his offered Love, which may
conveniently be grounded upon the late Letter he sent you, that you have not
yet answered, as also upon your discourse to him, when he showed both affection
and diligence in saving the old Flamines life at your request, in which service
you expressed so much liking to his person and virtues, that you professed him the
next person in your thoughts to Narcissus engagement, whom he will not be
persuaded is living: and I shall be very glad still to continue him in that
error, until the designs we have in hand may happily be brought to some
fortunate issue, by which means Farezius may be spoiled of the peoples
affections, and bereaved of the power of the Army, that now seems to carry him
up beyond all other authorities, and so consequently enflames his thoughts
above opposition, in what he shall propose, much less wish; though truly for
my part I believe, he has a strong faction against him, not only by the
Nobility by reason of Dimogoras disgrace, and many of the chief Sena^^rs
fearing their own power, but also in diverse Provinces where he has so long a
space quartered his Soldiers without removal, though their own desires in
taking away the power from the Lords and destroying the Kings regality, yet
hinders them from complaining.

Well, well said Cloria, as we must leave time to discover these hidden
mysteries, so will I address my self to put in execution what your wisdom
has prescribed, and to that purpose must enjoin you to remain here in my
absence, until an hours space give you releasement; in which interim I shall
endeavor to contrive a Letter to Cassianus (in answer to his he sent me the
other day) convenient for our design. But scarce had the Princess remained in
her private Cabinet the time limited by her words, but she brought forth a
Letter imprinted in a fair character, but written by a much fairer hand, which
she giving to Roxana to read, it spoke this language.

COusin,
Although I can no way doubt of your affection, by reason of so many
protestations you have made upon all occasions, able to convert any misbeliever
from the strongest opinion to the contrary, since otherwise honor as well as
religion, should extremely suffer by so much falsehood; yet whether that love
or no be of so noble a quality as to merit my regard, is scarce a question,
when you dare not before the face of any enemy, own these professions you have
so often uttered: Alas, alas Cassianus, to what a miserable condition am I
brought, when he that my heart would pleasure, is afraid to receive the favor,
because he that I have no will to love, is pleased to be angry? What dazeling
beams proceeding from Farezius greatness, have power to captivate the soul
of so Illustrious a Prince, whose ancient blood has filled the veins of all
the mighty houses in Asia with luster and renown? If I be grown less in
virtue then I was, when you first made those large tenders, you ought to
express wherein, that I might defend my reputation; but if your inconstancy
proceed from fancy, or want of courage, you cannot expect I should remain the
same,

CLORIA.


When Roxana had read the Letter, she told the Princess, that as she did
approve the manner of her writing, since it wanted not force to stir up the
coldest courage to that violence which was necessary for their purpose, so did
it not give much advantage for future engagement; but however Cloria was not
able to hear her words without letting fall a few gentle Tears, not only to
show, that her heart consented not to the hypocrisy, but her soul melted at
the remembrance of her absent love, though she meant no way to prejudice his
interest; and in this sorrowful posture, gave her governesse commission to
send away the paper; whilst she her self quickly retired into her own chamber,
at leastwise to content her thoughts with those hopes she had been persuaded to
entertain by Roxana's discourse, though not many days did she spend in
diversity of contemplations, before she received this answer from Cassianus,

MOst admirable Princess,
as I cannot but confirm my former protestations by a thousand other new
oaths, not only to re-assure you of my fidelity in those pure affections I
firsi offered upon the Altar of myheart to your sacred perfections, but must
conjure your beliese by all the powerful spells of honor and justice, to be
confident that neither the fear of Farezius greatness, or doubt of my own
safety, could give the occasion to lessen those respects so justly due from my
love to your worth, since I not only hold the Generals person of too low a
consideration for my thoughts, which are always employed upon that high
subject your excellent self, but my life to be of too small a value to be lost
in any thing that can possibly be named your concernment. No dear Madam, it
was nothing less then the horror my imagination apprehended to suspect your
unvaluable person might be in some danger by the unjust jealousy of the proud
Generals fears, to see you adored by any interest, and withal no small
doubt, least your royal fathers rights might again be restrained by his rage,
when he should perceive a foreign Prince of his own blood, began new
addresses without his leave to any of his posterity, since I believed Farezius
aimed alone at the honor to do the King justice: but now finding he has not
only changed the opinion with his fortune; but that I have a releasement by
the powerful warrant of your pen, the gods shall not withold my fury from
performing those services wherein I will esteem death a purchase, if the fair
Cloria do but own the Sacrifice of offered

CASSIANUS.


The Princess could not choose but read this Letter with a little kind of
trembling, as if she feared what she did not doubt, since the worst she was to
expect, as she thought from Cassianus, was to comply with her desire; but it is
the nature of all passion, to produce new violences, whether in those things we
wish or others we would not have. And so it fared with sweet Cloria, who in a
manner dreaded what she had designed to be, because it came. But after a lovely
smile had taken possession of that countenance, that for a while put on some
distraction, she told her governesse, that although their plot in all appearance
had thus far well succeeded, since she perceived her Cousin was won to be
sufficiently valiant; yet she made some question how she was to entertain his
presence, when he should make his addresses; for if she should as she said,
give him but ordinary welcome, he might again fall back from his seeming fury
against Farezius; and if too well, he might expect some greater engagement then
was convenient for her to grant. Truly Madam answered Roxana, make no scruple
to let him have as much as you can spare upon the old score, since my Lord
Narcissus appearance at any time, will absolutely blot out the obligation,
which you know were the first conditions you treated upon in saving the old
Flamines life. I but said Cloria, I should be very sorry any suspected
testimony did remain, that so much as intimated my thoughts could ever be
persuaded to another choice. In good sooth said the old woman; your conscience
is so tender in matters of love, that I believe when you are married to your
servant, you will make a doubt, whether he be the same man or no, and by that
means call your affection in question to the raising of some desperate
jealousy between you. At these words the Princess smiled, but was prevented
in her reply, by the information she received, that her dinner waited her
pleasure.

It was not long after this discourse before Cassianus himself in person came
into the Princess Lodgings, not only in confirmation of the truth of his
Letter he had sent, but as it were according to his profession to obraide
Farezius suspected, if not pretended love, although Cloria for that present,
was so busied by reason of some employment in her chamber with her maid
servants, that Roxana was constrained with some complements not only to give
him entertainment, but to make her Mistresses excuse, which at last seated them
both in a withdrawing room belonging to the Princesses lodgings, and that
conveniences drew on many discourses; amongst which Cassianus was persuaded by
the old woman's desires, to relate the passages of his own fortunes, with the
rest of the Princes of Armenia, pretended to be injured by the usurped power of
Artaxes their great King, which he delivered in this manner, as a greater
motive by Roxana's means to persuade Clorias affections.

You must know said he, that after the valiant King of Seythia had lost his
life in the Armenian Wars in defense of the Princes rights, who were esteemed
oppressed by Artaxes power, a story most sufficiently known to all, my self
came into Lydia to demand assistance of Euarchus my Uncle, to recover again my
conquered Country of Iberia, detained from me by Tigranes Duke of Colchis.
Orsames also at the same time began his Wars against our oppressor with the
same pretentions, since Philostros his powerful Favorite judged it a work
full of piety and justice, however he knew there would be much blood spilt in
the quarrel, fince as his master was mighty, Artaxes was obstinate, and both
ambitious; And to this purpose, not only prosecuted his design with much
violence against the King of Armenia, but in a short time Orsames gained many
Countries, so that at last, he brought Artaxes to be willing to accept, if not
to demand a public Treaty; whereby as it was pretended, Asia again might be
reduced to its former happy condition, by the effects of a general peace,
since the discomposure of such mighty interests, seemed to threten the whole
world with a fatal destruction; and to this effect, all the injured Princes
were called to show forth their accustomed privileges, in a City upon the
Confines of Syria and Armenia, which was a place chosen as most indifferent for
that effect: where their Commissioners then meeting, and yet remaining with
more disputes, then hopes of agreements, gave occasion to the Senate of Lydia,
to invite me to fly to their protection, as well for present subsistence, as
future hopes, since it appeared these two powerful Kings, only beheld their
own ambitions as the chief object of their considerations, though they pretend
a more charitable intention in their actions. But my Lord said Roxana, as I do
not desire to trouble my thoughts with the rights of other Princes that have
little relation to our affairs, but as they may concern your particular, so
in regard they may prove over tedious for our intended discourse, since the
Princess her self will be likely to surprise us before we have finished, I
must entreat the honor only to be made acquainted with those things, that
shall belong to your own Titles; and the rather for that I have heard some
disputes formerly to that purpose, which I was not very well able to answer,
and should be very glad to be better provided against other arguments of the
same nature.

Truly Madam answered Cassianus, as it is impossible for me to sever in all
respects the interests of other Princes from my own, so I will endeavor to
avoid what unnecessary discourse may prove either tedious or impertinent; after
that Roxana had acknowledged the favor by a few complements, he related these
particulars.

Although I am confident said he, that you are competently informed, that my
dead father was dispossessed of his fruitful Country of Iberia for taking up
of Arms against the power of Artaxes King of Armenia, yet may not be perhaps
sufficiently instructed how Tygranes became possessor of our Countries, Titles,
and Honors, wherefore be pleased to know, that after my said father was driven
forcibly from the possession of the Crown of Mesopotamia, (which he had
received by the free election of that people, who found themselves oppressed by
the Laws Artaxes had imposed upon their consciences; as well as many of the
Nobility deprived of such Lands belonging to the Temples, in their possessions,
which their predecessors had left them, though formerly taken away I must
confess by violence from the Flamines) and my mother forced to fly to her
friends charity for succor and safety, the King of Armenia with the assistance
of Tygranes riches, prosecuted so far his begun good fortune, that in a short
space he not only quieted the stirs in his dominions, but advanced his power
into Iberia, which being without any support, but what few Forces Euarchus his
father, then King of Lydia had send to defend his daughters right, quickly
became master of what strong places he pleased, until at last he was Lord of
the whole; and being in possession he not only paid that debt he owed to
Tygranes with part of my Lands, but bestowed upon him in requital of his other
good services, all our Titles and honors which for many lasting ages had
remained in our family, as being the next of kin. As this cruel injustice
killed my father with grief, so after some years it brought to our assistance
the forenamed Scythian Prince, as one sent from the Gods in our apprehension,
to teach Artaxes a new law of obedience to the fortunes of so great a courage;
however this date of life became determined by the envious destinies, and we
left only to demand aid of Orsames power, to finish that work that we thought
so happily begun to the advantage of the injured Princes; in which number I was
to be reckoned the chief, since most eminent both in wrongs and honors: As I
may say my particular cause bearing the very name of all the rest: In this
sign, the Syrians continued a large progress within Artaxes Countries, until
the King himself was forced in a manner by the consent also of Sorastros King
of Egypt, to that general treaty I formerly mentioned; which notwithstanding
all the while has only produced disputations, instead of conclusions, for that
the War continues still with violence to the ruin of the whole Kingdom,
without the benefit of any in particular, began at first by the obstinate pride
of Tygranes, that would not restore those rights belonging to my self, which
probably might have given satisfaction to the other Princes of our faction;
however lately Tygranes being also oppressed by the burden of war in his
own dominions, begins to be more plyant to our desires, and to this purpose
many arguments are alleged of either side to give color to the unfortunate
actions of Soldiers, who are maintained more to fatisfie the ambition of the
two mighty Kings, then to put us in possession of our rights. Tygranes
affirms, that as the King of Armenias gratitude bestowed upon him in
recompense of his services done the Crown, those honors and Lands that
belonged to our Family, so the money he has laid out in the Wars, makes him
a lawful purchaser of that benefit; and therefore in all equity cannot be
deprived of them without a full satisfaction, according to the damage he has
sustained by those actions. The State of Syria again pretends, that unless my
self be restored to my former dignities, the combination which is made with
the injured Princes, must of necessity be broken, and so consequently their
Kingdom of Syria dishonored in their agreement; and we further add, that
although Artaxes might have some color of displeasure against my father, for
taking upon him the Crown of Mesopotamia, and defending the possession in his
life time by force of Arms, which however is a Title disputable, yet my self
ought not to be esteemed any way guilty of the fault being an infant; and
therefore too much injured by such a loss, when instead of enjoying the
greatest principallity of all Armenia for dignity, I am left naked of honor
and subsistence, whilst others of less quality triumph with those spoils that
should adorn my person. In conclusion, not to detain your expectation over
long with diversity of relations, although the Kingdom of Syria vows never to
lay down Arms without a full restoration of the Princes rights: yet many
Ministers of that State did underhand conclude a league with Tygranes to my
prejudice; which shows particular interest has the chief preheminency in
this War; but since, upon new breaches, the Duke again is fallen off from
that agreement: in so much as the difference may produce better effects; and
the rather do I hope it, for that Tygranes has lately offered to procure the
King of Armenia to grant me equal honors to those my father has lost, as
himself will be content to deliver up the possession of the Countries
belonging to my right, if a general peace in all Asia may by that means
succeed; provided he be competently satisfied by the State for those damages he
has sustained by the Wars; in which posture continue our present affairs;
without either moving backward or forward, to the amazement of the whole world.

Truly my Lord answered Roxana, it seems to me, nothing more is demanded in
the Kingdom of Armenia then what you have been pleased to mention, since your
interest is the bases, upon which the only occasion of the War has been
builded. It is true said Cassianus, however some differences in points of
religion that the Scythians stand upon, is a kind of an obstacle also; yet it
is thought, the State of Syria can when it pleases, moderate that particular:
but the truth is, that those contentions that depend upon Egypt and Syria, are
of so much consequence to this Treaty, that it absolutely hinders not only the
progress, but success of all the rest, whose ambitions as it is thought can
never be satisfied; until one of those States perish from its appearing
greatness; by which means the other may appear to the world more absolute.

By this time the Princess Cloria came into the room, which for the present
not only broake off their discourse, but gave warning to Cassianus to present
himself to his most glorious Mistress, as the chiefest deity his heart
pretended to adore; however, she, as if nature as well as art had taught a more
beseeming quickness then ordinary, fortified with those instructions she had
received from her Governesse that gave her confidence, prevented her kinsmans
addresses with these words:

Cousin said she, if my necessary employment has made me seem rude in that
entertainment your kind visit merited from me, I must desire you, rather to
interpret my omission to the presumption I had in those ties that have united
us in blood, then any fault my governesse has committed in my education, upon
which score I am bold to ask your pardon, for your over long stay in expecting
my company. Cassianus finding himself saluted in this manner, not only
contrary to custom, but his own expectation, since formerly all her discourses
were rather marks of civility, then testimonies of affection; stood some time
amazed, as if his imagination could not be satisfied in that truth which his
ears heard uttered; But after he had a little put off that pleasing
distraction that anew captivated his senses, though in a trembling posture, he
returned her this answer.

Truly Madam said he, if the greatest Emperor in the world had been so
bountifully repayed for whole ages of attendance upon so beautiful a goddess,
certainly he would have made no question of his satisfaction, but rather have
given his whole domination of the earth for such a purchase; much less must I
esteem my self injured that only live by your pleasure. O my Lord answered the
Princess, since your expressions fly so high a pitch, I shall begin to think
it necessary to defend my reputation against your complements; but yet upon
better consideration, I am of opinion it is much safer to confess my self
overcome by your courtefie, then venture more blows in counequall a combat,
where your wit will be sure to have the victory: And with these words taking
him by the hand she led him into a fair Balcony that had a large prospect over
the goodly River of Pactole, where long they had not remained (the Princess in
the mean time casting her eyes down the River, upon whose banks was seated
that pleasant house of her Fathers that first gave Cassianus entertainment when
he came into Lydia) before she used this language, though a sweet shower of
tears opened the passage for her words: I cannot said she but with some grief
remember the innocent times that gave both you and me meeting in yonder place,
when my Father seemed to triumph in glory, that is now unfortunately
metamorphosed into a Garrison of Soldiers, who perchance neither honor
dignity, nor know goodness, much less practice virtue.

Indeed said Cassianus, as I must confess those respects I then received from
your most noble Father, and my affectionate Uncle were far beyond my poor
deserts, which gives me more occasion at present to lament his condition, in
being Subject to such a cruelty, that no power of mine is able to redeem, yet I
cannot also but remember my own losses at that time, since even then I quitted
the liberty of my soul, that until this present I could never recover again;
though I have sought all ways of redemption; and unless you prove more
merciful then the Kings oppressors, I shall not only remain in as great a
captivity, but have cause to accuse you of the like Tyranny, though I dare not
be so bold in my complaints.

But yet Cousin said Cloria, I must make a great deal of difference in the
nature of your sufferings, though I should grant the quality; for as the King
has by all means possible strived to give his oppressors satisfaction,
provided it may not be against the right of his Successors, and good of his
people; so you of the other side violently aim at your own content, to the
injuring perhaps of another Title. Alas Madam answered Cassianus, was I not
your first and last lover? the silent rocks can give sufficient testimonies of
the one, when at that famous hunting, I retired under their protections, only
to make my complaints, and the whole Senate can witness the other: by my
importunities; wherefore no interest is to be esteemed equal to my
pretentions, either in affection or right.

Alas, alas answered the Princess, you never let me know those powerful
affections before other respects had taken full possession of that heart which
became also in some sort a prisoner not to be released, who perhaps might as
well have been your Captive, if your omissions had not proved most unfortunate
to your purposes. And whereas you say, you are my last lover, I beseech you do
but consider Farezius intentions, and look upon his actions, and you will
find both violence and power has discovered a later scene, then what you
moved in, when you saved the old Flamins life, so that I must tell you, that
unless punctually you observe the condition according to your former
agreement, which was never to press my love to any conclusion, if Narcissus
were living, to whose living, to whose memory I must still observe that
decorum, I vow by the gods never to entertain any motions from your addresses,
much less give any consent to a future marriage; besides you must perform
those actions that may render you capable of satisfaction, as my self freedom
in granting; which can never be as long as the General has opportunity to
prevent and power to constrain. Wherefore in brief, you are to study some
opposition answerable to his greatness for both our advantages, whereby the
better to merit my love, as to show your self worthy the name of a Prince of
so great an extraction.

These discourses of Cloria could not choose but nettle the ears of Cassianus
toward the resolution of sufficient ambitions; since hitherto he conceived
himself to have been over sloathfull, as well in her love as his own honor;
so that standing some time in a deep muse, as if he intended to fetch his
determinations from his very soul, at last he broake out into this language:
Most fair and wise Princess said he, as already I have promised my best
endeavors with the expense of my dear blood (in which you have the dearest
interest) in your service against the proud General; so I must be prescribed
by your directions to such limitations and performances as I am to observe for
fear, that else my actions may either endanger your safety to be more valued
then the worlds Empire, or ruin your Fathers hopes, whose sufferings cannot be
exampled. Therefore I beseech you let me know how far your pleasure may
travel in that journey I intend to make against the pride of ambitious
Farezius.

Cousin said Cloria, as I shall leave my Governesses experience to treat with
you about the particulars, so of the other side, I am content to give you these
assurances of my affections, that after Narcissus you shall have the next place
in my consideration, provided you think of my Fathers sufferings, and be
mindful of your own honor, since without him I cannot give away my self, and
without your reputation you are but half a Prince. Upon these conditions you
shall find my Lodgings ever ready to entertain your visits, so they may be
seasonable and not scandalous, which I believe are favors sufficient to
nourish your hopes, according to those expressions you received under my hand
in that Letter, your seeming neglect of my condition forced from me, which is
all for the present I have to say upon this theme, unless it be to add to
your consideration, how is it possible you can either reap fruits from my
affection, if Farezius continue great? or what probability have you again to
recover your lost Country of Iberia, if all regality be suppressed? since in the
one his greatness may perhaps constrain me to an unwilling consent for my
own preservation, as the other by this means may so fill Lydia with popular
desires, that your birth and blood, much less dignity shall find no
entertainment in their considerations. Wherefore I say, join your thoughts only
to such designs as shall be contrived by the Nobility with the State of Syria;
wherein the Myssians seem also to have a share, in regard the Lords govern all
in their Country, and by that means you will best please my desires.

Although Cassianus could not disprove the Princess Rhetoric, for that it
taught him a duty belonging to his quality, which he had not hitherto
altogether followed, since he more looked upon his own private concernments, in
complying with his Uncles enemies, then those rights that belonged to the
dignity and honor of Princes, of which number himself was eminent by blood
and alliance: yet in regard of those hopes that Cloria gave him by her fair
language, and good entertainment, he was sufficiently pleased with her
discourse, for that it spoke at leastwise liking, if not love to his ears:
however, it seemed mixed with some reserved conditions, which he was content
only to interpret bashful assurances, though the gods were privy to other
intentions, that could not be altered; wherefore as if joyfully assured by the
Princesses words, and impatient of more delay to put in execution what he was
enjoined after he had returned humble thanks not only for her free expressions,
but the confidence she had in his services, with some other complements
belonging to his love, and fit for the season, kissing her fair hands he took
his leave, vowing the absolute performance of all her commands to the uttermost
of his power: but being gone, the Princess used these words to Roxana, fearing
belike her own dissimulation was too great a crime.

Do you believe said she, that the gods will be content with my hypocrisy, in
making this poor Princes affections, a stale to our other purposes, since you
know my virtuous engagements are so far from suffering me to become his wife,
that my heart dares fcarce think of such a persuasion in any kind; and as
little should I be willing such a report should reach the ears of absent
Narcissus, who perhaps will accuse my constancy for having only deceived, in
that nature for his better advantage: no no Roxana be confident, as plain
dealing is best in all moral actions, so certainly in love the contrary
procures either hate, jealousy, or despair, which may produce effects
dangerous, if not destructive. After the old woman with a kind of smile had
heard out her Mistresses discourse, she returned her this answer.

As I cannot deny said she, but dissimulation in it self, is a flattering vice
that steals upon many dispositions with certain possible if not probable
signs of lawfulness, because they are contented to be persuaded by their
imaginations, they mean no hurt in their intention, which notwithstanding I
must confess, destroys all moral conversation; yet in all respects of the
contrary, for a person to uncover his breast upon every occasion, without
leaving himself a defense against his crafty enemy, were a madness capable to
ruin his fortunes as often as the opportunity presented the means. Wherefore
Madam, in the general I can only give this rule, when a body is left at
liberty whether he will speak or no, let him rather hold his peace, then so
much as intimate a falsehood by his words, or in friendly conversation appear
not candid and satisfactory: but if in deep examinations that may produce
great consequences either of good or hurt, for my part I am of opinion, all art
possible may be used to avoyde the determination, provided a direct untruth be
not admitted; or the damage of a third party sustained by the concealment.

But Roxana said the Princess, for that you intend this discourse for my
satisfaction, I pray let us apply it to my case with my Cousin, whom you see I
have won into a belief of what I never intend. It Is true said Roxana, however
it does not appear you have engaged your self either by words or actions; and
therefore it is not any thing you have done has constrained or persuaded his
belief; wherefore it ought only to rest upon the fault of his own fancy, if he
prove deceived in his expectation hereafter. Besides, it may be considered,
that as he has been some part of the occasion of your suffering unjustly, so
is it fit he should endure a little penance for that offense; and put case it
may be granted that you have after a manner deluded his thoughts by the Letter
you wrote him, wherein you seem to envite his addresses to a new Courtship,
yet it cannot be esteemed false, for that you may have a resolution to
entertain his affection, if my Lord Narcissus (whom the Gods defend) should
miscarry. I but there Governesse, replied Cloria lies hidden the deceit, since
my resolutions are fixed never to make any other choice in life or death. Why
then answered Roxana, at the worst you do but like an honest person in danger
to be robbed, that takes some liberty to make thieves fall out, whereby to be
the better secured: And seeing that Cassianus cannot be prejudiced by the
practice, but on the contrary reap benefit, for that his fortunes seem to
depend upon regallity and Nobility, which the rude multitude would destroy; I
see no reason why you should possess your thoughts with such scruples. Well,
well said the Princess, as you are my Governesse, in this doubt I will
persuade my conscience to observe your principles; however, the gods may punish
us both for our overmuch boldness, thus to play too freely with those
injunctions that concern religion; or at leastwise may have some relation to
it; however, I cannot deny, but that there is a necessity in my dissimulation
at this present; and the rather am I content a little to practice the faculty,
for that I know Cassianus can sustain no prejudice by my intentions.

Notwithstanding these and other reasons which Roxana used at diverse times,
proved sufficient motives to retain her mistress firm in prosecuting their
designs; yet understanding by Creses amongst other discourses, that the Duke
of Cyprus was dead, she could not in some sort but be doubtful of the safety
of Narcissus, for that they had heard nothing from him since his separation;
however, she was extremely careful to keep these thoughts from entering into
the bosom of the already too much troubled Princess, though in the interim
she omitted no opportunity whereby to instruct Cassianus in that part he was to
play by their appointment against Farezius.

Cassianus as I said, having received both commands from Cloria, and
instructions by Roxana, consulted oftentimes with himself as well as with her
how he might best put them in execution, until at last he fell upon this
resolution; that as Dimogoras his trusty friend, had been most injured by the
preferment of Farezius, having outed him of his place and command in the Army,
so would he be the fittest person to be communicated with all, concerning the
likeliest way to prosecute his designs, according to the directions he had
received: To this effect he intended to make him acquainted with the hopes he
had lately received to obtain the favor of the Princess Cloria in his
pretended love; The rather for that he knew he was not only a man who had a
principal interest among the Nobility and chief Senators, but was also
extremely beloved in the Army, by most of the common Soldiers, that were not
absolute creatures of Farezius: wherefore one morning before Dimogoras was gone
out of his chamber, Cassianus came unto him with a smiling countenance, and
this language in his mouth:

Dimogoras said he, as it were something impertinent again for me, to
reiterate the multitude of my obligations to your endeavors, since they are
not only generally known to all the world, but diverse times have been
acknowledged by my expressions in particular: so my business at present is to
make you acquainted anew, both with my thoughts and intentions concerning some
late passages: I came into Lydia as you know by your procurement to prosecute
my affections to the fair Princess the Kings daughter when she was taken
prisoner by the Senates Fleet in Pergame. It Is true my courtships in that
nature, were something retarded, if not absulutely laid aside until the
present, by reason of a certain correspondency between her, and Narcissus the
Duke of Cyprus son: This gives me occasion to tell you, that however I found
her then backward to my wishes; either proceeding from her flattering fancy
that Narcissus was living, or conceiving her own condition was much more secure
in the Senates custody, then at present under the jurisdiction of the Army and
Soldiers, or rather I may say being violently pressed to some inconveniences, by
reason of the extraordinary greatness, (both in command and authority) of
Farezius, who as it should seem pretends something violently to her love and
affection; Now she is become more tractable, and willing to entertain those
protestations of mine, whose effects I have ever consecrated to her service,
since I had the honor to be entertained by the good will of the Lydian people:
I need not trouble you much with the repetitions of your own received injuries
by reason of the generals greatness, notwithstanding all those gallant
services, which you have performed, in the defense and safety of the
Commonwealth, neither shall I mention the consequences thereby, that threaten a
kind of destruction, to all the Nobility of the Kingdom; for that I know your
judgment, and their apprehensions, cannot possbly be wanting in this
particular: only I must needs tell you that the Princess Cloria her self,
extremely wonders how it is possible, you should dispense so much with your
honor and reputation as to bear those indignities that have cast you from
your authority and command, with such an extreme quiet pacification? Are the
Nobility said he of Lydia, so much degenerated in their souls and spirits, as
easily in this manner to quit their honor, to the lowest conditions the people
shall direct? what is become of the magnanimity of mind, once so frequently
reigning in the breasts of the better sort of men in this Kingdom, that is now
lost in a chaos of confusion with the rabble or common multitude? does a little
sensual fear, bury all considerations of valor and gallantry in this Nation?
people being only given to eat and drink, without affectation of greatness
or apprehension of disgrace: If it be so my Lord in the general, my words will
be as much in vain to be uttered, as your life in effect will be miserable in
the future: but I have more confidence in the courage of Dimogoras, both for
his own sake and my good: This being said, Cassianus rested silent to hear
what reply Dimogoras would make.

Dimogoras I may say continued altogether mute for something a long space: his
eyes sparkling out in the interim nevertheless a certain kind of seeming
desire of revenge, though his body overgrowne with flesh and humor, appeared
not to be much inclinable to action: but being wakened to some determinate
answer, by the importunities of Cassianus (who belike himself had been
strongly urged by Roxana, to be speedy in the execution of her design) at last
he blutterd out this reply.

My Lord said he, I must confess, that both my self and the rest of the
Nobility of Lydia according to the Princesses apprehension, (whose Father
however I love not, nor ever shall) have wound their dignities and honors,
into such a labyrinth of inconvenience, by complying so much with the violent,
and confused humors of the common people, that we have in a manner suffered
Farezius with the rest of his faction, to overthrow already the most essential
part of our hereditary honors and privileges; and by that means are become
less powerful, to act any thing with advantage either to our selves or
others: nevertheless perhaps, I may yet set on foot something of faction
amongst the Soldiers, (if they have not wholly lost the remembrance, that I
once commanded amongst them) that may perchance produce effects tending to
those purposes you have designed: with these words he entered into some rage
and passion, as it were out of the very apprehension of his own loss of
reputation, in being so disgracefully turned out of his command: presently
after this he took his leave of Cassianus, as pretending he would go to the
Senate, to try his friends constitutions concerning those designs he intended:

Cassianus was glad he had got thus much from his resolutions (for
notwithstanding he did not at all doubt his affection, yet he might have some
cause to suspect his activity) so that he determined himself also, to use the
best interest he had, both with the Lords and the rest of the Senators, whom he
knew to be of a contrary faction to Farezius: withal he had upon all occasions
free admittance into the Princesses lodgings, according to her own allowance
and Roxana's directions; which as it may be thought, sufficiently contented his
apprehension.

It was not long before Dimogoras and the rest of the Nobility, raised
considerable factions and mutinies in the Army, amongst the Soldiers, they
also being enflamed by their want of pay, and not performance of other
conditions promised them upon their first taking up Arms against the King,
being since renewed again to their hopes, when he was delivered out of prison,
by some Troops sent to that purpose, which suddenly called away both Farezius
and Hercrombrotus to the appeasing of the stirs.

Though Farezius, did with fair language and promising words in a short
speech, seemingly pacify most of their discontents, yet Hercombrotus, who was
of a more violent and active nature, finding many of the Troops continue still
their mutinies, and insolences against their command, suddenly flew in amongst
those Soldiers with fury in his looks, and terror in his countenance, where
presently seizing upon two or three of those that appeared most refractory and
disobedient, he delivered them instantly over to officers to be executed and
punished: After this he not only offered a free pardon to the rest, but also
promised them a real performance of all their just expectations, provided that
from thence forward, they would continue obedient and constant in their
affections.

After this, when both Farezius and Hercrombrotus were on their way again
toward the City of Sardis, an officer of the Army began this discourse to his
General: Sir said he, by this late mutiny, you may see the danger not only of
Dimogoras interest amongst the Soldiers, but the power he has with those of
the better sort of Senators; from which original, I suppose, has proceeded in
part these now appeased troubles in the Camp: of the other side can you
possibly conceive that after so many testimonies of disaffection from Euarchus
the King, he will be ever brought to be either entire for the Soldiers
advantage, or be weaned from that affection without reason, he has always
expressed to be in his nature, for his false and ungrateful country men the
Myssians? in like manner, with what confidence can we any more trust the
actions of the wealthy City of Sardis, when as they did not only refuse, to
open their purses to our occasions in our greatest necessities, but denied us
entrance into their Town, by the persuasion of those Senators that we have
now sent to banishment? These things being granted to be true, the next
consideration ought to be had of the remedy for future prevention: In the first
place, to compass our designs, and procure our security, we must endeavor to
join with a prevailing party in the Senate, or at leastwise make them so by
the Soldiers power, who may pass an absolute decree, to have no more Treaties
with the King, in regard that those hopes and fears, do not a little distract
the whole Kingdom, from relying absolutely upon our commands and jurisdiction,
as you know most necessary for the peoples safety: in the next place we are
totally to suppress the interest of Dimogoras for the present, and the
Nobillities privileges in the future, which as I must tell you keep up such an
opinion amongst all sorts of people, concerning their greatness and
stabillity, that it will be a very difficult matter, to act any thing either
for the Kingdoms good or the Armies advantage: Lastly, we must not only drive
the Myssian Commissioners out of our Country, who only wait occasions to suck
up all the benefit to themselves and Nation, which the Lydians at any time
shall either fight or toil for, but in some terrifying way or other procure
money from the Citizens of Sardis, whereby to give just and fitting content to
those faithful and loving Soldiers, that have fought so many bloody Battles,
and obtained multitudes of signal victories in their Countries behalf,
against their numerous enemies.

Though Farezius by reason of his melancholy and silent nature, made no great
reply at the present, to those reasons that had been delivered, yet it was not
many days after their arrival at Sardis, before an absolute decree passed the
Senate, that not only there should be no more Treaties, or addresses made unto
Euarchus, concerning any agreement either in the general or particular, but it
was also ordered, that it should be esteemed a crime of a most high
consequence, for any person so much as to make tender of any proposition to
that effect, to the rest of the Senators there assembled: which resolution was
quickly published over the whole Kingdom of Lydia by a formal proclamation.

Of the other side Dimogoras finding, both his interest in the Army and his
credit with the Senators did not any way suit with his ambition and
expectation, upon the very apprehension (as it was thought) of these apparent
disgraces, in a very few days ended his life in this world; however there were
some that not only gave it out, but believed, that he had been poisoned, to
prevent a farther trouble and danger to the Kingdom: This also gave occasion
to Prince Cassianus within a very short time after, to quit personally the
Country of Lydia, as perhaps supposing, now his chief friend and Favorite
Dimogoras was gone, and the rest of the Lords not being in a capacity to
support his honor and designs, against the Soldiers, in the Princess
Clorias behalf, it was to little purpose any longer to prosecute his pretended
love.

Nevertheless the Nobillity, with many other of the Senators of the same
faction, prepared themselves to give the body of Dimogoras, most stately and
glorious Funerals: To this intent, when the day came, all attired in black,
they met the corpse with a world of ceremony, and so conducted it through a
multitude of people, to the place ordained for that purpose, where being placed
according to the custom of other Generals, the flames quickly consumed the
pyles whilst that which was immortal, had a farther account to give,
concerning his actions and thoughts during his life.

When the Princess Cloria understood of this strange and unexpected law, not
only pronounced in the Senate, but published all over the Kingdom, she began
now to repent her, of her too much belief given to the Kings enemies,
notwithstanding any persuasion whatsoever, she had entertained in her thoughts;
and consequently had more cause a great deal to doubt her own security,
having no other defense left her but what she could gather from the faithful
and wise Counsels of her entrusted governesse Roxana, which was the occasion,
that one day having for the most part spent her whole store of passion, she
used this kind of despairing discourse unto her.

Truly Roxana said she, as there might be noted at first, a strong jealousy
amongst the Soldiers, by the strict guard set upon the Kings person, so this
last action makes me fear, that there is some prevailing design, as well
against our liberties as his dominion, which we shall be scarce able to prevent
by any industry or assistance; for as I cannot rely much upon the Lords power,
by reason they have altogether lost their authority, by severing their
interests at the first from their Princes prerogative, nothing but to comply
with their own ambition and spleen; so is there as little to be hoped for, from
the endeavors of this great and rich City of Sardis, considering their late
carriages, when Farezius with his triumphant Army, not only entered their Walls
without resistance, but were content to receive his absolute commands, without
the least dispute, belonging to their long enjoyed privileges, never as yet
questioned by any former Prince or power; these representations being known
and granted to be the effects of the late transactions, what probabilities
remain, for the recovery of my fathers rights, though it should be
opinionated, that we our selves were out of all danger personally; since the
Kings party appears, not to have either abillity or will to do him good; And
Lydia being strongly united under the present jurisdiction, what foreign
industry and endeavor soever, can work any considerable effects to his
advantage? considering the many brave Vessels and shipping that are always
ready for defense and resistance, upon the Carian and Ionian shoares, to oppose
either sudden invasion or continued hostility.

When Roxana had for some time rested silent with tears in her eyes, she
returned her this answer: Lady said she, you must then give me leave to blame
your superstitious modesty (as I may call it) in not suffering your Uncle
Orsames to have performed those ceremonies belonging to your Nuptials at
Memphis; which perhaps in part if not totally, would have prevented these
inconveniences.

Indeed Governesse replied the Princess, although perhaps you esteem those
decorums of fitting duty, which I shall be ever ready to render my Father and
Mother, but bashful superstitions, yet I can assure you, I shall never be so
much wanting to my own honor, as rather not a thousand times to venture my
dearest life, then to give away my self to any love whatsoever, without their
inward consent and public approbation: but let us for the present leave that
subject, and only fall upon the consideration, or the means, whereby the King
may be redeemed from his miseries, which Rhetoric would not only far better
please my ears, but be a much more profitable discourse in my opinion, since
in the other point, I am resolved still to remain obstinate, notwithstanding
any persuasion to the contrary.

Truly said Roxana, as I must needs confess, the thing it self is difficult
to bring about and the ways more uncertain to know how; so of the other side,
I am so far from believing the impossibility of the Kings restoration to his
ancient dignity, that according to my own thoughts I shall give you very
probable reasons, whereby to persuade you to it, if my fancy does not much out
go my judgment.

For although I cannot deny, but that the Country of Lydia being thoroughly
united under a well settled government, with the addition of Ionia, and Caria,
that afford so many considerable havens, furnished with multitude of shipping,
is a condition scarce to be attempted by any power; yet considering the
impatience of the peoples natures, with the daily oppressions of them by the
heavy weight of Taxations, a quick division will be wrought in the hearts of
those, that must of necessity be won to the change of laws, and government
before the ancient constitutions (by which the Subjects have formerly lived
happily for so many ages) can be totally taken away: However for the present,
perhaps either fear or hope exercises so far men's thoughts, that hardly as
yet have they leisure for consideration: but when as, I say, they shall find
this is like to be perpetual, they will with much violence desire again their
old subjection, though at first they were foolishly persuaded to seek a new
government. And more especially if those two great Monarchs of Syria, and
Egypt once make that accord, that all Asia attends with a greedy expectation,
which may soon be effected, since the King of Armenia has already agreed with
his discontented Princes, and also has condiscended to give satisfaction to
the Scythian Crown, whereby to deliver his Country absolutely from that
power, that has so many years molested it with its arms.

But Roxana said the Princess, what will those agreements conduce to my
fathers benefit, when every Prince regards only his own concernments? besides
their extreme jealousy of one another glory will not suffer them to
undertake any conquest jointly: And put case they should accord constantly in
their purposes, yet when the people of Lydia shall see themselves ready to be
invaded by a foreign power, they will certainly more strongly conform their
obediences, to this jurisdiction they now live under, whereby the better to
prevent a new threatening danger.

It is true said Roxana until the Subjects be made more desperate in their
sufferings, the people will not be content to trust strangers with their
liberty; but yet the assistance that is desired from foreign Princes needs
not to consist wholly in numerous Armies, but in small and frequent supplies
both of men and moneys, which joined with the Kings party, and laying hold of
the many discontents already engendered in the hearts of most, cannot but
conduce exceedingly to the overthrow of this new government. Besides there is
another benefit that may be expected from other Countries, being at open
difference with the Senate of Lydia; and that is, denying their Merchants the
liberty of Trade within their dominions, which at last must of necessity
discontent and impoverish the rich City of Sardis, from whence the Soldiers
are (if not maintained) at leastwise supplied upon all urgent occasions.

But why answered Cloria may not these Princes, and especially the two great
Monarchs of Egypt and Syria, as well forbid the free commerce you speak of in
the time of their own differences, as when they shall be at peace between
themselves, if they have any intention to right my father, as I have heard they
do pretend?

Because, replied Roxana, they are both so full of their own ambition, that
neither dares offend the State of Lydia as yet, until their Wars be at an
end between themselves, least they might give too much advantage to each other
by the assistance of so powerful a Kingdom as this is.

Then said the Princess, there may be some hopes to better my fathers
affairs, when these Kings shall think it good to put up their bloody swords,
and not before.

I conclude not so Madam, answered Roxana, for although these exasperated
Princes against their own quiet should have neither temper in their actions,
nor find wisdom in their councillors, until mere necessity should
constrain their Subjects to seek peace with violence, which were too dangerous
a president; yet it is to be hoped that the Myssians with the Cretan Forces
joined to the discontents of Lydia, by reason of diversity of Religions and
interests would in time restore the King to his ancient dignity.

Pish Roxana, replied Cloria; for the Myssians, I have so little confidence in
their assistance, that what countenance soever their actions put on, I can
scarce be persuaded of their intentions, since they once sold my father to this
misery he now undergoes; when they had a gallant Army in the Field to have
redeemed both his person, and his Crown; And for the Cretans, besides that
they are of a different profession to ours concerning the worship of the gods;
there are also so many factions amongst them by way of private ambition, that
they rather go back daily in their own affairs, then show any probabillity
of helping others; And for the discontents of Lydia which you mention, with
their diversities of Religions, I do not find upon all occasions, but they
can very well lay down their own spleenes, when there appears a necessity to
oppose my fathers prosperity: Lastly, concerning the common peoples sufferings,
I am persuaded, they are resolved to endure any subjection, or almost bondage
it self, rather then to be willing the King should recover again his lost
rights, by force and power of the sword, without making first some conditions
with his prorogative, notwithstanding he has diverse times, given them by
protestations, what assurances could be desired from a just, and a religious
Prince.

Madam, answered Roxana, your opinion I must confess is grounded upon a great
deal of probabillity, considering how the Myssians not only sold the King to
the power of the Senate, but at the first beginning of these troubles came into
Lydia to dispute your fathers rights: But yet if you please to consider, that
the reason of their actions then proceeded from the extreme covetousness of
some eminent persons amongst them who find now they can expect no more gain
(the Senate having already compassed their ends upon them) you will easily
believe, that they are resolved to change the scene for your fathers
advantage, since by that means they may come to play a double game, and win
by the bargain: Next concerning the Cretans although I must confess their
foolish divisions amongst themselves have not only much hindered the Kings
affairs, and in a manner endangered the whole frame of their own designs, yet
is there such a disparity between them, and the people of Lydia, not only in
regard of the difference of Religion, but in that we have outed them formerly
of much of their Lands; that they will dye to the last man, rather then suffer
the Senate to bear rule over them: Thirdly, I must desire you not to dwell too
strictly upon your belief, that the common people of Lydia will so easily
accord their difference, and pacify their discontents, upon the appearance of
a strange Army; in regard it will only bring with it the right of the cause,
with a promise of amendment; especially when they shall by a little more
experience find, that their present grievances have neither termination nor
limitation; For I say, that as at the first they were persuaded to entertain
the assistance of the Myssians, whom they most hated, and feared of all other
Nations, against their King, who oppressed them in nothing, however their
fancies did injure their judgments, so will they as well accept of any
foreign assistance against the Senate, when they can no longer endure the
burden of their oppressions: And last of all give me leave to tell you, that
the divisions within the Army and Senate house, cannot but produce strange
effects, since no spleen is so great, as what is in gendred by the same
faction, when once they fall at odds, either by reason of gain or prerogative:
But as she was further proceeding in her discourse, the dwarf informed them,
that there was newly arrived in the Castle hall a young Maid of an excellent
beauty, who desired with much earnestness, to be brought presently into the
Princess presence, as pretending she had some secret to discover, not
convenient to be imparted to any other ear; he also said, that as her eyes
sparkled forth a kind of youthful Majesty, so did her neglectfull dress,
seem to have been disordred by her late journey, which made her appear more
Amazon like.

This strange advertisement put them both into a sollicitous consideration, as
well concerning the person of the party, as the occasion of the adventure; And
many loving desires would gladly have persuaded poor Cloria, that Narcissus had
borrowed another disguize, to have given her a new visit: but having more
exactly examined her little servant concerning all particulars, she found the
stranger neither in stature or countenance could agree with the proportion or
features of her absent Lord: Wherefore after some more displeasing
consideration, with a kind of a sad voice, as if her thoughts were troubled at
the mistake, she commanded the Page to conduct the Maid to her presence.

As soon as the damsel entered the room, with confidence enough, approaching
nearer to the Princess in an abrupt manner, told her though softly in her
ear, that her new guest was no other but her brother Ascanius broake from his
imprisonment under the Senates jurisdiction; wherefore wished her for some time
to discharge her dwarf, that he might more freely discourse to her his
adventures.

Cloria was so much confounded with a sudden joy, to have her sweet brother in
her possession, whom she could not be permitted to see during their
imprisonment; that her distractions could scarce find a way, to put in
execution, what her own judgment, should have thought convenient at another
season: But at last breaking through her pleasant amazement, she discharged her
little officer; for however she was accustomed to trust him in her own secrets,
yet she would not notwithstanding use any privilege to hazard her brothers
confidence, least it might render him less assured of his safety: When she had
passionately demonstrated his welcome, by many affectionate kisses, taking his
white hand in hers, which seemed also to have a near alliance in beauty, she
desired him to make her acquainted with the passages of his escape, since as
she said, they could not but be admirable, considering the strict guard the
Senate was ever accustomed to set over the Kings children; in the interim
Roxana curiously attended to understand the discourse that was to proceed from
such dainty lips.

Wherefore after Ascanius had saluted his sisters looks, with three or four
gentle smiles, in which he seemed lovely to congratulate his own fortune and
deride his Goalers carelessness, he began this repetition, though first he
excused himself, for many circumstances belonging to the story.

My father said he, as he had commanded my brother Prince Arethusius for his
better safety, into the Kingdom of Syria, there to attend the directions of
our noble mother, so was he persuaded by the Myssians (in whose power he then
remained in the Army) to get me into his own possession, whereby the better to
secure (as they pretended) as many as might be of the blood royal; To this
purpose he commanded me to make an escape, and presently to repair to his
presence; however with this caution, that if I should be prevented in the
execution, I must not by any means reveal his desire; least the Myssians
should be brought into suspicion, who were then treating with the Senate about
their payment.

But be their pretenses what they would, I strengthened my duty and obedience,
by all the thoughts my young years and less discretion could suggest,
advantageable to the design and the Kings command, which I must tell you
scarce gave sleep to my eyes in the night, or rest to my body in the day, since
truly I must needs say, my youthful ambition became more violent then
ordinary, to do something exactly that might pretend to care and wisdom.

Yet not to trouble you with long repetitions, where the success proved
unfortunate, I was to my intolerable grief taken in my escape, though more
perplexed I must confess, to be foiled in my first interprize, then sorrowful
at the consequence of the loss: being apprehended I was by order of the
Senate, exactly examined before such Commissioners, as their gravities ordained
to be judges of my actions: However the gods so far favored my weak
constancy, that neither tyranny nor flattery, was able to shake my dutiful
resolution, which so enraged their froward spleens, that they not only caused
me to be shut up in a dark room, but commanded some slight punishment to be
inflicted upon my person, as a small combatant in my fathers quarrel, at which
I rather laughed then seemed to feel: But not finding these petty sufferings
could prevail against my spirit, they ordered a great part of my diet to be
taken from me, as supposing belike my belly was easiest to be conquered, when
truly I never esteemed meat the chief part of my consideration; especially
when I was assured for their own sakes, they would afford me sufficient to
sustain nature: yet at last having tried all other ways to compass their
ends, without receiving any fruit from their labors, they withdrew from me
those accustomed respects belonging to my birth and quality, which I cannot
deny, but most wrought upon my disposition; for that I conceived the dignity of
my parents, as also your self sweet sister suffered in the omission.

To be short, finding themselves wholly overcome by the goodness of my cause,
rather then by my courage, they began of a sudden to change (though not the
theater) yet the manner of their action; which was not only to sweeten their
carriages toward me, but also to tickle up my young ambition, with hopes of
being their elected King. For as they said, my father having totally abused his
trust, and my eldest brother Arethusius being unkindly fled from their
protection, they could find none other so fit a person to undertake the
government of the whole Kingdom as my self, if I would but express love in my
nature and be ruled by their Counsels, for their intentions as they protested
were never to destroy Monarchy: But I being enflamed with a new rage to hear
them to scandalize my fathers goodness, and go about to withdraw my duty by
their intentions, I answered that as my father had been much too gentle a
Prince for such people; so was their dissimulation no more to be believed
concerning my self in these offers, then when they protested to the world to
make Euarchus the greatest King of Asia; And in the mean time had to the
uttermost of their power deprived him of his Crown and dignity.

This blunt and resolute reply of mine, belike gave them no further
encouragement to proceed; for telling me, I was a pevish child, and could not
be brought to understand my own good, they not only quitted my company, but by
degrees suffered again the stream to return into its right course, to my
singular content; which however continued me still a prisoner.

Having past over so great a storm without shipwreck either of my own honor,
or danger to my fathers affairs, I began to conceive good opinions of my
judgment, and beginning likewise to be extreme weary of my captivity, since
my years now required activity, I fell into many considerations of another
escape; and had encouragement to put it in execution, not only by daily rumors
I heard of the discontents of the people, for that they found no inclination of
the Senate to agree with the King; but also, for that I understood many of the
Kings ships had lately revolted from their service: All which I say enflamed my
thoughts to a new design, and these inflammations of hope, desire, and passion,
made me diligent to procure the good opinion of those that were entrusted with
my person, as a necessary consequence to my intention. I oftentimes demanded of
them to what end was it to use rigor in my imprisonment, when it might turn to
their prejudice, if our side should hereafter prevail; neither could it at all
benefit them for the present with their masters by any rewards, if they
continued still in authority?

These persuasions with other circumstances, took them off from the fierceness
of their speed, especially when they had heard that Farezius was forced to send
many of his Troops abroad, to reduce some Provinces again to his obedience,
that rather chose to run into desperate dangers, then still to continue under
the Senates power.

These encouragements I say, made me begin to frame those Embryons I had
already conceived in my unsettled brain to some shape, proper for production;
and to this purpose, descending from generals to particulars, I acquainted a
servant I have now brought along with me, (whom I always found faithful to my
intentions) that my resolution was, in this distracted season to gain my
liberty out of the Castle; and therefore wished him to provide for my escape
such necessaries as were convenient for a business of so great consequence,
that concerned not only my own safety, but my fathers prosperity, but in the
interim to color my design, I gave it out that I intended to solemnize the
birth day of my brother, by a public Mask, to be acted for the delight of
those Soldiers of my guard: When the night came (having all the afternoon
before filled their brains with the fumes of excellent Wine, as their
imagination with the expectation of the story of Jupiter, flying from the ill
natured rage of his cruel father) after they were all orderly placed in their
seats, I caused the scene to be discovered, which appeared to their view of
so taking a quality, that they had no leisure at all to attend their charge, so
that I had liberty sufficient by their willing or careless neglect, to pass
diverse times without my accustomed attendants, through the Galleries into my
private bed chamber, as pretending I had some necessary office in the Play; but
at last finding they were all either sufficiently secured in their employment
of curiosity, or past consideration by reason of their over liberal diet, I
more secretly retired into my Cabinet, where I had appointed my servant to
attend with woman's apparel: which robes being soon fitted to my person, so
well suited with my imagination, that I carried my self with much confidence
amongst the multitudes of company in every room, when I came into the common
hall, my servant ushered me as some Masquer to the door; where the Porter made
no difficulty to give us passage, as believing it was a necessary duty
belonging to his office, not to be at all jealous in such joviality, least his
fellows might have derided him for his ridiculous caution.

But however, I got thus prosperously from the danger of all the Courts of
guard, yet the last centinell either bitten with his servile attendance in the
open air, whilst his other companions in warm rooms enjoyed content, or
being by nature more suspicious then the rest of his fellows, began strictly,
not only to examine our intentions, but roughly to deny our passage, in so much
as my fervant not believing it was safe to admit of such a hazardable
contention, quickly drew out a short hanger he had by his side, and gave him a
blow upon the pate, that made him ask counsel of the ground for the rest of
his proceedings, whether the wound was mortal or no, we left him only to
consider, whilst we made our passage, free in the night season, through a thick
wood not far distant from the Castle, until the breaking of the morning,
constrained us to seek refuge in a dark cave, where we continued all the next
day for fear of discovery, since we doubted not, but my flight would soon be
pursued with open cry.

When the sky began again to be obscured for our advantage after the going
down of the Sun, we thought it best to take a new journey toward the City of
Sardis, where confusion we supposed would secure us, until we could find a
convenient transportation for Syria; however our weariness, and want of food
compelled me the next day about noone, to take up my habitation in a small
Cottage under a hill side, in whose dwelling there only remained an old man
with his wife, having between them as the fruits of their long marriage one
daughter, which by the way must occasion a pretty short story: We no sooner
entered the house, but being provoked by a sufficient appetite, we called for
such provision as they had, promising a large payment, and they as willingly
condiscended to our desires, in which office the maid seemed most diligent, not
only in regard of her own good huswifery, but being exceedingly delighted, as
might be gathered by her smiling countenance at my strange attire; in the house
there was but two beds, the one where the old people lay, and the other for the
young wench; so that I was to take up my rest necessarily in the Girls bed,
where I must confess, I slept to my content, whilst my attendant made use of a
bundle of straw in an out house for his lodging: but in the morning I might
feel, not only one in bed with me, but the party to have her hand over my
breast, whom by more consideration I found to be the young damsel of the
Cottage; This I must confess put me to some confusion, until by a strict
examination of her intention, I perceived it was only her own innocent
curiosity, because she thought me a fine young gentlewoman: At which relation
the Princess could not choose but laugh; the rather for that Ascanius, did with
something a constrained earnestness, strive to defend the wenches chastity, as
if he had been jealous also of his own honor: yet nevertheless he was forced
to confess, the Maid did much question him, because he had no greater breasts;
But having sufficiently cleared his reputation, and jested out the rest, he
again continued his discourse.

Although said he, I had sufficiently satisfied her in all questions concerning
my travels, yet I had much ado to persuade her to rise from me; so much was
she in love with my company, neither would she condescend to my request until
she had again embraced me, bestowing three or four of her kisses upon my
lips; This being performed, and having yawned a pretty space, as a testimony of
her youthful laziness, she suddenly started out of the bed in her smock, that
was not of the finest cloth, where she remained still discoursing with me
until her father, and mother lying in the lower room, gave her a call or two
to hasten her speed, yet I had opportunity enough to enquire of her, not only
the nearest way to Sardis, but of the convenience of the next Town, where I
meant to provide my self of some change of apparel, since I durst not trust
those, which brought me from the Castle.

In conclusion, after I had employed my servant a few days near the place to
buy other Robes; and bestowed my old apparel upon the wench, for a gratuity
of her kindness, in affording me so freely her company the first night, I not
permitting the second I took my leave lovingly of the old people, who truly
had entertained me with an honest Country affection, so that presently
according to our direction, we repaired to the Banks of the River Pactolus,
where we quickly hired a Bark, that without any suspicion at all brought us to
Sardis, which Town sheltred us without discovery, until we found another
convenience to convey us to your Castle, where being arrived, we are confident
you will not betray your guests, but rather advise us by your Counsel, how to
prosecute further my affairs; since it is to be thought, they will make a
sudden and diligent inquiry after my escape. At which words with a pretty smile
the Princess Cloria cast her eyes upon her Governesse, as if she expected from
her experience the best direction for them both.

Roxana, when she had drawn the looks of Ascanius upon her in a curious
manner, since he had not been formerly acquainted with her conversation, and
also mused according to her custom for some short space, she gave this advice.

Truly, said she, as it is most necessary in the prime place, that my Lord
Ascanius provide for his own security, since it is impossible but some speedy
search will be after his escape, the Senate not being willing to part with so
many of the Royal family out of their own jurisdiction; So Madam be pleased to
think it convenient, that the Queen now remaining in Syria, may presently be
made acquainted with this fortunate delivery of my Lord your brother from his
imprisonment by some trusty messenger to be dispatched from our Counsels, which
party may be (as I conceive) this faithful servant, the companion of his
Travels, whom he has now brought along with him into this Castle, who cannot
well remain here in that he will rather prove a Subject of suspicion then an
officer of use, since the daily visits of this place by the Nobility, and other
people of quality must of necessity bring his name in question. And for this
beautiful runaway your brother, since he so well becomes a Maids attire, and
has so bravely given testimony of his own modesty, I see no reason why he may
not still live amongst us, without danger to his own person, or prejudice to
our honors, being entertained as your attendant in your chamber, until either
commands out of Syria call him away, or you your self be removed from the
jurisdiction of this Kingdom, by your happy marriage with my Lord Narcissus;
at which words the Princess became as red as Scarlet, not dreaming her young
brother should so abruptly have been made acquainted with her secret
engagement: But the fault was already committed, and Roxana had no time to ask
forgiveness, wherefore something confounded by her error, as well as she
could she went on with her continued discourse.

However said she, that we may not remain altogether ignorant of the
proceedings of the Senate, I shall industriously endeavor to instruct our
little dwarf, who wants no wit to make such inquiry abroad, as may be most
convenient for our affairs, for whose truth and honesty I will undertake, with
the engagement of my reputation; This may give you a full liberty to enjoy with
freedom each others company, a benefit that neither of you will repine at I am
sure, since the fates have been hitherto penurious to both your conversations;
with these words she rested silent in a kind of a grave smile, expecting the
young couple should sign their consents by some demonstration.

After that Roxana had fully ended her discourse, the lovely pair looked upon
each other, with such a sweet cheerfulness, as if their own passions had no
desire to enquire further after the depth of her reasons, since their hearts
abundantly approved of the consequence of her design, which was that they
might enjoy the felicity of one another conversation; at last Cloria asked her
brother, how he liked the wisdom of her Governesse, which gave him occasion
to tell her, that he did not now wonder how she had passed through the
intricacie of so many dangerous adventures, having had so faithful and
discreet a Pilot to guide her, in the vast sea of such desperate accidents.

In the mean time this delighted company past away their hours in such
conversation, as most tended to Euarchus wished prosperity, sometimes
complaining of the unrelenting cruelty of the Senate, that could so long
detain their just and merciful King in a dark prison, instead of casting
themselves at his feet humbly to desire pardon for their offenses, otherwhiles
again they would entertain their thoughts, with new hopes of his releasement
by powerful Armies sent into Lydia by all the Princes of Asia, in which number
Narcissus had no low rank in the opinion of lovepartiall Cloria; neither
seldom did they agree in belief, that the general distractions of the
Kingdom, would soon put an end to the differences without any other
assistance, until these diversities of fancies carried them one day into the
garden, where Clorias diligent servant in the view of other attendants,
observed so carefully the directions of her charge; that she made always
election of those fruit that the Princess intention did but only covet, and
presented them to be made more beautiful by the touch of her white hand.

In these entertainments I say they continued until an ancient Lord of the
Senate, who had not altogether put off his duty and affection to the Kings
posterity, with a seeming joy that made him forget his accustomed ceremonies to
the Princess Cloria, not only suddenly entered the Garden, but made a kind of
rude passage through the crowd of such as waited near her person; and with a
breathless voice informed her, that, that very morning, as the Nobility were
sitting in their own Council chamber, divided by a partition from the common
assembly of the lower Senate, they were saluted in a tumultuous manner by may
thousands of people (having their leaders of much greater quality) with a
petition, that not only complained of the proceedings of the Army, but defired
they might again speedily enjoy the liberty of their King, the freedom of the
Laws, and an establishment of their Religion, as they said absolutely
obstructed from their possession, by the licentious power of the Soldiers
under Farezius command, whom (as they intimated) they had formerly chosen to be
their Captain for some season, but not to be a tyrant against their
privileges for ever; vowing withal, that as they would not depart the great
City of Sardis without a direct answer, so were they resolved to procure an
accomplishment of their just requests, to the hazard of their lives, and
fortunes.

O Madam, said he, how these brave beginnings, inflamed our souls with new
courages: notwithstanding, we could not choose in some sort, but reflect upon
our own poorness of spirit, or at leastwise dullness in understanding, that
never went about to put in execution what these people propound at present for
their and our advantages.

Truly, replied the Princess Cloria, although I cannot but commend these
peoples understandings, that appear to have some sense and feeling of their
reputations yet must I a great deal more extol their courages, that dare
expose themselves to maintain those small privileges, which by a certain
kind of birthright they have received from their honest and wise ancestors;
when as you of the Nobility, of the contrary, seem altogether stupid in the
apprehension of such honorable rights that appertain to your qualities, left
you by the brave endeavor of your most Noble predecessors: who were at the
first so spleenative indiscreet, in your passions against your Prince (though
without any known cause whatsoever) that you were content to sacrifice your
known own advantages, above the common all people, only that you might but
destroy him and his prerogative; not leaving your selves so much power as to be
able again to recover your own dignities.

These words and reproof of the Princess almost put the Nobleman out of his
tale; but she finding him something out of countenance, encouraged him to the
prosecution of his relation:

Madam, said he, when we had thanked them for their prudent admonition (as we
termed it) what our own duties should have remembered, we presently dismissed
them, with other speeches and promises, that sufficiently contented them for
the instant. After they were gone, I must tell you, we were sent to the other
part of the Senate, sitting in another room distinct from ours; intimating we
desired some conference with them, whereby the people might be rendered
satisfied in their seeming just demands: upon our meeting, many things were
propounded to that purpose, as well concerning our selves as the soldiers; but
what will be the issue of these proceedings, for my part I am not able to
divine: only we are informed, that the multitude will not depart from the City
of Sardis, until they have received such answer, as may in some sort give
content to their thoughts: which either must settle the Kingdom in a probable
posture for peace and quietness, or so inflame the Armies resolutions, that
they will endeavor to become masters of the whole. With these words he
abruptly took his leave, as if his apprehensions had been transported only by
imaginary conceits.

As soon as the Lord had quitted the garden, and the rest of the attendance
being also removed some distance from them, the Princess, Ascanius and Roxana,
began to fall upon confiderations and discourses of the Kings affairs:
sometimes their hopes were carried to assure themselves, that it was
unpossible, but those confusions must needs produce effects to that purpose;
since, as they believed, the soldiers of the Senate could not long agree, and
then the common peoples desires of necessity would again bring him into his
Throne: for they imagined, that however there might be obstacles and
contentions for the present, in regard of the extraordinary power of the army,
yet the soldiers at the last could not but admit of a King, more willingly
then any other General of their own rank to command over them: besides they
doubted not, but the Nobility, and the City of Sardis would join together to
establish Euarchus in the same honor and dignity as he was in before these
late troubles; since the consequences had already not a little impoverished the
whole Kingdom, and what it would do further if it should continue, might very
well be feared, though as yet not certainly known; In that the dignity of a
Court probably, would as well confirm the one in their hereditary privileges,
as enrich the others by traffic and commerce; seeing it was chiefly the
better sort of persons, that took off the commodities of the Merchants.

These pleasant apprehensions invited them all three to take some delight, in a
certain beautiful and refreshing Grote, encompassed round about by an
intricate Labyrinth, or Wilderness of flourishing Trees, that shaded it
sufficiently from the eyes of people: in the midst thereof there was a
Fountain upon the borders, in which was contrived many sorts of Chaces by
dogs and huntsmen; who by the turning of several artificial Cocks, seemed
not only to move in prosecution of their prey, but the hounds with open
mouths barked and made a noise. The prettiness of the conceit, for a long
space gave young Ascanius sufficient content: when they were weary of beholding
of this invention, they went to the viewing of other rarities. There they might
behold Andromeda, with the Sea Monster, coming out of the water to devour
her, whilst her sorrowful parents stood upon the bordering shore, to behold
that woeful and lamenable Tragedy, occasioned as they thought by the too much
severity and cruelty of the gods, until Perseus the son of Dane, that was
courted in a shower of Gold by Jupiter, descended from the skies upon his
flying horse, and seemed to rescue the distressed Lady. There were also to be
seen in that place, diverse Artificers, working in their Trades, only by the
force and current of the water: in like manner, others playing upon several
kinds of Instruments, both delightful to the ear, and pleasing to the
apprehension. Besides, Birds of all species, made of Glass and other
materials, that seemed to chirpe in a natural way, though only so contrived
by the mere invention of men, to give the greater satisfaction to luxurious
sense. After they had as it were glutted their contemplation with these
delightful vanities, the Princess Cloria being better skilled then her brother
in the use of such devices, suddenly turned one of the pipes, which quickly
overspread young Ascanius, with a large Canopy of Water, that resembled a
plentiful, though sweet shower from the heavens, in so much as he knew not at
the instant, how to wind himself out of the inconveniency, until he was
forced to entreat his sisters favor for his redemption; neither did she
altogether afford him that grace, since he became a little wet to purchase a
convenient experience against another time. But Roxana, as if she thought her
Mistress had used something too much severity toward her young brother, began
a needless apology for the action, when she might have known Ascanius could
not be displeased at any thing his sister did. When they had as it were dwelt
long enough upon these watery pleasures, they again returned into their own
lodgings, in which place the metamorposed maid was most careful to observe
those decorums that belonged to her office, and attendance, least the contrary
might have occasioned the endangering of his discovery: where they remained, I
may say, entertaining themselves sometimes with hopes, and sometimes with
fears, until the dwarfes return brought them more certain intelligence, of
many passages both from Sardis and other Regions: however because they desired
to understand his information, in the most methodicall way, in regard the
circumstances as they apprehended, would give a great light to the intentions
on foot, they wished him to tell his story and adventures in order, which he
performed in this manner.

After said he, I parted from this Castle, according to your command I went to
the very door of the Senate House, the best place as I thought for
intelligence; where finding all those that stood without in a most confused
distraction, both in their words and looks, it was not long before many of the
chief Senators, of a sudden came out of the room; when presently they went
with a great deal of haste toward another chamber, where I understood by the
discourses of the multitude, they were designed to meet some of the Lords about
a conference, concerning the settlements of the disorders of the Kingdom. I
being both bold, and little, and so consequently as I thought not much to be
suspected, in the confused crowd thrust in along with them, where placing my
self in a nook of the chamber under a hanging it was my chance to hear these
several discourses from them.

The first sort of Senators that spoke, thought it convenient, if not
altogether necessary, again to settle the King in his ancient dignity, not
only in regard of the extraordinary cries of the common people to that
purpose, but also for that there were so many several factions within
themselves in the Senate, not probable to be reconciled, with any advantage to
the Nation: Others notwithstanding were of a contrary opinion, alleging that
it were better to hazard the ruin of the whole Country in a general
confusion, then to come any more under the jurisdiction of that Tyrannical
government, as they said they had with so much blood already endeavored to
destroy: A third number of that assembly, seemed in some sort to be willing to
restore again Euarchus to his Crown in full luster, but they doubted, least
his unrelenting spleen might put him on, to call the Senate to a strict account
for their past actions, and severity used both against his authority and
person; wherefore wished rather to have some of his posterity Crowned in his
place, whom for such a benefit as they believed, would easily be persuaded to
forgive and forget his fathers injuries: This proposition a long time
entertained their fancies, until they considered, that not only Prince
Arethusius was in the Kingdom of Syria, prosecuting the Queen his Mothers
designs, and my Lord Ascanius his brother had lately by flight procured his
own liberty without their consents, that absolutely beat back any more
discourse upon that subject; however they thought it convenient, if not
extremely necessary for the present, to give what satisfaction they could to
the discontented people, who belike attended in great numbers, about the City
of Sardis to that purpose: yet it was considered with all, that if they should
endeavor altogether to please the multitude, without having their Swords ready
drawn in their hands, whereby to be able to chastize them, if they should
prove too unreasonable in their demands, they must expect dangerous and
insolent affronts, instead of quietness and obedience to their commands: In so
much as they thought it convenient in the interim that they entertained the
peoples expectations, with good words and fair promises, to send privately to
Farezius, wishing him to be ready to march with his Soldiers, to keep the
multitude in due obedience to the Senates authority if they should continue
these extravagant prosecutions of their designs, which in effect being fully
resolved upon by them all, they quickly broake up the Assembly.

So that when they were in this manner dispersed and I had freed my self
undiscovered from their companies, I thought it my duty, to gain what other
intelligence I could amongst the common people, since I conceived, much
consisted in their constant and brave resolutions, to which purpose they seemed
in some sort to have assembled themselves, with an intention to contend against
the present government, by some violent manner of prosecution, though for the
better color of their actions and intentions, they appeared only with
petitions in their hands, instead of other weapons of danger: With these
thoughts I held it my best course to retire into the very heart or body of the
City of Sardis, as well to feel the pulse and constitution of the Inhabitants,
as the likelier to be informed by their intelligence, concerning all other
proceedings of the Kingdom: neither in this design was I much deceived in my
expectation, for sorting my conversation, with watermen and other inferior
people, I understood, that as the rich Citizens of the Town, although they
desire again to have their King to govern over them, though with some
restriction in his power, because they fear his revenge, since otherwise as
they believe, they could probably expect nothing but a general confusion, so
of the other side it is apparent the multitude for the most part desire a
change; not only in regard of the envy they bear to the Senate, who more
absolutely command over their persons and estates then the King ever did in his
greatest glory, but also in regard, they doubt the Soldiers at the last, will
come to be Masters of every man's fortune; which jurisidction of all others,
they most detest in their natures and dispofitions: As I was sufficiently
satisfied in these inclinations of the people, I repaired to the public place
of commerce for the whole City, where (in short) amongst the Merchants I
understood, that not only a great part of the Navy was revolted to the King
(the Mariners being encouraged thereunto by some Senators which Farezius the
General had formerly sent into banishment) but that the Myssians were also
preparing a great Army, by the directions of the Kingdom of Syria, suddenly to
invade Lydia, on the Kings behalf. These news giving my endeavors sufficient
encouragement, still to prosecute my design, for other intelligences, within
three or four days afterward, I became certainly informed, that the Senate
being not able, or at leastwise not willing to give the multitude satisfaction,
according to the desire of their petitions, they had in great numbers not only
taken up arms for their own defense, in regard they understood that Farezius
had directions, notwithstanding the opposition of the Lords, to march toward
their assemblies with all his power, but they had also seized upon many Castles
and Towns, toward their enterprise and assistance in the Kings name; with whom
in like manner many of the Nobility join with considerable Forces. Last of all,
you may be pleased to know, That Hercrombrotus, Lieutenant General to
Farezius, is of a sudden called away with a great part of the Army, toward the
confines of Lydia, near the City of Smyrna, occasioned by reason of the revolt
of some of his own Commanders, who are joined with the power and force of the
Country to oppose the Senates proceeding: which in effect is the full
information I can give concerning my employment.

When the Dwarf had made an end of this relation, the Princess Cloria smiled
upon her brother, not only to see how well the boy had performed his office,
according to the confidence her Governesse Roxana had in his wit and fidelity;
but withal in regard of the inward joy she felt concerning the King her
fathers affairs, that seemed now to be in a better posture then they were,
almost since the beginning of his troubles: for she imagined by the
consequences, his subjects would be constrained for their own advantages, to
place him again in his Throne, in a higher capacity of power then before.
Ascanius of the other side, expressed also by his countenance the like
gladness, in so much as after a little space, as if he had been in a manner
transported with thoughts of delight and satisfaction, according to his
youthful conceptions, that were apt enough to entertain all Ideas of content
and felicity, presently run to his sister, and whilst both his arms were cast
about her neck, he sealed, as well his affection as his joy upon her Ruby lips,
by a multitude of sweet though more dear kisses: but she at last, either
something apprehending the too much importunity of such affections, or else
desirous to inform her self better of other particulars, told her brother in a
jesting way, that as she could scarce dispense with the rigid rules of her own
modesty, to have her virgin lips so assaulted, although it were from an
affectionate brother, whose innocent virtue was beyond all possibility of
scandal, so did she of the other fide exceedingly wonder, that his own change
of condition, which only procured his safety, under the protection of the
Castle, where for the present they remained, had not wrought in his disposition
contrary effects, to that quality wherein he was born, since now he was to
esteem himself rather a servant to fortune, then a Prince by extraction: not a
Prince, replied Ascanius? the gods defend, I should ever harbor in my breast
such poor and unworthy thoughts, notwithstanding the injustice or malice of
any fortune whatsoever: no sister, be you assured, that both for your sake and
my own, I shall always endeavor by my actions, to show that I am son to
Euarchus and Hyacinthia, and I doubt not but you will do the like concerning
your own particular: But yet, replied the sweet Princess, we are obliged in
some sort to yield to our fates, when we have not means sufficient left us to
prevent them; for if the Senate, by a certain kind of a tyrannical power
granted them by the heavens (perhaps only in correction of our offenses) do
imprison and circumscribe our persons, what matters of consequence can our
minds afford us to our advantage in such exigencies? O say not so, answered
Ascanius; for the mind is able to be a noble conqueror over all unfortunate
disasters; since in my youthful studies I have read of many brave persons,
that in the highest expressions of tyranny, and afflictions imposed upon their
bodies, by their worst and greatest enemies, have at last in despite of all
their cruelty, born away the only palm and Laurel of victory; as it were
confounding their very persecutors, with the extraordinary constancy of their
own sufferings. These, said Cloria, I must confess are brave resolutions in
words, if they can be as well practiced by actions: for I must tell you, that
flesh and blood cannot easily put off all natural inclinations; though I will
not deny, but the soul may do miracles, being aided by divine considerations;
and oftentimes has demonstrated wonderful effects, merely out of some
extraordinary sense, or inflammation of honor, both by Soldiers and
Philosophers. Truly, said Ascanius, then it were very hard, being Kings
children, if we should not in our proceedings meet with some of these faculties
to our benefit; when as perhaps contemptible slaves in former ages have
abundantly exampled to our knowledge and edification, such heroical suffering.

As they were thus discoursing, Roxana, who had for a long space kept a most
formal and grave silence, thought it also convenient to show her own wisdom;
the rather, since her years and experience, pretended to a certain kind of
prerogative amongst those of the younger sort of people. Truly, said she, as I
cannot deny, but that this extraordinary courage you mention, is of a singular
benefit to many sorts of people, in their pressing and difficult occasions; yet
when with a wise (though not a base) compliance, we can avoid both the
inconvenience and hazard to our selves, with more ease and no dishonor, I see
no reason, why we should go about to strain nature to no purpose? especially
if we be not well assured to gain a beneficial victory by the contention; And
if we fail in that we seem to undertake, we contract thereby a further
mischief and disreputation to our selves, then if we had not at all offered to
contend against power and oppression at the first: besides oftentimes those
resistances in the dark shall never come truly to the knowledge of the world,
so that consequently we fail then of that glory, our foolish and preposterous
ambition aimed at by such resolutions: by which means we shall be rather
enterpreted to be blown up with vainglorious fumes, then seasoned with true
fortitude: In time the best mixture must be so to moderate our actions, that as
precipitately we put not our selves upon vain and needless sufferings, without
necessity, so ought not we too much to yield to the inconstant strokes of
fortune and oppression, when either honor or religion calls us to a public
demonstration of our bravery and courage. But however these disputations might
either confirm Cloria, or convert her brother, yet Ascanius finding the
opportunity, for his own desired employment in the Kings affairs, he resolved
as soon as possible he could, to seek occasion for his own speedy departure;
