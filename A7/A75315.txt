THE ANATOMY OF THE FRENCH and SPANISH Faction.
BEfore the Norman Conquest, the French looked long upon the affairs of
England with a greedy eye, and in those innocent times maintained a party here
in England to make good their Faction. The Spaniards, as they are more grave in
their deportment, so they are more retired in their Counsels; and being then
always in Wars, either to establish or increase their more Western
territories, had hardly the leisure to think on England, until the Alliance of
King Philip with Queen Mary; since which time, being taken either with the
wealth or the pleasure of this Isle, they have always either openly by war,
or privately by policy, been industrious either to assault it or betray it.

I will not wipe off the dust of antiquity from the story of the French, to
represent unto you, what were the designs which many years since they
nourished to unite this Kingdom unto France, neither will I ravell out your
expectation or the time in any discourse upon the Spaniard more then what shall
concern our present purpose, which is to declare unto you, how the French and
Spanish for these late years have desperately conjoined into one resolve of
mischief for the subverting of the Protestant Religion, and the ruin of this
Kingdom, which was of late the envy, and is now become the pity and the
astonishment of Christendom.

Yet before I arrive unto their latter practices, on which I chiefly would
insist, it will be worth your observation to consider how eagerly both nations
did ambiate the marriage of the renowned Queen Elizabeth, who always overcame
her enemies and her Sex. The first who did court her in the way of marriage,
was Don John de Austria thinking thereby to reduce our Island and Religion to
the Spanish Principles, but the Queen who knew very well before, what was the
ambition and the arts of Spain could no ways be induced to hear of that
illegitimate Prince; The second was the Duke of Alenson brother to Henry the
third, then King of France, (a gallant Gentleman indeed) and who, wheresoever
he came did win upon the hearts of all by his valor and his courtesy, but
as the Kingdom was then blessed in a brave Queen, so was the Queen blessed
with as brave a Counsel, and that marriage by reason of the diversity in
religion, and many considerations of State being also rejected, the Duke
returned into Flanders where either by grief or poison, he died strangely in
the flower of his Age, of an issue of blood, which abundantly came from him,
out of all the passages of his body.

In the same manner also died his Elder Brother Charles the eight King of
France, neither did his other brother Henry the third, (who before he was King
of France swayed the Imperial Scepter of Polonia) descend unto his grave by a
natural or timely death, so true is that of the Satyrist.

Ad generum Cereris sine caede and sanguine pauci
Descendunt Reges et sicca morte tyranni.
By a dry death, without some bloody end
Few Kings to Ceres son in law descend.
Herein you may observe how just are all the works, and how constant are the
ways of God, their Father Henry the second of France promised his Father on
his deathbed, that he would make no more war with the Protestants, nor be
the occasion of any more effusion of blood in France for Religion, but soon
after his death, forgetting his Covenant with the dead, and overcome with the
evil counsel of his Queen, the war began anew, and the old wounds being
opened, the land again did sweat with blood. But mark the event, this Henry
being afterward at a Turnament, in which himself would be a tilter, he was
struck through the eye with the splinter of a spear, of which not long
afterward he dyed.

His sons Charles and Francis miserably ended their contracted days by a
terrible evacuation of blood, the wit of Justice punishing that blood in their
bodies which they had caused to issue out of the body of the Kingdom. Henry the
third a great contriver of that most horrid massacre, and Author of much
Protestant bloodshed at the battles of Dreux and Moncontour, was killed
afterward himself by a Friar, and both the Murder and the Murderer commended
by Xistus then Pope of Rome, neither of such fair hopes of posterity was there
any one left, of the great and glorious name of Valois to succeed in the
Kingdom of France. I have obviously inserted this, that the world might take
notice how dear unto God is the safety of his people, and that he has
pacified the crying blood of the Protestants with the destruction of the
families of the Monarchs of the earth. If you would give me the reading of it,
I could furnish your observation with another story, which because it is very
memorable I will here insert it, and then return from whence a little I have
digressed.

Henry the third being slain, the Crown of France was devolved unto Henry of
Burbon King of Navarre, who had married Margaret sister to Henry the third, she
was a Lady of a delicate constitution both of mind and body, and admirable for
her virtues and her vices, who finding that the Peers of France had estranged
their hearts and their loyalties from her husband by reason of his religion,
she persuaded him for the assurance of his Crown, and the safety of his
person, to turn Catholic again; which indeed once before he did, which was at
the massacre of Saint Bartholomews, some 3 or 4 days after the solemnization
of his marriage. But though that superstition be blind, what cannot the Jesuits
see? They conceiving that this alteration of his Religion was but dissolation
in the King, they corrupted a villain with gold and the certainty of salvation,
(as if the way to heaven was by murder) to destroy him; this desperate caitiff
(under the pretense of private business of great importance) having passed the
guards had access unto his Majesty, and finding him on the top of the stairs
stooping, and prepared to listen to him, he struck at his breast with his
knife, and missing it by a more merciful error, he struck his knife through
his lip against his teeth. The villain apprehended and the tumult appeased, a
great Personage standing near unto his Majesty, said unto him, Sir, You have
denied God in your mouth, and now you feel he has struck you in the mouth, I
must beseech your Majesty to consider of it, and not deny him in your heart,
least he should strike you through the heart. Many years after this were
passed away, and the King oftentimes in his mirth amongst other doubts would
desire to be satisfied in his knowledge of what Religion he himself was, and
surely at the conference betwixt the Cardinal Du Peron, and Monsieur Du
Plessis, it seems that he was more addicted to the Cardinals part; howsoever
not long after (it is too well known,) that passing through the street in his
Caroach, he was struck quite through the heart with Ravilliacs knife. The
hearts of Princes are in the merciful hands of God, who by vile Agents can
deprive them of their temporal Crowns, to crown them with glory and
happiness for evermore; howsoever this is a true and a sad relation, and of
great use and consequence in all ages, if it precisely be considered.

I will not trouble you with a further repetition, how often in Queen
Elizabeth's days the Spanish faction by War, by Jesuits, and by some great
though disaffected personages at Court did advance it self, and how often it
was suppressed. What title the Spaniard pretended to the Crown, even in the
evening of her reign is sufficiently known and answered. I will pass
therefore to the beginning of King James his days, who although he was a most
wise and knowing Prince, the Spanish faction found then a greater power to act
their designs, and Historians a lesser liberty to express them: Almost at his
very entrance into this Kingdom, an impudent and wild Petition was contrived
by Father Garnet and other Priests and Jesuits, for a tolleration of Religion
and preferred to his Majesty, but advisedly rejected, upon Arch Bishop Abbots
grave counsel to the King; upon this denial their Faction growing desperate,
they enterprised (by the advice of the said Father Garnet) the Gunpowder
treason, for which how far they dived into Hell for counsel, the Devils
themselves can witness. Not long before in eighty eight, they practiced on the
water to overthrow us, and now (as if they would make all the Elements
accessory to our destruction) they contrived in the Earth by fire, to blow us
up into the Air. And indeed it is no wonder they should so much practice with
fire, and be so guilty of it, who are themselves the fire brands of Hell. One
would have thought that such a desperate and so matchless a design, upon
King, Peers, Kingdom and people, should have produced the execution of some
Law, for the utter extirpation of all Papists, and their Jesuitical adherents;
but unfortunately such was then the interest with foreign Princes and the King
of Spain, the entertainment of whose Pentioners, being some of our Nobility and
Church Papists, came to no less then three thousand or four thousand pound a
year, that after execution done upon a few, the further prosecution of the Law
did cease; Nay so prevalent was this Spanish Faction with King James, that by
many impertinent solicitations, they induced him to condescend to many things,
which have proved since very prejudicial to him, his Royal progeny, the Peace
of his Kingdom, and the Protestant Religion then established. For in the first
place, his Majesty was drawn to conclude a Peace with Spain, the most
disadvantageous to this Kingdom that ever was; for by it no English were
permitted to trade into the West Indies, and if any did adventure so to do, he
was to be hanged and tortured without mercy; from hence it came to pass, that
the English who had resolved with the Netherlands for the sending of ten
thousand men between them into those parts, were so deterred as that our
friends the Netherlanders were left to shift for themselves; who now have
gotten so great a footing in Brasile (which is not the tenth part of America,
yet bigger in situation then three times England) that the Spaniard will never
be able to remove them thence. And while the English for many years sare
still, the King of Spain has been so well enabled by the vast treasures that
came from thence, to make full and due payment to his Jesuitical Factors here,
as that they ever since have performed most faithful service to him. And lest
any thing should be wanting to the Catholic King undertaking the Catholic
Cause, they persuaded King James to arm the King of Spain with two thousand
Pieces of Ordnance, under color of which license, Sir John Ieme transported
twice as many, what others did is not well known, but it is conceived by able
judgments, that if the King of Spain were as well prepared with men and
shipping, as he is with Guns and Ammunition, he might beat us with our own
weapons. And thus from one degree to another, they have still incroached on His
Majesty. After this, with might and main they labored for; and cried up his
boundless prerogative, a thing which Princes are generally over much delighted
to hear, and by this his Majesty was drawn at last to disaffect Parliaments,
as intrenching too much upon His Royal Prerogative, and regulating the Regal
power, which never ought to exceed Law, but when it rendeth to the relief of
the subject in mitigating the rigor of it, and not by impoverishing the
Subjects, and oppressing them with illegal Monopolies and unwarrantable
taxations, which by woeful experience this miserable Kingdom has too long
felt and groaned under the burden of them.

Many more particulars may be alleged, as the prevailing power they had with
King James, when (upon the motion of Gondamore) his Majesty neglected the
proffer of some German Princes, and condiscended to send his son and heir into
Spain, for the contract of a marriage with the King of Spains sister, and one
of a contrary Religion, which had it accordingly proceeded, it might have
proved as prejudicial and troublesome, as the marriage with France.

But the proceedings of the Spanish Faction since the access of His Majesty
that now is unto the Crown, I need not recite at large, they are all within
your own memory, yet for your better satisfaction, I cannot but report some
few particulars. The first is, of the laying of their foundation at the
Conclave at Rome, where it was concluded, that his Holiness should have a
Nuntio in England, and the Queen of England should have an Agent at Rome, to
act things here as should be there resolved on. Another was to persuade his
Majesty by mediation of the Queen (whom they too well knew and saw that he
entirely loved) to prefer those to dignities and Courts of judicature, who
might serve best to put in execution their mischievous designs, whereby it
most unhappily came to pass that the Spanish Faction became the Cabinet
Counselors, so over-awing and over-swaying the greater and better part of the
privy Council, that their mere proposals past for resolutions, and hence it
was that the Starchamber (where these and they whom these promoted and
countenanced did bear the greatest sway) did abound with extravagant Censures,
no less unconscionable then terrible, by oppressing the common people and
maintaining illegal taxations, and inducing Prerogatives far beyond the
presidents of all former times, and surely had it not been for those exceeding
powerful Popish factors, the high Commission had not decreed so eagerly to
oppose true Religion, by Suspension, deprivation, Excommunication, Fines and
imprisonment, much less some Bishops and inferior Ecclesiastical Courts, had
not adventured with such animosity to propose, or with such violence to
prosecute their own superstitious articles, as if they had bin Canons concluded
on by the whole Church of England, or as if the Articles of these men which
consisted only of Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons, etc. (as every Bishop or slye
Official thought good) ought to bind the the whole Church being so partially,
if not corruptly represented. For are Cathedral Churches any other but such
places which Queen Elizabeth and her Council for some political ends, were
pleased to let rest in some part of that popish splendour and magnificence which
might take with the neighboring Princes of the contrary Religion, and not
render her and her people utterly reconcilable to the Church of Rome. The
Parochial Churches then were better cleansed from Popish Relics, according
to the well settled constitution of other reformed Churches, and now forsooth
better refined Parochial Churches must again be reduced to a Cathedral garb,
because it is more ceremonious and majesticall, and therein more resembles
Rome.

Thus with the overswelling greatness of those cabinet Councillors, men were
preferred to places of Judicature in the Common wealth, which (I suppose)
either could not or would not maintain Justice, but were always forced to
advance prerogative above and against Law, the subjects by many woeful
complaints can witness how many millions of moneys in few years have been
wrested from them under the name of Lone, Knighthood, Shipmony, etc. all which
though unlawful, yet were they either justified by the most part of the
Judges, and the people miserably oppressed.

The next plot which they no less endeavored then obtained, was to weaken his
Majesty both at home and abroad, and indeed which way could they weaken him
more in England, then to employ the cabinet counsel to persuade him to make
sale of his own proper hereditary land, and so without Parliaments to raise
money for the supporting of his royal dignity by unlawful and unusual means,
which could not but much withdraw the dutiful affection of the subject from
him, wherein his chiefest strength consisted, and how could they have devised
more to lessen the reputation of his wisdom and puissance with foreign
Princes then by inciting his Majesty (as if he had married the conditions as
well as the daughter of France) to begin a war with Spain, and then to
conclude it partly without, and partly against the approbation of the
Parliament, and so afterward to France it self.

To this may be added the taking of Rochell, for all the aid of his Majesty's
ships; the little assistance and countenance which of late times has been from
England afforded to the Netherlands, and from all their premises it may be
concluded, that there were all destructive ways to the Protestant Religion,
and therefore promoted and prosecuted by great persons Popishly addicted to the
ruin of our Peace, our Lives, Liberties, and (which is yet much dearer to us)
our Religion. Was the plot small may we think by billetting of soldiers in all
parts of this Kingdom, by intending to bring in foreign forces, especially
many hundred of German horse, and by proposing Martial law to be put into
execution, which now we see to take effect, yet it was under pretense of law,
when there was neither Reason, Law, nor Equity for the raising of forces or any
such great sums of money as there was raised, which yet had they been employed
in any reasonable proportion for the good of the King or Kingdom, neither King
nor Kingdom had been so distressed as now they are, but the truth is, as such
vast sums were illegally extorted, so they were as fraudulentally disposed
without his Majesty's privity, even to the strengthening of the professed
enemies of our Religion, which now threaten the subjugation, if not the utter
extirpation of it.

The next plot was for brass money, and the making of it current, whilst the
French of all other nations were permitted to carry our gold and silver, away,
were they of what Sex, Age, or condition soever. How much the Queen Mother had
for her part is not, nor ever will be certainly known, but, it is conceived
upon very good ground, that she and her Jesuitical train have had two
millions of money, which is ten times as much, as the Queen her daughter
brought into this land; and if this has not been a heavy burden to poor
England, let all men Judge. But this is not all, have not the Jesuits had free
egresse and regresse and intimate acquaintance, with Canterbury, Wren, and the
rest of the Popish Bishops, whereby they procured the discountenancing, yea the
suppressing of the most able and faithful Divines and Ministers of the
Gospel, when in the mean time who were advanced and put into places of trust
or preferment, but Arminians, and Socinians, whose poysenous tenants in some
and many things are steps to Rome, in others more dangerous as being more
subtly contrived.

We cannot here omit (by their instigation) the receiving into favor of many
great Delinquents who fled from the Justice of the Parliament: the cessation of
Arms in Ireland to bring over the war and Popery into England; the Queens
negotiation beyond the Seas, for the continuance and fomenting this unnatural
war, partly in her own person, and partly by her seconds. And to this end
the pawning of the Jewels of the Crown. The several plots daily contrived to
corrupt our soldiers, citizens, nay even our Divines themselves, all which are
unquiet and dangerous issues and effects of the French and Spanish Counsels.

And now (when they can proceed no further in their mischievous devices) they
endeavored to continue the last and worst of all, which is still managed by
the help of their old sure friends who are so gracious at Court, and that is
the separating of his Majesty from his high Cour^ of Parliament, and in keeping
him from them, as also in causing an ill opinion in some people and Counties
against their own representative body so advisedly now a^sembled, and at first
aggregated from all shires. And indeed of all other practices this is most
fearful, destructive, and the most desperate, for who could imagine (did it
not evidently appear) that the Papists both of the French and Spanish faction
should have such an influence on his Majesty, as to make him believe that his
Parliament is set against him and the good of the land, and that Privadoes and
Sycophantes at Court are better affected and more able to seek for the good and
safety of the King and Kingdom then they are, as if it were probable the
wisdom, and till now the never suspected integrity of both the Houses of
Parliament, by which the King and Kingdom have always flourished could ever
prove so treacherous to King or Kingdom, or be so careless of themselves and
their posterity as to do things dishonest and treasonable, or if it were
possible that men for the most part who were never greatly entrusted by his
Majesty, or the State, should be able to give more faithful Counsel, or be
less subject to erroneous advices then they are, who now sit in our high Court
of Parliament. Surely as after many storms at sea, we now begin to see the day
and land again, so great thanks for their pains, prudence and patience is to be
given to God by us, to whom (no doubt) the benefit will redound.
