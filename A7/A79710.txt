The Confession of Faith of the Kirk of Scotland; with the Bond or Covenant
subscribed unto by the whole Kingdom.
THe Confession of Faith, subscribed at first by the Kings Majesty, and his
household, in the year of God 1580. Thereafter, by persons of all ranks, in the
year 1581, by ordinance of the Lords of the Secret Council, and Acts of the
general Assembly. Subscribed again by all sorts of persons, in the year
1590, by a new ordinance of Council, at the desire of the general Assembly:
with a general Bond for maintenance of the true religion, and the Kings
person: And now subscribed in the year 1638 by us, Noblemen, Barons,
Gentlemen, Burgesses, Ministers, and Commons under subscribing, together with
our resolution and promises for the causes after specified, to maintain the
said true religion, and the Kings Majesty, according to the Confession
aforesaid, and Acts of Parliament: the tenor whereof here follows.

WE all, and every one of us underwritten, protest that after long and due
examination of our own consciences in matters of true, and false religion, are
now thoroughly resolved of the truth by the word and Spirit of God; and therefore
we believe with our hearts, confess with our mouths, subscribe with our hands,
and constantly affirm before God, and the whole world: that this only is the
true Christian Faith, and Religion, pleasing God, and bringing salvation to
man, which now is by the mercy of God revealed to the world, by the preaching
of the blessed Evangel: And received, believed, and defended by many and sundry
notable Kirks and Realms; but chiefly by the Kirk of Scotland, the Kings
Majesty, and our Estates of this Realm, as Gods eternal truth, and only
ground of our salvation; as more particularly is expressed in the Confession of
our faith, stablished and confirmed by many Acts of Paliaments, and now of a
long time has been openly professed by the Kings Majesty, and whole body of
this Realm, both in Burgh and Land. To the which Confession and form of
religion we willingly agree in our consciences, in all points as unto Gods
undoubted truth and verity, grounded only upon his written word: and therefore
we abhor and detest all contrary religion and doctrine: but chiefly all
kind of Papistry, in general and particular heads, even as they are now
damned and confuted by the word of God, and Kirk of Scotland: but in especial,
we detest and refuse the usurped authority of that Roman Antichrist, upon the
Scriptures of God, upon the Kirk, the civil Magistrate, and consciences of
men, all his tyrannous laws made upon indifferent things against our Christian
liberty; his erroneous doctrine against the sufficiency of the written word,
and the perfection of the Law, the office of Christ and his blessed Evangel.
His corrupted doctrine concerning original sin, our natural inability and
rebellion to Gods law, our justification by faith only, our imperfect
sanctification and obedience to the Law, the nature, number, and use of the
holy Sacraments. His five baftard Sacraments, with all his rites, ceremonies,
and false doctrine added to the ministration of the true Sacraments, without
the word of God. His cruel judgment against Infants departing without the
Sacrament, his absolute necessity of Baptism, his blasphemous opinion of
Transubstantiation, or real presence of Christ's body in the elements, and
receiving of the same by the wicked, or bodies of men; his dispensations with
solemn Oaths, perjuries, and degrees of marriage forbidden in the word, his
cruelty against the innocent divorced, his devellish Mass, his blasphemous
priesthood, his profane Sacrifices for the sins of the dead and the quick,
his Canonization of men calling upon Angels or Saints departed worshipping of
imagerie relicts, and crosses, dedicating of kirkes, Altars, days, vows to
creatures, his purgatory, prayers for the dead, praying, or speaking in a
strange language, with his processions, and blasphemous lettany, and multitude
of advocates, or mediators, his manifold orders, auricular confession, his
desperate and uncertain repentance, his general, and doubtsome faith, his
satisfaction of men for their sins, his justifications by works, opus
operatum, works of supererogation, merits, pardons, peregrinations and
stations, his holy water baptizing of bells, conjuring of spirits, crossing,
saning, anointing, conjuring, hallowing of Gods good creatures, with the
superstitious opinion, joined there with his wordly Monarchy, and wicked
Hierarchy, his three solemn vows, with all his shavelings of sundry sorts,
his erroneous and bloody decrees made at Trent, with all the subscribers, and
approvers of that cruel and bloody band conjured against the Kirk of God: and
finally we detest all his vain allegories, rites, signs, and traditions,
brought in the Kirk, without or against the word of God, and doctrine of this
true reformed Kirk; to the which we join our selves willingly in doctrine,
faith, religion, discipline and use of the Holy Sacraments, as lively members
of the same in Christ our Head, promising and swearing by the great name of God
our Lord, That we shall continue in the obedience of the doctrine and
discipline of this Kirk, and shall defend the same according to our vocation,
and power, all the days of our lives, under the pains contained in the law,
and danger both of body and soul in the day of Gods fearful Judgments. And
seeing that many are stirred up by Satan, and that Roman Antichrist, to
promise, swear, subscribe and for a time use the holy Sacraments in the Kirk,
deceitfully against their own consciences, minding thereby, first under the
External cloak of religion, to corrupt and subvert secretly Gods true
religion, within the Kirk; and afterward when time may serve to become open
enemies and persecutours of the same, under vain hope of the Popes
dispensation, devised against the word of God to his greater confusion, and
their double condemnation in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ.

We therefore willing to take away all suspicion of hypocrisy, and of such
double dealing with God and his Kirk, protest, and call the scearcher of all
hearts for witness, that our minds and hearts do fully agree with this our
Confession, Promise, Oath, and Subscription; so that we are not moved for any
worldly respect; but are persuaded only in our consciences through the
knowledge and love of Gods true Religion printed in our hearts by the holy
Spirit, as we shall answer to him, in the day when the secrets of all hearts
shall be disclosed: and because we perceive that the quietness and stability
of our Religion and Kirk, does depend upon the safety and good behavior of the
Kings Majesty, as upon a comfortable instrument of Gods mercy granted to this
Country, for the maintaining of his Kirk, and ministration of justice amongst
us; we protest and promise with our hearts under the same oath, handwrit, and
pains, that we shall defend his royal person and authority, with our goods,
bodies, and lives, in the defense of Christ his Evangel, Liberties of our
Country, ministration of justice, and punishment of iniquity, against all
enemies within this Realm or without, as we desire our God to be a strong and
merciful defender to us in the day of our death, and coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom with the Father and the holy Spirit be all honor and glory
eternally.

IN obedience to the Commandment of God, conform to the practice of the godly
in former times, and according to the laudable example of our worthy and
religious Progenitors, and of many yet living amongst us, which was warranted
also by Act of Council, commanding a general Bond to be made and subscribed,
by his Majestis Subjects of all ranks, for two causes; one was for defending
the true religion as it was then reformed, and is expressed in the confession
of faith above written, and a former large Confession established by sundry
Acts of lawful general Assemblies, and of Parliaments, unto which it has
relation, set down in public Chatechismes, and which had been for many years,
with a blessing from heaven, preached and professed in this Kirk and Kingdom,
as Gods undoubted truth, grounded only upon this written word: the other cause
was, for maintaining the Kings Majesty's person and Estate; the true worship of
God, and the Kings authority being so straightly joined, as that they had the
same friends and common enemies, and did stand, and fall together: and finally
being convinced in our minds, and confessing with our mouths, that the
present and succeeding generations in this land, are bound to keep the
aforesaid national Oath and subscription inviolable. We Noblemen, Barons,
Gentlemen, Burgesses, Ministers, and Commons under subscribing, considering
diverse times before, and especially at this time the danger of the true
reformed religion, of the Kings honor, and of the public peace of the
Kingdom by the manifold innovations and evils generally contained and
particularly mentioned in our late supplications, complaints, and
protestations, do hereby profess, and before God, his Angels, and the world,
solemnly declare, that with our whole hearts we agree and resolve, all the
days of our life constantly to adhere unto, and to defend the aforesaid true
religion, and forbearing the practice of all novations, already introduced in
the matters of the worship of God, or approbation of the corruptions of the
public government of the Kirk, or civil places and power of Kirk-men, till
they be tried and allowed in free Assemblies, and in Parliaments, to labor by
all means lawful to recover the purity and liberty of the Gospel, as it was
established and professed before the aforesaid novations: and because after due
examination we plainly perceive, and undoubtedly believe that the innovations
and evils contained in our supplications, complaints, and protestations have no
warrant of the word of God, are contrary to the Articles of the aforesaid
Confessions, to the intention and meaning of the blessed reformers of religion
in this land, to the above written Acts of Parliament, and do sensibly tend to
the re-establishing of the Popish religion and tyranny, and to the subversion
and ruin of the true reformed religion, and of our liberties, laws, and
estates. We also declare that the aforesaid Confessions are to be interpreted,
and ought to be understood of the aforesaid novations and evils, no less than
if every one of them had been expressed in the aforesaid Confessions, and that
we are obliged to detest and abhor them, amongst other particular heads of
Papistry abjured therein; and therefore from the knowledge and conscience of
our duty to God, to our King and Country, without any worldly respect or
inducement, so far as humane infirmity will suffer, wishing a further measure
of the grace of God for this effect; We promise and swear by the great name of
the Lord our God, to continue in the profession and obedience of the aforesaid
religion: that we shall defend the same, and resist all these contrary errors
and corruptions, according to our vocation, and to the uttermost of that power
that God has put in our hands, all the days of our life: and in like manner
with the same heart we declare before God and men, that we have no intention
nor desire to attempt any thing, that may turn to the dishonor of God, or to
the diminution of the Kings greatness and authority: but on the contrary, we
promise and swear that we shall to the uttermost of our power, with our means
and lives, stand to the defense of our dread Sovereign, the Kings Majesty's
person and authority, in the defense and preservation of the aforesaid true
religion, liberties and laws of the kingdom: as also to the mutual defense
and assistance every one of us of another, in the same cause of maintaining the
true religion, and his Majesty's authority with our best counsel, our bodies,
means, and whole power against all sorts of persons whatsoever; so that
whatsoever shall be done to the least of us for that cause shall be taken as
done to us all in general, and to every one of us in particular: and that we
shall neither directly nor indirectly suffer our selves to be divided or
with-drawne, by whatsoever suggestion or allurement, or terror from this
blessed and loyal conjunction, nor shall cast in any let or impediment, that
may stay or hinder any such resolution, as by common consent shall be found to
conduce for so good ends: but on the contrary, shall by all lawful means
labor to further and promote the same; and if any such dangerous and divisive
motion be made to us by word, or writ; we and every one of us shall either
suppress it, or if need be, shall incontinent make the same known, that it
may be timously obviated: neither do we fear the foul aspersions of
rebellion, combination, or what else our adversaries from their craft and
malice would put upon us, seeing what we do is so well warranted, and arises
from an unfeigned desire to maintain the true worship of God, the Majesty of
our King, and peace of the Kingdom, for the common happiness of our selves,
and the posterity. And because we cannot look for a blessing from God upon our
proceedings, except with our profession and subscription we join such a life
and conversation, as beseems Christians, who have renewed their Covenant with
God; we therefore faithfully promise for our selves, our followers, and all
others under us, both in public in our particular families, and personal
carriage to endeavor to keep our selves within the bounds of Christian
liberties, and to be good examples to others of all godliness, soberness and
righteousness, and of every duty we owe to God and man. And that this our
union and conjunction may be observed without violation, we call the living God
the searcher of our hearts to witness, who knows this to be our sincere
desire and unfeigned resolution, as we shall answer to Jesus Christ in the
great day, and under the pain of Gods everlasting wrath, and of infamy and
loss of all honor and respect in this world, most humbly beseeching the Lord
to strengthen us by his holy Spirit for this end, and to bless our desires and
proceedings with a happy success, that religion and righteousness may
flourish in the land, to the glory of God, and honor of the King, and the
peace and comfort of us all, in witness whereof we have subscribed with our
hands all the premises, etc.
