Majesty throughout the Kingdom, are exactly and effectually to observe and
follow.

LONDON, Printed by Bonham Norton and John Bill, Printers to the KINGS most
Excellent Majesty. 1626.

Instructions which Our Commissioners for the loan of money unto Us in Our
County of (...) are exactly and effectually to observe and follow.
1 FIrst, with all speed after the receipt of this Our Commission, ye shall
assemble your selves together, and upon conference and advice between your
selves, ye shall determine in what manner ye will proceed to the execution of
this Our Commission in the several parts and divisions of this whole County.
And before your parting from this first place and time of your meeting, you
shall your selves, for a good example to others, lend unto Us these several
sums of money, which are hereby required of you to be lent, testified by the
writing of your names with your own hands, that when ye shall in Our name
require others to lend, they shall discern your own forwardnes, and that you
do not move others to that which ye forbear to do your selves, the Lords and
others of Our privy Council attending Our person having already done the
same, by the subscription of every of their names. And before your parting, you
shall cause so many of those of that County to appear before you, and proceed
with them according to these Our Commission and Instructions.

2 And because We would expedite this service, and ease you of importunity,
and leave no way to the partial information of others, in the under or over
valuation of men's estates (which is often subject to much error) We have
thought this to be the most indifferent and equal way of coniecturing at every
man's ability to lend, by taking those rates for Our guide, at which they were
assessed in the books of the last Subsidy, and to require the loan of so
much money only, as the entire rate and value comes unto, at which they are
there rated and set; As namely, He that is set at one hundred pounds in Lands,
to lend us one hundred pounds in money, and so after that rate for a more or
less sum; And he that is set at one hundred pounds in goods, to lend Us one
hundred marks; And he that is set at ten pounds in goods to lend us twenty
nobles, and so pro rata for a greater or lesser sum. And where there are
bearers or contributors, they shall assist the Subsidy man.

3 When ye have agreed between your selves of the several days and places of
your sittings, and which of you shall attend it, at every several place of
your meetings in the several parts of this County (which We would have you to
appoint as speedily as may be, and to attend without intermission) you shall
send your warrants under your hands, or the hands of two of you at the least,
to the high Constables, petty Constables, and other officers, of, and in those
several divisions, personally to warn all such persons who were assessed for
the last Subsidy, or to leave such warning in writing at their dwelling
houses, that they fail not to give you meeting, at the times and places
appointed by you, and that those Officers to whom your warrants are directed,
fail not to give an account unto you of their service therein. And such as
have been warned and do not appear before you at the day and place
appointed, you shall send for by warrant, and bind them over to appear before
the Lords and others of Our Privy Council.

4 That at every of those meetings when there is a convenient number assembled,
you use all possible endeavors, to cause every of them willingly and
cheerfully to lend these Sums unto us, opening unto them the necessity, and
vnauoidablenesse of this course, and setting before them, that Our Honor, the
reputation of this Nation, the true Religion, and common safety of Us and Our
people, and of Our Friends and Allies, are all engaged in this common Cause,
That there is now no time of disputing, but of acting that which concerns Our
common Defense, and assuring them that this course which is at this time
enforced by necessity, and to which no ordinary rules of Law can be
prescribed, shall not be drawn into example or president.

5 That if ye shall meet with any objections, or scruples raised, which may be
impediments to this Our Service, That ye use all diligence to remove them, and
satisfy them, And if any shall object or whisper, That if this way of raising
of money take place, then no Parliament shall hereafter be called; That ye
satisfy such, That the suddennes and importance of the occasions are such, as
cannot possibly admit of that delay, which the Summoning, Assembling and
Resolutions of a Parliament do necessarily draw with it, And that it is far
from Our heart to make any such use of the love of Our people; But that We are
fully purposed to call a Parliament, as soon as fitly We may, and as often as
the Commonwealth and State-occasions shall require it; And that by their
affections showed unto Us in this way of necessity, they shall the sooner
inuit Us to the frequent use of Parliaments, being confident in the hearts of
Our people.

6 That ye appoint the days of payment of the Sums of Money to be lent unto
Us, to be within fourteen days, and persuade such as shall be able, to pay
it at one entire payment, the better to accommodate Our great occasions, which
are present and pressing: But to such as in your good discretions ye shall
think it more convenient, ye may accept of the one half at fourteen days,
and the other half to be paid within three months next after the said
fourteen days.

7 That you treat apart with every one of those who are to lend unto Us, and
not in the presence or hearing of any others, unless you see cause to the
contrary in your good discretions: And as every one gives consent, That you
cause him or her to set his or her name or mark to a Book, Roll, or List to
be made by you, testifying their assent, with a mark or distinction for the
times of payment accorded unto; And if ye shall find any, who either shall
deny to lend unto Us, or shall make delays or excuses, let them know they do
thereby incur Our high displeasure: And if they persist in their obstinacy,
notwithstanding that, Then ye shall examine such person upon oath, whether he
has been dealt withal, persuaded or practiced with to deny or refuse to
lend, or to make excuse for his not lending, who has so dealt with him, and
what speeches or persuasions he or they have used tending to that purpose? And
ye shall also charge every such person in Our Name upon his Allegiance not to
disclose to any other, what his answer was; And if any shall refuse to lend,
or refuse to take this oath, you shall bind him over to appear before Us, or
our Privy Counsel, to answer his contempt.

8 You shall show your own affections and zeal to this business, and to Our
service, in your effectual dealing with all men freely and cheerfully to
run this course, and in using your powers, favors, and credits which every
of you have in the County, amongst the Gentlemen, Freeholders, and others, to
advance this business, that it may come off cheerfully and roundly. And that
you your selves by any means discover not any coldness, or unwillingness to
the service, whereby any others to their discouragement, may gather that you
have no heart to the Work, although for forms sake you must take it upon you,
being employed therein: but that in your own persons ye heartily and really
intend it as a work of infinite importance to Our service, and the service and
^afety of the Commonwealth.

9 That in your treating with your neighbors, about this business, you show
your own discretions and affections, by making choice of such to begin with,
who are likely to give the best examples: and when you have a competent number
of hands to the Roll or List of the Lenders, that ye show the same to others
as they come before you, to lead them to lend in the like manner.

10 Ye shall observe and discover by all good ways and means, whether any
publicly or underhand be workers, or perswaders of others dissent or dislike
from this course, or to hinder the good dispositions of any others to lend unto
Us: and as much as you may, ye shall hinder all discourses about it. And ye
shall certify Our Privy Council in writing of the names, qualities, and
dwelling places of all such refractary persons with all speed, and especially
if ye shall discover any Combination or confederacy, against these Our
proceedings.

11 Ye shall let all men know whom it shall concern, that we are well pleased,
upon lending of these sums required, to remit all that which by Letters in
Our Name was desired, upon the late benevolence, as a free gift: And if any
have already paid to Our use any such sum, that the same be accepted for so
much, as in part of this loan, And if it exceed the sum desired to be lent,
that the overplus shall be repayed unto them without fee or charge, and in like
sort, where it shall be equal, no further sum shall then be required. And
this being made to appear unto the Collector or Collectors of this Loan,
either by certificate of such person who collected the said Bencuolence, or
privy Seals, or otherwise, it shall be sufficient warrant to the parties that
are to lend, to defalke accordingly, as also to the Collector for not requiring
or collecting any more.

12 Likewise if sithence the last Parliament, any have received privy Seals,
Our pleasure is, that if they have not yet paid in any moneys thereupon, that
they agreeing to the loan of the sum required, be excused of the payment of
the Privy Seals. And if they have already paid into Our Exchequer, or to any
Collector to Our use any such sums of money upon those Privy Seals, if the
same be less then the money now desired to be lent, it shall be accepted in
part of payment thereof, if it be more, then the surplussage thereof, upon
demand shall be repayd without fee or other charge: and in like sort, where
the Privy Seal shall be equal with the sum hereby desired to be lent,
there the Privy Seal to be accepted for the loan. And these Our
Instructions, together with your Certificate thereof, shall be a sufficient
Warrant for the same.

13 If ye either know or find any able person not set in the last Subsidy,
That ye deal with every such inhabitant in the same manner and according to
the same proportion as is held with other Subsidy men, according to your
judgments and best discretions: and insert their names and sums in the said
book, roll, or list amongst the others of them. But ye are not to admit of any
suit to be made, or any reasons to be given for the abating of any sums, the
time and the instant occasions not now admitting any such dispute, which would
but disturb and protract the service. But where you shall find poverty and
disabilitie, there to use a discretion when it comes to be collected.

14 That ye appoint such and so many fit and able persons to be collectors of
the sums of money within this County, as you shall think fit, of whom you
shall take good bonds for true payment of the sums they shall receive. The
Collectors are to pay in the moneys into the receipt of Our Exchequer, without
fee or reward to be paid by them, within fourteen days after the receipt
hereof. And as soon as ye have finished this service (which We require you
to perform with all possible diligence and speed) ye are to certify unto Our
Privy Council the names of the Collectors (who shall have such allowance made
unto them by the Lord Treasurer as shall be fit) and the names and sums of
the several persons, who thus shall lend unto Us, together with the said
book, roll, or list thereof.

15 Ye shall deliver to every Collector nominated by you, a perfect transcript
under your hands, or under the hands of two of you, of the names and sums of
every person promising and undertaking to lend unto Us, and the Collector who
receives the moneys, shall upon receipt thereof deliver an acquittance for
the same, or so much as he receives, which shall be a sufficient warrant for
the repayment thereof unto the Lender, and a sufficient testimony that he has
paid the same. And every such Collectour within the fourteen days before
^mited, is to pay in the moneys within his Collection as aforesaid, or return
in under his hand in writing, the names of all such as refused or neglected to
pay unto him the sums expressed.

16 And if any of the Commissioners shall be absent from the execution of this
service, (which we hope will not be) That the rest of you the Commissioners
certify their Names, who shall make such default; as also the Names of all
such, who upon these Summons do not come and attend you.

17 And We do hereby explane and declare, That the charge given by the said
Commission, or by these Our Instructions upon faith and allegiance to attend
this service, be not meant or extended to any of Our Privy Counsel, for that
they are daily employed otherwise in Our service: Nor to any Peer of this
Realm not Resident in the County where he is named a Commissioner, nor to any
other that by Our special direction is otherwise employed in Our seruic^.

And these Our Instructions We require and command you upon your faith and
Alleagiance unto Us, to keep secret to yourselues, and not impart or disclose
the same to any others.

These instructions for the ease of transcribing, and the speedier dispatch of
the service, are ordered to be Printed, but no more Copies to be made or taken,
then shall be delivered to the Commissioners upon their dividing themselves
into several parts of the County, for execution of the Commission.

FINIS.
