For ye instruccion of all such as desire to know how the Apostolyke
hospital and confraternite of the holy ghost in Rome was first found / and
by whom it was establisshed and / in what place it is edifyed: in this litell
treatise here following it shall be declared.

First ye shall understand / that this said hospital is edified nere unto ye
water of Timber a this side the brid (...) ^^ynt Ange within a large boow shote
of saint Pe^^^^ ^^urche and palayes of our holy father ye pope / and next unto
bridge (that now is fallen in decay and ruin) the which is called the
bridge of Nero. And more over within the said Hospital is a fountain /
which yet at this time is called the fountain of Nero. And where as now is
the vynyarde of the said Hospital / some time there stood the palayes of
Nero. And also where as now stands the church of the said hospital (as we
find by writynge) the said Nero caused a house to be builded / which was
called Taberna meritoria: that is to say the house of pity / the which house
the said Nero let build to the simylytude of another called Taberna meritoria:
where as now is edified the church of our Lady / over water of Timber / in
the which place at the hour that our savior Jesus was borne sprange a
fountain of oil the which ran into Timber in the sight of all people. And
in to this foresaid house were resceyued all ancient gentylmen and men of war
/ that had trauayled in battle about the public welthe / which in their age
were fallen in pouerte / and were not able to socoure them self: than in the
said house they were honestly nourisshed.

And since ye time our feyth catholyke has been establisshed and augmented / in
the said place has been edified a right fair church in the worship of god
/ and of the virgyn Marye / the which was called Sancta Maria Also in the said
hospital to resceyue the seek people be ordained. iii. C. beds / where
sometime ye shall se. iii. or iiii. C. seek folk and moo.

Also the children that be given to the said hospital to govern: for as many
as they have (both in the said Hospital and i the country / ye which be put
to nourisshe at a place acustomed for them / till they be. v. or. vi year of
age) for each of those children they pay a ducate a month / and sometime they
have a M. and sometime mo: the which they kep^ and nourisshe till they be able
to learn some science: and some of ye men children be religious men / and some
crafts men and some be seruauntis in the said place. And likewise they keep
the maiden children till they be spousable / and than they mary them honorably
at the dispense of the said hospital.

Also in the said hospital be prestes and religious men / ye serve god both
day and night. And there be also. iii. C. lrvi. hospitals belonging to the
said hospital / the which be in diverse cou^tres: and in them also ye said
warkes of mercy be acomplisshed. And in the foresaid hospital daily is a dole
of bread and mete to pore people from morning to noone.

Also in the said hospital be many servants / that take wages: and also they
find many soldiers / that guard and defend certain castles: as the castle
of saint Severe Trypergule / and other being on the pertes of the
myscreantes. wherefore Pope Innocent the.viii. Alexander the.vi. Pius the.iii.
July the.ii. and also our holy father pope Leo that now is / seeing ye great
cost and charge of the said hospital ye which they be not able to sustain
without the charity and alms of criste^ people: wherefore our said holy father
has confirmed and extended the confraternite / and all the indulgences of the
said hospital / willing that it should be publisshed / and conduted in all
places within cristendome: as it ap pereth in the bulls and vulgaries of the
said holy fathers.

Also the said indulgence and co^fraternite were never denulled / revoked / nor
violate: but always augmented. Also the warkes of misericorde of the said
hospital daily be augmented by the help of good christian people / and
principally within this Royalme by the sacred majesty of the most mighty
king of England / the most reverent father my lord Cardinal and legate /
my lord the Archibysshop of Caunturbury Prymate of England / and of all other
prelates.

Also the said holy matter is conduted by the verray religiouse persons of the
said hospital and order of the holy ghost: among whom is a special
Comyssarie / which may make and ordeyne perpetually the said confraternyte
and indulge^ce in all churches / where he and his substitutes shall erecte the
foresaid pardone.

Wherefore than so great and digne pardone / given for so holy a cause ought uat
to be refused: but with great devotion should be desired both for them that be
alive / and for them that be deed.

And finally / though no pardon were granted to the said hospitayll / yet for
the honor of god / and to fulfill the marks at mysericorde / that every
christian man and woman ought to put to their helping hands to the susten
facion of ye pore people and other warkes of charity that daily he done in the
said hospital / to the end yt for their good deeds (done in this world) they
may opteyne the joy of paradise and reygne with the father and the sone / and
the holy ghost world without end. Amen.

Thus end^^h the description and foundation of the holy apostol^^ ^ospitall of
the holy Ghost in R^^^ ^ulgarly called Saint Esp^^^^.
