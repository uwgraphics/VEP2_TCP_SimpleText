To the Honorable, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of the House of Common
by Gods goodness assembled, and by his gracious good providence hitherto
preserved in Parliament: The humble Petition of diverse Barronets, Knights,
Esquires, Gentlemen, Ministers, Freeholders, and others of the County of Darby,
to the number of 7077.
Shows,
THat when we have seriously considered that unexpressible danger this Kingdom
was in at the time of your election, to that great and honorable burden,
which for the glory of God, and good of this Church and Commonwealth you have
now a long time with patience undergone, together with the manifold grievances,
which then did, and some whereof still do disquiet the peace and happiness of
the Kings Majesty, and this Kingdom, and the great opposition the blessed work
of Reformation has met with by those who are ill affected to the State; And
when we call to mind (notwithstanding all this enmity) the many and great
works which God has been pleased already to effect by the wisdom, pains and
unwearyed diligence of this Honorable Parliament, God sometimes turning even
the plots and practices of the adverse party to the furtherance of his own
work, we cannot but give God the glory of his free Grace in Christ to this
Kingdom, and with all due thankfulness commemorate your industrious labors
to perfect the great design of this Kingdoms happiness, so judiciously
begun, and accordingly prosecuted, and which we hope by the continued mercy of
God, your accustomed co-operations, and the willing agreement of our gracious
Sovereign, will in Gods due time arise to a sweet perfection, to the joy of us,
and your posterities: And yet although we live far off, we cannot but hear of
those many late obstructions, and malevolent hindrances with which this good
work has been opposed by means of the malignant party, who by evil councels
and other strange, and formerly unheard of courses, have endeavored to
infringe the lawful power and liberties of Parliament, to continue Popish
Innovations, to oppress our consciences with unnecessary Ceremonies, and to
destroy the lawful rights of the Subject; All which we conceive are contrary
to that happy Protestation so providently commended unto us by this Honorable
House: Besides, the cursed plots that have been invented against our beloved
friends of Scotland, and our poor distressed brethren in Ireland, whose most
lamentable condition our souls bleed within us to remember, and other sensible
grievances at large declared in your late faithful Remonstrance of the State
of this Kingdom.

IN tender consideration whereof, and for that many thousand of poor people
amongst us do already feel the heavy pressures of those long delays in
settling the State of this Kingdom, As we do give humble thanks to Almighty,
the Kings most excellent, and this this high and ever to be honored
Parliament, both the House of Peers and Commons, for that happy agreement in
those good and wholesome Laws already voted by you both, and enacted for the
welfare of Church and Commonwealth, and especially the late Acts for freeing
the Bishops and Clergy from their distractions by temporal affairs, And that
hopeful beginning of provision for relief of Ireland, So we do willingly
join with the many thousands of our faithful brethren and fellow Petitioners
in and about the Honorable City of London, and other several Counties of this
Kingdom, humbly to supplicate this Honorable Assembly of Parliament, still
earnestly to mediate with his Majesty, and the House of Peers, for their
concurrence with you (and by the power of Christ) to go on cheerfully with
what speed you may, to the perfecting of those good endeavors so worthily
begun, and to find out, prosecute, and punish all notorious offenders in
Church and Commonwealth: That the popish Lords may also be removed from having
Votes in Parliament, Papists fully disarmed and confined, Church papists
discovered, and the evil Councels of the popish and malignant party
disappointed, and for the time to come wisely prevented, speedily and fully
according to your good beginning to succor poor Ireland, and that by a quiet
execution of your late agreeing Votes England may be armed with a present care
of defense by a posture of war: That all power and places of strength may by
your happy proceedings be established in persons of trust, and such as this
Honorable Parliament and Kingdom may under God confide in, that the power and
privileges of Parliament may be confirmed, and for future time predefended,
that all Congregations may by your religious wisdom be prov^ded of fit and
able Ministers, and that the Doctrine and Discipline of Christ may be
vindicated from all corruptions, and by Gods blessing we shall make good our
aforesaid protestation to the uttermost, that England may still continue one of
Christ's golden Candlesticks, the Ministers Stars in his right hand, the whole
Kingdom a people in covenant with God, and in the blessed peace of the Gospel,
we may sit every man under his own Vine and Figtree, and enjoy a happy peace to
us and our posterity to the worlds end.

Thus shall your Petitioners be bound daily to pray.
This Petition was presented the fourteenth day of March, by Sir John Curzon
Knight and Baronet; who serves for that County, and after it was read, was
thankfully accepted by the House, and special order given for the Recording of
it, with the Petitions of several other Counties.
