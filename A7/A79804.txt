The Cities Loyalty to their KING.
WHy kept your Train-Bands such a stir?
why sent you them by clusters,
Then went unto Saint James's Park,
why took you then their musters?
Why rid my Lord up Fleet Street,
with Coaches at least twenty?
And filled, they say, with Alddrmen,
as good they had been empty:
London is a brave Town,
yet I their cases pity,
Their Mayor and some few Aldermen,
have clean undone the City.
The Prentices are gallant Blades,
and to the King are clifty,
But the Lord Mayor and Aldermen,
are scarce so wise as thrifty:
I Will pray for the Apprentices,
they to the King were hearty;
For they have done all that they can,
to advance their Sovereigns party:
London, etc.
What Is now become of your brave Poyntz,
and of your General Massey?
If you Petition for a peace,
these Gallants they will slash ye:
Where now are all your Reformadoes,
to Scotland gone together?
'Twere better they were fairly trust,
then they should bring them hither:
London, etc.
But if your Aldermen were false,
or Glyn that is your Recorder,
Let them never betray you more,
but hang them up in order:
All these men may be coacht as well
as any other sinner
Up Holborne, and ride forward still
to Tyburne to their dinner:
London, etc.
Gond send the valiant General may
restore the King to glory,
Then that name I have honored so,
will famous be in story:
Which if he do not I much fear
the ruin of the Nation,
(And that I should be loath to see)
his Houses desolation:
London is a brave Town,
yet I their cases pity.
Their Mayor and some few Aldermen
have clean undone the City.
The MEMBERS Justification.
DEn. Hollis is a gallant man,
and was for them too crafty,
What he pretended for the King,
was for the Members safety:
Sir Stapleton's a stern brave boy,
although his Spouse be courtly,
He went to York, and's labor lost,
he could not bring Franck Wortley:
The Parliament has sitten close,
as ere did Knight in saddle,
For they have sitten full six years,
and now their eggs prove addle.
Brave Fairfax did himself besiege
poor Frank, and him has undone,
Yet lost more men in taking him,
then he did taking London:
Now whither is Will* Waller gone?
to Sea with Prince Elector,
Will he forsake his Lady so,
and leave her no Protector?
The Parliament, etc.
Jack Maynard is a loyal blade,
yet blind as any Beetle,
He purchases the Bishops Lands,
yet scarce can see Paul's steeple.
Both Glyn and Harlow are for Wales,
and Lewis for his Madams,
These Britains will not change their bloods*
with Noa's no scarce with Adams:
The Parliament, etc.
Clotworthy is a zealous man,
yet has his purse well lined;
So has Wat Long, yet he is we know
religiously inclined:
But Nichols is for Pluto's Court,
in inquest of his Father,
O^'s Uncle Pym, and there he found,
Strowd, Hambden* Pym, together:
The Parliament, etc.
These three have Pluto's Mercury sent,
and wonder they prove such men,
To make three Kingdoms one poor State,
and do it worse then Dutchmen:
Their Synod now sits in great fear,
and so does Jack Presbyter,
That we shall have a King again,
and once more see a Miter:
Yet they have sitten wondrous close,
As ere did Knight in saddle,
For they have fitten full seven years,
And now their Eggs prove addle.
FINIS.
