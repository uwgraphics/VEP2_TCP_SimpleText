Present The Kings most Excellent Majesty His Royal Highness the Duke of York
Lord Chancellor Lord Treasurer Lord Privy Seal Duke of Lauderdale Duke of
Ormond Earl of Ogle Lord Chamberlain Earl of Bridgwater Earl of Bathe Earl of
Carlisle Earl of Craven Earl of Arlington Earl of Carbery Viscount Halifax Lord

WHereas by the late Address of both Houses of Parliament, His Majesty was
humbly desired by His own Example to Encourage the constant wearing of the
Manufactures of His own Kingdoms and Dominions, and to discountenance such
persons, Men or Women in His Majesty's Court, as should wear any Manufactures
made in Foreign Countries; And that pursuant hereunto His Majesty had
Graciously Declared, That He would not only do it by His own Example, but
would discountenance all other persons that should wear Foreign Manufactures;
And that His Majesty had given Order to the Lord Treasurer, to Direct the
Commissioners of the Customs, to cause all Goods of Foreign Manufacture
Prohibited by Law, to be Seized, at what Port, or on whose Account soever they
shall be Imported into this Kingdom, and that his Lordship shall grant no
Warrant for the Release of them. And whereas upon the Petition of the Silk
Weavers of London, Presented to His Majesty in Council, setting forth, That
they have attained to great Skill in Contriving and Making of Silks and Stuffs,
Figured and Plain, and that if due Encouragement were given to them, and to
several other Manual Trades, by Prohibiting the Importation of Foreign
Manufactures, they should increase and flourish. His Majesty was pleased to
Declare, and accordingly then gave Order to the Master of His Robes, That he
should not Prepare for His Majesty's Use in His Wearing Apparel, any kind of
Silks or Stuffs Wrought out of His own Dominions, nor any Ribons, Gloves,
Hatts, or other things for His Wearing, which were Manufactured beyond the
Seas, unless as hereafter Excepted. And likewise that the Lord Chamberlain of
His Majesty's Household should take Care, and give due Order, That no person or
persons should presume to come into His Majesty's presence, wearing any of the
things aforesaid, being of Foreign Manufacture, nor any other whatever, unless
as follows; Namely, The Lace commonly called Point de Venice, which may be
worn by any until the First day of May next (and no longer) as also Linen, and
Calicoes, and such other wearing things as by Our own Trade are Imported from
the East Indies.

To the end therefore that these His Majesty's Commands and Orders may be
Publicly taken notice of, and the more exactly obeyed, It is this day further
Ordered by His Majesty in Council, That the Right Honorable the Lord Treasurer
do Renew his Orders to the Commissioners of the Customs, That they direct the
Seizure and Confiscation of all manner of Foreign Wearing Manufactures that
are Prohibited by Law; And to cause His Majesty's part thereof to be Publicly
Burnt; That so the Petitioners, His Majesty's Subjects, may find all due
Encouragement and Advantage in the Prosecution of their several Trades and
Callings; And this Order is to be Printed and Affixed in all the Ports and
Customhouses of England.
