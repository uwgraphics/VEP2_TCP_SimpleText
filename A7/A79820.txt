THE CITY.
DRaw near you factious Citizens, prepare
To hear from me, what hideous fools you are,
What lumps of sordid earth; in which we find
Not any least resemblance of a mind
Unless to baseness, and Rebellion bent,
Against the King to aid the Parliament.
That Parliament whose insolence will undo
Your Cities wealth, your lives and safeties too.
Are you so stupid dull you cannot see
How your best virtues, now are treachery:
Apparent treason Murder, and the like,
How with unhallowed hands you strive to strike
Him whom you should your Loyalty afford
(Great CHARLES) the blessed anointed of the Lord;
How you do daily contribute and pay
Money, your truths and honors to betray.
Big with fanaticke thoughts, and wild desire,
'I is you that blew up the increasing fire
Of foul Rebellion, you that only bring
Armies into the field against your King,
For were it not for supportment from your bags,
That great and highest Court that only brags
Of your vain folly, long e're this had bin
Punnished for their bold sacrilegious sine
Of actual treason, there had never come
Upon this Kingdom such a Martirdom.
Arms had hanged up as useless, and the State
Retained its freedom, had you kept your Plate:
No Keinton Battles had made Mothers curse,
Made childlesse there the treason of your Purse,
The Public purse o'th City, which must be
Esteemed the cause o'th public misery.
No Drums had frighted silken Peace from out
The Neighboring Countries, nor need you about
Your City with your gilded Musket go,
Trayning not for good service, but for show,
That the whole town may see your feathers spread
Over your Hatts, as the Horns do over your Head,
The Humble Parliament had never dared
To have prescribed Laws to their King but spared
Their Zeal in bringing Innovations and
Distractions, over the butious face o'th Land.
They would not then have so supreamely brought
Their Votes, to bring the Kingdoms peace to naught.
Nor with so slight a value looked on him
King Charles, and only doted on King Pim,
Nor for Authenticke Doctrine have allowed
As Law, the precepts of ingenious Stroud,
Hambden, nor Martin, had not then looked bigg
Upon their King, nor Arthur Haslerigge;
Nor yet Kimbolton, on whom we now confer
The style of traiterous Earl of Manchester:
Secured by you the patrons of the cause
Contemned his Loyallty, and the Kingdoms Laws
Nor misled Essex, had not you been, nere
Had acted on this Kingdoms theater
So many tragedyes, nor Warwick sought
To ingrosse the Navall honors, no nor thought
Upon any action, so unjust unmeete
As keeping from his Majesty his Fleet.
It Is you have done all this, you have been the head,
The very spring, from whence this River spread
The streams of foul Rebellion, which we knows
At last will drowned you with it is overflow.
You the arch traitors are, you those that stew
The Kingdoms happiness, and the aleagance du^
To his sacred Majesty, you you that have
Betrayed this Nations honor to the grave
Of lasting obloquye, you that have destroyed
The smiling wealth of the Ci^y, and made void
The good opinion which the King before
Had of your Loyaltyes, of the faith you bore
To The Royal steeme, which still has to your great
Advantage made this City their Chief Seat,
Fond and and seditious fools, do you think you be
Wiser then all times numerous progenye,
That have adorned your City, when did they
Your harmless ancesters strive to give away
Their wealth. and duty from their Sovereign Lord,
To make themselves Traitors upon Record,
When did they their Plate and Coin bring in,
To be the cause of their own running ruining,
They never used to fright their King, nor draw
Tumults together to affront the Law,
No nor good houses, their Corslets slept and all
The Arms they used hung up in each man's hall,
They did not then Ennamel'd Muskets carry,
To train in More fields, and at Finsbury,
But did in comely Archery Excel,
Like honest grave Children of Adam Bell
And Climme o'th Clough, now each of you will be,
More then a furious William Cloudes-^ee.
And trace the Streets with teror as if Ven,
With Fulk, and Manwaring, were the only men
Whom you did owe allegience to, as if they
Could give you privilege to disobey.
The Royal Mandate, which does them Proclaim,
Guilty of Treason, and you of the same,
As deeply stand Impeach't, and will at last
Pay derely for it, when your vain hopes are past
All Succors, which you credit for your merit,
will be afforded you by the help o'th spirit,
That is the devil you serve, for heavenly powers
Can never Patronize such acts as yours,
Poor basled City, but bafled by a crew
Of men, which are as arrant fools as you,
Surely your brains can never be so dull
As not conceive this, which each empty Skull
Must needs resent, how that their only aim,
Is to create your City all on flame,
And as the smoke and sparks up aspire,
They Will sit and Laugh like Nero at the fire,
Themselves have made, unless your heads be all
Horns and no flesh, you needs must see the fall:
That threatens you, like Lightening to Eschew,
Which Ruin 'twould be wisdom to renew,
Your lost alleagiance, and Repentance bring,
As a fresh victim, to appease your King,
For be assured who to the King's untrue,
Must in their nature needs be false to you.
