A country new Iigge between Simon and Susan, to be sung in merry pastime by
Bachelors and Maids.
To the tune of I can, nor will no longer lie alone: Or, Falero lero lo.




Simon. O Mine own sweet heart,
and when will thou be true:
Or when will the time come,
that I shall marry you.
That I may give you kisses,
one, two, or three,
More sweeter then the hunny,
that comes from the Be.

Susan. My Father is unwilling,
that I should marry thee:
Yet I could wish in heart,
that so the same might be.
For now me thinks thou seem,
more lovely unto me:
And fresher then the Blossoms,
that bloomes upon the Tree.

Simon. Thy mother is most willing,
and will consent I know,
Then let us to they Father
now both together go:
Where if he give us his good will,
and to our match agree:
It Will be sweeter then the honny,
that comes from the Be.

Susan. Come go, for I am willing,
good fortune be our guide:
From that which I have promised,
dear heart i will never slide.
If that he do but smile,
and I the same may see:
It Is sweeter then the blossoms,
that bloomes upon the Tree.

Simon. But stay here comes my mother,
we will talk with her a word,
I doubt not but some comfort.
to us she may afford:
If com^^^^ she will give us,
that we the same my see,
Twill be sweeter then the honny,
that comes from the Be.

Susan. O Mother we are going
my Father for to pray:
That he will give me his good will,
for long I cannot stay*
A young man I have chosen;
a fitting match for me:
More fayrer then the blossoms,
that bloomes upon the Tree.

Mother. Daughter thou art old enough,
to be a wedded wife,
You Maidens are desirous
to lead a married life.
Then my consent good Daughter,
shall to thy wishes be:
For young thou art as blossoms,
that bloome upon the Tree.

Simon. Then Mother you are willing,
your Daughter I should have:
And Susan thou art welcome,
i will keep thee fine and brave.
And have those wished blessings
bestowed upon thee,
More sweeter then the honny,
that comes from the Be.

Susan. Yet Simon I am minded
to lead a merry life:
And be as well maintained,
as any City wife:
And live a gallant Mistress
of Maidens that shall be
More fayrer then the blossoms,
that bloome upon the Tree.

The second part,
to the same tune.




Simon. THou shall have thy Candles,
before thou do arise:
For churlishness breeds sickness
and dainger therein lies,
Young Lasses must be cheerisht,
with sweets that daynty be,
Far sweeter then the honny,
that comes from the Be.

Mother. Well said good son and Daughter,
this is the only diet:
To please a dainty young wife,
and keep the house in quiet:
But stay, here comes your Father
his words I hope will be:
More sweeter then the blossoms,
that bloome upon the Tree.

Father. Why how now Daughter Susan,
do you intend to marry?
Maidens in the old time,
did twenty winters tarry:
Now in the teenes no sooner,
but you a wife will be:
And loose the sweetest blossoms,
that bloomes up on the Tree.

Susan. It is for my preferment,
good Father say not nay:
For I have found a Husband kind,
and loving every way:
That still unto my fancy
will evermore agree:
Which is more sweet then honny,
that comes from the Be.

Mother. Hinder not your Daughter,
good Husband, least you bring
Her loves consuming sickness,
or else a worser thing:
Maidens youngly married
loving wives will be.
And sweet as is the honny,
which comes from the Be.

Simon. Good Father be not cruel,
your Daughter is mine own:
Her mother has consented,
and is to liking grown.
And if your self will give then,
her gentle hand to me,
Twill sweeter be then honny,
that comes from the Be.

Father. God give thee joy dear Daughter,
there is no reason I,
Should hinder thy proceeding,
and thou a Maiden dye:
And after to lead Apes in hell,
as Maidens doomed be:
That fayrer are then blossoms,
that bloome upon the Tree.

Simon. Then let us to the Parson,
and Clarke to say Amen:

Susan. With all my heart good Simon,
we are concluded then:
My Father and Mother both,
do willingly agree:
My Simon's sweet as honny,
That comes from the Be.

All together sing. You Maidens and Batchelors.
we hope will loose no time:
Which learn it by experience,
That youth is in their prime,
And daily in their hearts desire,
Young married folks to be;
More sweeter then the blossoms,
that bloome from the Tree.

FINIS.
