See, here, Malignants Foolerie
Retorted on them properly
The Sound-Head, Roundhead, Rattle-Head
Well plae'd, where best is merited.
Sound-Head
This Foolish World is full of foul mistakes,
Calls Virtue, Vice, and Goodness Badnes makes^
The Orthodox, Sound and Religious Man,
Atheists call Roundhead (late) a Puritan:
Because He, (roundly) Rattle-Heads, Truths foes,
Plainly depaints, As this next figure shows
Rattle-Head
See, here, the Rattle-Heads most Rotten-Heart,
Acting the Atheists or Arminians part;
Under One Cater-cap a Ianus-face,
Rejecting Truth, a Crucifixe to embrace:
Thus Linsey-Wolsie, Priestly-Prelates vile,
With Romish-rubbish did men's Souls beguile
Roundhead
But here is a Roundhead to the purpose shown,
A Romish-Rounded-Shavling, too well known;
A Balld-pate Fryen a Roundhead indeed,
Which does (almost) Rotunditie exceed:
Since These Roundheads, with Rattle-Heads so 'gree,
Romish Malignants Roundheads (right) may be.
