THE Knight Errant.
GUzman is famous through the world, for tricks that he has plaide,
Quixot is like renownd for Iusts, against the Wind-mils made,
With other his adventures strange, poor Lazarillo too
Is sung amongst the Spanish Bards, for feats that he did do.
Our Hynd amongst the English Pads, does many one a excel;
And Knowles from all the juggling wits, does bear away the bell:
With many equal unto these, who in print were never known,
Who by their wits and cheating tricks, has couZned many a one.
Yet in praises of our Errant Knight, with me they will bear a part,
And all submit in feats of wit, to our Sir William Heart.
Of Sir William Heart his strange birth, and of his being nourished by the Solan
Geese; of his being found by a Fisherman; likewise how he left that trade and
turned Moss Trooper.
IT is a thing very difficill to give any exact account of the life or first
production of this our doughty Knight, (the subject of this our story) being it
is a matter that has not only bin delivered in clouds unto all his
acquaintance, and those that have heard of him; but even rest hid, as yet to
the present Powers that question him, he being endued with the learned language
of the Highlands, and as good Lowland Scotch, as any of his fellow prisoners,
he pretending to be one of the Hungry nation; but since my Genius has received
further light then any other touching this business, I will no longer hold the
wondering World in admiration: It is a general conclusion amongst the learned,
that a Mandrake proceeds from the seed of men that are hanged, that that
radical moisture distilling from the Mentula, received by the earth, nourisht
and hatch by the Sun; but Sir William had a more strange conceivement. For in
the year of our Lord, Anno 1611. several sail of Scots who had obtained leave
and Patents of King James to transplant the Natives in the Ulster Plantation of
Ireland; these ships being fraught with men, women and their families, setting
out for Ireland, from Dumbarton, Air, and other Western parts of Scotland; But
they had not sailed many hours with a prosperous gayle, but the winds change,
the Seas boil, and in fine the Elements conclude their overthrow (a just
judgment; beware of Naboths garden, or another man's possession, it is not
lawful) and to be brief, the storm waxes so violent, that in a short time away
flies the main Masts, tackles, sails, etc. and splits, some against the rocks,
some splits and sinks in the mouth of Asike, the River that parts Cumberland
and Scotland, others by excessive leaks immediately sink; this so affrights the
perishing passengers, that through excessive fear several women gave up their
young, and in the end not one escapes: yet so it came to pass that one of the
ships in which some of the Abortives were, being broken all to pieces, one of
the untimely fruits floated upon a certain chest, and was beaten into a rocky
cliffe, a place the Sea seldom kissed, but in some such extravagant weather.
This little lump was so much favored by certain fowl called Solan Geese, which
are of a strange nature, drobing from the sides and masts of drowned ships:
these inhabiting in those clifty rocks, kindly nourishes and hatches our young
one, who being fed with such fish as the fowls procured for the space of nine
months; at the end of which time several fishermen used thereabouts a hadock
fishing, one amongst the rest was by foul weather driven into the cliffe where
our Sir William lay, and finding that miracle, friendly takes him away, robbing
the kind fostering birds of their prey; brings him home to his cave, where his
wife kindly receives the child, giving it a mess of Poleloore, a dainty dish
in in that country I can assure you. The stripling grows up to age of 12
years, at which time the old man takes him to Sea, where he assists in the
trade of fishing for the term of five years: But in the mean time a disaster
befalls him (for his father the Fisherman as he supposed) had a daughter (with
whom they ligging awe together) it was his fortune to engender with: she
proving fruitful as most of that country cattle are, forces our Billicoe
Wully for fear of the Scotch damnable Inquisition, that wayfull steule of
Repentance, to leap into the Lawlands into Anandayle where he was entertained
by a Moss Trooper to be Sub-Cow-stealer.

Thus have you heard how strange our Heart,
Preserved was from this wrack.
And that when others drowned, were in the Sea,
The Billows beat him back.
Which makes me shrewdly to conclude,
In reference to our Knight,
That maugre all the Winds and Seas,
The Rope will have its right.
How Sir William Heart became famous amongst the Moss Troopers by robbing my
Lord William Howard of the North; likewise how he cozened them and came
disguised into England.
THE Mosse-Troopers are your Scots that dwell in Nidesdayle, Anandale, the
Marsh country and other adjacent parts upon England, some in Gilsland, and in
the Mosses of Cumberland, these fellows are Country men, which keep good
horses, are well armed, and in fine, are notable resolved thieves, being
numerous, having for shelter their Caves in the Mosses and Mountains where they
inhabit: unto one of the chiefest of these was our Sir William an appendix
whose name was Kinman, famous for his fellonies; these Blades had been much
persecuted by my Lord Howard of Naworth upon the borders of Carlyle, many plots
of revenge had they had against the said Lord. But none to any great purpose,
by reason of the great fear they stood in of him; but upon Hearts being admitted
to their Counsel, they resolve to try their fate (thus:) Sir William and
another that had attained to the English tongue, having laid Kinman with his
crew betwixt Naworth and Brantree, and another party between Naworth and
Carlyle, away comes my two Kendall men (for so Sir Willy and his associate
termed themselves to be) to Naworth, where after a long narration of their
being robbed by Kinman, and his crew not far from thence, as they were going to
Brantree from Perith Fair with commodities, also that they were confident, he
had not passed the the town, but lay in wait for a further prize, whereupon my
Lord causes his men to arm and horse themselves and go in pursuit of these
thieves, with Hearts comrade for their guide Sir Wully staying behind, having
his head broke a purpose, pretetending debility through his wounds. This being
in the close of the evening, the guide leads my Lords men up and down until
it was midnight before they came upon Kinman, who unawares upon the watch word
from the guide breaks out upon Naworth men, in the mean time Sir William
steals out of the Castles, sets fire on the Barnnes, stables and outhouses
and hasts away to the other party by Carlyle, packs away part of them like
Country men for Naworth with all speed as assistants to slack the fire, which
was much increased by reason of the time of night, the small number that was
left about the house to assuage it these Hacks so behaved themselves that
whilst the family run confusedly and amazed up and down, they robbed
several rooms of a great deal of treasure, and so escaped in the middle of
this hurley burley; Back comes those that had been in pursuit of Kinman, cut
and beaten, stripped, and dismounted, crying out they had been betrayed by a
false Scot, whilst Kinman, Heart, and their comrades were marching through
Asike up to their dens, well laden with a rich prize; this plot taking so good
effect, proclaims our Sir William famous amongst the Mossetroopers, who honor
him now as much as the Senate of Rome did their perpetual Dictatour, he
perceiving the influence he had upon them they being gathered together in
council, he thus delivers himself unto them; I make no doubt, but it is well
known unto you all, that how these devils dig'd out of the Indies, (viZ.) Gold
and Silver, are become the Idols of the earth, and that their power ransom
Kings, saves the condemned from the jaws of death, and leads captives the
desires of the World; it being thus my Bulleys, I think a treasury amongst us
would be a greater safety to us then our dens, holes, and sculking places, by
the virtue of which we might release any of our fellows from captivity when
fallen therein by any adventure. This project is approved of, and they conclude
to treasure up the tithe of all their gain in the hands of Sir William and one
more of their chief, to the intent above mentioned; which in few years
(contrary to the Proverb) amounts to a very large sum, which our Knight
perceiving, having drawn in one of the sub-theeves as his man, having horses
and other things necessary robs his fellow treasurer of the money, who was the
next day dirged by the Mossetroopers for a Conspirator in the fact,
notwithstanding his innocence: But our Sir William escaped so well, that you
shall find him presently a banished Knight out of Ireland amongst the then
Noble housekeepers the Catholics of Lancashire.

Now all ye Scots behold and see,
how your Repentant Stool
Made this our doughty Errant Knight
become more Knave then Foul.
Though he by silly birds were fed,
who from guilt and fraud are free.
Yet for creeping to his sisters bed,
my Bulley was fain to flee,
And as the Mossetroopers can tell,
he being turned loose;
They Gods wot^ken full well,
he proved more Fox then Goose.
How Sir William Heart robbed a Roman Catholic in Lancashire.
AT Kirby Loyndsdayle our Sir William puts himself and his in Noble equipage,
and under the notion of an Irish Knight he sets on upon his progress, falling
into society with several Gentlemen of Lancashire and was well liked of,
having a fluent tongue, being full of gold and silver, hunting a week here and
a week there, always largely giving to the servants wheresoever he came,
which made him be cried up for the bravest Gentleman that came within their
Masters doors, but coming on he betakes himself to one of the richest
Catholics houses in that Country, Mr. Preston by name, and there seemingly
betakes himself to his devotions, (he was but a seeming Saint God wot) Lent
running on he charges his man to have ready their horses against Maunday
Thursday at night; the day coming that family with many others of the said
Religion were at their devotion, Sir William likewise. Now as they were at
their Ceremonies singing the Lamentations in the Chapel, the Altar being most
sumptuously dressed, when they came to the passage of representing how Judas came
to take our Savior, at which time they put out all the lights, then I say, did
our Knight step to the Altar nimbly (though profanely) dismantling that sacred
place of a world of rich Jewels, and stealing out of the Chapel to his
horses, and away which caused at the relighting of the Tapers the Lamentations
to be renewed, many being taxed, the Knight not suspected, which gave a greater
scope to his escape.

Thus did he with Religion cloak
his Sacriligious act:
And in the Holy Altar smoke,
Judas- like commit the fact.
To mow the less, was not so bad,
that is but a fleshly sin.
Nor when he was Mossetrooper lad
for them the prize to win.
But by pretense of Holy prayer,
to do so bad a thing,
Will to the world appear most rare,
if that he escape the swing.
How Sir William Heart after his Robbery in Lancashire, upon his Journey toward
London, lights into a rich Inn in Warwickshire, and by a wyle marries the man's
daughter of the House.
OUr Knight after his Robbery at Mr. Prestons flies toward London, making no
stop but what necessity forced him to, and lighting into an Inn not far from
Coventry, he resolves to rest himself some days there; which he accordingly
does, and observing his Host he finds him a notable Cavalier and of a
believing nature, which sets Sir Williams wits a grinding, the man's daughter
being hansome, and Sir Williams kisses, complements and glances amorus, But
observed with a majestic distance by Sir William, his man not failing his
part, the house much listen and hearken to find out what our Noble man was, who
fits them for their hearking, his man always being telling him, when they where
harkening what a disgrace it would be for him a Lords son and heir to match
with an Inkeepers daughter: but Sir William calls him rogue, swearing maugre
the world he would have her, this being heard by his Host and his daughter at
several times they rejoice infinitely; otherwhiles his man would be at him
saying, Please your Honor send me to this Lord or that, naming persons of
Honor, they will think themselves obliged to furnish you with an hundred pound
or two; which the man of the house overhearing, causes his daughter to furnish
the Knight upon all occasions, which so sweetens him that he in a short time
marries her, has to boot most of her fathers wealth, and all this to be a Lady.

To the world nothing is more common,
Then the proud ambition of a woman.
Eve our first father did deceave,
And of that heavenly bliss did us bereave,
Which none but Adam ere did know,
Pride having wrought our overthrow*
For which proud fact women often does smart,
As for example take our lady Heart.
How Sir William Heart came to London, where living at a high rate, at last
Cozened a Linen Draper living upon Ludgate Hill of an hundred and forty pounds
in moneys and for lodging.
NOw behold our mighty match marching toward London, Sir William and his Lady
whith their train, men and maids upon tired Iades, etc. hither they come, and
whilst the merry money lasts (Fly brass the Devils a tinker, and so was Major
Rumball) our jovyall crew spares for no cost, which exhausts in a short time
the most of their treasure; Expectation frustrated, breeds Iarres, This is the
cause of our domestic wars; for in the change of twelve months, Sir William
Heart got rid both of wife and portion; the one he consumes, the other he packs
into the Country: and then betakes him to his wits, and whilst he has something
left takes him lodgings at a Linen drapers upon Ludgate Hill, passing after
his old mode for some great man in disguise, strange Company he keeps, and many
shifts he makes, keeping his credit still good at his Lodging: at last coming
acquainted with a Hollander, he discourses concerning the trade of Linen, and
grows expert in the function; one night drinking a cup of Sack with his
Landlord, he acquaints him that he had a sum of three hundred pound in banck
in Holland, and that he intended to have it over in so many barrells of Bag
holland, and thereupon writes a formal letter before his Landlord for holland;
in less then a months time the holland comes barrell'd up, is brought and
stored up in his Landlords seller: Sir William and his Landlord goes down
knocks open one of the barrells, viewes the top where was four or five pieces
of good holland, and after a little while returns into his Chamber again;
within a day or two following Sir William Heart comes to his Landlord, and
desires, to satisfy a pressing debt, immediately a hundred and forty pounds,
and in liew of that courtesy he told him he would afford him a penny worth in
his holland, the Landlord makes what have he can and provides him with the
sum aforesaid, which our Knight being possessed of, he told his Landlord he
would be within to see the cloth delivered out; but certainly some serious
occasion drew him aside, for he never saw his Landlord since: who having stayed
some two or three days in expectation, at last, breaks open the barrells where
he finds the top of each covered with a piece of holland, and under neath the
barrells were well stuffed with good green turfe, in all to the value of twelve
pence or there abouts: which when the poor Linen draper saw he was ready to
sink through sorrow, but alas! to no purpose, for the Knight was flown half
way into Worcestershire.

This cheating (Sir Kn.) will last but for a while,
These facts of yours will bring you to a fall.
Though the Linnen-draper poor you did beguil,
And through cozening some, do hope to cozen all.
Yet at Worcester (as I take it) not long ago,
You Are beaten, taken, yea and stripped I troe.
How Sir William Heart being taken a Prisoner at Worcester had leave to lie in a
Burgesses house of the town, where a certain Dancing master taught, by reason
of which he fell in league with a young Gentlewoman one Mris. Dorothy, whom he
cheated of ten pounds.
OUr Sir William having played Iegier du pirde from London, steers his course
by the north west road for Scotland, it being then the receptacle of such
blades, the great number of English that came in with the Scots, consisting for
the most part of such hacks. But at or near unto Sturbridge in Worcestershire,
our Knight is taken by some of the County troop upon suspicion, being armed
with Pistols he and his man, he pretends to belong to the Army, but there his
tale failing him, he is brought before Colonel James the governor of Worcester,
where after examination he is committed a prisoner to a townsemans house in the
Cookeing-street where one Hall a danceing master taught several young
Gentlewomen to dance; this Le Frisk our dancing master had been an arch
Cavalier in the former wars; into whom our knight insinuates himself
spending upon him most liberally, which causes him (Cats guts and rossen) to
swear to all his acquaintance, that he was for certain some disguised Prince,
and so commends him amongst his scholars, that several of the female Cavaliers
begins to resent him, and one amongst the rest especially affects him, which
love of hers, may be from these reasons, she being the governesse of her
Grandmother, and of her jointure some three hundred pounds a year, not far
from that City; the indulgence of the old Gentlewoman being the ruin of the
younger, her feature and complexion being none of the rarest; her portion but
reasonable, but her thoughts ambitions, proud, as Ixions; this Lady fancies our
Sir William, loves him, who perceaves her a Platonic lover, he frames
accordingly several glances, sighs, wringing of the hands, trembling kisses,
and amorous verses, which brings our Gentlewoman into so strong a conceit of
being a Lady, that she observes the distance of one already: She invites her
servant to her Grandmother hoame unto several Suppers and Collations, and in
the hight of all this their joylity, comes the Scotch King with his tarpallians
to town, and then hey boys, who but our Knight proclames him at the market
Cross and the next day to Court as Bravely harnessed as one of the Goulden
fellows that strikes the Quarters at Bow church in Cheap side, and afterward
to their old exercise of Carowsing and feasting, where our Lady Dorothy is
seated at the upper end of the board, our Knight sends to his Mistress for ten
pieces; which is sent immediately, the next day he meets her, and to
congratulate her favor, presents her with a blew bead Ring worth six pence,
under the notion of a turkey stone, likewise invites her and her Grandmother
that night to supper, to a pig and other rare dishes. But in the interim, mark
what befalls, our forces the same day routs the Bullyes, and all the fats in
the fire, our Knights taken, brought to London and clapped prisoner in the Tower:
Mris. Dorothy follows, but there contrary to her expectation finds Sir
William Hearts Wife with three or four Children, whereupon she sent to him for
herten pounds, and receives in liew thereof a bad answer, the grief of which
caused the rivulets of her eyes to inundate the marygolds of her cheeks, (roses
I should have said, but I am jack tell troath) and back to Worcestershire she
is gone with a sad heart God wot.

Thus Mris. Dorothy with a pensive mind,
Is gone and left her Ladyship behind.
The ring proves falce, her monie's lost,
And thus you see how her Ambition's crossed.
Thus Reader may thou gexesse pede Hercules,
Our Knights whole life to have done such pranks as these.
And if thou fanciest this our Sir William Heart,
I do assure thee of a second part.
FINIS.
