A PETITION OF The Major, Aldermen, and Common Council of the City of LONDON,
To His Majesty.

Together with His Majesty's gracious Answer thereunto.

Anno Domini. 1641.

TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY. The humble Petition of the Major,
Aldermen, and Common Council, of the City of LONDON,
MAy it please Your most excellent Majesty; the often expressions of your most
gracious acceptance of the manifestation of the Petitioners duty and loyalty,
and the frequent declarations of your Majesty's great care of the good and
welfare of this City, and of the true Protestant Religion, and of the
protecting and preserving the Persons and Privileges of your great Council
assembled in the Court of Parliament: each encouraged the Petitioners to
represent the great Dangers, Fears, and Distractions wherein the City now is,
by reason of the prevailing progress of the bloody Rebels in Ireland,
fomented, and acted by the Papists and their adherents, and want of Aid to
suppress them, and the several intimations they have had both Foreign and at
Home, of the driving on of their Designs, tending to the utter ruin of the
Protestant Religion, and of the Lives and Liberties of your Majesty's loyal
Subjects, the putting out of Persons of Honor and trust from being Constable
and Lieutenant of the Tower, especially in these times, and the preparations
there lately made, the fortifying of Whitehall with men and Munition in an
unusual manner, Some of which men with provoking language and violence, abused
diverse Citizens passing by, and the drawing diverse swords, and therewith
wounding sundry other Citizens in Westminster Hall, that were unarmed: the late
endeavors used to the Innes of Court, the calling in diverse Canoniers, and
other assistance into the Tower, the late discovery of diverse fireworks in the
hands of a Papist, and the misunderstanding betwixt Your Majesty and
Parliament, by reason of misinformation, as they humbly conceive.

Besides all which, the Petitioners fears are exceedingly increased by your
Majesty's late going into the House of Commons attended with a great multitude
of armed men besides your ordinary Guard, for the apprehending of diverse
members of that House, to the endangering of Your Sacred Person, and of the
Persons and Privileges of that Honorable Assembly.

The effects of all which Fears tend, not only to the overthrow of the whole
Trade of this City and Kingdom, which the Petitioners already feel in a deep
measure; but also threatens the utter ruin of the Protestant Religion, and the
lives and Liberties of all Your Loyal Subjects.

The Petitioners therefore most Humbly pray Your Sacred Majesty, That by the
advice of Your great Council in Parliament, the Protestants in Ireland may be
speedily relieved, The Tower put into the hands of Persons of trust: That by
removal of doubtful and unknown Persons from about White Hall and
Westminster, a known and approved Guard may be appointed for the safety of
Your Majesty and Parliament, and that the Lord Mandevill and the five Members
of the House of Commons, lately accused, may not be restrained of liberty, or
proceeded against, otherwise then according to the privileges of Parliament.

And the Petitioners (as in all duty bound) shall pray for Your Majesty's most
long and happy Reign, etc.
HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER To the Petition of the Major, Aldermen, and Common
Council of the City of LONDON.
HIS Majesty having fully considered the matter of this Petition, Is
graciously pleased to declare, that being unalterably resolved to make good all
His expressions and declarations of His care of this City, Of the true
Protestant Religion, and of the Privileges of Parliament; His Majesty takes
in good part, the intimation given by the Petitioners of the fears and
distractions wherein the City now seems to be. And though He conceives He did
on Wednesday at Guild Hall satisfy most of those particulars, is pleased to
add this further Answer.

1 That for the sad business of Ireland, His Majesty cannot possibly express
a greater sense then He has done, there being nothing left on His Majesty's
part unoffered or undone. And He hoped by the speedy advice and assistance of
His Parliament, that great and necessary Work would be put in a just
forwardness, to which His Majesty will contribute all his power: And how
zealous He is and has been therein, will appear in a Declaration speedily to
be set forth by His Majesty.

2 For the Tower: His Majesty wonders, that having removed a Servant of good
Trust and Reputation, from that Charge, only to satisfy the fears of the
City, and put in another of unquestionable Reputation, and known ability, the
Petitioners should still entertain those fears; and whatever preparation of
strength is there made, is with as great an Eye of safety and advantage to the
City, as to his Majesty's own Person, and shall be equally employed to both.

3 For the fortifying of White Hall with Men and Munition in an unusual way:
His Majesty doubts not, but the Petitioners have observed the strange
provocation He has received to entertain that Guard: That by the disorderly
and tumultuous conflux of people at Westminster and White Hall, his Majesty's
great Council was not only disquieted, but his own Royal Person in danger,
most seditious language being uttered even under his own windows, whilst the
examination and punishing such Tumults by the course of Law were interrupted
and stopped. And if any Citizens were wounded or ill entreated, his Majesty is
confidently assured, that it happened by their own evil and corrupt demeanours.

4 His Majesty knows no other endeavors to the Innes of Court, then a
gracious Intimation, That he received the tender of their loyal and dutiful
Affections with very good Approbation and Acceptance, and an encouragement
given them to continue the same upon all occasions. Neither does His Majesty
know, what discovery has been lately made of fire-workes in the hands of any
Papist.

5 For His going to the House of Commons (when His attendants were no otherwise
armed then as Gentlemen with Swords) His Majesty is verily persuaded, That if
the Petitioners knew the clear grounds upon which those persons stand accused
of high Treason, and what will be proved against them (which in due time they
shall be acquainted with) and considered the gentle way his Majesty took for
their apprehension (which He preferred before any course of violence, though
that way had been very justifiable; for His Majesty is very well assured that
it is notoriously known, That no privilege of Parliament can extend to
Treason, Felony, or breach of the Peace) the Petitioners would believe his
Majesty's going thither was an Act of grace and favor to that House, and the
most peaceable way of having that necessary service for the apprehension of
those persons performed; specially, if such Orders have been made (which his
Majesty is not willing to believe) for the resistance of all lawful
Authority, as are discoursed of.

6 And for the proceedings against those persons mentioned in the Petition; his
Majesty ever intended the same should be with all justice and favor according
to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm; to the which all innocent men would
cheerfully submit.

And this extraordinary way of satisfying a Petition of so unusual a nature,
his Majesty is confidently persuaded, will be thought the greatest instance
can be given of his Majesty's clear intention to his Subjects, and of the
singular estimation He has of the good affections of this City, which He
believes in gratitude will never be wanting to His just Commands and Service.

FINIS.
