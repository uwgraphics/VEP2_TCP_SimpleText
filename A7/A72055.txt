portrait of Queen Anne ANNA DEI GRA^^^ MAGNAE BRITANN^^ FRANCIAE ET HYB^^NIAE
REGINA ETc.
For FACE, for RACE, for GRACE, for every thing
Which makes a SPOUSE fit for a ROYAL KING
So here the Effiaies which does represent
That PEER, that SPOUSE, that IEMM most excellent
Whom by a SACRED number, I prove can
A threefolde QVEENE, a threefolde CHRISTI-ANNE
And by uniting THREE again to ONE
I may affirm SHE IS paraleld by none
But is the EMPRESS of true MAJESTY
Whom (GOD preserve) now and Eternally.
