(...), OR, HYPERPHYSICALL DIRECTIONS IN TIME OF PLAGUE.

Collected out of the Sole-authentick Dispensatory of the chief Physician both
of Soul and Body,

And Disposed more particularly (though not without some alteration and
addition) according to the method of those Physical Directions Printed by
Command of the Lords of the Council at OXFORD 1644. and very requisite to be
used with them.

Also, certain Aphorisms, premised, and conclusions from them deduced,
concerning the Plague, necessary to be known and observed of all, that would
either prevent it, or get it cured.

By LIONELL GATFORD, Bachelor in Divinity-Physick.

In his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the Physicians. 2 Chronicles. 16.
12. OXFORD, Printed by H. Hall. 1644.

To the Right Honorable the Lords of the Council, and others His MAJESTY'S
Commissioners for the Government of the City of OXFORD, Lionell Gatford wishes
increase of honor, and the blessing of Peace, Temporal and Eternal.
BEing unjustly forced from that Cure, whereunto God had called me, as the most
of my* Profession are, that will not turn Mountebancks and poison the People)
and not suffered* upon His Majesty's gracious Exchange, (after seaventeene
months imprisonment in London, without any cause shown in all that time)
either to return to that Care or to practice any where else with safety
(though licensed for all parts of this Kingdom) I was necessitated to repair
to this City made happy in the midst of miseries by your Vigilance and Gods
blessing thereupon. I had not been long here, but I saw and partooke (praised
be the Lord for it) of one of the greatest mercies (let others value it as they
please) that ever this City was blessed with: A vast, and in their own
opinion, an invincible Army surrounded us, 2 King 18. and 19.
as sometimes the Assyrians did Jerusalem: Their Tartaris, their Rabsarises and
their Rabsakehs opened their mouths wide both against our religious Hezekiah,
and against all his loyal Subjects then attending his sacred Person, thinking
(as their own bloody Pamphlets did intimate) instantly to have devoured them
all. And without doubt, If the Lord himself had not been on our side. Psalm.
124.
If the Lord himself had not been on our side, when those men thus rose up
against us, they had swallowed us up quick when they were so wrathfully
displeased at us: But blessed be the Lord, he did not give us up as a prey unto
their teeth; but put his hook in their nose, 2 Kings 19* 28.
and his bridle in their lips, and turned them back by the way, not by which
they came, but by which they became the object of their Sovereign's tender
mercy and compassionate pity, whom they then pursued with their Rebellious
malice and merciless cruelty. This unspeakable mercy of God to this City, or
rather to this whole Nation, was attended upon (whether for our
unthankfullnesse, or for our other sins, or for both! with that formidable
judgment of Plague. Upon the increasing and spreading whereof, observing, that
your Honors, in your extraordinary care of this place, had commanded certain
Physical directions in time of Plague to be published, I was encouraged to
believe, that Hyper-physicall directions for such a time could not want your
patronage, And therefore finding none other of my calling, though far more
able, to have prevented me, I presumed to present you with these: Knowing
withal, that without your help and assistance, both Physical and
Hyper-physicall prescripts, how excellent soever, will be but of little benefit
or profit to the most of men; all men being naturally prone to reject, at least
to neglect that advise which would do them most good: and unless the
Magistrates make them know that they bear not the sword in vain, but will
proceed to severe correction where wholesome instructions are despised, the
Divine and Physician both may prescribe till they are weary, and all to no
purpose. Numb. 16* 46.
We read of an Aaron needing a calling upon from Moses to do what belonged to
him in the time of a Plague. Numb, 25. 8.
But as the Plague may be (and, for ought any man knows to the contrary, this
Plague may be such) the Magistrates actual exercising their power in the
execution of justice upon some provoking Offenders may be so necessarily
required, that the raging contagion will not cease without it. This I am
confident of, and not without good grounds: That would your Honors be pleased
but to revive the execution of some of your own Laws against that one horrid
crying sin of swearing and blaspheming Gods name, which so reigns in our
streets and houses, the Plague of God would not rage so much in them, as now it
does. Exodus 20. 7.
The Lord (says the Commandment) will not hold him guiltless that takes his
name in vain It Is swearing (says one of the Prophets) that brings the flying
roll of the curse into men's houses, Zach. 5. v. 3, 4.
and makes it to remain there, till it have consumed both them and the very
timber and stones thereof. And it is for swearing amongst other foul crimes
(says another Prophet) that the Land mournes. Hose 2 4, v. 2, 3.
As therefore ye tender particular men's persons, that have jeoparded their
lives, for you, as ye regard the welfare of this City, wherein God has
preserved you, and as ye love this whole Land, wherein God has highly honored
you, suffer not the sacred Name of that gracious and glorious God, who has
wrought these and other infinite mercies for you, to be dishonored and
profaned so as it is by cursed Oaths and blasphemous Cursings. Let some sharp
mulcts against Cursing and Swearing be duly inflicted and required, that if the
dread of that Name do not terrify men from so abusing it, yet the fear of
that Power wherewith God has entrusted you, and their own just punishment for
disregarding both, may make them afraid to use that Name in vain, which you
have found by so often experiment not to be in vain to those that honor and
rely upon it: so shall your names be precious in Gods account, your friends and
servants that fly hither for succor be solaced and confirmed in their
expectation thereof, your enemies mouths be stopped in one of their lowdest
clamours, and all both friends and foes, that visit this City, be constrained
to acknowledge, that the streets and ordinary places of concourse, under your
Government are sweeter and better kept, then the Churches and Pulpits under the
Rebels Tyranny. Pardon me (I humbly beseech you) for Pleading thus earnestly
in this cause. The King's, your Honors, and this whole Kingdoms hopes of
deliverance from those sore judgments, under which they still groan, (as well
as those miraculous deliverances that have been vouchsafed us) depend wholly
upon that great Name. And therefore if not my zeal to Gods glory, yet my
loyalty to my Sovereign, my duty to your Honors, and my love to my Nation,
may excuse my boldness in minding you of a speedy vindication of the honor of
that Name. I know there are many other crimes amongst us, that cry alowde for
your more then ordinary care and diligence, zeal and courage, Hom. 3. ad pop^
Antioch.
in chastening and correcting the daring actors of them: but (as Chrysostom
once-spake) I conceive this to be the best way of correction, (...).
to begin first with one part of the Law, and see that that be observed, and
then to go on to the rest. And with what part should ye begin first, if not
with that, which is most transgressed, and (if it be rightly considered)
easiest to be amended: Up, then in the name of God, and sanctify the People by
purging out from them this spreading sin of cursing and swearing; Joshus. 7.
v. 13
and prove the Lord whether he will not, Malach. 3. 10.
upon your banishing the Plague of God, and other rash curses and oaths out of
men's mouths, banish that Judgment of the Plague it self and other Judgments
from this City; The forementioned Father was bold to engage his word and credit
to the Citizens of Antioch, that upon their abstaining from swearing God would
free them from that great Calamity which was then upon them. (...), etc.
I dare not undertake so far; but it were well if you would please to make
trial, whether God would do so much, or not. This you may be assured of, for
you have Gods own word and promise for it, whether the Plague shall thereupon
be removed from others dwellings or not, Hom 3. ad Pop. Antioch.
That love of yours to his name shall keep you and your own dwellings safe.
Psalm. 69. 36. and Psalm. 91.
As for your Honors observing these Directions your selves, it were too
presumptuous a thought in me to expect, that any advise of mine should be
hearkened unto by you who have so many learned and renowned Doctors to consult
upon all occasions: yet where you find that I speak home to the purpose and
God himself speaks the same, though not for my sake, yet for his, daigne it
the hearing, I and the following too, if you love your own safety. Howsoever
if you shall but tolerate and approve these Directions so far, that others
under your present charge, who cannot, many of them have access to those that
are more learned and better able to counsel them, or rather are afraid or
ashamed to appear to such, how willing or ready soever to receive them, may by
that your toleration and approbation (the Reverend Doctors not dissenting be
fully satisfied, that there is nothing herein prescribed, but what is good and
wholesome, and will, through Gods blessing, conduce much to their health and
preservation, this will be ample honor and encouragement to

Your Honors most humbly devoted Servant L. G.

Certain Aphorisms and conclusions from them deduced, concerning the Plague,
necessary to be known of all that would either prevent it, or get it cured.
AS there is a Corporal or Bodily Plague; which is by Physicians defined to
be, A Common Epidemicall disease, most acute, contagious, and pernicious, that
with its secret or close-lurking malignity, and Spiritfull poison invades and
infects the heart and vital spirits with all other parts of the body,
suddenly and speedily overthrowing them by causing extreme putridnesse and
raging distempers therein; showing it self at the last, and for the most part,
in spots, sores, or Carbuncles, together with other dangerous and deadly
Symptoms. So there is also a Spiritual or Soule-Plague 1 Kings: 8, 38.
, called Sin, which according to Divines, is a transgression of Gods Law 1
John. c. 3 v. 4. Romans 7. v. 7, 8. cap. 4. v. 15.
causing death Romans 7. v. 9, 10, 11. cap. 5. 12, Deuteronomy. 30. Ezekiel. 18.
temporal and eternal; and may, for its near resemblance to the other
Plague, be further described in the same terms with it: viz. An universal
Romans 3. v. 9, 10, 11. 12, 19. ^3. 1 John. c. 1. v. 8. 10.
or epidemicall disease Ez. k. 34. v. 4. Math. 8. v. 17.
, most acute Genesis 6 5 Ps. 19. 1^.
, contagious Isa^h^. 6. cap 24. 5. Psalm. 106. 35. Revel 18. 4.
, and pernicious Levit. 26. Deuteronomy. 28. Romans 6. 23. 1 Cor. 6. v 9, 10.
, that with its secret or close-lurking Psalm. 19. 12. Romans 7. 23.
malignity and spiritfull poison Deuteronomy. 32. v. 33. Psalm. 140. 3 James 3. v. 6. 8.
invades and infects, etc.

(2)
The Plague of the Soul is the original or principal cause of the plague of
the body Levit. 26 v. 23. 25. Deuteronomy. 28. v. 15 21. Jerem. 29. v. 18, 19. Ezekiel,
14. v. 23. 19. Numb. 12. v. 4. 33. cap. 16. v. 41. 46.
. And therefore without all dispute the best and surest, if not the only
course for avoiding or expelling the Plague of the body, is to avoid or expel
the Plague of the soul 1 Kings: 8. v 37, 38, 39. Ezekiel. 9. v. 4, 5, 6.
.No disease, say Physicians, can be taken away, unless the cause be taken
away; and the cause being removed, say the Naturalists, the effect removes with
it; and the only way that the Scriptures prescribe to get quit of any
judgment, is first to get quit of Sin Jerem. 18. v. 8. Ezekiel. 18. 30 Hosea:
6. v. 1. Luke: 13. v. 3, 5.
.

(3)
As the Plague of the body (according to Physicians in their Physical way) is
caused either by external causes, such as the consuption of the air, the
contagious touch of some bodies or things, etc. or else by internal causes,
such as the putrefaction of the blood or humors, etc. So the Plague of the
Soul (according to Divines in their Theological way) is caused either by
external temptations and provocations, and those principally of the senses
Genes. 3. v. 6, 17. cap. 6. 2. 2 Samuel, 11. 2. Prove. 6. v. 24, 25. cap. 7. 21.
, to some whereof the poison of the temptation is conveyed by the air, to
others by some contagious touch Prove. 6. 29. cap. 7. 13. 2 Co. 6 17.
; or else by internal corruption Romans 7. v. 20, 21, 23, 24. Genes. 6 5. Matthew.
15. 19.
, the seed whereof is derived unto us from our Parents Psalm. 52. 5. Romans 5. 12.
Ezekiel. 16. 3.
. And therefore if we would be preserved from the one plague as well as the
other, we must provide and furnish our selves with such antidotes and
preservatives, such cordialls and other approved remedies, as are good and
proper for the resisting and expelling of both sorts of corruption and
putrefaction, as well external, as internal. And such you shall find by and
by prescribed in their due order.

(4)
Not only the Body-Plague Levit 26. 25, Deuteronomy. 28, 21. Numb. 1^ 33. cap. 16.
46. 2 Samuel 24. 15. Amos 4 10.
it self, but also all the natural or physical causes thereof, are
themselves caused by God, as the supreme and hyperphysicall cause Psalm. 38. v.
3, 7. Deuteronomy. 28. v. 22, 61. Psalm. 74. v. 17. Job. cap. 37, and 38. Amos 3. 6.
. And therefore as we endeavor by Physical preservatives to keep and defend
our selves against the natural and second causes of that disease before it
seize upon us; and as we apply to our selves physical medicines to cure us of
it, when it has taken hold on us: So we must not fail to address and apply
our selves by hyperphysicall means and ways to the supreme and first cause 1
Kings: 8. 37, 38. 2 Samuel 24 v. 17, 18, 21. 2 Kings: 20, v. 2, 3. 7. Hosea 6. 1.
2 Chr. 16. 12.
, who disposes and orders both that disease it self and all its causes as
he pleases Deuteronomy. 32. 39. Psalm. 135. 6.
.

(5)
It is acknowledged by the best of Physicians (as a learned Doctor in that
faculty Mathias Vntzer Lib. 2. delue pestif^ra.
informs me) That although there are many excellent medicines found out, and
by reason, use, and experience of the wisest approved to be very happy and
successful, both for the preventing and curing the Plague of the body; yet it
was never said, written, read, nor heard (they are the Authors own words) that
any mortal man, of all those that have been, or are, could truly assume so
much glory to himself, as to say that God had shown and revealed to him any
true certain Antidote or Medicine against it, either to preserve man from it,
or to expel it from man; but God reserves that skill to himself; and that,
(as some Physicians as well as Divines conceive) because God would not have men
to know any sure defense against that his just scourge of Sin, but only in
him and from him. And therefore though we do and ought to make use of such
preservatives and medicines 2 Kings. 20, 7.
in time of Plague, as God Job. 5. 28. James 1. 17. 1 Cor, 12. 9.
has by learned and experienced Physicians Coloss 4. 14.
imparted unto us; giving him thanks for them Ephesians. 5 20.
: Yet we cannot and ought not to rely upon them: but we must submit all to the
Lord and rest upon him Deuteronomy. 32. 39. Psalm. 121. v. 1, 2. and Psalm. 107, v. 18,
19, 20. Luke 8. 43, 44.
. And if we so do, and repent truly of our sins, and do that which is just
and right; although the Physician can prescribe no certain infallible remedy
for it; yet the Divine can, so far as to assure thee that it shall not hurt
thee. For thy so doing (I mean thy repenting truly of all thy sins, and
relying wholly upon God in and through the merits and mediation of Christ,)
will undoubtedly preserve thee Ezekiel. 18. 30. Psalm. 1* 9 1 and Psalm. 31. 19.
, if not from its stroke, from its venime and poison; so that, if it kill thee,
yet it shall do thee no harm; for that he will be the death of its death, or
the plague to its death for thee John: 11 25, 26, 1 Cor. 15. v. 55, 56, 57:
Hos. 13. v. 14.
; and thy death shall be an advantage to thee Philip. 1. 21.
.

(6)
Whatsoever we take or make use of to prevent or expel the Plague either of
Body or Soul, must be taken or used speedily, without the least delay Numb.
16. 45. 46. 2 Samuel 24 15, Joel. 2. 12. Psalm. 95. v. 7, 8. Isaiah 55. 6. Prove.
1. v. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.
: for the poison of both Plagues is so subtle and spiritfull, that it both
infects and kills in a very short time; oftentimes in a few hours.

These Aphorisms and conclusions being premised, I hope the following
Directions will prove the more beneficial, provided that these two cautions be
observed.

First, That these Directions be looked upon directly as they are, not as the
original prescripts of a Divine, for then there had been less of the
Physician in them, but as the occasional meditations of a Divine upon the
original prescripts of a Physician, and so there is a kind of necessity, that
they should favor the more both of the Physicians (...) and his (...) to, his
medicinal confections and his medicinal expressions.

Secondly, That whereas the Director keeping close to the Allegory makes use of
Physical terms to express Theological graces, the Reader be not so
graceless as to abuse those expressions to the venting of his own rudeness
and profaneness.

HYPERPHYSICALL DIRECTIons in time of PLAGUE, etc.
THe first and most general preservative against this infection is not named
by the Author of the Physical directions; for that (as I suppose) he thought
it more dangerous to fly from this City, as the case then was, then to abide in
it: it being better to fall into the hands of God, who in wrath remembers
mercy; then into the hands of such merciless bloody men, as then did, and
still do lie in wait to devour us: howsoever I shall be bold to mention it,
as being altogether requisite in that case that I shall apply it unto. The
Preservative that I mean, is the flying from such Persons and places as are
infected. It Is approved of in the Letter concerning the Body-Plague; provided,
that they who would make use of that means have no public or private bond
upon them to the contrary, and that they do not take that course, as an
occasion to save their purses from contributing to the releife and support of
those who stay behind them, and are in want; as also, that they do not trust
too much upon their flight, as thinking themselves secured thereby. But in the
Allegory as it concerns the Soul Plague, the flying from Persons and plates
infected, is not only a prescript of Council but of Command; and the contagion
cannot well be avoided without it Numb. 16. 26. Jerem 51. 6. Rev. 18. 4. Tit.
3. 10. 1 Cor. 5. 11. 2 Cor. 6. 17. Prove. 5. 8. and cap. 24. 21.
.

Whether men fly or not, let as many, as have not done it before, set their
houses in Order, and settle their estates 2 Kings 20, 1.
making the best provision they are able for their Wives and Children 1 Timothy 5.
8.
, and not forgetting the Poor Prove. 19. 17. and cap. 21, 13. Psalm. 41. v. 1,
2, 3. Dan. 4. 27.
.

Have a care what Strangers thou receivest and entertainest in thy house. To
entertain strangers especially in times of distress, is an excellent means
of preservation to a whole family, for thereby some have entertained Angels
unawares Heb. 13. 2.
, and those such Angels as have preserved them and theirs from the universal
destruction of that City wherein they have lived Genesis 19.
: and it is a most acceptable thing both to God and Christ to entertain some
strangers Deutr 10. v. 18, 19. Job: 31. v: 32. Mat. 25. v: 35, 40. 3 Epist John
v: 5. Isaiah 58. 7. 8.
, and the excluding or neglecting them most distasteful Mat: 25. 43, 45.
. Yet it is good to beware whom thou entertainest, lest otherwise thou chance to
entertain Devils in the form of Angels. In particular beware of false
Prophets, or false Teachers, who privily bring in damnable heresies, where e're
they come, causing the way of truth by their pernicious ways to be evil
spoken of, and with their fained words make merchandise of men's souls 2 Pet:
2. v 1, 2, 3.
, you shall know them by those marks, by which Saint Peter describes them,
such as the despising of government, carrying themselves presumptuously and
selfe-will'dly; speaking evil of dignities 2 P^t: 2. from v: 10, to v: 20.
, etc. If any such come unto you, or any other that bring any other doctrine
then what is consonant to the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, receive them
not into your house, neither bid them God speed 2 Epist: John v: 10.
. Beware also of all such as use to creep into houses, and lead Captive silly
women, whether they be Prophets, or not 2 Timothy: 3. 6.
, you shall know them also by those marks which Saint Paul sets them out by 2 Timothy: 3. v: 3, 4, 5.
, if you be but careful to observe them. And because you will say it is
impossible to know whether strangers be such, or not, I would advise you to be
the more careful, that those strangers whom you do entertain be able to show
you some way or other either by the report of others Act: 10. 22. and cap. 22.
12. Heb: 11. 39. 3 Epist: John v: 3, 6.
, or by their own deportment James 2. 18. and cap: 3. v: 12, 13. Mat. 7. 16.
, some good testimonial of their being free from all such infection or
contagion. But if they cannot do that for the present. Notwithstanding use them
humanely and entreat them kindly, so long as thou know nothing to the
contrary, but that they are clear and free, and that for his sake who showed
such kindness and compassion to thee, when thou wast a stranger to him and
stripped of all thou had that good was, and wounded and cast out into the high
way ready to perish, those that knew thee, passing by thee, neither willing nor
able to help thee. I mean Jesus Christ himself, who tells thee this of
himself in a parable Luke 10. v: 30, 31. etc.
, and bids thee do the like I^: v 37.
. Nay further; If thou suspect them or know them not to be free from infection,
yet if they be in extreme want, make the best provision for them that thou
can with safety to thy self and family. And that still for his sake who
entertained thee when thou were a stranger to him and to all worth and
goodness that might any ways deserve the least kindness from him Ephesians: 2.
v: 12, 13, etc:
, viz. their Lord and thine; they being his creatures Ezekiel: 18. 4. Mala: 2. 10.
and bearing his image Gen: 9 6.
, as well as thy self, and standing and falling only to him Rom: 14. 4.
. And so I pass on to the preservatives prescribed in the Physical Directions.

such sweet waters Cant. 4. 15.
, as are not to be matched for virtue and efficacy, by the richest distillations
or extractions that art can boast of; and if thou drink them, or sprinkle them
on thy burning heart, thou will find thy animal and vitali spirits exceedingly
recreated and refreshed, and so wonderfully strengthened and corroborated in
their withstanding and repelling all venime and putrefaction. Fail not of
perfuming thy house, chamber or closet* or all of them twice or thrice every
day^: (as much oftener as thou please, or seeft cause Luke 21, 36. Ephesians. 6. 18.

An especially care must be had of thy wearing clothes, for that they being of
a loose porous spongie substance, are very apt to receive and retain
contagion. And we are told by good Authors that have written of the Plague,
that sometimes the poison thereof has layen in clothes, and other things of
that nature, which have been laid aside before they have been well ayred,
not only diverse months, but years, and then infected all that have meddled
with them: the experience of diverse amongst us can witness much in this
particular. And it is further to be noted, that the poisonous seed of this
contagion being in a garment, does pass from thence, not only into the living
bodies of men, but also into things without life; as namely, from one garment
into another, and does sometimes so lurk in garments, that it hurts not him
in whose garment it is, and yet infects and kills others that come near it. It
behooves every one then to be very careful of his wearing apparel; as they
were of old commanded to be, when the Plague of Leprousie Levit. cap. 13. and
14.
was in any place, or other foul diseases Levit. cap. 15.
, And to that purpose be advised to avoid all fantastical affected fashions of
garments Zeph 1. 8. Is. 3. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.
the contagion thereof being very catching. The fashion of open breasts, how
common soever amongst women, is very infectious, and some men may with more
safety come near breasts full of Plague-spots, then such breasts: for the
uncovering of the breasts, is, for the most part, a symptom of excess of
lustful heat in the body: and the laying open to common view that reserved
repose of modest love Pro. 5. 19.
, is a strong temptation to immodest desires to take up their lodging there
Hos. 2, v. 2.
, as supposing those breasts not unwilling to be bruised Ezech. 23. v. 3. 8.
, that are willing so to be exposed. Neither is this all the danger; (though it
be danger enough, one would think, to hazard the loss of thine own, and
others souls, by thy fond and wanton attiring thy body) but thou have cause to
fear, lest thy making naked, and discovering those parts, which thou should
not, provoke God to strip thee of all thy apparel and ornaments, and leave
thee naked and bare to thy shame and confusion here, as well as to thy
condemnation hereafter Is. 3. 17, 18. Ezekiel. 16. v. 37. 39. cap. 23 v. 26* 28,
29, 34. Hos. 2, v. 3.
. Black spots and patches, and other paintings and pargetings of the face, as
constantly worn by some as any other dress or attire, are most foully
contagious, and although now (the more is the pity) they are become the wear
of some honest and honorable personages, yet they are suspected to have had
their first original from that pestilentiall disease, called luet venerea, a
very sore infections Plague: and notwithstanding that they are by some reputed
to render faces the fayrer, yet the more sober and chaste judge such faces, and
their whole bodies not alitle the fouler for them 1 King. 9. v. 30. Pro. 7. 13.

Let her put away her fornications from her face etc.
: and let such faces take heed they do not one day gather other blackness
Nahu. 2, 10. Lam. 4. 9.
; therefore wear no more on thy face, then thou will be willing to appear
with before the face of thy judge. Superfluity and excess in apparel is also
exceeding dangerous, especially in times of Gods, wrath. We read of men
threatened to be cut off for it, and that (as it is thought by diverse of good
judgment) not only for being effeminate themselves, as too many Phantastickes
use to be in their unmanly habits and fancies, but for suffering and
maintaining their wives and children in that their folly and vanity Is. 3. from
v. 16. 10 26. 1 Pet. 3. v. 3 4, 5. 1 Timothy 2, v. 9.
. There is no little danger likewise at such times, and more particularly on
days of public humiliation, to wear soft rayments or costly apparel, which
may be worn by such as are of place and dignity, on other days and at other
times. Our best clothes are then our worst, and our worst, even sackecloth, is
then our best 1 Chronicles. 21. 16. If. 22. 12. cap. 32. 11. Joel. 1, 13. Jonah. 3.

Be no less careful to shun an infected and suspected, houses, such as thou
were before advertised of: And if thou happen to come near any such ere thou
art aware, or upon necessary occasion; and in thy passing by hear any singing
and roaring, or (as they call it) making merry therein, be thou truly sorry for
them, and let fall a tear or sigh at the least in their behalf, as for men in
a desperate condition: for besides that such behavior at such a time Isa: 22.
12, 13. Ezekiel. 21. 10.
and in such a place strongly argues that a strange raving giddiness or
light-headednesse has possessed them, a notorious symptom that the poison or
infection has gotten into their brains; such carriage is usually accompanied,
or followed at the heels, with a deep lethargicall senselessenesse, another
deadly symptom of the Plague, from which very few recover.

If thou pass by any house that has a red cross, or The Lord have mercy
upon us on the door: be ashamed that any door should be better furnished then
thy heart: and therefore let the sight thereof mind thee of getting the door
posts of thy heart marked with the blood of the Lamb, that so the destroying
Angel, which smote that house, may pass over thine Exodus 12, 21, 22, 23. John

customarily, that the Lord would have mercy upon all that remain alive within

If the Magistrates shall obance to forget or neglect their duty and the
public safety so far as to tolerate any unecessary public meetings or
concourse of people, such as Wakes, Feasts, Theatricall sports, Campings, or
Footballplayes, Dauncings, or the like pastimes: have a care thou do not forget
or neglect thine own duty and safety so far, as to be present at any of
them, or to approach near them, unless it be to reprove them Ephesians. 5. 11.

The forsaking or absenting thy self from the public Assemblies in the house
of God, as the manner of some is, I can in no wise approve Heb. 10, 25. Psalm,
84.
. but rather I counsel thee to frequent them the oftener; provided that thou
go prepared with some inward and outward Antidotes and preservatives before
and after prescribed, taking with thee thy Bible in thy hand, and something in
thy purse or pocket for the poor. For besides that God has promised his own
especial presence at such meetings at all times Mat, 18. 20.
; he has also declared more then ordinary acceptance of such prayers and other
religious performances as are presented to him in that place in a Plague-time 2 Samuel 24. 18, 25. 1 Kings, c. 8. 37, 38. 39.
. And, which is worth our inquiring into, very few, if any, of those who have
been infected with the Plague, either in this or in any other contagious time,
could say, and say truly, and upon certainty, that they caught the infection,
or the infection them, by frequenting the house of God, either to pray unto
him, or to hear his word preached unto them.

Go not forth early in the morning: to be sure, not before thou have offered up

I would advise thee to eat, thou shall hear by and by, when I come to speak

instantly sets on fire the whole course of nature, and is it self set on

In the morning before thou go out of thy house, or whether thou stir out or
not, be sure to break thy fast: but understand me aright; Concerning public
and private fasts and the observation thereof. Se afterward in Diet.
I would not have thee to break the' public religious Fast, if any be
appointed by the supreme Magistrate, no nor thine own private religious fast,
resolved on for thy self alone, or for thine own family with thee; for so
far thy power extends; but that is the utmost extent of a private fast, and
they, who go farther in appoynting a Fast, incroach upon the Princes royal
power, whosoever they are. The taking those things which I prescribe, is no
breach, I am sure, of either of these fasts, but an help to the better keeping
of both; and, as far as I yet apprehend, the taking of such things, as are in
such times prescribed by the Physicians, or otherwise communicated for
preservation, is in that respect the like; The fast, that I advise thee to
break, is that fast whereunto every man, through the abundance of corruption
that is in him, is most naturally inclined, viz. the absteining from all
spiritual food and nourishment Amos. 8. 12. 1 Cor. 10 v. 3, 4.
, etc. and this fast thou must break in the time of Plague especially. Thou
need not eat much in quantity: Every morning a little butter made of the
sincere milk of Gods word 1 Pe^. 2. v. 2. Prove. 30. v. 33.

teats of the Old or New Testament, mixed with faith and love 2 Timothy 1, v. 13.

are, that are not received with thanksgiving, and so sanctified by the word of
God and prayer 1 Timothy 4. v. 4, 5.

knife to thy throat; and desire them not Prove. 23. v. 1, 2, 3.
. And because I would have thee know as well what to eat, as what to abstain
from, let me assure thee, that the only bread and flesh, in which thou may
confide, is that bread which is called the bread of God, or the bread of life,
or the bread from heaven, and that flesh which is called flesh and meat indeed
John 6.
. This bread and flesh if thou can feed on it by a true and a lively faith,
my life for thine, no plague shall hurt thee Ib.
. Eat thereof every day more or less according to that provision which thou
have made; and as often 1 Cor. 11. v. 25. 26.
as thou are invited; if thy appetite be good, do but examine thy self, and
eat freely of it at thy Lords Table 1 Cor: 11. v. 27, 28, 29. cap. 10 v. 21.
. To prescribe what particular meats every man should, or should not eat,
were not only ridiculous but impossible, so different and contrary are
several men's tempers and constitutions, and so much also, upon occasional
alterations, does the same man's temper and constitution differ from it self.
Those meats which are wholesome for some, are little less then poison to
others; and that which at one time nourishes a man, may at another time help
to destroy the same man. Wherefore I advise every wise man that regards his
health and safety to consult in point of diet that Physician who has fairly
taken upon him the care and cure of him Man: 2, 7 Heb: 13. v. 17. 1 Pet. 5. 2.
Act. 20, v. 17. 26, 27, 28. T(...): 1. 5.

learned Physician In the second exhortation before the Confession at the
Communion.

discourse is excellent condiment Colos. 4. 6. Ephesians. 4. 29.

at thy meals, provided still that it be mixed with faith, and that it be eaten
with a good appetite without the least nauseating; for if it be so eaten, it
neither corrupts in the stomach, nor causes any obstructions, (which are
the prime reasons why Physicians inhibite milk in time of infection) but it
helps to cleanse Ephesians. 5. 26. Psalm. 119. v. 9.

strengthening the vital parts Psalm: 119. v. 50. 52. 92. 93. 111. 143.

preservation of flesh, especially of beef and veale 2, and 3. Ed 6. cap. 19. 5

fairly taken, may be eaten without danger; but fish taken in other men's

, (the prime ways that those great Fishers near London upon the banks of
Thames use in these times) may perchance be sweet in the mouth, but either they
prove very ill of digestion, or being digested, generate only putrid and
corrupt humors, which dispose and expose the eaters thereof to all manner of
plagues and diseases See the places now cited for every particular.

choosing it Ezekiel: 47, 12. Revel. 22. 2.
. Strong wines or strong drink, unless very moderately taken, is exceeding
dangerous Prove: 20 v. 1.

Ephesians. 5. 18.
. Some kind of emptiness is very bad, and therefore the contrary is prescribed

: nay'tis not safe to appear empty-handed before the Lord Exodus: 23, 15. cap.
34 20. Deu 16, v. 16.
. But the avoiding all such emptiness both of heart and hand is most
consistent with such fasting as the time of Plague calls for and God accepts;
And therefore though I allow not emptiness, yet I cannot but magnify fasting
as one of the best courses that can be taken either to prevent or expel the
Plague, if it be observed according to the following prescript. When a Public
Fast is proclaimed or called by the Supreme Magistrate, (which in this
Kingdom is the King (and the King only, to whom the constituting and
appointing of a fast solely apperteines Chro^: 20 v. 3. Jonah 3. v. 7. Ez. 8.
21. 1 S^m 7 v. 5. 6.
; fail not to keep it with all due observation, abstaining from all meat and
drink Dan. 10. v. 3.
, except what in case of necessity is prescribed by the Physician, as also from
all pleasure and daily labor Isa, 58. V. 3.
; pouring out more then ordinary prayers and supplications Jod: 1. 13 c. 2. 17.
, rending thy heart Jo^l: 2. v. 13.
, and watering thy cheeks with thy tears Joel: 2. v. 11.
, loosing the bands of wickedness, and showing mercy to the poor Isa: 58. v.
6, 7.
: For such a fast is most acceptable to God, and prevalent with him Is^: 58. v.
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Joe^: 2. from. v. 12, 10 v. 28.
. But when a Public Fast is either appointed by such as have not the Supreme
power, (like that of Jezebell appointed in the Kings name 1 King: 21.
, and as such fasts commonly are) for the better color of murdering the
innocent, and taking possession of their inheritance Ib.
, or else is observed only for debate and strife, and to smile with the sist
of wickedness Isa, 58. 4.
, and not according to those necessary conditions of a truly religious fast but
now named; Such a fast, instead of pacifying Gods wrath, does much more incense
it Ib: v. 3, 4, 5.
. And O my Soul come not thou into their secret: unto their Assembly mine
honor be not thou united G^n(...): 49. 6.
. Private fasting by thy self alone or with thy family is of singular virtue

virtue, and thou all benefit by it Mat: 6 v. 16.

Where there is fullness or corruption of blood in any; as, in such a
plentiful peaceable land, as this lately was, the most men's bloods are too
rank, and too high, too suddenly rising upon small or no occasion, and too
often boiling, too much tainted with ease and idleness, and diverse other ways
foulely corrupted; In such a case letting blood is fit and necessary Rom: 13.
v. 4. Genesis 9. 6. Deuteronomy 13. Number. 25, 8. Levit. 26. v. 25. Psa: 78. 34.
: but care must he had that too much be not taken away; for that suddenly
ruins the parties that are so dealt with, and brings the guilt of blood upon
them that so deal with them. The bleeding by horseleeches I like not, for that
they cry always give, give; that is, give us more blood, give us more blood,
or that which is valued by some as their blood Prove. 30, 15.
; take heed therefore that thou suffer not these to fasten on thee. And if thou
make use of a Physician or Surgeon to let thee blood, beware of those
new-upstart Quacks at London, notoriously infamous for bloodletting throughout
the Christian world Nahu. 3. 1. Is. 1. 21. Zeph. 3. v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Ezekiel, 22.

Where the humors are corrupted, and where they much abound, and so are near
to corruption (as who can say he has not such humors in him Pro. 20. 9. Job.
15. v. 15, 16 1 Epist. Jo. 1. 8, 10.
) there purging Physic is very necessary 2 Cor 7. 1. Ezekiel. 24. 13.
, so that it be not too strong and violent. A pretty quantity of Rubarb of
Patience, infused in wine of cheerfulness on the fire of Trial, is approvedly
good for the purgeing of all choleric and melancholy humors Pro. 15. 18. Heb.

; or (where they are to be had) the Quintessence of the one, and the extract of
the other, made into such pills as may well be swallowed, are admirable. Aloes
of sorrow for sin taken in conserve of amendment of life, is excellent for
purgeing both those and all other ill humors whatsoever Ez^k. 18. v. 21, 22,

Issues or fontinels in the remoter parts of the body, made by some cauterie of
external troubles and afflictions, are very good for keeping the poison from
the more principal parts Romans 8, 28. Heb. 12 11, Psalm. 119. v. 67. 71.
, but there is so much danger in the returning of the humors upon the stopping
of such issues, and the corruption that is purged out by them, without inward
purgations, is so little Psalm. 78. v. 32, 34, 36, 37, 40, 41. 42. Amos. 4. from
v. 6. to the 12. If. 1. 5. 2 Pet. 2. v. 22.

mentioned, Page prae.
whether any outward issues be made or not.

Vomiting, if there be cause, is very necessary, As if any have swallowed
ought, that he cannot well digest: or though his stomach be such that he can
digest it for the present, as he thinks well enough: yet it is known to be
such, as if it be not cast up again, it will trouble the stomach a long while
after, and perhaps corrupt his very blood, and that to his Childrens Children,
as all things that are unjustly gotten or wrongfully detained will do, more or
less Pro. 28. 8. ca. 13. 22. Eccles. 5. from v. 13. 10 v. 18 Ja. 5 1 2, 3 4
.

In such a case, if thou have swallowed any such thing, never suffer thy self
to rest till thou have vomited it up again; or else be sure God will either
make thee to vomit it up and thy Children that have eaten of it with thee, or
else, if he suffer it to remain with thee and them, it shall be to bring a
curse and a consumption on both Ib. and Job. 20 from v. 10. to the end. Job. 1.
cap. 27. v. 13. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Zach 5. 3, 4
. Now to procure vomit in such a case, If the oil of love to God and obedience
to his Commandment, will not work with thee as to turn thy stomach Luke 19.
v. 8. Jo. 14 v. 21 23.
; take the extract of several dreadful sentences in sacred writ denounced
against those who swallowe such things such as those new cited let I and K.
, mixed with the bitter water of the curse Deuteronomy. 27. 26. cap. 28. from v. 15.
to the end Zach 5. 3.
, and some of the Spirit of the fear of the Lord before prescribed, boiled
together in thy Conscience, heat with the sense of Gods wrath Pro. 18. 14. Ps.
2 12.
, and of thine own appearing before the tribunal 2 Cor. 5. v. 10 11.
, and so drink it off as hot as thou can well endure it; and if this do not
make thee cast it up, I know not what will.

Exercise with moderation is most healthful; as the exercising thy self in
thy calling, by stirring up that gift which God has given thee for the
enabling thee therein 1 Cor. 7. 20, 24. 2 (...). 1, 6. Exodus 35. 30, 31, 32,
etc. Romans 12, 6, 7, 8, 11.
. This exercise will keep both thy body and mind from a world of corruption,
which would otherwise through idleness or bad employment grow upon thee Ezekiel,
16. 49. Pr. 31. 27. 2 Samuel 11. 2. 1 Ti. 5. 13.
. But the prime exercise of all, is to exercise thy self unto Godliness 1 Timothy 4. 7, 8.
, so as to have always a conscience void of offense toward God and toward
men Acts 24. 16.
. And if the Plague should feise upon thee whilst thou art thus exercising thy
self, happy will it be for thee to be found so doing Mat. 24. 46.
, whereas to be found idle or ill employed at such a time Mat. 24, 48, 49, 50,
51.
, gives the Plague the more power over thee, as finding more corruption in thee
to lay hold on Pro. 24. 30, 31.
, and thee out of that way wherein God has promised to protect and keep thee
Psa. 91. 9, 1, 11, Psalm. 33, 18, 19. Psalm, 144, 20.

The last means of preservation according to the common prescrips of
Physicians, is that which ought to be the first and chiefest in the care and
practice of every wise man. Namely, the fortifying and defending the heart and
vital parts by Cordials, against the venime and poison of that pernicious
disease. For although there be no member, no entrall, no part or particle of
the whole body of man, which does not feel the insulting cruelty and rageing
tyranny of this acute destroying disease; yet of all the rest the heart is the
most infected, corrupted, tortured and afflicted with its pestiferous venom;
because the heart is the magazine of active heat, the royal fort of life, and
the fountain of all the vital Spirits; which being once vanquished and taken,
the victory over all the other parts of man is most easy and expedite: and it
is the nature and property of all poison, especially of this most subtle and
deadly poison, chiefly and principally to assault and invade, and so to wast
and ruin the native heat, and vital spirits, and in them life it self. It
may, and does make its way to the heart by, or through other parts of the body,
and so perhaps shows it self in them first: but it is the surprising and
overcomming the heart which it principally aims, and drives at. Take this
either literally of the Body-Plague, or Allegorically of the Soule-Plague; you
will find it most true of both. The heart is the principal subject of the
Plague of the body; so Physicians; The heart, (that is, the understanding,
will, and affections) is the principal subject of the Plague of the soul, so
the Scriptures 1 K. 8. 38. Genesis 6. 5. Mat. 15. 19. Eccle. 8. 11. Deuteronomy. 29. 18.
19. Jer. 11. 8. cap. 17. 9.
. Above all things then have a care to preserve thy heart Pro. 4. 23. Deu. 11^
16, 18.
, Which is to be done chiefly these two ways. 1 By purgatives. 2 By Cordials.
For purgatives I can prescribe no better then those before advised. And for
Cordials, because there are so many excellent ones, and particular men's,
tempers and cases are so different. I advise every one to make his address (as
before in point of diet) to some discreet learned expert Divine-Physitian of
known honesty and integrity; and unless there be some very good reason to the
contrary, rather to his own Physician that has undertaken the care of him, and
best knows his state, then to any other Sc Diet. let. F. G.

agreeable to God, revealed in his word 1 John. 4. 1. Is. 8. 20. Ma. 16. 6. cap.

. But in case thou be any danger more then ordinary, and can not have
recourse to any such Physician. Take the Spirit of wisdom and the fear of
the Lord Is. 1^. 2.

a terrible sweat, Luke 22. 44.
and unless the thought of that sweat, the sense of thine own condition and
of Gods wrath, together with the virtue and strength of thy Physic do
provoke some sweas in thee, 1. 21, 1 Timothy 6, 5.
I conceive thee to be in a very ill case, little better then desperate. 2 Timothy
3. 8. 1 Pet. 1.
But in thy sweating observe these rules. 13. Jam. 1. 8. cap. 4. 8.
I Consider that it is not the violent or long sweating, so as to weaken thee,
or oppress thy Spirits overmuch, that will do thee good; but the kind free
sweating according to thy strength Every one that is sensible both of his own
sin and Gods wrath, cannot make his let swim, nor does not feel the wrath of
God so hot and so heavy upon him, as some do, Ps 6. Ps. 22, Ps. 38. Ps. 42.
Ps. 88.
. 2 Do not think all the danger over, upon once or twice sweating; for the
subtetly of the disease is such, that being once or twice (sometimes oftener)
repelled from the heart and vital parts, it still lurkes in some secret angle
of the body, and will return again Deuteronomy. 9. from v. 7. to the end. Psalm: 78.

preservatives after thy sweats John 8. 31. c. 15. 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 16.

Thus have I shown thee the best means for preservation that I could recall
for the present. 4 4. Acts. 24. 16. 1 Pet. 5. 9.
And if any Doctor, Bachelor, or other Practitioner in Divinity Physic, can
show me any error in any of these prescripts, Deuteronomy. 16. 15. 1 Cor. 16. 13.
Ephesians. 6. 18. 1 Pet. 5. 8.
I shall willingly correct it: Or if he shall prescribe any, that are more
accurate, I shall amongst others most humbly thank him for it.

Now for Curation, I observe that that Reverend Physician, whose method I have
kept the most close to of any's, adds very little for the curing of the Plague
to what he had prescribed for the preserving from it, Psalm. 38. Genes. 4. 13.
Mat. 27. 3, 4, 5.
except it be for curing the botches, sores, or Carbuncles. And as I apprehend,
he therefore does so, first, because the same physic, especially the Cordial
Physic, that is good for preservation, is as good as can be thought on, in
ordinary cases, for cure, only where need requires, as it does in the most, the
quantity of the ingredients must be augmented. Secondly, because men's tempers
and constitutions as I before told you are so different, and in a manner
contrary, and the poison of the disease infecteth and corrupts in such
different ways and degrees that it is not good, scarce safe either for
Physician or the parties infected to adventure upon any Physic, without the advice (where it is to be had and time permits) of some able Physician, whom
they shall please to acquaint with their particular present state and
condition. The like course upon the like reasons shall I observe in these my
Hyperphysicall Directions. For general curative Physic, in general cases,
where any are infected, (as who can say I am clean Prove. 20. 9. John 15. 15,
16. 1 John 1, 8 ^ 10.
?) I know no better, then what I have acquainted you with, by way of
preservatives: only the quantity of the ingredients, and so of the Doses The
quantity of the several ingredients and particular doses both for preservation
and curanen, I therefore omitted because their nature is such as cannot be
proportioned.
, is to be increased, as there is cause. And for particular cases I once
again, as before, advise every man that desires to deal safely for himself,
and would have his Physician to deal so too, by all means to repair (if he
have the Liberty) to some discreet learned Divine Physician for his particular
counsel concerning his particular state See before Diet. let. F. G.
, and after his prayers to God to direct his Physician aright in his
counselling, punctually to follow his counsel, so far, as his counsel is

A Postscript of Gratitude.
To the Worshipful Master Thomas Smith the late Loyal Major of the renowned
City of Oxford.
Worthy Sir,
THese Directions published for the common good of this City, and therefore
dedicated to those Superior powers, which at this time have more then ordinary
influence into the Government thereof, could not pass quietly from my hand to
the press without giving you some particular interest in them, both because I
received (besides other kindnesses) the constant food that sustained me all the
littletime wherein I was composing them (as well as before and since) at your
table; and so it is but a due return of that fruit which your bounty and
liberality helped to foster; as also, because it is conceived by them that know
you, that your good example in observing them, will be no small inducement to
others, especially of your own polity, the more readily and willingly to put
them in practice. Other retribution, though none more cordial, shall hereafter
be made you, if God make me able. Let it suffice for the present, that as you
forget not to do good, and to communicate Sacrifices with which God is well
pleased: Heb. 13. 16. So that good which you have done, and those good things
whereof you have communicated, are not forgotten by all those that have
participated of them. By all did I say? nay I verily believe by none at all,
that are truly loyal, and such only, as near as you could, were the constant
partakers of your courtesy and hospitality; for certainly, they that in such
times as these dare be loyal, scorn to be ungrateful. Let this poor
commemoration of your rich bounty to such be an earnest thereof: and what I and
others of His Majesty's Loyal Subjects are not able to requite, without doubt,
that God, for whose sake and cause you have done it, will abundantly recompense
into your bosom. For which purpose Saint Paul's benediction, That he that
ministers seed to the sower, will both minister bread for your food, and
multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness. 2 Cor.
9. 10.

Shall be the daily prayers of Your much obliged L. G.

PHYSICAL DIRECTIONS IN time of Plague.
DWelling-houses are to be kept clean, free from filth, and ill smells, the
Windows near infected houses kept close with Glass, or oyled, waxed paper,
that light, but no infected air, may come in. In houses farther from
infection, windows open sometimes, toward wholesome air and wind.

Churches, at times of public Prayers and Preaching, and at all public
meetings, not in Chimnies only, but in moveable pannes; the fires made with
dry wood, Oak, Ash, Beech, dry Vine-branches, Willow, Baytree, Rosemary
sticks, etc. Juniper, Rosemary, dried, Bay Leaves, Angelica, Lavender, Sage,
Hyssope, Marioram, Thyme, Mints, Balm, Pitch, Tar, Rosin, Turpentine,
Frankincense; some of these cast on the coals, to perfume the house.

have them, and be not otherwise provided. Oak boughs, Ash, Willow, Bay
leaves, Hysope, Marioram, Thyme, Lavander, Mints, Rosemary, Fennel, Sage,

red and white Sanders, Storax, Myrrh, Saffron, Amber, Camphyre, Musk, etc.

dragme, Bole-Armeniake two drams, yellow Sanders half a dram, Saffron the
weight of 3d, syrup of Wood-sorrell, as much as will make it into a most

hour after it; treacle-water two spoonfulls, with one dram of Mithridate,

small, roast it soft, close stopped, in a wet paper under the Embers, apply it
hot to the Tumor, let one lie three hours. Or a pultesse of Mallows two
handfulls, two lilly roots cut and bruised, twelve figs sliced, boil all
well in water, stamp them, put to it three spoonfulls of oil of Lillies,
apply it, and shift it thrice a day. When it is broken, take the yolke of an
Egg, honey of Roses one ounce, Turpentine half an ounce, London treacle, or
Venice, and Methridate, and Saint John's wort oil, each one dram, a little
meal flower, mix all together, lay it to the sore, upon leather, changing it
twice a day. Or a hot loaf out of the Oven. Or three Lilly roots roasted,
beaten and applied; burn the plasters, etc. taken off the body.

Those that escape, are to be purged before they go abroad; those that dye,
are to be buried in remote places, and deep in the ground.

FINIS.
