TO THE MOST VIRTUOUS AND GENTLE LADY THE LADY PERIAM.
LO here, most worthy Lady,
these Canzonets of mine, like two waiting maids desiring to attend upon you;
destinated by my Wife (even before they were borne) unto your Ladyships
service. Not that for any great good or beauty in them she thought them worthy
of you: but that not being able as heretofore still to serve you; she would
that these therefore with their presence should make good and supply that her
absence. For her sake then vouchsafe, gentle Lady, to entertain them; having
no other thing to commend them to you for, but this that they are Virgins,
never yet having once been out at doors, nor seen the fashions of the world
abroad. And therefore notwithstanding perhaps in the highest degree they shall
not satisfy you: yet if they shall but in any sort content you; I know that
the greatest fault you will find in them shall be for their smalenesse. And so
good Madame I cease further to trouble: but not still to s^rue and honor you.

Your Ladieships Ever to command Thomas Morley.
