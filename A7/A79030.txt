BY THE KING.
A Proclamation of His Majesty's Grace, Favor, and Pardon to all Seamen,
Sailers, Mariners and other Watermen.
WHEREAS ever since the beginning of Our Reign We have, to the care of the
good of Our Subjects in general, added particular encouragements to such of
them as are Seamen, Sailers, and Mariners, as well by increasing the wages of
such of them as served in Our own Ships, placing of Corporalls in every ship
for their learning of the Discipline of War, and Chaplains for their
instruction in the Protestant Religion, as by diverse other Acts of Grace and
Favor to them in general, far beyond any of Our Predecessors.
Notwithstanding which, We find that by the cunning of some Traitorous and
Seditious persons (who amongst other their false devices, by which they have
endeavored to alienate the hearts of Our Subjects from Us, have suggested that
We intended an alteration in Religion) many of Our Seamen, Sailers and
Mariners have been seduced to keep Our own ships from Us, to contribute
toward the maintenance of the Army which is raised against Us (and which had
destroyed Us, if God almighty had not protected Us in the day of Battle) and
have been since drawn on and invited to serve in land-service against Us,
though they have ever heretofore been freed by Us, and many of them (especially
those which belong to the Corporation of the Trinity-house) have had special
exemptions from any such service. Which Actions of disloyalty We cannot believe
they were drawn into by their own inclinations, but by the false informations,
or threats and menaces of their seducers. We do therefore hereby offer Our
free and Gracious Pardon to all Our Subjects being Seamen, Saylors, Mariners,
and all other Watermen, for all offenses concerning the premises committed
against Us before the publishing of this Our Proclamation. Provided that this
Our Grace shall not extend to any Person who after notice of this Our
Proclamation shall presume to detain any of Our ships from Us, or to serve in
any of Our ships detained from Us, or otherwise serve against Us either by Sea
or Land, or shall presume by Loan, Contribution or otherwise to assist the
said Army now raised against Us, or to assemble or muster themselves in Arms
without authority derived from Us under Our hand, or to enter into any Oath of
Association for opposing Us or Our Army. But We must and do declare, That
whosoever shall hence forward be guilty of the premises or any of them, We
shall proceed against them as enemies to the public peace, and Persons
disaffected to Us, and to the Religion and Laws of the Kingdom.

Given at Our Court at Mayden-heath, the tenth day of November, in the
Eighteenth year of Our Reign.
