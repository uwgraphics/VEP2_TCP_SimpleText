A LETTER FROM A TRUE AND LAWFUL MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, AND One faithfully
engaged with it, from the beginning of the War to the end.

To one of the Lords of his Highness Council, upon occasion of the last
Declaration, showing the Reasons of their proceedings for securing the Peace of
the Commonwealth, published on the 31 th of October 1655.

Printed in the year 1656.

A Letter from a True and Lawful Member of Parliament, and one faithfully
engaged with it from the beginning of the War to the end.
SIR,
BEcause you accuse me so much of want of temper, and say that I am angry with
you, when I cannot answer your arguments, and so that instead of finding a way
to be of one mind, we loose our selves in passion, and love each other worse
than when we came first together: I have taken this uncholerique way of
discoursing with you, and to inform you (since you enjoyne me to use the same
freedom with you, as if you were a private person) why I am so far from
approving your Declaration of the 31th of October, as an Act agreeable to any
rules of Right and Justice, or an Expedient to promote the Peace and Security
of the Public, that I take it to be inconsistent with the Elements of Law,
Equity and Religion, and even destructive to the private Interest of those, for
whose preservation it seems to be intended; And in the doing hereof, I shall
first answer your Argumenta ad hominem; those Reasons by which you thought to
have wrought upon my passions and infirmities, and to have induced me not to
have found fault with that, which could do no harm to any body I care for, and
which I might in some degree be obliged to defend, in order to the support of
somewhat else, which I my self, have done and countenanced.

You tell me, that none are concerned in this Declaration, or in the most
rigorous execution of it, but the Cavaliers, a people toward whose reduction
to the low, and wretched condition they are now in, you say, no man has
contributed more than my self, and that I do confess my self to have been much
deceived, and to have deceived others, to have been in the wrong, nay, to be
guilty of all the innocent Blood that has been spilt in this quarrel, if I,
as well as you, do not prosecute those people to the utmost, upon whom we have
laid all that guilt; and who will show little favor toward us, if once they
grow to have no need of ours.

I shall have so much occasion, upon several parts of your Declaration, to
speak of the Case of the Cavaliers, and how necessary it is that Justice be
observed even toward them, and of the consequence, and the concernment that
all sorts of Men have in the administration of of that which is right and
equitable, and how unsafe it is for the Public, if the due Current of Law and
Justice in respect of any persons be perverted, that I shall in this place only
put you in mind of the Inhibition given in the Parable of the Sowers, to those
over-good Husbands, who would make such haste to free the Field from Weeds;
Matthew. 13. 29.
the Master said, Nay, least whilst you gather up the Tares, you root up also
the Wheat with them. There is no man who reads your Declaration, and considers
it, but discerns plainly, that under pretense of gathering those Tares, vexing
the poor Cavaliers, whom you do not find to grow so fast, as much to disturb
your Corn, and which you intend at last but to gather, according to your
several Appetites and Passions of loving and hating this or that man, or as
you covet their Estates, not as they are dangerous to the public Peace, you
root up the precious Wheat, all the Laws and foundations of Right, which are
the only security of every honest and freeborn Englishman; and that in truth
no person of the Royal party is more concerned in this arbitrary, extravagant
and unparalleled Act of Tyranny, than every man, who has served the Parliament
with the most fidelity throughout that war against the late King, if he do not
submit to the present Power, and endeavor to reform and suppress that, which
you cannot but believe involves a very considerable number of Men, who have
deserved as well of their Country, and have been and are as great Assertors of
the Liberty thereof, as any person, who consented to the publishing that
Declaration; and therefore it is no wonder if you find me, and I suppose many
more, who are not suspected to be over-inclined to the Cavaliers, no less
offended at your resolution and proceedings, than they have good reason to be

To your tenderness of my reputation, least I suffer in my credit, by differing
now with you, which you say is no less than to confess that I have been
deceived heretofore, and that I have deceived others, who were engaged in the
quarrel by my advise, or my example, though I will not answer you in the
language of a much wiser man, even the excellent Philip de Comines. That a
Prince, or any other man, who has never been deceived, can be but a Beast,
because he understands not the difference between good and evil; yet I may
tell you, that whosoever has not been deceived in the Current of these last
fifteen years, has been preserved from being so, by such an absence of
friendship, confidence and Charity in and to Mankind, by such a measure of
distrust, jealousy and villainy in his Nature, that I had rather be a Dog than
that man: For my self I am not ashamed to confess before God and the world,
that I have been much deceived, miserably, and wretchedly deceived, but not
half so much, nor so inexcusably as I shall be, if ever I trust those again,
who have so much deceived me, or if I believe that my ruin and destruction is
not as much designed by this Declaration, as any Cavaliers whatsoever; And that
I may not hereafter trouble you in this discourse concerning my self, or with
my own story, I will very ingenuously confess to you in this place, my part in
the war that was carried on between the last King and Parliament, and then
you will see how like I am to be immoderately inclined to the Royal party, and
yet how unsecure I am from being buried in the same ruin, that is prepared to
overwhelme them, and consequently, whether I have not reason to protest and
prepare against those, who threaten me with that ruin.

When I was returned by virtue of the Kings Writ to serve my Country in
Parliament, I brought with me all that affection to the Liberty and benefit of
my Country, as the condition of it required, and all that Reverence and duty
to the King, that was agreeable to the Oaths I and every man there took, before
we could sit in that Convention; and truly I had no more desire to alter the
fundamental Government of Church and State, than you have to restore it: I
will not deny to you, that after a short time of sitting there, the continual
Fever of the House made my pulse beat higher too, and the prejudice I had to
some persons in power, and authority, from whom, as I thought, I had received
some hard measure, lessened my esteem and opinion of the Court; Then, the Lords
free concurrence in whatsoever we proposed, and the Kings as ready granting
whatsoever we desired, made me think my self in the number of those, who were
to govern all the World, and insensibly I found my self a greater man, than I
had before imagined I was: I chose the conversation of those who were believed
most intent and solicitous to free the subject from the vexations and pressures
he had been made liable to, and I thought them the most competent Judges of the
remedies, which were to be applied to those diseases, which they had so exactly
discovered: in a word I believed all they said, and out of the innate Reverence
I had for Parliaments, I concluded it impossible for any thing to flow from
thence, that could bring damage or inconvenience to King or People, wherein how
much I have been deceived, the world knows, and I am not ashamed to
acknowledge: And this opinion and resignation of my self to that infallible
Guide, made me neither strictly weigh what they did, nor patiently hear those
Objections, which I could not answer; thinking worse of the persons who
objected, than of the things they objected against.

When the matter of the Militia was first handled, I had no other understanding
of it, than as I had observed it had been exercised very unequitably by the
Lords Lieutenants and their Deputyes, and therefore I hearkened willingly to
those Lawyers, who confidently averred, it was not in the Crown; yet the
greatest reason, that persuaded me to join with those, who would press the
King in it, was, that I thought and was assured, that he who had till then
granted all we asked, would not then begin to deny; besides that I saw most of
his Council and Servants, who were of both Houses engaged in the same party
and importunity. When so many Members of both Houses left the Parliament and
went to the King, I could not deny that very many of them were persons of great
Integrity and eminent lovers of their Country; yet I thought their condition
so desperate, that a Sergeant at Arms would have reduced them all, and was
resolved not to imbarke my self in so hopeless a dependence; the Parliament
being to common understanding possessed of the whole strength of the Kingdom:
Nor had I ever the least apprehension of a War, till we heard that some of
our Troops were defeated by Worcester; and that the King began to gather an
Army about Shrewsbury, which yet I thought would never have looked ours in the
face; but that the King would upon some Treaty have given my Lord of Essex
leave to have guarded him to Westminster; and that all, who had obeyed the
Parliament, should have had offices, preferments and rewards, and this
persuasion never departed from me, till we saw the Kings Army drawing down
Edghill toward us the morning before that Battle.

From that time I wished we had been to begin again, and that we had left off
to ask, when the King was resolved to grant no more; I remember three nights
after I was quartered near Warwick at the House of a Minister, whom I had known
long before, and who was then fled, being reckoned one of the Prelaticall
party, and so not taking himself to be secure among our Troops, which were not
eminent for civility toward that part of the Clergy; I understood he was hid
amongst his Neighbors, and thereupon sent to him to return home, assuring him
he should be very safe* He came very willingly, and told me he could not fear
the receiving any injury where I commanded, and so entertained me with much
cheerfulness during the time I stayed there: sitting with him one evening, I
told him, I believed the loss of blood on both sides, had so much allayed all
distempers, that there would be no need of drawing more, but that the King and
the Parliament would easily come to a Treaty, and compose all differences, and
extinguish all jealousies, that had been between them. He smiled, and said, he
had read a story in Aelian, that when in one of the States of Greece, Nicippus
his sheep brought forth a Lion, it was generally and justly concluded, that it
portended a Tyranny, and change of the State from a peaceable to a bloody
Government, and it fell out accordingly: Truly Sir, said he, when the two
Houses of Parliament produced a Sovereign power, to make a General, raise an
Army, and to declare war, after that mild and innocent Sheep, that legal
venerable Council had once brought forth that Lion, which seeks whom he may
devour, I gave over all my hopes of the continuance of that blessed, calm and
temperate State of Government, by which every man eat the fruit of his own
vine; and I expect nothing but rapine, blood and desolation; and if you have
those hopes you mention, you will find your self disappointed; and that they,
who you think are of the same mind with you, have nothing less in their
purposes than Peace, or to perform one promise they have made to the People;
but they resolve to change the whole frame of Government, and to sacrifice the
wealth and tranquillity of their Country to their own Ambition, Covetousness,
and Revenge; and when once they discern that you will not pursue their most
violent courses, they will more endeavor your destruction, than of them
against whom you are both now so unanimously engaged.

This discourse, which I then considered only as proceeding from the spirit of
a man, who I knew approved nothing that we did, afterward made impression upon
me, and I discerned every day men recede from the grounds they had before
seemed to consent to, and to be less inclined to overtures of Peace, than they
had formerly appeared to have been; yet upon those specious reasons; That our
only security consisted in keeping so much power in our own hands, that it
might not be in the Kings power to do us hurt; That if we receded from those
Propositions, which we had pressed the King to grant, we should shortly be
bereaved of those good Laws he had already granted; at least, it would be
necessary in all Treaties to insert, and in some degree to insist upon those
Propositions (how extravagant soever) that by departing from them, we might
pretend to pay a valuable consideration for those Concessions, which we must
still require from the King for our own indemnity; and by these means our
Treaties came to nothing, the Treators being never left at liberty to recede
from those unreasonable Propositions, which were therefore made unreasonable
(as was pretended) that they might be receded from. I will not deny to you,
that when upon the Kings successes, Commissioners were sent to invite the Scots
to our assistance, and I saw a great Army of that Nation ready to enter the
Kingdom upon those unworthy Conditions on our part, that ought never to have
been submitted to, I was in that perplexity, that I thought of nothing but
casting my self at the Kings feet; I was ashamed, that having so long
reproached the King with designs of calling over foreign Forces, as if the
affections of his People should fail in any thing that was just for him to
attempt; and having prevailed so far upon the People by those reproaches, we
our selves should call in a foreign Army to help us, and after we had
pretended to ask nothing of the King but what the People would not be contented
without, and therefore because the Kingdom generally did desire and expect it,
that we our selves should draw in an Army of Strangers, of which there could be
no need, if it were not to impose that upon the Kingdom, which it did not
desire: I called to mind, that Plutarch seemed to commend Lysander, for having
thought it less dishonor and reproach unto the Grecians to be overcome by
other Grecians, than to go slatter the barbarous people, and seek to them that
had gold and silver enough, but otherwise no goodness or honesty. I remembered
what a costly Visit they had made to us two years before, and did truly
believe, that what we could suffer from one another, could be nothing to the
lasting Calamity they would bring upon us, who (I was confident) could never be
a means of restoring Peace and Happiness to the Kingdom. In a word, I thought
of nothing more, than of renouncing those who had so apparently renounced their
Professions, and of cordially joining with the King's Party.

Whilst I was thus resolved, I heard of the cold reception they had, who were
already gone to Oxford, and that the Court there carried it self, as if it
could do its business without help, and thought themselves losers, by passing
by any thing that had been done amiss. The anger and indignation I contracted
hereupon, made me change my purpose, and to revolve, that if others should be
of the same mind I had been, and desert the Parliament, there would be none
left to make reasonable Conditions for them, who had been engaged in the
Quarrel, which I persuaded my self would at some time be done. And I was sure,
that though we might have exceeded our Jurisdiction, and done many unlawful
things, our being together was still lawful; and whilst it was so, we should
at last, upon good or ill fortune, be Parties to such an Agreement, as would
secure our selves who staid, which was more than they could promise themselves
who went away: Hereupon I was fixed, never more to think of quitting the
Parliament, but to run its fortune; and accordingly I proceeded to the end of
the War, and never left the House, notwithstanding the several Factions and
Animosities, and the Violence and Tumults which I much disliked, until I was
with the m^jor part of the House of Commons, kept from thence by the Army, and
used in that scornful manner, as is notorious enough, because after the Treaty
at the Isle of Wight, I desired that an Agreement should be made with the King.

I have troubled you with this short recollection of my part in this business,
that you may see how far I have been from favoring Cavaliers, by whom I have
had the honor to be thought so considerable, that I was always excepted from
pardon in those Proclamations and Declarations, which then issued out. Whilst
there was a War carried on by the Parliament, I ventured my life, and lost my
blood in that War; and whilst there was a Parliament, I continued in the
service of it; and since that time, I have enjoyed my self in as much peace and
tranquillity as the Calamities of the time would suffer me, and without further
opposing the present power, than in my heart not submitting to it, or taking it
to have any color of Law, or Justice, or Religion, or Reason to support it.
And as I do heartily ask God forgiveness for the ill I have been guilty of
during the War, so I do humbly thank his Divine Majesty for preserving me from
the guilt of the ill that has been done since; and I hope the remembrance of
the former, or apprehension of any thing that may be the consequence of it,
shall never work upon me to approve the latter. And so I come to your
Declaration it self, the several parts whereof I shall speak to, without
observing precisely the order they are in, but taking the liberty to marshal
them according to my own way and method.

Let me then begin with complaining, that you assume to your selves throughout
the Declaration, the style of the Best Affected of the Nation, of those with
whom the Honor and Interest of the English Nation is deposited, and indeed of
the Nation it self; and reckon all, who are not pleased with the Government you
have so manifestly usurped, Enemies to the Nation; which you must give us
leave, who have sweat and bled more than any of you, for the interest and
liberty of the Nation, and are sure a more considerable part of it, both in
weight and measure, to take very ill of you. We cannot, we must not, endure to
have it believed, that the English Nation is shrunk into my Lord Protector and
his Highness Council, who all together had not the interest of one common
Village when these Troubles began; you may be such a Nation as God threatened
his chosen people withal in Deuteronomy, A Nation of fierce Countenance, Deuteronomy.

which shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young.
The Latin Translation renders it, Gentem impudentem, an insolent sort of
people, that cared neither for God nor Man. The Grammarians give the style
usually to Sects, or Professions of Men, Natio Philosophorum, Natio Poetarum;
and among the Jews, the Sect of the Pharisees was frequently called the Nation
of the Pharisees; you will find in Josephus a very lively description of them,
Joseph, lib. 17. c. 3.
who, he says were so much addicted to self opinion, and boasted themselves to
be the exactest Observers of the Law in all the Country, to whom the women were
very much addicted, as to those who were much beloved of God, as in outward
appearance they made show to be; These were such as durst oppose themselves
against Kings, full of fraud, arrogance and rebellion, presuming to raise War
upon their motions of spirit, and to rebel and offend their Princes at their
pleasure; and whereas all the Nation of the Jews had sworn to be faithful to
Caesar, and to the Estate of the King, those only refused to take the Oath: so
far he. And if you please this Nation, you may be, except you choose rather
(for you bear great love and affection to the Jews) to be of their fourth Sect,
which the same Author tells you was founded by Judas of Galilee, and accorded
in all things with the Pharisees, but that they were so extremely zealous for,
and jealous of their liberty; that they only acknowledged one God to be Lord
and Master of all things, and had rather themselves, with their dearest
children and kinsfolk, endure the most grievous and bitter torments that could
be imagined, than call any mortal man their Lord. And this is the antientest
Record, I think, can be produced for those Friends of yours, who have lifted
you up to the height you are now at, though it is plain your selves are retired
enough from those inconvenient scruples. Be what other Nation you will, how far
you are from being the English Nation, or that part of it which is tender of,
and like to advance its Interests, must appear in the further examination of
the Principles of your Declaration.

Since you would have it believed, that no part of the English Nation can be
concerned in, or hurt by this destroying Act, but only the Royal Party; you
should so clearly have set down the guilt of those you punish, and the rules by
which you punish, that no innocent man could have thought himself involved in
the one, or in the reach of the other: it had been to be wished, that since you
take upon you to execute Justice and Judgment for the Nation, you had,
according to the good old Custom always observed in those Judicatories,
plainly set out the known Laws of the Land, by which such and such Actions are
declared to be Crimes, and by which those Crimes are to be punished in that
degree; it being no more in the Judges power to exceed the punishment
prescribed, than to declare that to be a Crime, which no Law has declared to
be so: whereas without quoting one judged Case in Law, or citing one Statute
for your ground, or mentioning one precedent to justify your manner of
proceeding, you wrap up your discourse in Metaphysical notions, and conclude by
deductions from the Law, and Light of Nature, and from the dictates of Reason;
a Reason so abstracted from practice, and so difficult to be understood, that
we may well apprehend, that we shall hereafter be concluded guilty, and
condemned, before we are accused, or able to accuse our selves; and therefore
it is not out of kindness to them, that we now endeavor to state the true Case
of the Royal Party, the Crime they are charged with in this Declaration, the
Judgment that is inflicted upon them, and the Grounds of that Judgment, that
we may from thence be able to conclude, how far we are from their case, and
consequently how secure we are from being liable to their punishments.

The Case then of the Royal Party is this. After a War waged for some years
between the King and the Parliament, after several great Successes on the
Parliaments side, the Kings Armies and Garrisons are reduced to those
streights, that they thought fit to make Conditions; They do not confess that
they owe their admission to compound for their Estates, or the moderation that
was used in it, to that excess of good nature you reproach them with in your
Declaration. But they say it was upon a full Contract between the Parliament
and them, and upon Articles of surrender on their part of those places of
strength which remained then in their possession; the which, together with
their acquiescence from further opposing us, we of the Parliaments party (they
say) then thought a valuable consideration for any Concessions we then made to
them; and that they had the Public Faith of the Parliament for the punctual
and exact performance of the Articles on our part. That by our thus treating
with them, and their compounding with us, we raised a vast sum of money for the
support of our Armies, without which we had been in many streights; and if they
had not totally declined any further thoughts of opposing us, amongst so many
discontents which then raged in the Parliament, the Army, and amongst the
Scots, it is not probable that we should have carried all before us with so
little resistance as we did; so that the advantage we got by their Compounding,
was not small or inconsiderable. That we were so far from requiring them to
change their Principles (other than their no further assisting the King in a
War against the Parliament, the which himself at the same time declined, and
betook himself to Treaties) that there was a special provision in all Articles
against any such pressure. That we of the Parliaments party were so far from
urging them to wave their Allegiance to the King, that we professed the same
with them in all our Professions, Declarations, and Protestations; and that the
Crime we accused them of, and obliged them to compound for, was, for their
offenses against the King and Parliament, and therefore the Pardon drawn by
order of Parliament, was granted to them in the Kings name, and passed under
the Great Seal of England: so that they were, and are by that (according to the
Fundamental Laws of England, which are the only security every Subject has
for the enjoying his property and his liberty) free and absolved from all
manner of Offenses committed before the Grant of that Pardon; and by it put
into as full a possession of their Estates, and all the Rights of a Subject of
England, as they before enjoyed; and if they have committed no offense since
that time against the Laws of the Land, they are, and ought to be accounted in
the same condition with us, and not in any degree to be troubled for more than
what they have done since. And this is in truth the state of the Royal Party,
without strengthening it by any consideration of the Act of Grace and Oblivion,
which was afterward granted to them.

Whether those Articles have been so punctually performed as you say; whether
that Court, which was purposely erected to do them Justice in that particular,
was erected soon enough, and before they were broken with intolerable
oppression; or whether that Court has since executed Justice so effectually on
their behalf, as you declare, I leave to themselves to make manifest; being in
truth (as I said before) no otherwise concerned for them, than as the equal
administration of Justice to all sorts of people, is, and must be, the
foundation of peace and happiness to any Commonwealth, according to the
Ordinance of God himself, 2 Samuel 23. 3.
He that rules over men, must be just, ruling in the fear of God. Where there
is not exact and precise Justice, there can be no fear of God, pretend what you
will; and you cannot but have heard, that very many learned and pious men have
attributed the ill success which the Christians received in the several
attempts which have been made, with so vast a consumpsion of men and treasure
in the Holy Land, to that perfidious breach of faith made by the Christians,
after the first taking of Jerusalem, in the year 1098. when after Mercy
proclaimed to all that would lay down Arms, it was concluded necessary for
their defense) upon the rumor or apprehension of the approach of a new Enemy,
and the number of the Captives being very great) to put all the Turks to the
Sword, which was performed accordingly, without favor to age or sex, three
days after their promise made, to the infinite reproach of Christian Religion;
though (as my Author says) some slew them with the same zeal that Saul slew
the Gibeonites, Full. Ho, War, ^ 41.
and thought it unfit that those goats should live in the sheeps pasture. But
the noble Tancred was highly displeased at it, and knew that Christianity
abhorred any such violation of Contract, and expected the miserable success
that attended it. And it may be, that unjust proceeding might be one of the
reasons that moved our Robert of Normandy to refuse that Crown which was then
offered him, and afterward conferred on Godfrey of Bulloigne.

We have set down the state and security they were in by that Agreement and
Pardon; let us in the next place examine how they become Reprobate, and fallen
from that state of Grace, and what the Crimes are which you now object to them.
Before you opening the Design, you prepare us to be content with very slender
Evidence, by telling us, that Conspirators are a sly and secret generation of
men, whose walks are ever in the dark, and the measure of all their feet cannot
be exactly taken and compared. Truly if they walk so much in the dark, that
they cannot be found out to be tried, they ought not to be found out to be
executed: yet in the very Preliminaries to the Conspiracy, you charge them with
matters as evident and manifestable in their nature, as any part of a
Conspiracy can be. That persons were sent from hence to Charles Stuart with
Letters of Credit, and a considerable sum of money. That a select number of
persons were chosen by the name of a Sealed Knot, who were to reside about
London, and to keep and maintain correspondence with those of their party
beyond Sea; both which are particulars, if true, as easy to be made appear to
be, as levying of War, or any other act of outrage. You have Ordinances severe
enough against those, who send money to Charles Stuart; or those, who
correspond with them; produce the persons, make good the Charge, and we shall
not think our selves in danger by your sentence upon them; but, if you will
infer, that because he is not starved abroad, he is supported from hence: and
that all, who do not wish you your hearts desire, conspire to promote his
interest, we must not consent to such consequences, in which we are no less
involved, than they.

You speak of one Fitz-James, who went from hence to the late Kings eldest
son, then at Paris to promote some design of Assassination of particular
persons; of a Conjunction between him and John Gerard; of Major Henshaws going
to Paris concerning the same design, and that Charles Stuart refused to see
him, but relied on Gerard and Fitz-James, to whom he gave precise directions,
that they should not make their attempt, till all his friends were ready in
England: Then you say, there was one Boswell, and also one Pierce, and several
other persons employed at other times for those Assassinations, and had laid
the place and manner of execution; and the means whereby to attempt it; All
the particulars whereof (you say) would be too large to set down; as it would
the several gracious Providence of God in the disappointing of them. Truly,
if this short Recollection of such important particulars be only to put you in
mind in your devotions, to acknowledge to that Providence, those signal
deliverances, you may be as reserved in the discovery as you please; but if you
desire to engage us in the belief that such attempts have been real, and in a
detestation of the Abettors of them, you ought to enlarge your selves in the
relation, and to publish such evidence as may satisfy the world, that your
deliverances have been more than from your own imaginations. What the other
persons are you mention, I meet with no body that knows; and for Fitz-James, I
hear all those of the Royal party, who upon the publishing this Declaration
have occasion enough to speak of him, say, that they always looked upon him,
as a Spy of yours, and not of their party; and you may remember, when you and I
were once walking in James's Park, and he passing by, I asked you who he was,
you told me that you hoped by the means of that Gentleman, that Dunkirke would
be shortly put into your hands, it being then in the hands of the French; and
that he was newly returned from thence, with some assurance to that purpose;
how he came so soon after to be so dangerous an Enemy to you, and so much
trusted by your enemies, I cannot imagine, and had need to be made manifest by
some authentic testimony.

You proceed in hudling up another Design, of working upon discontented
humors, which are observed to be stirring in the Nation upon pretenses of
liberty, and the Rights of the freeborn people of England, which were
supposed to be infringed by keeping up an Army, and by enforcing taxes from
them, and by not calling free and equal Representatives, chosen by all the
people; and then you accuse John Wildeman and some others of the like
Principles (whom you do not name) as fitting Instruments for managing that part
of crying for liberty: And these you say, were to carry on a design, which
should in outward appearance be different from the other, although in truth it
came from the same root, and was directed to the same end. And you say John
Wildeman had brought his part to such maturity, that he wanted very little, but
the open declaring himself in arms, having in effect finished his declaration,
which was to be published upon that occasion, and the time you say did fully
answer the Rising designed by the Royal party, which fell out but a few days
after: When you say, there was another Insurrection that was to keep company
with this, and that part of your Army in Scotland should have mutined,
surprised their Generals, thrown off their Officers, and marched up to London
under the command of Major General Overton: Whereas you forget, that no longer
ago, than in page 15t^ of your Declaration, you say it was the principal
business of those, who were sent with letters of credit and a considerable
sum of money, to assure Charles Stuart, that the reason why the Nobility and
Gentry, and bulk of the Kingdom of England, (which they said were Episcopal,
and of his former party,) did not rise with him upon his late March from
Scotland, was, because he was believed to have gone upon grounds disagreeable,
both to their affections and interests, and also to the good of the Nation, and
inconsistent with the ancient Constitutions both of Church and State; but that
if he would return to his former Principles, to wit, To cast himself totally
upon his old party, they would venture both their lives and fortunes for his
recovery. And in page 27. after the affairs grew apace into a ripenes, and
some were of opinion, that they should take in some persons who had been for
the Parliament, you say, It was denied upon this reason, that seeing they had
no need of them, as their affairs then stood, it would be prejudicial to his
Majesty's service, and their common interest, to take in persons, whom they
should afterward be troubled to be rid of. How comes it then to pass, that
this severe Royal party, without regard to their principles, on a sudden
should incorporate it self with John Wildeman, and Major General Overton, who
in their several Stations, have most advanced that interest, which is most
destructive to theirs; and who have never been suspected for inclination to
Episcopacy; and your selves tell us, after you have amused us with the
discourse of John Wildeman, and Major General Overton, that those, that were
to be made use of to bring the design to pass, were the Revellers, who did
not, as you hope, intend to serve the interest of Charles Stuart. What the
merit of those two persons has been toward the Commonwealth, is enough known
to all lovers of their Country; nor can their reputation be blasted by such
obscure insinuations. It is now many months since they have been in your
hands, under a very strict restraint, and if you could prove any thing against
them of adhering to the Royal party, and promoting that interest, you would
have used the same expedition in proceeding against them, as you have done
against those at Salisbury and Exeter, and therefore we have reason to
conclude, that their being so honestly concerned for the Liberty and Rights of
the Freeborn people of England; their supposing it to be infringed by keeping
up an Army, and by enforcing Taxes from them, and by not calling a free and
equal Representative chosen by all the people, is their Crime and Guilt, and
if you cast in all those* who are of the same opinion with them, into the
Royal party, and think to make them odious, under that imputation, you will
indeed make a party strong enough to vindicate a very Royal quarrel^ and
interest.

The clear matter of fact, which seems to have some manifestation, is this,
That some persons have been particularly trusted in this Kingdom by Charles
Stuart, to dispose the people to a general rising, to provide money, to buy
Arms and Munition; and if they could to surprise some Sea town; That he
himself was so pleased to hear how careful and solicitous they were for him,
that though out of the tenderness he had for his friends, he had deferred to
call upon them, till he could give them encouragement from abroad; yet since
that came on so lowly, he would no longer restrain their affections; but if
they were able to make any handsome appearance in any one place, he would be
sure himself with them, and sent them word, that he would to that purpose keep
himself within a reasonable distance; and this letter was writ in July 1654.
near eight months before appearance of trouble. After this, to make good his
promise, he removed himself from Cologne into Zealand, on purpose to attend the
rising, and the Lord Wilmot, Wagstaff and Oneile came over actually to conduct
and lead the design, and agreed to make their attempt upon the twelve of March
1654. An Insurrection accordingly was made in the West, and had in all
probability increased, if it had not been seasonably suppressed: That in
Yorkshire separated, as soon or before they came together, and so in all other
places, and thus by the goodness of God that bloody design was prevented; yet
(you say) some who run away from their Rendezvous, did it with a resolution to
take a better opportunity, when the Government in confidence of the present
success shall be secure, and less aware of them, and they are at this day at
work upon other designs both here and in Scotland, to begin new troubles and
rebellions amongst us; And this is the Charge of what they have done.

Let us now see the inferences that are drawn from hence, and the judgment
that is given thereupon, and it will be then easily discerned, whether we, (who
are not accused of the guilt, for you say the design was general, and
levelled against all those, who had upon any account whatsoever adhered to, and
owned this Cause) are not by those inferences to be made liable to the same
judgment, when ever you conclude it convenient to your affairs that we
undergo it. You infer from your own Narration (the truth whereof I have
nothing to do to question) that their pretended King, who was ready to embarque
for England, would never have put himself in the eye and face of the world, if
those, who showed themselves in arms, were to have no other seconds but what
appeared; and you say, it cannot be imagined, that the Lord Wilmot and Wagstaf,
and others, would have run so great hazards upon so weak grounds; Or that those
Gentlemen who did actually rise, could suppose that the Army would be so easily
overrun, and therefore you conclude, that what was done by them, proceeded from
the consent of the whole party, and upon this assumption, you adjudge their
libertyes and their fortunes to be at your mercy; and that all the pardons and
Acts of Indemnity, which have been passed on their behalf, are void; and
rather aggravations of their guilt, than security against any other judgment
you will hereafter pass against, or upon them.

Is it possible, that you can satisfy your own Consciences with this kind of
argumentations or can you believe your Army strong enough to impose this Tax
upon men's understanding, tha^ they shall think your proceeding consistent with
Justice, or agreeable to reason? It had been more suitable to your Greatness,
and more ^^spect to the Nation, to have shut up Westminsterhall, that old
Conservatory of our Liberties, and to cause over the Gates thereof, and in the
front of your Commissions to be engraven in letters of Steel, that short Adage
of the Poet;

-- Pro foedere, proque
Justitia est Ensis: --
Than to imagine that you could compose their minds with this Declaration; Can
you think it a good Argument, that the whole party intended to rise, and so
ground enough to judge them, because their pretended King, the Lord Wilmot and
some others believed they would? and do you not rather think their not rising,
when if they had, they might have given us all trouble, an argument that they
never intended it? You say, that the first of the three things which were
chiefly designed by them in this business, was, To prepare and engage every
individual man of their own party, who had either been in the former Wars, or
had been a friend unto them, or was likely by reason of his alliance, breeding,
or discontents, to engage therein, who being engaged, were to bring all their
Tenants, and those who depended upon them: and also to lay designs for the
possessing of Garrisons and strong Holds. And is it not very manifest by no one
man's appearing with all his Tenants, and very few men's appearing who had
Tenants, by their not possessing one Garrison, or strong hold, or house, that
what design soever some particular persons might have, the whole party did in
no degree cherish or assist the design? Shall the presence of those who were
there, though many probably might not know what they came about, be enough to
condemn them, and shall not the absence of others, except you can prove they
were at least privy to what was designed, absolve them? You say, that what
Major General Overton designed, Page 21.
was to be brought to pass by the Levellers, and some others, who did not (as
you hope) intend to serve the interest of Charles Stuart. And why have you not
so much Charity for the Royal party, of which there did not appear enough at
any Rendezvous (Salisbury only excepted) to put you to the trouble of
dispersing them, to hope that whatever the Lord Wilmot and the rest intended,
to bring to pass by them, they never thought to second them? It can neither be
just in it self, nor prudent in you, to give the Royal Party cause to believe,
that they hold their liberties and Estates by no better a tenure, than the good
behavior of every man who keeps them company, or has been heretofore engaged
in the same quarrel with them; That the Earl of Kingston, who therefore
compounded, because he had a great estate to enjoy, should loose his, when ever
Major General Wagstaffe shall rebel against you, who never compounded,
because he had nothing to save, and will be always venturing, because he has
nothing to loose. You have not reduced the Royal party into a Corporation,
that by the misdemeanour of some of the Members, their Charter should be
avoided: They of them, who never had pardon, have received no benefit by what
the other procured for themselves, and there is no reason they who compounded
with you, should without committing new faults, receive prejudice by the
transgressions of other men. Can you imagine, that they who were admitted by
you to compound, would ever have been at the charge and trouble of it, if they
had thought they should incur any danger, or pay the penalty, for any
attempts made by the Excepted Persons? As long as they, who are not suffered to
live amongst you, are projecting against you (as they will always be) must not
the rest, who dwell at home as much as you, enjoy what is their own? In a word,
every man compounded for himself, sued out his own pardon, and can only be
punished for his own offenses: And it is expressly provided for by several
Statutes of Magna Charta, that no man shall be condemned without being brought
to his answer, and how the sworn Judges of the Law, who do not relieve those,
who demand protection from them for their Liberties or Estates, will answer the
breach of their duty and their Oaths I cannot foresee; especially, if they
remember, what the Lord Chief Justice Cook puts them in mind of, Cooks Pleas
of the Crown fol. 23.
in his Pleas of the Crown, printed by order of Parliament. That it was Enacted
in the first year of H. 4. that the Lords, nor the Judges shall never be
admitted to say, That they durst not for fear of death to speak the truth. For
my own part, I am content, that I was one of that party, which reduced them to
a necessity of compounding, and admitted them to conpound upon such terms,
that they might enjoy their Country with some satisfaction and comfort: Let it
be your glory, to break and violate all those conditions, and to be recorded,
as those were by the excellent Historian, in the declination of the Roman State
from Justice and Honor: Salust.
Ignavissimi homines per summum scelus, omnia ea sociis adimere, quae
fortissimi viri victores hostibus reliquerunt; That you have by transcendent
wickedness and Tyranny stripped them of all, whilst they lived as friends
peaceably with you, and under you, which we were contented they should enjoy,
after we had conquered them as Enemies: and so let them stand or fall, as they
can.

I come now to consider, how we, who are not yet accused by you, may expect
upon the same inferences, to have the same judgment let loose upon us, which
for the present you intend shall immediately destroy only the Royal party: you
will not suffer us to think it strange, that so many persons are secured,
although they were not visibly in arms, upon the late Insurrection, or that
you have laid a burden upon their Estates, beyond what is imposed upon the
rest of the Nation, toward the defraying that charge, of which they are the
occasion: you have at present in custody under the same general reproach
persons, who from the beginning to the end of the war, served the Parliament
as faithfully and as eminently, as any who were Members of it: now it is not
probable, that they would have engaged themselves in so unequal an enterprise,
if they had not expected to be seconded by their friends, why should not we
therefore look to be involved under the same judgment? You say, John Wildeman,
and others of the like Principles, were most fitting Instruments for the
carrying on the design, and that Major General Overton was to make use of the
Levellers, and it cannot be supposed, that they would have proceeded so far,
without having some assurance of assistance from their party, and I pray then
where is the difference between the Levellers, those who insist upon the Rights
and Liberties of the freeborn people of England, who would have Taxes taken
off, and a free and equal Representative (those are their Crimes) and the
Royal party which is condemned, because some of their friends appeared in the
Insurrection? It is plain enough, what they are in due time to expect at your
hands, who in the last Parliament Insisted to have part of the Army disbanded,
which you insinuate, was done upon no less than Combination with that party
you have condemned: But we need not take such pains by such inferences to
discover your good purposes toward us, Page 14.
you have ingenuously declared, That your quarrel is against all, who retain
their old Principles, and still adhere to their former interest in direct
opposition to the Government established: Let the old Principles retained, be
what they will, and the Interest adhered to what it will, Parliamentarie
Principles and Parliamentarie Interest, Presbyterian Principles and
Presbyterian Interest, Independent Principles and Independent Interest, if it
be in direct opposition to the Government established, the same measure of
persecution must be their portion, which you would have us think is only now
assigned to the Cavaliers. Alas it is not their Principles you are angry with,
but their obstinate adhering to their obligations, and their interest; Let them
depart from those, and no longer oppose the Government established, and you
will like them the better for their Principles: the truth is, you think none
worthy of their estates, but they who have their Principles, and therefore you
resolve to take both Estates and Principles to your selves: No other Principles
will serve your turn, witness the weekly Sermons preached by your Proselytes,
of obedience, and subjection to Government; so diametrically contrary to what
the same men preached in the beginning of these troubles, that if their Sermons
of the year 1641. were bound up in the same volume with those they preached in
1654 and 1655, they might be taken to be Vincent and York bound together, by
their Invectives, Contradictions and Positions; and Prin and Mountague are not
more unlike, than this Offspring begotten by the same Parents; witness the
Principles and Grounds of this Declaration and Judgment, which are more
arbitrary and tyrannical than ever were vented or laid down, and owned by the
most exorbitant person of the Royal Party, which pulls up all Property and
liberty by the roots, reduces all our Law, Common and Statute, to the dictates
of your own will, and all reason to that which you, and you alone, will call
reason of State, and which we are obliged in the next place to examine, as our
Parva Charta, and the Funeral Oration upon Parliaments, Law, Conscience, and
Equity, and we shall then see how near our condition is to that of the poor
Sicilians, which Plutarch tells us of, when the two Captains, Calippus and
Pharax, professed they would set Sicily at liberty, and drive out the Tyrants,
but did in truth exercise so much cruelty upon the people, and brought them to
such calamity and misery, that (he says) all that they had ever suffered under
all the Tyrants, Plut. vita Timol.
seemed to be pleasure and delight, to the insupportable yoke of servitude they
were forced to submit to under those Reformers; and they desired nothing more,
than to exchange the liberty they had so dearly purchased, for the Government
they had so foolishly wished to be freed from.

Your first Principle is, That as well the Articles of War, as the favor and
grace granted by the Act of Oblivion, contained in them a reciprocation. As
there did a real benefit accrue to the Grantees, so certainly there was a good
intended and designed by them to the State; and if the State do not attain
their end, neither ought the other to accomplish theirs: From hence you argue,
That none have signed to Articles of War, that are not conditional; and that
when those, who received those Articles, resolved to break the conditions, they
had not then the consent of those that gave them. Let us speak first to the
Articles of War; and if you had not a wonderful delight to make easy things
hard, and to perplex the common people with difficult words, you could not
apply this discourse to your purpose: Nor do Articles of War contain any secret
Conditions that are not expressed. The reciprocation is, that one delivers what
he is in express terms obliged to deliver, and thereupon that he receives what
was promised that he should receive; if he performs not his promise at the time
he is engaged, or imbezel any thing he promised to deliver, he has forfeited
the benefit that should accrue to him by the Articles. But when he has
performed his part (I speak purely of the Articles of War) he is not obliged to
change his Party, nor to love those with whom he has capitulated, nor shall
forfeit the benefit due to him by those Articles, though he should seize the
Town delivered by him within one month after, except he were by his Articles
expressly restrained from any such attempt.

For the Act of Oblivion, you declare, That must needs be meant as an
Obligation upon the Enemy, and as a proper means to take away the Enmity
contracted by the War, intending by Mercy to reform those who had opposed, etc.
And that this does imply such a condition in the nature of it. Whereas in truth
any Condition is contrary to, very inconsistent with the nature of it; nothing
more absolute, nothing less conditional, than an Act of Oblivion, which wipes
out all that is past, without the least prospect to come. Nor are they always
granted out of mercy, but from convenience, when they who give them usually
receive as much benefit from them, as they to whom they are granted; when the
number or power of the guilty is too great and too hard for the innocent, the
latter are more concerned to give, than the other to receive the Act of
Oblivion, in which of old there used to be this Clause, Live. li. 7.
Ne quis eam rem (whatsoever it was they had been guilty of) joco seriove
cuiquam exprobraret; which if it were an essential Clause, has been very ill
observed by you.

You heighten this Doctrine by a very notable Maxim, in the point of Pardons,
which you say are always granted with Clauses of good behavior, either
explicit or implicit, because else whosoever granted them, lets loose a
Delinquent to future offense; and he that answers not the end and consideration
of the Pardon, cannot in reason be said ever to accept it; For, you say, an
Oblivion was not only intended of the offenses, whereby they had rendered
themselves obnoxious, but that this kindness should be answered with obedience
on their part, and produce a real change in their Principles and Interest, as
to the Common Cause. I have heard, that it is usual that men, who plead their
pardon for any capital offense, are obliged to find Sureties for their good
behavior: but I never heard, that for the breach of the good behavior, they
were proceeded against, and executed for their old offense, as if they had no
pardon, that is sure against the nature of the Pardon. Nay, if a man be
pardoned under the Great Seal of England for the highest Treason, and
afterward commit a new Treason, he shall not, without a new Process, be
executed for the old, but must be formally convicted for the new, and can be
punished only for that; nor can the former be any other aggravation, than to
make him appear less worthy of a new mercy. But let us see now how far this new
Law, and new Logic, concerns our selves; and first, give me leave to put you a
Case, which may or might have much concerned one of your own Body; and we find
those instances illustrate most, which come nearest to our own interest. My
Lord Commissioner Fynes (who they say was the sole Architect of this goodly
Structure, your Declaration) was, you know, once Governor of Bristol, and for
the base surrendering that City to the late King's Forces, out of want of
Courage to defend, was adjudged by a Court of War at Saint Albans, to lose his
head; my Lord of Essex, according to the authority he then had, gave him his
pardon under his hand and seal, by which alone he was preserved from Execution.
Now the intention of that Pardon was, that this kindness should be answered
with obedience on his part, and that he should not swerve from the Principles
of that Cause then in contest* nor from his affection to that General, who gave
him his life. How far he has been from performing those Conditions, all the
World knows, and yet he would not sure be willing to forfeit the benefit of his
Pardon. Another intention of that Pardon, was, that he should have Courage and
Magnanimity to discharge any Trust the State should confer upon him, without
being corrupted with fear or hope, to betray it: If he shall by money or
threats be wrought upon to do injustice in the place in which he is trusted,
since he that answers not the end and consideration of the Pardon, cannot in
reason be said ever to accept it, shall he forfeit the benefit thereof, and
lose his head upon the former Judgment? Have you forgotten how many persons
stand secured by your Act of Oblivion and Pardon, besides the Royal Party? and
will you, that you may elude the one, lay down those rules, which must cancel
the peace and quiet of the other? What have many faithful people of the City,
and other good Patriots, to secure them for many things they did during the
contest between and in the two Houses of Parliament, and whilst one part went
to the Army, and the other remained in their places, but Acts of Oblivion and
Pardon? What have the Agitators of the Army, and indeed those parts of the Army
it self, not inconsiderable, who upon several occasions refused to obey their
orders, and sometimes mutined against their Officers, to secure them that they
should not lose their heads to morrow, but Acts of Oblivion and Pardon? And
must they now be told of intentions in granting them, which they never heard
of? And that if the State do not attain their end, in such an obedience on
their part, as produces a real change in their principles and interest, all is
void that has been done, and they liable to the same punishment, as if no such
Acts had passed? If this be their Case, they had need provide other security
for themselves.

Your next Principle is worthy of your selves, and a fit Cornerstone for your
foundation of Tyranny, That forbearance from outward actions will not avail
nor entitle to the benefit of the Pardon, if yet there be malice and revenge in
the heart, and such a leaning and adhering to the old interest, that nothing is
wanting for the discovery thereof, but a fitting opportunity; for (you say) as
such men cannot in justice and ingenuity claim the benefit of an Act of Favor
from that supreme Magistrate, to whom they know themselves to be Enemies: so
neither is that Magistrate bound in justice before God or Men to give it to
them, if he has reason to believe from the course of their conversations, that
they are such, and that their intentions toward the Government, under which
they live, are the same as when they were in open Arms against it, and is at
liberty to carry himself toward them, as if no such act had been; nay, he may
proceed against them with greater severity, etc. Truly if this be so, the large
bulk of our Laws and Records, which establish our liberty, and our property,
may be reduced into a very small Volume; and we are so much the worse for the
Reformation you have wrought, that we have not only fought away our Arms, but
all those Rights for which we took them up. And if after all our clamor
against Oaths ex officio, and men's being compelled to accuse themselves,
against the Star Chamber, and the High Commission, we are now to be undone for
the thoughts of our heart, and our intentions toward the Government, and that
you will take upon you to know those thoughts and intentions, and that not from
any thing we know or do our selves, but from the course of our conversation,
which may be from what others say or do, with whom we converse; it is more than
time for us either to seek security in some other Climate, where this Day of
Judgment is not yet come to pass, or so to purge our own, that we may be out
of the danger of those, who with impious presumption take upon them to do that
office, and make that inquisition into the hearts of men, which God Almighty
has reserved for himself, and who will then proceed with less rigor upon what
he knows, than these terrible Inquisitors do, upon what they unreasonably say
they have reason to believe. Let us revolve the vast Treasure we have lost, and
compare it with the Nothing we possess. The Law says, no man shall be
punished, if his offense be not proved by credible Witnesses; this Declaration
says, though we abstain from any unlawful action, we shall be punished for
the malice and revenge in our heart. Cooks Pleas of the Crown, fol. 9.
The Law says, that a Conspiracy to levy War, is no Treason, except there be a
levying of War in facto; your Declaration says, If you have reason to believe
that we have evil intentions against the Government, we are without any right
or title to any thing we enjoy, and are at your mercy to dispose of us as you
please; which is the lowest condition of Traitors. If this be Liberty, what
Nation in Europe lives in Servitude?

I have been longer than I meant to have been, and therefore I shall only
mention one more of your Principles; which if Machiavel's Prince, Hob's
Leviathan, and all other Institutions of Tyranny were lost, would be
sufficient to avoid all established Laws, and insensibly to bring the freest
People into the most insupportable bondage, and to resolve all Obligations of
Government into the good will and pleasure of the Governor. That if the
Supreme Magistrate were in these Cases tied up to the ordinary rules, and had
not a liberty to proceed upon illustrations of reason, against those who are
continually suspected, there would be wanting in such a State the means of
common safety. The illustration of Reason is this; That when they who are
peaceably minded in the Nation, are ready to say, These are the men of whom we
go in danger, it is both just and necessary that all those, of whom the people
have reason to be afraid, should pay for securing the State against that danger
which they are the Authors of. If you thought it operae praetium to have given
any satisfaction to the poor People of the Nation, for whose liberty you are so
zealous, and that it were not below you to make your commands appear
reasonable, to which you expect precise obedience, being able, as you say, to
give many pregnant instances, That former times have held this way of
proceeding just and reasonable, as well in this, as in other Nations, you would
have vouchsafed to have given one, especially since you say, such have been in
the memory of several persons now living. That which came nearest it, yet
strayed at a great distance from it, seems the resolution of the Judges in the
case of Ship money, which were with so great detestation condemned by the
Parliament, and your selves, before you were in a posture of governing, and for
which they paid so dearly: yet in that Case there was to be real necessity, an
imminent danger that the Supreme Authority might foresee, as the Sentinel
discovers the Enemy first, and so was bound to provide against: but that your
fears must be so complied with, that Armies must be raised to secure you, and
whosoever you are pleased to be afraid of, must be compelled to defray the
charge of those Armies, is a Doctrine never heard of before this Declaration;
and your fear is so useful to you, that no proportion of Courage would do your
business half so well.

Oportet neminem esse sapientiorem legibus, is a Maxim in the Law; and what is
that Arbitrary Power we have so long inveighed against, made so many men odious
with the reproach of, made, but the endeavor to set up an Arbitrary
Government, the Abridgement of all Treason, against which we first took up
Arms; and for the rooting out of which, we have shed and lost so much blood,
what is it but the assuming (in what extraordinary Cases soever) upon
discretion to require us to do that which the Law does not require us to do, to
forbid that which the Law does not forbid, and to punish us to a degree beyond
what the Law directs us to be punished; to swarve from that rule, is to take it
away; and being gone, we are no longer Subjects, but Slaves. In the Roman
State, during the reign of the Kings, who whilst that Government lasted, were
very absolute, the King himself could not do an Act against the letter of the
Law, in favor or disfavour of any person, be his merit or guilt what it would;
but in such extraordinary Cases, the Appeal was to the People, who were to
judge whether the rule was to be declined, or no. So Horatius, for the killing
his Sister, was condemned by the Duumviri, who had no other power than to
proceed upon the letter of the Law; nor was it in the power of Tullus
Hostilius, who was King, to alter it. But the Appeal was to the people, they
considered the provocation, the tears of his Father, who said, if he had
judged that his Daughter had suffered unjustly, Se patrio jure in filium
animadversurum fuisse; Live. lib. 1.
they considered the great merit of the person, absolveruntque admiratione
magis virtutis, quam jure causae: thus deviations from the known Law, whether
in mercy, or in rigor never extended farther than a particular person, never
comprehended a multitude.

Our Ancestors were so vigilant on our behalf, that they would not have us
accused without some witness, not condemned in matters of importance without
the full evidence of two or three witnesses; Nor is the same person capable by
the Law of being witness and Judge, if he saw the Malefactor commit the offense
of which he stands accused, he cannot give his evidence as witness, whilst he
is Judge; every witness, how divested soever of passion and affection, having
in the wise jealousy of the Law, too much of a party, to be the Judge; Whereas
your supreme Magistrate, need no other evidence, but his own suspicion, and if
he be afraid, we are undone, for it is plain enough, though out of your
abundant tenderness you impute all the fear to the people, reserving to your
selves only the benefit of your suspicion, to suspect whom you please; you will
not trust the people with the Prerogative of their own fear, that they may fear
as much and as little as they see cause for, your Supreme Magistrate has the
Monopoly of that Commodity; and it is very observable, that you do not say
these extraordinary payments for securing the State, shall be made by those of
whom the People are afraid, you will not give them leave to tell you how much
they are afraid, or of whom they are afraid, but by those of whom the people
have reason to be afraid, and they are not reasonable enough to know that
themselves, you will do it for them; and so you are the Law, the Witness, the
Judge and the Party, and therefore no doubt will proceed in that manner as you
think best for your selves.

Jus meum metu tuo non tollitur, say the Civilians, and the incomparable
Grotius, after he has inveighed against that unreasonable opinion in Policy,
That it is lawful in Princes to take arms against a growing power, which
being grown may be able to oppress their Neighbors, as disaovwed by all sober
Casuists, and looked upon as an extravagancie by all regular Judges of the Jus
Gentium, concludes excellently, That we live upon those disadvantages in this
world, Grot. de Jure Bell. and Pacis
Ut plena securitas nunquam nobis constet, adversus incertos metus, a Divina
Providentia and ab innoxia cautione non vi praesidium petendum est: It is very
natural to fear those most, whom we have most injured, and it would be very
unnatural that we should be thereby warranted to do new injuries to them:
Wisdom 17. 12.
And it is too great a privilege for the basest and most unworthie passion that
can be harbored in the mind of man (for fear is nothing else but a betraying
of the succors which reason offers, says Solomon;) instead of being a
torment to the servile spirit that is possessed by it (as most other passions
are) to torment and destroy those they are unreasonably afraid of. Besides all
other judgments are determined within some extent of time, whereas no period
can be set to your fears, nor consequently to our punishments; And I remember
Salust says of Catiline, that after he had caused his son to be killed, that
he might persuade a Lady to be the more willing to marry him; Animus impurus,
Diis hominibusque infestus* neque vigiliis neque quietibus sedari poterat, ita
conscientia mentem excitam vexabat. I know not how many of you are in that
condition, and if that part of the Commonwealth must be at the charge of Armies
to preserve you against all whom you will be afraid of, it must shortly raise
new Armies to suppress the old, and to free you from the fears you have of one
another. How strong your love is, few have had evidence to discern, but your
Jealousy is like that in the Canticles, Cant. 8. 6.
cruel as the grave, the coals thereof are coals of fire, which has a most
vehement flame: In a word your fears are grown so terrible, that we have no
other security, than by being as much afraid as your selves, and providing for
our selves accordingly.

You see now the reason that warranted that passion which I expressed to you,
when I first read your Declaration, and that the judgment in it is come home
to our own doors, and concerns the poor Royal party no more, than it does
our selves; and it may be, it is come the sooner home to our own doors, for the
little consideration we had of any Acts of power, how exerorbitant soever, that
we thought only related to them. You know the wise answer given to him that
asked what City he believed to be best governed, Plutar. vita Sol.
Solon said, That City, where such as receive no wrong, do as earnestly defend
others to whom wrong is offered, as if the wrong and injury had been offered to
themselves: And that General was worthily extolled, qui aliquid esse crederet
and in hostem nefas; Our too little circumspection and tenderness of that, has
brought the Case to be our own; If the Royal party will change their interest,
that is, keep their old Monarchical Principles, and apply them to the support
of your interest, they shall be received, entertained and preferred by you; you
have manifested it enough to them, by trusting none more than those who have
done so. They are only in danger, of whom you are afraid, in respect of their
conversation, of their intentions toward the present Government, and of their
interest not to submit to that Government, which you say is established, and
they believe or know to be but usurped. And we shall the better find who they
are, and make some discovery of the number of them, and consequently of the
danger that is threatened from them, if we take a short view of the Government,
by what degrees, and by what Authority it is imposed upon us and how far the
several interests of those, who have at least equally with your selves opposed
the common Enemy, are secured and provided for, and we shall thereby the more
easily judge, how far we are obliged in conscience or discretion to submit to
it, of whom you are most like to be afraid: and so, who are most probably in
the end, to be charged with the maintenance of those forces, which you will
find necessary to secure that Government, and your fears that it will not be
secure.

What is become of the Parliament; and the Parliament party, that first
undertook that war and pursued it, till they were without an eneny, is too
melancholic a question to expect an answer to? You cannot take it ill, that I
say this is not the Government we then undertook and engaged to preserve and
defend; and you will give me leave to observe, that there is not one officer in
all your Armies, that in the beginning of that war, was above the degree of a
Captain; so far are you from being the People, who bore the heat of the day,
or who deprived the enemy of of their arms: Nor is there one person amongst
you, who had then interest or reputation enough to engage ten men in the
quarrel; nor is one of those who had in any credit now with you, or trusted in
any part of your Government: So that you may reasonably conclude, that as they
cannot hold themselves obliged to submit to it, so much less engaged to
support it, and consequently amongst that number of which you have reason to be
afraid.

After you had by bringing your Army to London, and imprisoning the major part
of the Commons, and dissolving the House of Peers, extinguished Kingly
Government, erected your selves into a Commonwealth, and instead of one, set up
as many Kings, as you had left members of your Parliament, all who were
uncontrolable and above the reach of Justice, and exercised what kind of Power
and Tyranny they pleased upon their fellow subjects; The people were
universally engaged to maintain and defend that Government of the Parliament of
the Commonwealth of England; All Princes and foreign States taught to make
their addresses to it; War and Peace declared by it; The Keepers of the Great
Seal of England, the Judges and Ministers of Justice, appointed in the same
manner, and the whole Administration of Justice throughout the Kingdom was in
the name of the Keepers of the Liberty of England, The Army professed it self
entirely at the obedience of the Parliament, and absolutely to be disposed by
it, and well it might do so, there being so many Officers of the Army, Members
of Parliament, that they had reason to believe all Commands would be suitable
to their own desires, if they desired no more than what they hitherto
professed, the support of that Government, which not only every person who had
the least trust, share or benefit in it, had sworn to defend, but whosoever
sued for favor or Justice from it, were bound to subscribe to. In this manner
all things were ordered; Ireland reduced to perfect obedience, and our enemies
there to perfect slavery; Scotland (as your own Poet says) was preferred by
Conquest to serve us: So that we were not only without any visible Enemy, and
so sufficiently revenged of our friends, that they could be of use to none but
our selves. The Parliament now thought it high time, that they who were in
truth the Conquerors, the People at whose charge alone the war had been
carried on, should receive some benefit from their Conquests; That when they
had no enemy at all, they need not have so great an Army, and therefore they
betook themselves to councels of good husbandry, and to think of preferring
them, who had taken so much pains in their service, to ease and plenty; to
give those Estates to them, which they had taken from others, and by these
gratuities to disband some part of their Army; But that was a Jurisdiction, you
never intended they should exercise, you were well enough contented that they
should have the Sovereign power to raise money, for the payment of the Armies,
but when they presumed to speak of disbanding those Armies, you wisely
remembered how insecure you should be without those forces, which had raised you
to the height you were at, you remembered how many former orders you had
disobeyed* how you had triumphed over the long Robe, and the Privileges of
Parliament; and albeit Acts of Prdon and Oblivion had been passed for your
Indemnity, you concluded, if the Government should once fall into those
peaceable hands, they would find ways enough to avoid the observance of any
promises, they had been compelled to make against their wills; and hereupon for
the good of the people, you resolved to take the Government into your own
hands; and according to the advice given by the Servants of the King of Syria,
Take the Kings away, 1 Kings 20. 24.
every man out of his place, and put Captains in their rooms. You brought
armed men into the house of Parliament, forced the Members with many
opprobrious speeches to leave their places, locked up the doors, that there
might be no more resort thither, and appointed a select number of the Officers
of the Army to provide for all, that King or Parliament used to do; and here
was an end of your Commonwealth, which Government all were so solemnly engaged
to defend; nor is there any person, who adheres to the Principles of a
Commonwealth in any trust or esteem with you: Nay, it is very observable and
notorious, that of all that select number which helped you to be free from
Monarchy, by sitting in that Court, and who dare no more look a Monarch in the
face, than they dare justify what they have done at the day of Judgment, there
is not one man in credit with you, nor of command in any of your Armies by Sea
or Land; nay; whom you have not eminently affronted, disobliged and and
oppressed, except he has such a relation of blood, as may render him
unsuspected. And can you think these men friends to your present Government?
and consequently can they but think themselves involved in this Declaration,
and designed to maintain those additionall forces, which are, or must be raised
to defend you from those of whom you see reason that the people should be
afraid.

Your next Government was entirely by the Army, which as if it had not fought
to suppress all exorbitancy of power, but to possess it self of it, and was
now sufficiently qualified to do all, that others had or would have done
before, laid Taxes and impositions upon the Kingdom, repeated over all the ill
things which had been complained of before, in most intolerable and
insupportable degrees, and improved the confusion to that height, that there
was no shadow or formality of Justice left; and that dist^action in Gods
worship, that there were more Religions than Regiments, and all practiced with
equal license, and animosity against each other, when on the sudden the
General of the Army (if he can be called a General whose Commission was
determined, by the determination of that Body that granted it, the Parliament)
takes upon him to assemble another number of people, every man chosen by
himself, and that Council of Officers of the Army, who were constituted by
himself, and making their appearance before him, called them a Parliament,
called himself their servant, and besought them to repair those breaches and
ruins of the Commonwealth, which their wisdom could only do, most of them
being men of no parts, no experience, no quality, no interest in the Kingdom,
serving only to render the venerable name of Parliament ridiculous by their
frivolous and impertinent consultations, without doing any sober act in order
to the healing the wounds of the Commonwealth, as their Predecessors had made
it odious by taking upon them so unlimited a power to vex and grieve, and
devour their Brethren. And when these had brought themselves into a sufficient
reproach and disestimation of the people, and yet could not be enough united
amongst themselves, to serve the Generals turn, part of them went to him,
confessed themselves too weak to sustain the great burden he had laid upon
their shoulders; and desired him to take the power again, which he he had so
graciously conferred on them, and that he would take upon himself the ordering
and repairing the Commonwealth, which they had not wisdom to do. The other
part, that had a better opinion of their own abilities, and believed they might
find some proper remedies for the public grievances, were according to the
late method turned out of doors by the Soldiers, that they might no more
continue those unprofitable Consultations: And so by these few Bankrupts
repaying the small money he had lent them, the General takes Livery and Seisin
of the whole Treasure of the Kingdom, and thinks this a sufficient delegation
of the power, and interest of the Nation into his hands, of which he makes use
within few days after, and with a sudden and unexpected solemnity, the Lord
Major of London, the Judges and the Keepers of the great Seal, being summoned
to attend, without knowing any part of the business, upon the advice and by the
consent of half a score of his friends, who were like to look that he should
receive no hurt, He degrades himself from the Office of General, and unlimited
power thereof, as he says; and is contented under the style of Protector of
the three Kingdoms, of England, Scotland and Ireland, to be restrained within
the limits he had prepared for himself, laid aside his Excellency to be his
Highness, and contented himself with all the Crown Lands which were left
unsold, and a limited power (as he called it,) extending farther than ever King
pretended to; and this was the rise and progress of your present Government,
to which you expect such an obedience, as must produce a real change of all
our Principles and interest; and if we are but thought to have evil intentions
toward this Government, we must be at the charge of the Armies raised to
secure it.

That which disposed the minds of the people to abstain from a present
Protestation against this Government, besides the Agony of the late confusions,
and the astonishment upon the new wonderful alteration, was, that it was but
temporary, and that limited to a very short time; A free Parliament was to be
called within so many months, which was entirely to consider and settle the
Government of the Kingdom, to remove all those obstructions which hinder the
Peace and happiness of the Nation, and to restore it to that tranquillity and
quiet it had been so long deprived of: And the Protector was sworn to a due
observation of all those Articles, which he had himself prescribed for his own
rules and bounds, and therefore the more hope that he would be contented to be
limited by them. It cannot be denied that the Kingdom chose many worthy persons
of fortune, interest and experience, as their Deputies to provide for the
public security, who entered upon a free disquisition of the state the Kingdom
was in, according to the very Method prescribed by the Instrument of
Government; and to enquire by what means and title; so vaste and transcendent a
power was gotten into the hands of one man; so contrary to what had been before
determined; many men professing, that if after so much blood spilt and
calamities undergone by the people, to free them from Monarchique Government,
it should be now found most agreeable to the Nature and temper of the Nation,
to return to the same form of subjection, there could be little doubt, it
would be much better to restore it to the Royal Person, to whom by the line of
succession the unquestionable Right was derived, and whose being possessed of
it would in a moment restore the whole Nation to a full and entire Peace, from
whose unblemished youth and gracious disposition, as much of happiness might be
expected, as had been enjoyed in any former Kings Reign, than by continuing it
in the hands of an Usurper, who had violated so many Oaths and Protestations
already, and had ascended to this pitch only by the most barefaced breach of
several trusts, that ever Christian or Gentleman was guilty of, to expose the
Kingdom to a war, that could have no end, but in the ruin and desolation of
it. These grave, necessary and important debates, were no sooner entered into,
than in contempt of all Privileges of Parliament, which will not allow matters
in debate to be taken notice of, the Protector, like a King; Nam impune
quaelibet facere, id est, Regem esse, summons them into his presence, with the
highest and sharpest language, reproaches them for disputing his Authority, by
whom they were called together; requires them to renounce and disclaim that
liberty, before they proceeded to further consultation, and to that purpose
delivered an Instrument without subscribing to which, the Band of Soldiers
which guarded the door of the Parliament house, would not suffer any man to
enter, whereupon a Major part of the Parliament departed to their houses, and
they only went in, who submitted to the conditions, which many afterward did,
who in detestation of the violence, at that time had forborne to subscribe.
Thus he, who without the consent or privity of a dozen persons, had assumed to
himself the title and style of Protector of three Kingdoms, and therefore
found a general submission, because he had bound himself within a short time
to call a Parliament, that might settle the Government, when it was now met and
possessed of the power it was to have, because they came together upon his
call, would not suffer them to question any thing he had done, or what he
should do hereafter, their submission (as he said) to his Authority of
summoning them, being a tacit acknowledgement of his power, which he would not
endure to be argued against, without calling to mind (besides the practice of
these last ill years) that by the express letter of the Law, Lo. Cook Jurisd.
of Co. fol. 42.
any restraint from altering or revoking an Ordinance or Act of Parliament it
self, is void, being against the jurisdiction and power of Parliament.

When he had thus reformed his Parliament, he gave them leave to sit together,
to consult how they might contribute to the support of that power they were not
able to impair, and to lay new burdens on the People, the envy whereof they
should rather bear than himself. But as the Pope (Paul the 4th.) complained in
the Consistory of those who reported he could make but four Cardinals, Hist.
Conc.
in regard of that which he had sworn in the Conclave, and said, Tr. fol. 396.
That this was to bind the Popes Authority, which is absolute; That it is an
Article of Faith, that the Pope cannot be bound, and much less can bind
himself; and that to say otherwise, was a manifest Heresy. So he took it very
ill, that they should believe upon any Articles in the Instrument of
Government, to which he had so solemnly sworn before he assumed the Title, that
they might lessen his Power, or the Army, by which it is supported; and
therefore when he saw they betook themselves to those Counsels, which might
lessen the insupportable burden the People undergo for the maintenance of as
numerous Forces, and greater indeed, than were ever on foot when the Common
Enemy had Towns and Armies to oppose, and that they presumed to speak of
disbanding part of them, he sent for them, and after he had, stylo Imperatorio,
reprehended their presumption, and checked them in sharper language than ever
King gave himself leave to use to his Subjects in Parliament, contrary to his
Oath, and before the time was expired which was assigned for their sitting, he
dissolved them, and takes upon himself Authority, with the consent of such,
whom he pleases to make of his Council, to make and repeal Laws, to lay Taxes
and Impositions upon the People, and, which is the highest expression that can
be made of his Tyranny, to publish this Declaration; whereas it is notorious
in the Law, That to commit the power of Parliament to a few, is against the
dignity of Parliament* and no such Commission can be granted, even by the
Parliament it self.

You know, how strange soever it be, that all this is true; and you may then
easily compute, of what rank or kind of men they must be, who are delighted,
or in their hearts not opposite, to your present Government: how very few there
are in your Council or Army, who were for King and Parliament, and how those
Principles have been asserted by you, is known to all men; what affection they
have for you, who with so much hazard and infamy served you in the
extinguishing the Monarchy, and what indignities they receive at your hands, is
likewise within your own view. What is become of those two swelling names,
which for so long time filled our mouths, and under the shelter of one of which
all men took Sanctuary, the Presbyterians and Independents? Is there one man of
either party, who without renouncing the Principles of his party, is in credit
or trust with you? and do they not both every day expect from you the
exemplification of that memorable Judgment of Philip of Macedon, who upon the
hearing a difference that was fallen out between two men of very seditious and
turbulent natures, determined, That the one of them should presently fly out of
Macedon, Vit. Phil.
and the other should run after him as fast as he could. You see then how very
few there can be in the three Kingdoms (except those who possess great Offices
and Estates from you, (and even of those, many think themselves disobliged, by
seeing others of less merit than they think themselves, more obliged) who are
without malice and revenge in their heart, and such a leaning and adhering to
their several old interests, that nothing is wanting for the discovery thereof,
but a fitting opportunity; and you have declared that propension and
disposition in them, to be Crime enough to forfeit all that they have; and you
cannot wonder, if upon so fair warning, they prepare as well as they can, and
at least good resolutions, for their own security. Alas, Sir, we know how
little confidence you have in any of your old Friends, who you believe will
never heartily submit to a Government they never intended to erect, and who
have not sacrificed their wealth, their blood, and their peace, to suppress a
Royal Family, accustomed by a succession of so many hundred years to command,
and to be obeyed; and to invest another, inferior to most of our selves, in
the same interest and power, and so (to use your own expression) to entail the
quarrel, and prevent the means to reconcile Posterity. Page 38.
You say, you will not in express terms lay to the charge of the Royal Party,
the swarming of those Jesuits, which are now croaking amongst us, turning
themselves into all forms and shapes, to deceive and seduce men from the Truth.
I wish we had not all too much reason to charge you in express terms with what
you will not, and no doubt cannot charge them. What liberty the Priests and
Jesuits take, how far they prevail upon the People, what countenance they
receive from this Government, is apparent enough, by not proceeding against
them in Justice, as if no Laws were in force for their punishment. Your private
Negotiations with the Pope, and your promises, that as soon as you can
establish your own Greatness, you will protect the Catholics; and the
insinuations that you will countenance them much further, are sufficiently
known and understood? And of their dependence upon, and devotion to you, there
needs no evidence beyond the Book lately written by Mr. White, a Romish Priest,
and dedicated to your Favorite, Sir Kenelm Digby, entitled, The Grounds of
Obedience and Government; in which he justifies all the Grounds and Maxims in
your Declarations, and determines positively, That you ought to be so far from
performing any promise, or observing any Oath you have taken, if you know that
it is for the good of the People, that you break it, albeit they foreseeing all
that you now see, did therefore bind you by Oath not to do it, Page 89.
That you offend against both your Oath and Fidelity to the People, if you
maintain those limitations you are sworn to: and sure what you do, must be
supported by such Casuists. Lastly, we know very well, how far you are from
confiding in your own Army, how jealous you are of many of the Officers, and
more of the Common Soldiers, and therefore that you raise those several little
Armies in the several Counties, with which you hope to suppress or control the
standing Army upon any occasion, when the sense of their own and their
Countries miserable condition shall render it less devoted to you. And we
likewise know, how in distrust of the whole English Nation, you are treating to
bring over a Body of Swisse to serve you, as the Janissaries do the Turk, and in
order to control your own Army, as well as to reduce the People to an implicit
obedience to your Government. That most of the Money which was collected
amongst us for the poor Protestants of the Valley of Lucern, is returned and
applied to the carrying on those Levies; and that many are already landed in
England, and are now about London, upon pretense that they are to be sent to
plant in Ireland, whereas they are kept for the completing those Regiments
which are every day expected to arrive: and then you have completed your work,
and brought the only lasting calamity upon the Kingdom, which you have
hitherto forborne to do, and with which odious reproach you charged the Counsels
of the former times, only for intending to introduce foreign Forces.

I cannot end this Discourse, without taking notice of your so frequent mention
throughout this Declaration, and indeed upon all occasions in your ordinary
conversation, of the continued assistance and presence of God in whatsoever you
have gone about, of his gracious dispensations, and his visible hand manifested
in your successes, and of his more than usual care and kindness toward you;
whereas if you would soberly revolve what is passed, and dispassionately
consider and weigh your present condition, it may be you would find your Case
so rare and wonderful, that there have seldom been a People in the World who
have had more reason to believe themselves to lie under the signal and terrible
displeasure of God Almighty, and against whom his vengeance is more manifestly
threatened, than you at present have. You have had all the advantages, and all
the successes, which you could ever propose and hope for, and some greater than
you could hope for, and your perplexities and insecurity remains greater than
before; you have not an Enemy in the three Kingdoms, who stands in opposition
of your power, or who indeed is Owner of a Sword to resist you, and yet you
avow and discover such a proportion of fear, that new Armies must be raised for
your defense; you have gotten all the Wealth of the three Kingdoms into your
hands, and enjoy none, your wants and necessities being so great; when you had
little credit, and less interest to do good or harm, you had many Friends, and
few who hated you; and now it is in your power to make great whom you please,
and to destroy all whom you are angry with, your Friends leave and forsake you;
and you are grown so universally odious, that you may say to those who adhere
to you, Salust.
as Catiline did to his Army, Neque locus, neque amicus quisquam teget, quem
arma non texerint. All your safety is in your Army, and yet you fear that
little less than your Enemies. How many of those who bore parts with you in
your darkest Designs, have laid violent hands upon themselves, out of the
conscience of their own wickedness? And is not that Curse in Leviticus fallen
upon the rest? And upon them that are left alive of you, Lev. 26. 36.
I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies, and the
sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee, as fleeing from a
sword, and they shall fall, when none pursues. Can there be a greater slavery,
than to be afraid of those whom you have subdued? And has not God delivered
you, as he did those of Judah and Jerusalem, 2 Chronicles. 29. 8.
to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as you see with your eyes? So
that in truth, setting aside the peace and tranquillity of mind, which must
prepare the joys of the next World for us, and considering merely the delight
and pleasure in this, into which some degree of reputation, the affection of
some Friends, and the fidelity of those we trust, are necessary Ingredients; I
had rather be the most undone man that this Declaration has preyed upon, than
my Lord Protector, or any one of his Council in whose names it is published.

To conclude. As it is manifestly destructive to all the liberty and property
of the People, and to the Laws of the Kingdom, by observation whereof alone
those liberties, and that property can be preserved: so to common understanding
it must be the most fatal Instrument against your own interest and security,
and make all men see how inconsistent theirs is with the Government you have
erected. You have pulled up Parliaments by the roots, which are the only
natural security the Nation can have against Oppression and Tyranny, and which
we thought we had exactly provided for by the Triennial Bill, and which will at
present authorize the People to assemble and make their Elections. You have
cancelled all Obligations of Trust, and taken away all possible confidence from
all men that they can ever enjoy any thing that they can call their own during
this Government; and having so little pleasure left them in life, they will
prefer the losing it in some Noble Attempt to free their Country and
themselves from the bondage and servitude they live under, to the dying ignobly
in some loathsome Prison, when you please to be afraid of them. Do not value
your selves upon the terror you infuse into the People, by your frequent
Sacrifices of Blood, and exposing their Friends to them on Scaffolds, and on
Gallows. Remember that it is recorded of Ann de Burg, who was burnt in France
in the year 1559. upon matter of Religion, That the death and constancy of a
man so conspicuous, did make many curious to know, what Religion that was, for
which he had so courageously endured punishment, and made the numbers increase
exceedingly. Trust me, you have gotten nothing by those Spectacles, and men
return from them more confirmed in their detestation of you, than terrified
from any of their purposes toward you. And when the despair you have put them
into shall make them consider, that as the misery, calamity, servitude and
infamy under which the three Kingdoms suffer, proceed entirely from you, so,
that they will be determined with you. That the general hatred and detestation
of you is such, that it is very probable that those Noble Patriots, whose
spirits shall be raised to destroy you, shall not only reap unutterable Honor
from it, but find safety in it, either from the Confusion that must instantly
attend, or from the abhorring your Memories in those that shall survive you. If
they shall perish in or upon their Attempt, what a Glorious Fame will they
leave behind them? what a sweet Odor will their Memories have with the present
and succeeding Ages? Statues will be erected to them, and their Names recorded
in those Roles, which have preserved the Bruti, the Horatii, the Fabii, and all
those who have dyed out of debt to their Country, by having paid the utmost
that they owed to it; their Merits will be remembered, as those of the Primitive
Martyrs, and their Children and Kindred will be always looked upon as the
Descendants from the Liberators of their Country, and esteemed accordingly;
their Fate will be like his in the Son of Syrach, Ecclesiastic. 39. 11.
If he dye, he shall leave a greater name than a thousand; and if he live, he
shall increase it. And all the Peace, Tranquillity, Splendour and Glory, which
the Kingdoms shall hereafter enjoy, which will be the greatest that any Nation
in Europe has been possessed of, in the awe and dread their Enemies will have
of them, in the reverence of their Friends, and the full veneration of all the
World, will still be imputed and attributed to those Heroic Spirits, the
Authors of this first deliverance. And besides the preventing that Deluge of
Blood, with which the Land will be otherwise overwhelmed, by this means the
Nation will be restored to the Honor it has lost, by freeing it self, without
any foreign help, from that miserable Condition, into which we are fallen by
our own mere Folly and Madness.

And they that come after him shall be astonished at his day, as they that went
before were affrighted, Job 18. 20.
