The Triades or Trinites of Rome / translated in to English.

Them that sin rebuke openly / that other may fear and dread..1. Timo. v.
The preface
GEntell reder / ye shall have here gadred togeder those things / the which be
either set by / used / or hated at Rome. That place trewly may be called Rome
/ where such enormities be much used. For so / after the mind of Nicolas de
Lira and other Saint Peter in the end of his first Epistle / i. Pet. v.
called Rome by the name of Babylon / because it was in Idolatry / lechery /
and pride. etc. at al points like to it. And as it may be now called (for the
same things / ye / and other much worse / if worse may be) Sodoma or Gomurra
/ were it not that they diffren in this one only point / which is
aboundau^ce of bread and wine. For as in Gomurra and Sodom was great plenty
of fode for every man / so likewise in Rome is the contrary thereof / penury and
scarsenesse of vitell / ye of al goodness / howbeit in that thing / I think
they agreen each with other / so yt Rome may well be called Gomorra. Things
gathered togider / I say / to thentent that vice ones known / it may the
better be eschewed / and not of malice / as many (who now be rubbed on the
gall) sayen. For if it come of malice open lie to reprove vice in them / whom
he that has but half an eye / may se daily without all shame / and eke the
dread and fear of god still to continue and delight in their sin and
abominations. Than surely / if it were not to sin against the holy ghost to
speak such a blasphemy / I would say that all the prophets / that all
Christ's disciples / ye / that Christ him self: Alas that I am compelled now
to open my lyppes to pronounce this word / Esa. xiii.
malicious / Hier. l. li
who is all good and full of the contrary to malice that is charity / for my
excuse. Dan. iiii
Did / I pray you / Esaias / i. Cor^. iiii v. vi.
Hieremias / and Daniel / repreue ye babilonie^s / Actuu^. v.
and also their king Nabugodonosor of malice? Math. xxiii.
Rebuked sait Paul the Corinthiens of their light judgment and Luc. x.
of fornication of malice? Mat. xi.
Was saint Peter induced to blame Ananias and his wife Saphira / of craft and
avarice by malice? Ye / to be short / did not Christ lay hipocrisy to the
scribes and pharisees charge / and that openly? Did he not vpbrayde the cite of
Corozaim / and other? but I hope ye will not say / inflamed with malice. I
pass over the malice / that saint Jerome / saint Crisostome / and Gyldas
monacus / vsen in reprofe of sin / writing to bishops / to monks / and to
all other kind of people (whereof their works be full) lest I should seem to
fear / yt this already written were not of strength enough to persuade you /
that it is not of malice. But hoow sir? So^e man will say / no man douteth of
the goodness of these men But think ye / that the writers now a days be of
that sort? Whether they be of that sort or no / I will nothing dispute / but me
thinks because it is an indifferent thing / and may be lightly done / ye
are blame worthy them so to judge For Christ says: Mat. vii
Nolite iudicare, et non iudicabimini. Which doctors expou^de to be mente of
indifferent things. Again / either these things be fautes or not fautes: that
they be fautes / ye will not again say I trow. That there be no such fautes
there used: I report me to your own conscience / if this prove it not / mark
than commenly the living of these Rome ro^ners / who although / that a very
few of them will deny it to be so at Ro^e by their mouth / Shall I warau^t you
/ confess it openly in their living / Tha^ me seems that it were better to go
about amendeme^t / than in dispraysynge and leying malice to the auctors charge
/ seem rather to hold and defend abusion / than here of correction / for we
should rather consider what is written tha^ the writer. And to conclude / if no
man should rebuke sin other than such / who^ the Romans call Missi. Missus
Seute
The son should sooner lack her light and lease her heat / than they the
desire and pleasure to continue their abomination. And more over Pasquyll the
plain says / if he should not speak against prelates vices in Rome openly /
but to them selfs preuyly in their cha^bres / that the moon would sooner turn
him from an hard stone in to melow wax / than he should be suffered to come in
to one of their Palacyes: and because I think that Pasquyl says troth I have
turned this book out of latin in to english as follows / for reformacion of
sin.

Finis.
The Triades / and commodities of Rome.
Three things there be that maynteyne the dignite of the cite of Rome. The
first / the auctorite of the bishop of Rome. the.ii. The relyques of saints
which they show for money. The iii. sellyng of pardons.

It is great ieoperdy to go to Rome / and that for three things / the which
Romero^ners commonly bring from thence. A corrupt co^scie^ces / a proud
stomach / and a beggars purce.

Rome is to be sho^ned because it is of these three things / ye destruction and
breche / as of a good conscience: of good zele to Christ's relygion / and of a
man's oath and fydelyte.

These things be mocked at Rome / the example of good men / Saint Peter's
facion both in living / and also his going about from place to place to preche
the word of god / and the judgment at domes day.

These three every man may se at Rome / antycke or old byldi^g / poyso^nyng on
the other and ruin in monasteries and churches.

Three things be banysshed Rome / Symplicyte / chastyte and honestye.

Three things daily be sold at Rome / Christ's passion / Benefyces / and women.

The Romans hate to here of these three things / as of a general counsel / a
reformation of the clergy / and that ley men should have the scripture in their
mother tongue / or to be learned.

They be sore gerued with three things at Rome / yt Christen Princes should be
at concord / that the people should be brought out of their blyndenesse / and
that their iuglyng should be espied.

Three things be chefely in price or value at Rome. The first / fair women.
The second goodly and fat horses. The. iii. the popes bulls.

These three be set naught by at Rome / good maidens / emty purses / nor a good
and well learned man / promoted or to be in power and auctorite.

Comenly of every man / these three things be used at Rome The pleasure of the
body / gorgyous aparel / pride and hautenesse of mind.

They that be not ydell nor well occupied at Rome / do these three things /
Iette up and down / hunte harlottes / and haunte tauernes.

These three things be the delycate dysshes of poor me^ at Rome / Rotes /
onyons / and garlycke.

And with these three things be fatted the rich men at Rome. The labor and
sweet of ye pore men / usury / and the pyllyng and pollyng of christen people.

At Rome dwellen these three as Cytezens / Simon Magus / Judas / And the people
of Gomor and Sodom.

He has need of three things that has bysynes in the law at Rome / of money
enough / of hired friends / and of lies.

There be but three things that rule al at Rome / As great gifts and rewards /
carnal favor / power and will.

Three things at Ro^e do promote every man. Brybes / flatery / and vnshamfaste
boldness.

Three causes there be why so many desired to go to Rome, The first / because
they may be made prestes there for money / be they never so folysshe or
unlearned. The second is great luker in sellyng there pardons and good deeds when
they come home / and the third lyberty to live as they list the^ selfs /
Capilanus honoris is the pops chapelayne which is thereby exempt from the
bysshoppes jurisdiction.
be it never so noughti / as done these Capilani honoris.

These three things were the cause that the bishop of Rome did bring a great
part of Christendom in to his subjection. The wanton living of princes / the
sophistry of the freres / which caused good lernyng to cease / and supersticion
taught of blind priests to the unlearned people.

These three things will cause the tyranny of Rome to cease The study of holy
scripture / the new Testament well translated in the mother tongue / a decay of
flaters / for whom it is impossible to continue / ye pope decaying.

Three things be the founders of Rome / unjust war / the craft that has
been used to get money for the byldyng of saint Peter's Church / and in time
past / Ipocrisy / or feigned holiness.

Three nets wherewith they fysshe at Rome / Pardons / the Iubyle / and the
faculte and power granted to legates and cardinals in every country.

Three things be ever in hand at Rome / but never fynysshed. The bliss and
immortalyte of the soul / ye making up of Saint Peter's church / and to go in
war against the Turks.

These three things ye shall scante compel a Romayn to do / to keep his
promise and faith / to wait on any man with out promise or hope of promotyon
/ and the thryde to give the way to any man.

Rome has great plenty of these three things / hores / prestes / and scrybes.

A short mass / old gold / and a delycate life. Of any of these three
things are most set by at Rome.

The Romans claim three things only to them selves

The great bishop / the co^nynge in poysonynge / and a crafty way to get
great sommes of money.

These three thiges be not so common in no cite of the world / as in Rome. Men
of all contreys / the universal study of auaryce / and men that can tell money
in all la^guages.

The romais in especial hate three things. That the election of bisshoppes
should be in temporal princes hands. The statutes of mortemaine / and premunite
/ and that prestes should be put to answer before a lay Judge.

Rydyng on moylles / Currours or posts / and blessings / be three common
thiges at Rome.

Ye shall see at Rome euerywhere these three: Holy places Strumpets / and goodly
old buylding.

These three be banisshed Rome. Primatiua ecclesia. Truth / and preching of
bisshoppes.

The three instruments of auaryce at Rome / wax / parchement / and led.

Three things be despised at Rome / Poverty / the fear of god / and
rightwisenesse.

He that will learn three proper things / Let him go to rome / To make
delycate bankets / how to disseyue / and the abuse of the flesh.

Three things be well clothed and trymmed at Rome / Prestes / Moyllis /
co^cubines / and harlottes.

Three things they do not be leave at Rome. Animarum immortalitatem, co^ionem
sanctorum, et inferiorum penas.

They brag at Rome much of three things / and yet they have them not. Love
to god and to their neighbor / faith / and innocence.

Three things be at Rome / howbeit they are but sildome seen. Old gold / the
pope / And beutyfull wives.

Three things be very dear at Rome: Offices / Equity or Right / and Frendshyppe.

Three things ye may kiss at Rome / if ye intend to offer. The auters /
Chekes / for so they kiss there / and with labor and rewards / the popes
fette.

Three things be commenly seen in the church of Rome / namely in abbeys and
colleges. Tables / wherein be written miracles / a box at every imamages foot
to drown in money / and very little wax / ye / scante a light before the
sacrament.

Three things do reygne at Rome. The pope / poison / and cursyng.

Rome is vexed with three euylles / with hot sykenesses as the pestylence agew.
etc. with pouertye / and fraud or disceyte.

Three discommodites of Rome / darth of vitayle / falshod / and the intemperate
air.

And these three things were not / Rome should decay / bulls / advocates / and
procuratours.

Three things never come often ynowe to Rome / Bysshoppes paul's / Mensis
papales, et anuates.

Lenuoye
Now let us pray
All that we may
Of god / grace to obtain
Our lives to amend
And heuyn at our end
Which is bliss certain
For to be angry
It is but a folly
I tell you by saint Paull
For all men thinks
That an horse wyncheth
When he is rubbed on ye gall
It is not spekyng
No / nor yet thretnyng
That will make me to seace
But good lyueng
And true teaching
Will make me hold my peace
Sirs / wherefore
If ye will no more
Of this gladly to here
ye must begin
A new song to sing
In Christ's quere
Which if ye do
Or help thereto
I tell you verily
I will not write
Nor yet endyte
Against you trewly
But contrary
If Christ and you varry
By him I swear
I will not spare
To paynt your flours
Even in your own colors.
