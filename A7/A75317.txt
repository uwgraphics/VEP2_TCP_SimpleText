THE ANATOMY OF WESTMINSTER IVNCTO. OR, A Summary of their Designs aginst the
KING, CITY, and KINGDOM.
Written by Mercurius Elencticus.
IN bodies Politic, the Repersentative, as it is made up and chosen by the
body Collective, so should it ever act for the good of the same: but it is more
common then commendable for men betrusted with other men's good to behave
themselves to their trustees hurt.

There be four Cases wherein a body Collective is not bound to a body
Representative, but ought in conscience to dissent from it, and protest against
it.

First, when a body Representative acts in a direct, evident and obvious manner
against the express will and Word of GOD.

Secondly, when in like plain and direct manner, it acts against the apparent
welfare, peace and good of the Kingdom.

Thirdly, when it acts after the same manner against its own proper end and
being.

Fourthly, when it acts beyond the bounds, limits and extents appointed it.

The terms (a little changed) were once the Parliaments. And all which
granted (as cannot be denied) the serious examination of the proceedings of a
Prevailing party in the two Houses, yields matter and reason sufficient for our
utter dislike of and protestation against them. And that will appear, if we
consider, first, Their ungodly proceedings in matters Religious and Divine;
Their dispoyling of Churches, their shutting the mouths of Oxthodox Ministers
that would not Preach Diurnall Doctrine, their taking away our Common Prayer
Book; their not only tolerating but encouraging and emboldening of all manner
of Schismatics and Heretics, sedicious incendiaries, Sectaries, and seducers
of the People; Socinians, Arrians, Anabaptists, Antinomians, Erastians,
Familists, Shakers, Seekers, Brownists, and Independents, contrary to the
known Statute Laws of this Kingdom; yea, Electing of them (before others)
into the most considerable places of profit and trust in Martial and Civil
affairs; and under a pretense of a Christian respect unto tender Consciences,
designing a toleration for all these, Contrary to the express rule of Sacred
Scripture, commanding earnest contention with them; and contrary to their Faith
given our Brethren of Scotland, as you may see by the Covenant and Scottish
Declaration.

Secondly, they tell us that the solemn League and Covenant does not oblidge
unto a suppression of those who out of a pretense of weak and tender
Consciences (but indeed treasonable Designs against the King and Kingdom)
refuse to subscribe unto Presbyterian government; and say that it is a most
putide and irrational thing, once to conceive that any such thing was ever
intended by the Parliament in the imposing hereof (witness their Reply to our
City Remonstrance of the 26. of May 1646. in which also they urge four reasons
to prove the same, and are not ashamed to style these limbs of the Devil,
these first borne of Satan; a party of as cordial friends as ever they had
since the War began. Thus do they make Religion but a Veil to shroud
themselves under, while they get a shoot at a Crown, at Prince and People; a
thing which from the very beginning of their Sessions they only aimed at, and
have since only pursued.

For whereas they were called by tha King ad Concilium only, and to acquaint
him with the oenour of our Petitions delivered them, instead of discharging
their Duty, they straightway begin to destroy a third Estate in Parliament,
root out the heads of the Clergy. Next, to usurp the Militia from the King,
and settle it in themselves; Contrary to the mind of the Convention when it
was full and free: and contrary to the pattern of heaven and earth: The power
of a Kingdom being disposed unto one Viceroy, not to a multitude; save as
Substitutes in several ranks under that one, as that one is under him whose
right by Creation it is.

And for carrying on the said Designs, they raise Tumults in December and
January 1641. and by the seditious rabble of our City, drive away the
dissenting Members, and as it were new mould the two Houses: and in March after
they seize and dispose of the Navy and Cynque Ports, under a pretense of
providing against danger, winding themselves into the strength of the Kingdom
for a Design; which appears by consequents, pretenses being not to be believed
where following actions run Cross and Counter.

For presently they show more confidence then fear (though long before, as
also now again, we have nothing else.) More audaciousnesse against the King,
then solicitude for the Kingdom; and daily endeavor to subvert and destroy,
not preserve and maintain the fundamental constitution and government of the
Realm and Parliament.

Neither is it long after till they discover their intentions against his
sacred Majesty, as since August last they have done against the City and
Kingdom. Martin says openly in the House, and the House reproves him not for
it; that the Kings Office is forfeitable, and that the welfare of this Kingdom
did not depend upon his Majesty, nor any branch of the Royal race: and
Lud^^^, that he was not worthy to be King of England.

And surely this was the mind of the Houses, else these cursed villains had
not gone unpunisht then, nor Hamond nee; sinor themselves May 26. impudently
declared that they should not want duty or modesty if they followed the
highest Presidents of those two rebellious Parliaments that deposed and
murdered Edward and Richard both the second.

Nor had they denied the Kings negative Vote in Parliament; nor had they, but
to deprive the King and Crown of all power of Legislation and government,
presented and so earnestly urged those Bills for nominating the Privy
Counselors and chief Officers of State; and for Reformation of
Church Government and Liturgy, as they (forsooth) liked; and to order the
Militia as they pleased; and to approve of Commanders for Forts and Castles;
and to admit such Peers as should be made hereafter, to sit and Vote in
Parliament.

A Bill for the Kings leaving to trial and punishment of Law, such ill
Councillors or Officers as then were or after might be, would have bin
sufficient to have secured this Kingdom from any harm or danger by any ill
Counsel whatsoever: This the King might and would easily have granted; and
this might have contented them, if care of the Kingdoms welfare had been their
ayms. But ambition and avarice makes them seek for the rule and power out of
the Kings hands (which is not his to part withal, power only of creating
Substitutes under him being given him by the original owner thereof) it is a
fine thing to sit at Westminster, and Vote, and make Ordinances at will and
pleasure, and send for the Kingdoms Money and have it.

And for making good of what they had taken from, and declared against, and for
the carrying on of what they had proposed to his Majesty, viz. to detain the
Forts, the Militia and Navy from him (which acts be high treason by the
Statutes of Hen. 8. and Edw. 6. themselves know it well) and to take from him
and from the Crown of England the power of Law-making and governing, and to
depose and destroy him and his royal race together with Monarchy, they sent
the late Earl of Essex (whom they persuaded all was Law they did, as himself
averred, and whom they have since well requited with untimely end) through the
streets of our City, to raise an army of deluded fools, pretending to redeem a
captived King from evil Counselors; but indeed to captivate him; which since
the war was ended, the sillyest may plainly see; and that their jealousies and
fears, and their pretenses of Reformation and liberty were mere stratagems and
delusions to bring about their traitrous designs against the King and Crown,
against the Church and against us the freeborn people of England.

Else why shut they up the King in prison? Why Voted they no more addresses to
him? Why put they forth that traitorous Declaration against him? These things
have not been done by the people of this Kingdom to any Prince, whom they have
not soon after deposed and murdered. Else why turned they their Army in August
last against our City? and why made they that saucie Ordnance soon after, to
distraine by Soldiers for what Taxations they should at any time charge upon
the Country? and why do they not disband this heretical rascal Army, but
employ it every where to murder and plunder those that Petition the settlement
of Peace? Why drove they away the eleven Members? Why took they down our
ch^ines? and why lie they yet lurking about our City? Why did they displace and
imprison Sir John Geere and the other Aldermen? Why invaided they our Freemens
privileges in making new Officers, and such as we cannot confide in; Men that
seek not to preserve, but enthrall our Liberties; that study not to advance
the Public, but their own private interests, that intend their own rather
then the Cities profit and security? Why restore they not the Mili^ia of the
City into those hands it was in before August last? how shall we think they
cease their Design against us, when none of all these is accomplished? Look
to it Brethren, there is mischief still intended, though those at Westminster
will needs have us believe otherwise.

When the discovery of this last design by Everard, came unto our knowledge,
the Major and Common-counsell (confederates with them in the business, for the
promoting of a new War with our Presbyterian Brethren) petition this perfidious
prevailing party in the Houses; and in their Petition, to color the business,
do closely take in the Parliament into the then present danger with the City,
as if the Army acted or consulted any thing, which they had not first rules for
from Westminster; and likewise intimate the Cities resolutions to adhere to
this wicked Jancto, that every day styles it self, The varliament of England,
according to the solemn League and Co-Penant; and this must have thanks, and be
published in print, to persuade the people, whether they will or no, that they
be yet the representitative Body of the Kingdom, and that such Officers as they
have made in the City since Aug. last, without consent of the freemen, be the
representitative body of the City, and that all is well 'twixt the City and
this Iuncto, as if there had bin no starting from first pretended principles;
and now that ( viz. the Covenant) which the other day was declared to be but for
discovery of the Parliament enemies, must oblige to an engagement in a second
War (contrary to the express tenor of it) to set up Independency: thus do they
one while court Religion a Mistress, another while use her as a slave.

But good Master Wisdoms of Westminister, you shall find a wronged party of
Presbyterians, both in City and Country (for whom you still lie in wait, though
you would fain seem to relinquish your designs) will call for satisfaction from
you and your juggling implements of the City and Kingdom: It is not your now so
often proclaiming your selves The Parliament of England, nor the Major and
Common-Counsels petitioning you, nor your sly conjunctions and courting of one
another with thanks and Declarations of mutual assistance, nor Preachments by
Proxies in Tippling houses and Ordnaries, That there nor is, nor can be any
difference 'twixt our City and you, nor your re-calumniating the Cavaliers, and
fathering of plots upon them, which your selves invent at Derby-house, and
discover by the Major, nor your new Brittannicus of Grays-Inne, whom you hire
for five pound per week, to write anew those forgeries wherewith you formerly
abused the King and his faithfuls, and deluded us, shall make us forget your
August-tricks, nor your four Bills which you sent so privately to his Majesty at
Carisbrook-castle, that but for our Brethren of Scotland we had not yet heard
of them, nor your close restraint of the King, when he refused to sacrifice us
and our posterity to your insatiate ravenousnesse, by signing them; nor your
late traitorous Declaration against him, nor your designs of taking off his
head, if the Kingdom would have thanked you for that your Declaration, and
liked of such horried Murder; nor your continued detention of him, to the daily
decay of Trade, and ruin of many of us.

You have brought the Parliament of England to a low ebb, a Iuncto of most
desperate Rebels, most cursed Traitors, your selves that went from Westminster
to the Army in August: but for the carrying on of your Designs (now ready to be
quashed) and slurring over the discoveries, you will needs take notice of the
good affection of the City to adhere unto the Parliament, according to the
Covenant; very willing and nimble are you to apprehend and publish to the world
any thing which might make our City your friend, or (at least) stop
insurrections against you, you fear the trial of Law, and persuade that there
is no dislike 'twixt it and you, since the time it refused to join with you in
a Petition for a general pardon; and you easily condescend to put up our
chains: but for an In let (when you have devoured up the petitioning Counties,
and murdered those that desired to bring you to the trial of Law; you make
Skippon (an Army Officer, and not to be trusted by our City) Major General,
and you put the Militia of the City into Independents hands: Thus do you play
with our City, as a Cat does with a Mouse, catch her, and let her go, and catch
her again, but at last ever devours her; and then prudent Citizens, what good
does putting up your chains? and you run back to your propositions presented at
Hampton Court, as if that were sufficient satisfactions and should reconcile
you, after so many and foul falsifications of Word, and breach of Covenant with
our Brethren of Scotland, and those proud and traitorous designs you have
discovered of late against our City and Kingdom, and detaining of the King in
prison, and making no just account of those vast sums You and your
Substitutes have had from us.

In the beginning of these unnatural Brauls, your Declarations signified, that
the separation of his Majesty from Westminster was the original of our
unhappiness; and that the chief intent of raising your Army, was to bring the
King from some evil Counsel, in honor and safety, to sit with you at
Westminster, and that it was impossible ever to have a safe and wel-grounded
Peace, without his Majesty's personal concurrence in Parliament; and you often
protested by word of mouth in our Common Hals, and many Declarations in the
public view of heaven and earth, that you would not destroy but maintain our
Religion and our Laws, that you would live and dye with us, stand and fall
with us, that you would never leave us, till you had made us free; and lo, now
our freedom, now we have gained you your wills (for any thing we may since
imagine to the contrary) upon your private enemies, the King's Faithfuls; we
must be slaves to you and your Mechanic Substitutes, and your Raggamuffin
Army, and if we petition for our Sovereigns liberty and our own easment, we
must be worse used then Israel by their Egyptian Taskmasters, we must be
butchered and pillaged as our Surrey Brethren at Westminster, and as the
Petitioners in Kent, murdered and stripped in every Town and Lane where they were
found; and now your six weeks talk of settling the Kingdom, is come to a design
of disarming the Counties where you martch, one by one, and doubling your Army
and Assessements, and subjecting us unto a Military power: Thanks for the
freedom you intend us; we must keep you an Army of Rogues and Knaves to murder
and plunder us every where, and to protect you traitors, and your unjust
Committees, from trial of Law, and making up your accounts; you would have it
so: you are wise enough to know, that Rebellion cannot subsist longer then it
keeps an Army in the field, and we have woeful experience of the abuses and
charge of it: though Kentish Bumpkins be content with Bag-puddings, and Essex
Calves with Butter-milk, if we must wade thorough the red Sea unto our
Liberties, we will; send you out your Westminster Bulls of death and plunder,
against such as rise against you, and do your worst, we shall shortly ease our
selves of your Army and you too: and we hope such Cavaliers as served their
King for love, will join with us to restore him, and repair our infringed
freedoms, and vindicate themselves robbed and plundered of their Estates in
time of War, by you and your agents (contrary to the Statute of Hen. 7. you
know it well, you dishonest and shameless --) and forct to pay great sums of
money since at Goldsmiths-Hall, to the utter undoing of many of them: you might
by as good Law, have robbed upon the Road in times of peace, as sequestered any
for serving the King of this Country, or compelled loanes of Money from us, to
help forward your traitorous designs against the King and Kingdom, but you
think to make white your black actions with more wilful murders: You will try
by the King's Commission of Oyer and Terminer, not Rebels, but those that rise
to suppress them; this is your conscience, your honesty; thus regard you the
murdering, killing and slaughtering the Subjects of this kingdom; the tearings,
rendings and crippling of poor people; the burning, wasting and plundring of
men's estates; the woeful, bitter and sad complaints, and showrs of tears shed
in corners and secret closets by many men, whose former quality, with the
remembrance thereof, makes them wipe their eyes, and counterfeit cheerfulnes in
the sight of men: thus salve you the sores of this kingdom. When the Essex
Calves (as you styled them, and as they have proved since) then a little
sensible of their Masters sufferings, and their own, and the kingdoms ill
usage, and calling to mind some former specious Declarations, and treasonable
courses, directly contrary thereunto, repair unto Westminster in that most
unquestionable way, for the Subject, as Warwick daigned to call it, petitioning
the restitution of the King, and the Countries ease: the Houses after thet
uppers thanks for some respects in the Petition, and the saucy Commons
mentioning some former services, desire a further patience, and the Petition
shall be geanted; they will settle the kingdom by Dooms day, or when they can
continue War no longer; for in stead of disbanding their Army, they prepare for
second brauls, they put the City and kingdom into a military posture, under
Independent Officers, and fight with Major General Laughorn, Colonel Powell
and Poyer; yet they say their quarrel is against Cavaliers, and the people
must rise for them now, (a traieterous and perfidious Juncto, that seeks to
enslave them to an arbitrary power, and an Army) as for the Parliament before.

Our Brethren of Surrey petition, and the Houses send for the Rogues, (then at
White Hall) to fall upon them, making Westminster (formerly a Court of Justice,
where men had right) a field of blood and theft.

Our Brethren of Kent resolving to petiton, but fearing a Surrey welcome, arm
for their defense against the Army; and instead of receiving their Petition,
they delude them with Treaties and wiles, till they had got their Rebel Army
into the County amongst them, and then they send it Orders to fall upon them,
to slaughter and plunder all that should desire to have an old King, and a new
Parliament; which was sufficiently observed by the Soldiers; for none could
pass the Road uncut or unmurdered, and unstript; and when they came into their
Quarters, they would with drawn Swords, and spanned Pistols, swear and curse,
and tell the women, they would have rost-meat, or they would broyl a piece of
their Hu^bands heads: neither were they contented to feast whiles they stayed,
but at remouall, let sellars of Beer upon the floor, knock out the bottoms of
Milk-vessels, and spoil all. These be the civil Soldiers they have so often
talked of.

Essex appears for the assistance of Kent, and they first bribe far, and other
knaves to decline the business, and then send Whaley in amongst them, to play
like prnks there, as in Kent.

Sussex presents its Petition by the number limited in the Declaration to bring
it; and they tell them, as the others six weeks before, they are upon the
business of settling the Kingdom; yet they spent the last month in making
Orders for the sale of the Duke of Yorks Horses, and for Lincolns man passage
to France, and for Hungerfords coming from Ireland hither, and such like most
weighty affairs: the past of the month they have spent in voting the spoil of
Kent and Essex, in framing Plots at Derby house and Westminster, to be fathered
upon the Cavaliers, and to be discovered by the Major, and other their own
Agents, in preaching to the people of a common enemy against the Parliament,
City and Kingdom, in slandering our Presbyterian quarrel to be that of the
Cavaliers already ended, in proclaiming themselves The Parliament of England,
and their Independent Faction, the City and Kingdom, and apparelling all men in
the goodly clothes of Rebellion and Treason, that rise against their
Rebel-selves, that would destroy Religion and Law, the King and his Posterity,
and Crown themselves and Successors.

On Friday last they Vote the disarming of the Kingdom, as their Armies
marrch, and subjecting us to a tyrannical arbitrary power of themselves and
their Soldiers; to lay us so open (by disarming us) to the invasion of Spain
and France, our prist in and potent adversaries, was high treason in the Earl
of Straford and the Lord Cottington, in the beginning of their Sessions; and
yet now it is their Act, it must be otherwise.

Thus have I recapitulated a little the mischievous projects of this lewd and
wicked IUNCTO (those that went away to the Army in August last) and do desire
all, who have any zeal to Religion, love to Monarchical government, sense of
the sufferings and imprisonment of the King, affection to their oppressed
Brethren in the several Counties, or desire to preserve the liberty and
property of the Subject, that they would arm in each corner of the Kingdom,
and by force command that which will not otherwise be had.

FINIS.
