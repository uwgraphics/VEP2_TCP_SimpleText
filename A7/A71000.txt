Several LETTERS OF Great Importance, AND Good Success.

Lately obtained against the Fellowship of Bristow, by Captain William Smith,
Captain of his Majesty's Ship called the Swallow, now in service for the King
and Parliament.

And likewise the Lord Admiralls design upon Bristoll, and the Navy making
ready there under the Command of Sir John Pennington.

LONDON, Printed for Lawrence Blaiklock, at the sign of the Sugar-loafe near
Temple Bar, 1643.

SIR,
ACcording to my last unto you, I set sail on the third of August 1643. out of
Kinsayle to ply to the Eastward, and between the Saul-tiers and the Smales, I
made a Sail some two leagues to the Eastward, on the fifth of the same month,
in the Morning, and at Even fetching her up, she proved to be a vessel
belonging to North Yarmouth, and come from Strangford in Ireland, laden with
wood, and bound for Milford in Wales, to deliver there: And inquiring what
news, the Master told me that he met with Captain Jordan, in the
Expedition, who had taken a Hamburger, burden about three hundred Tuns, of
force, sixteen Gunnes, being laden with Salt and other provisions, she came
from Rochell in France, and was bound for the relief of the Rebels, and was
taken before St. David's head on the Coast of Wales, the Master further informed
me, that he did believe Captain Jordan was gone for Milford, and I having a
great desire to meet with Captain Jordan, I bore in for that Harbor, not
knowing how he might be engaged, and in case I found him not there, then to
desire the Gentlemen of that County to send Heu and Cry to apprehend diverse
passengers who^ Captain Jordan had forced on Sheare before he got possession of
the prize, and when I came before the Harbors mouth, a Fisherman came on board
of me, who told me that in Milford there were two ships, men of War, the one
was the fellowship of Bristoll, burden about four hundred Tons, of force,
24 Gunnes, having in her Four Captains, viz. Captain Barnaby Burley, Captain
Brooks, Captain William Hayle, and Captain Banister, the other was the Heart
Friggot, wherein commanded Captain Richard Nesson, the said Captains had
summoned aboard the Fellowship all the Gentry in those parts, and certified
that the King had rasten Bristoll, and that all the Kingdom did now repair
unto his Majesty to seek for his gracious pardon, and that the Parliaments
forces were all overthrown, and that His Majesty would suddenly march for
London, all Kent being now in arms to assist the King, Chattom and Rochell
were also taken, therefore they would advise that County presently to present a
Petition to His Majesty, in tender of their service unto him, and also to
raise such a considerable sum of money, as they in their wisdom should conceive
meet to comply with His Majesty's occasions, and so come aboard them, and they
would present them to His Majesty, but in case they should not do this, then
they and their posterity were ruined for ever, for Prince Rupert would
immediately come down and Plunder their Country: And his Majesty had sent
them out to command all his Majesty's ships, and other ships that were on that,
or the Irish coast, that on their Allegiance they should repair to Bristoll,
and the Commanders and Mariners should have his Majesty's gracious pardon, and
the Commanders should receive from his Majesty both employment, honor, and
great reward, and the Mariners should have a large gratuitie, Upon this
intelligence, I called to me all the Officers of the Swallow, and then the
ships company, informed them, what I had heard, and that the ship was rich,
having aboard her, diverse goods belonging to the Merchants of Bristoll to
preserve from plundering, all which the owners of the ship had traitorously
delivered with their ship into the hands of the Cavaleirs, And that if they
would fight for it, their love and zeal to Gods cause would be made visible to
all men, and it would very much daunt the enemy, and be a good example for
others to trase them in the steps of valor and virtue, Also it would manifest
their thankfulness to the Parliament, who had conferred such favors, as first
a gratuitie, then the increase of their wages, all which must needs bring a
blessing on them, and I do not doubt, but that it should please God to deliver
the Ships into our hands, but that the Parliament would acknowledge their
constancy in gratifying their fidelity according to the value of the prize, and
then demanding their resolutions, they cried all as one man, God bless the
King and Parliament, and that they would stand by me, to the last man, and
then I bore in for the Harbor, it being monday the Seventh of August 1643.
where I found the said Ship at Anchor, but the Commanders had made us from the
top of a hill, before we came in, and had fitted their ships, and put aboard
their Waystcloathes, and when I came within shot, there came off a Boat from
the fellowship, toward the Swallow, and in it one Captain John Brooks, holding
forth a white flag, who desired a parley upon condition I would let him return
aboard the Fellowship if we could not accord, to which I consented, then he
came aboard, and leaping down into the Wayst, he cried, God bless King
Charles, to which we all said, Amen. The which being done, the said Captain
desired to have some private conference with me, but I refused it, saying, I
desire to hear nothing from him, but what the whole ships company might hear,
but he pressed it the second time, and being denied the said Captain turned
himself to the ships company, relating unto them the words formerly specified
in demonstrating the Kings grace and mercy extended toward us, in case we
would comply and carry the ship to Bristoll, but then I commanded him to
silence, saying, it did seem strange unto me, that he should dare to take the
Kings name in his mouth, in regard that both he and his confederates appeared
unto me to be Pirates, and Sea-Rovers, in that they had taken and rifled a
double Shallop that belonged to his Majesty's Fleet, now on the coast of
Ireland, having five small Guns in her, but the said Captain replied, They had
a Commission for what they had done, under the hand of Sir John Pennington, and
that Captain Hayle had another under the hand of Prince Rupert, and that Sir
John Pennington was High Admiral by Patent under the great Seal of England; I
told him I had no such intelligence of any such Patent, either from the
Parliament, or from the Honorable the Earl of Warwick or any Order to obey
it, and for that of Prince Rupert, he being a stranger, I could not perceive by
what virtue or power his Highness could give Commission to any to rob, or take
his Majesty's ships, or other ships belonging to any of His Majesty's Loyal
Subjects. And therefore until I could be better satisfied; I would use my best
endeavor to seize on their persons, and ships, as Pirates, or sinck by their
side.

And in the interim of this discourse, the Swallow was come to Anchor on her
broad side, and then Captain Brooks desired me to certify so much in writing
to Captain Burley; and while I went into the Cabine to write, the Fellowship
had cut her Cable, and was under sail, intending to run a shore; and being
informed thereof by the Master, we came out, and I commanded the Gunner to give
fire to a piece of Ordnance, the which was done; but within a Cable length the
Fellowship came aground, and in pursuit of her, we cut and also came aground a
little ahead of her, and then I gave her two pieces of Ordnance; whereupon
Captain Burley appeared on the Poope, and cried, Captain hold, hold; then I
commanded him a board, who when he came told me he would deliver up the ship,
if I would promise on the faith of a Gentleman to set the Commanders and ships
company on shore, or give them a double shallop to carry them to Bristol the
which if I refused to do, he had left those on board would set the ship on
fire; then I replied unto him, that burn she should, for I was resolved not to
part with any one man of them, for I valued them more then I did the ship: but
in the mean time I had sent a letter to the Master and ships company, that if
they would deliver up the other two Captains with their ship, I did promise
them all a free entertainment, and that they should have their wages paid, and
all such goods as they could make appear justly to belong to any of them: upon
the receipt of which letter, the Master and Mariners did deliver up the ship
without the loss or hurt of any one man (God be praised) only when the Heart
Frigot parted from us, to run a shore, we gave her an unhappy shot, and killed
two men, and hurt one; but Captain Nesson who commanded in her, carried her
eight miles up the River, and ran her a shore in a Creek; but she was pursued
by Captain Rue Williams, and there was exchanged diverse shot between them, but
Nesson ran away with most of his men, and left her, and the next day Captain
Williams brought her off, in which service, the Gentleman does crave his
Lordships Protection: Having perfected this service the next day, I set sail
in pursuit of my Admiral, to acquaint him with our proceedings, and also that
Bristoll was lost, and the fleet is now repairing there to command out fleet,
wherein Sir John Pennington is to come out Admiral, that so we might use our
best endeavors to nip these proceedings in the bud, and having acquainted my
Admiral herewith, it is agreed on, that forthwith we repair to Milford to
endeavor to get our ships want of victuals supplied, the which if we shall
do I hope God will enable us to perform some good service in the preventing of
the coming out of that fleet, either by inviting them to comply with us, or
else to destroy them in the Harbor, And this is my Admiralls, and our constant
resolution, if it shall please God to enable us with victuals to subsist on
this Coast, to which I doubt not, but our God will give a blessing in that he
has been pleased to give such good success in the surprising of one of their
best ships, as also the Friggot, the which is a great encouragement to us, and
doubtless as great a disheartning unto them who seek their King and Countries
ruin, endeavoring to upheld that Antichristian beast, whom God has said,
Must down, to whose protection I commit you, and take my leave, and rest.

From aboard his Majesty's Ship the Swallow, making sail for Milford, Aug. 17.
1643. Your most loving Brother to serve you, William Smith

Noble Sir,
THe Character which Fame sounds in the ears of all men that come into the
these parts of your worth, and the good affection you and the rest of the
Gentlemen of this County bear to the public Cause, whereon depends Gods
glory, the Kings honor, and the peoples safety, is a sufficient motive to
enduce me to present these, in discharge of the trust imposed, which is to
keep a compliance with all His Majesty's loyal subjects, who in their refined
judgments, have made no divisions or distractions between the Kings Majesty,
and His great Council the Parliment in England, and to engage my life in
defense and preservation of such Worthies, is my duty, in which, I hope one day
to appear a loyal subject, and a faithful servant, and if here I may do my
acceptable service, I desire to receive your instructions, with which to my
power I shall not fail to comply* and I shall also desire you and the rest of
the Gentlemen of this County, to be pleased to send Hue and Cry to attach
certain wandering and Rebellious persons, who were lately forced on the shore
by the Expedition on this County, it is thought some Priests and Jesuits were
amongst them, and that they have jewels and money, the which I am informed they
brought from Rochell in France, and were bound to the relief of the Rebels at
Wexford in Ireland, the apprehending of these dangerous persons may happily
prevent great evils which otherwise may ensue; and so every good man in
discharging his duty to his God and his Country, it may be a means to hasten
a speedy composure of these sad tragical distractions, the which our good God
in his mercy grant, to whose protection I commit you, and take my leave and
rest,

August the 7. 1643, aboard the Swallow. Your frind to serve you, William Smith.

The Answer.
Allworthy Sir,
I Much rejoice at your constant perseveration and good success, which I hope
the Lord in his mercy will continue, and my prayers and means shall not be
wanting, I have imparted your desire of supplying your wants of victual unto
the Gentlemen, whose willingness I presume will not be wanting, and this night
I am assured to hear their answer, which I hope will give you real content,
what lies in my power to assist you; I shall not be wanting, being really to
corroborate my protestation with my life and means, not any way daunted with
the poor flawes of ill fortune that has lately befallen us, God will not
suffer his chosen to suffer in the superlative degree, but greatly to chastise
them, lest they attribute too much to the arm of flesh, God I hope and make no
doubt) will make a period to these unnatural civil Wars, and our Religion,
Laws, Liberties, preserved, in their desired purity, I desire to wait on you,
but reserve my self till I receive your commands, in the interim I am your
servant and present my service unto you and will remain,

August 9, 1643. Your friend to serve you, Griffith White.

The Letter upon the same day.
Noble Sir,
SInce the last Letter I sent you this Post-noone, I understand by an honest
Gentleman, who is as I am, that Hayle your now prisoner has divulged in the
presenee of some Gentlemen of quality of this County, that the inhabitants of
this County should not reap their Corn, in case they did, they should not
enjoy it, my desire is, that you would be pleased to vouchsafe this courteous
favor, to examine and fish out the cause and ground of this report, and
withal, if you find this to be true which cannot but prove prejudicial the
public good, that you would write a letter, and direct it in general to the
Gentry of this County (omitting particulars) which I verily believe will turn
the hearts of such who are now in the way of colapsing, since the taking of
unconstant Bristoll, and unite their hearts with ours, who are constant to the
Cause, I desire if your resolution comply with me (which I doubt not of) to
hasten your Letter with all speed, which I know will be very thankfully
received, and for my own particular I shall and will remain your very loving
friend to serve you,

Grissith White.

Most worthy Sir,
TO satisfy you, and the Gentlemen of this County, in the contents of your
last unto me concerning the menacing speeches thundered out by Hayle and his
Confederates, that the Corn now on the ground should never be reaped by the
Gentlemen and Commons of this County, or if it were, you should never enjoy it,
are I assure you only the Bravadoes of a proud insulting Enemy, and grounded
neither on judgment, or religion; for who but our only wise God can tell what
shall be hereafter, or what 2 day may produced; and I am confident the Gentry
of this County are not ignorant of the power of the Almighty, that he is able
to deliver as well by few as many, as is manifested unto you by multitudes of
examples in his revealed word: wherefore to remove your fears, the only
comfort I can give you is this, That in your Makers cause you would behave your
selves as becomes good Christians, and valiant Soldiers of Christ Jesus, that
you would gird on your swords, muster your Forces, put your selves in battle
array, and quit your selves like men, putting your selves under Gods
protection, doubt not but his Divine Majesty is both able and also will deliver
all those that put their confidence in him; but without faith our Savior would
do no miracles while he was here on the earth: wherefore in confidence of his
assistance, there can be no greater manifestation of our faith then to engage
our lives and estates in the maintenance of his cause, which is the only means
to preserve both. And I believe, that the Gentry of this County very well
understand the condition of this war, and that it is no other then between
Christ and Antichrist, and that one day his Majesty will have great cause to
acknowledge the fidelity of all such his loyal and obedient Subjects as have
or do adhere unto his Majesty and his great Council the Parliament of England,
in the suppressing of that Antichristian Rout who have now taken up arms to
destroy the Protestant Religion, the Kings honor, and dignities, the
privileges of Parliament, and the liberties of the Subject; in the
preservation whereof the Parliament have been forced to take up Arms, in which
as I stand engaged, I shall be ever ready to assist and comply with all such
his Majesty's loyal and faithful Subjects, so far as God shall enable me,
and my abilities give me leave; and in tender of my service herein to all the
well-affected Gentlemen of this County, I take my leave and rest.

Your faithful Servant to be commanded in the serviee of God, the King, and
Parliament, William Smith.

FINIS.
