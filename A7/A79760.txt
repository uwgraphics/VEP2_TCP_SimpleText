(...) Stirling, 24 October, 1650. Ante-meridiem.
A SHORT WARNING, From the Commission of the General Assembly; Concerning the
Malignants now in Arms.
ALbeit the Designs and Carriage, of the Malignant party now in Arms, and
their Accomplices, be in themselves so many, and so manyfestly wicked, as may
render them odious, and detestable, unto all the people of GOD, in this Land,
at the first looking thereon; Yet the LORD having called us thereunto, we hold
it our duty (as here-to-fore) to give Warning thereof; Both for the reclaming
of these, who are already ensnared therein, and for the guarding of others,
against Temptations thereunto.

We need not be at much payns, in fynding out of these men's intentions; nor
go far off, for Learning of the ends which they propose unto themselves, in
their present actings; These being no other, than has been promoted by the
Malignant party from the beginning: To wit, the setting up of themselves,
under a pretense of Promoting Royal Authority, and kingly interest; That they
may the more easily bear down these who have been isntrumental in the Work of
GOD; and at last destroy the Work it self, a design which had been to be
abhorred in any; but much more in these men, who are so Solemnly tied before
the LORD, by the Oath of the COVENANT unto the contrary, and against whose
former Malignant ways, and back-slydings, the LORDS Hand has been lifted up
so high, unto the breaking of the Pride of their Power, oftener than once: And,
who have so lately been offering and professing, before the CHURCH of GOD,
their Repentance, for such things; as being convinced in their Consciences of
the Sinfulness, and Unlawfulness of the same: And, who stand under the Tie of
so many Promises and Subscriptions, both to the State and Church, to the
contrary: Several of the most eninent amongst them, do by these their late
actions stand now proclaimed before the World, and under their own hands,
infamous and perfidious Covenant breakers: And, it does much highten their
iniquity; That they have conspired together against GODS People, in such a
time; when there is also another Enemy in the Land, designing Mischief against
Religion, and Government.

We may say, We are brought low: But we hope, That the LORD shall prevent
us, with His Mercies, and require it at their hands. If there be any place
left for exhortation, we WVRN these men, to consider, How the Wrath and
Vengeance of the LORD has been persuing the Malignant party, in all these
Kingdoms, these many years past; and, how many times their own Designs have
been blasted, and themselves brought nigh unto Destruction; And, to remember
what a severe Avenger the LORD is of Covenant Breaking, and of the open mocking
of His NAME, by falling foully again into these sins, which once have been
confessed, and they seem to have repented of: And what a foull stayn it is upon
their Consciences and credit, to go contrary to so many late Professions, and
violate so many Bands and Obligations, taken upon themselves for avoiding all
Malignant Ways, and not disturbing the Peace of the Kingdom: And, how
monstrous and unnatural a thing it is, to have risen against their Country,
and the Public Authority of the Land, when they had to do with a prevayling
Enemy; And, it shall be Wisdom for these that are in Authority, to walk with
Malignants, according to the rule of the Word of GOD, and Band of the COVENANT,
to take good heed of trusting, and taking in, such as have been opposite to the
Work of GOD, so many experiences teaching the unsoundness of most of these from
year to year, which also may teach all these who have recovered themselves, out
of such Snares, to take heed, that they be not again involved therein; But
that as they have professed their Repentance, for their Accession to any
Malignant courss, so they may labor to get their Hearts established through
Grace, that they fall not back with others, into the same Sin.

AND, We exhort the whole LAND, To beware of Compliance, with these Sons of
Beliall, either by joining with them in Arms, or concurring in Counsel and
Designs, or by assisting them with men, or moneys, or provisions, or by
corresponding with them, or countenancing of them, or conniving at their wicked
ways; As they would not draw Guilt upon themselves, before the LORD, and prove
Treacherous and Unsteadfast in His COVENANT and CAUSE.

THE Straytes and Sufferinges of His People, be indeed, at this time, many and
great: But it is better to suffer the hardest of Afflictions, than to sin
against GOD, by complying with an evil Courss: And, We are confident, That
unto those who keep their Steadfastness, GOD shall open a Door of Hope, and
make a Day of SALVATION to appear: Therefore, Let all men, in the Strength and
Fear of the LORD, do their Duty against Enemies on both hands; And the LORD
shall give DELIVERANCE.

A. Ker.
