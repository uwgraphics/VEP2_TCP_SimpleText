the Kingdom, it is desired as follows:
THat to morrow morning each parish shall go about eight a clock to Church.

Commons for the Listing of all within the parish, that will serve in this
public work as a soldier.

City.

have ordered that all such Prentices as shall go upon this service, shall be
received again by their Masters, and not receive any prejudice in their
Prentiships or Freedom by going upon this employment.

and such others as shall be well affected to this service in each Parish, may
upon the ending of the Sermon List such men as will serve.

That the Lists so taken be brought in by four a clock to the Committee of the
Militia of London.

That at 8.a clock on Monday morning such as are Listed do attend my Lord of
Warwick, his Excellence, and such others of the Lords and Commons as shall be
appointed at the new Artillery-yard, and that then they shall receive their pay.

Dated this Saturday, 5. Nov. 1642.
