LONDON, Printed by Robert Wood. 1650.

To the FAVORABLE READER.
TO write of modern men, is a troublesome business; all men commit errors,
few having committed them, will hear thereof; one must or flatter them, or say
nothing; to Comment upon their actions, is to endeavor to teach more by a man's
own example, than by that of others; more to him that writes then to him that
reads; more to be silent then to be active: Flatterers have yet moreover so
exalted their good deeds, that the naked truth redounds to the blame of the
Relator; for the truth of that which is heard, comes short of that which is
believed; and some there are who arrive at that height, as they leave no place
for flattery, fancying themselves greater then flattery can make them. In the
beginning of Government, every small authority seems great; in the continuance
thereof, however great it be, it seems little; whence it proceeds, that in
time, that Magistrate is not endured, which was too greedily (at first)
created, or desired. Liberty and Principality are incompatible, they meet not
together, or if they do, they last not; every own seeks his own perfection,
which depending upon the destruction of another, they seek it there; to live
quietly, it behooves either to be totally free, or totally tied to servitude: To
conquer Princes, and not know how to make the victory beneficial; to win the
people, and not know how to keep them in subjection; is a loss of men and
time: Providence is necessary, and it is laborious. To captivate men's minds
with rewards is impossible; servitude cannot be rewarded with any other
recompense, then being set at liberty: To tie them by an Oath is no way safe;
they are not subjects, whose power is only subject to will; Liberty is
natural, servitude violent; what is violent needs somewhat, which from without
may withstand it, if its beginning be not occasioned from some internal cause.
This alteration of Government is performed with very great labor and
difficulty to the undertakers thereof, and with, the either great patience, or
murmurings of the people, who are passive therein. But I dare divine, and can
assure poor England, that the glorious omnipotency of Heaven seems very
favorable unto her, and gives great hopes (after some few distractions abroad
composed) that all her taxes shall be withdrawn, and (for the future) be no
further burdened with oppressions, or payments; during which continuation, we
are not masters of our own fortunes, and so live not at home: And therefore
seeing that the purchasers of our Liberty, have many difficulties to attend
their motion, I heartily implore all true Englishment, as one man, to unite
their hearts, their prayers, their forces, and purses, unanimously for defense
of this Commonwealth and Authority now established; and by conforming
thereunto, we shall quell hoth the insulting French, the proud Spaniard, and
all other Enemies to Englands peace and tranquillity, throughout the world; and
by degrees, we shall attain to a most excellent and accomplished Government.
But before we shall absolutely enjoy this happiness, we must undergo some
troubles, meet with many stumbling blocks, and endure many a cruel storm, yet
let this be our comfort, God will deliver his people out of the hands of their
enemies, and settle peace in the habitations of those that put their trust in
him. Reader, I am doubtful I have detained thee too long (in Epistolizing)
from what I promised thee in my Title page; for which I desire thy pardon,
entreating thee to accept of the weak and imperfect labors of

Thy friend, M. A.

MERLINVS ANGLICVS, OR, AN ENGLISH MERLIN: Prophetically foretelling, The most
eminent things that shall happen, in England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
this present Year, 1650.
May's Astrologicall Predictions.
THis Month produces matters of great concernment; the actions will be eminent
in the Kingdom of Ireland, and unto the perpetual honor of the English
Nation: Great fortune at tends the English Heroes (notwithstanding the
treacherous designs of their Enemies, and others) and some desperate assaults
are attempted, wherein God makes it appear by some sequel victory or action,
that he loves the faithful Patriots of England, by giving conquest and triumph
to their Armies in Ireland: A total subduing of the barbarous Irish appears
visible toward the close of this Month; but great sickness and unnatural
diseases seems too brief within our Camp, occasioned by some treacherous
neglect from England. Self ends appear visible within our English territories,
intemperate disputes, and civil broyls are much feared, and the spirits of
diverse Monarchical creatures, are exceedingly enraged and enflamed, throughout
the West and Northern Counties; but a Southern cordial will speedily be
administered, to abate the heat and fury thereof: Great rumors this Month of a
Foreign invasion, but providence, and vigilance, retards the landing of the
States enemy. Here arrives news, as if the wavering Scot were entering league
or friendship, but whether with us to deceive us, or with our enemies to annoy
us, time will manifest; it is believed to the contrary: For if an agreement be
not concluded, between their King and the Grandees; (with good provision and
security for the Commonalty) the whole land is divided, and their distractions
will exceedingly increase; a Thistle belonging to the Royal branch (as they
say) aspires high in the North of that Kingdom, but the English Rose once
appearing, strikes a sudden blast to her piercing and prickling blossoms.

Junes Astrologicall Predictions.
GReat are the consultations and disputes of the Commonalty of England this
Month, who fixing their eyes Northward, discern the Scot to be highly
elevated, by reason of his great confidence, or uncertain assurance, of aid and
assistance from Denmark, France, and other places, to annoy us; yea, and the
state of all Europe is guided likewise with most strange and improvident
advisers; and a sullen murmuring people within our own Territories, seems to
swell with inveterate conceptions, acting and contriving desolation and ruin
to the supreme Authority of the Nation; and many poisoned darts will also fly
from the quiver of invective spirits, wounding and piercing the honor of some
worthy Patriots, who formerly seemed as Oracles to the people, free from
corruption either in Office or bribery: [Oh a lusty purge for these diabolical
creatures, who under the spetious pretenses of restoration of liberty, do
endeavor the involving of us into endless misery.] But if the Commonalty
begin now to be angry, their blows will fall exceeding heavy, and woe be unto
those who shall move them to wrath, by dis-franchising them of their late
purchased liberty, and endeavor their involving once again in new commotions
and troubles; great ruin attends the Dane, and all other who are interessed in
his design, against the Inhabitants of this Commonwealth: Distractions grow
great in several parts of the Nation, through want of the Engine and smew of
War, but by the great vigilance of our prudent Rulers, their wants are
supplied, and their discontents most happily allayed and pacified. Rich men
look to your purses, a purge is now preparing, but [indeed] it will be a very
favorable and pleasant one. The close of this Month produces great
happiness to the laborious husbandman, his heavy taxes being much abated, and
their weighty burdens in a great measure removed. Ireland cries out this
Month for moneys and provision, and many there are who endeavor the retarding
thereof, and withdraw their helping hand from the propagating of so great a
work; but let them all be anathematized (who shall appear isntrumental
therein) to future generations and posterities: Great commotions and
distractions (throughout all parts of the world) attends the close of this
Month; But a woeful rising seems to threaten the Turk, even from
Constantinople the allarm shall be given, which will echo through most of his
confines and territories, insomuch, that the industrious Venetian, appears full
of action, and will free themselves from slavery in the Island of Candy, firing
and taking most of the Turkish Galleys, which lie as Pirates and Robbers, to
massacre and enslave the Christians.

July's Astrologicall Predictions.
THis Month produces great action, both by Sea and Land; especially upon the
Coast of Britain, Scotland, Sweden, and Holland; the English Mariners seems
both stout and resolute, triumphantly sailing with their slags of defiance, and
scorning to strike sail to the proudest enemy that flotes upon the Ocean: Some
desperate engagements happen between them, and the French rovers, little
quarter given, but revenge repaid, for their former abuses to the poor English
Merchants. Sir George Askue (the Summers darling) and the undanted Generals,
Blake, Dean, and Popham, in few days will clear the English Channel, and not
so much as a French Rover, or Irish Pyrate, will dare appear on our Coast; so
that free trade and commerce will not in the least be hindered or retarded;
which makes the Merchant, and the rest of the Manufacture-Adventurers to smile,
returning thanks, and presenting gratuities for this great privilege. Some
action in the Northern Climate, both by Sea and Land; for assuredly the Scot
has a great desire to be troublesome, and once again to be stripped and whipped,
and sent to foreign plantations: The seasonable temperature of the weather
this Month, invites the English Army in Ireland to great action, a great blow
threatens their enemy, but not without some loss; for by reason of some
perfideous spirits, he takes great advantage, and seems very resolute and
sturdy; many conspirators hold juggling consultations, and greatly it is to be
feared, there will be some conspiracies in England; yea, among some, whom the
people have entrusted, and preferred to great Office and dignity; but like
faithful Patriots, others of the Trustees, and Keepers of our Liberties, carry
on the work designed by the omnipotent Jehovah, for perpetuity, his glory, and
our comforts.

Augusts Astrologicall Predictions.
MAny various reports are echoed up and down, in several parts of our Nation
[this Moneth] as if the entrance of an Army amongst us were to be feared, and
that an in-road will be made by Jockey, together with the Danes, French, and
other forraigners: Do not attempt our harm, you of the Scottish Faith, for
sharp effects from the conjunction of Mars, does presage and threaten a dismal
woe, not only within the English territories, or your confines, but also all
over Europe, [where ye shall reside.] Some great ones amongst us endeavor to
foment new differences, and to corrupt the soldiery, but notwithstanding their
several temptations, little will be effected; and as to the government of the
English affairs now on foot, it seems not at a loss, but in a good posture or
condition, though infinite and manifold treacherous plots are consulted of, to
destroy the frame of Government now extant, its authority and Majesty, and the
Rulers of us thereby; yea, the whole Nation it self (if possible;) the
influence whereof, produces sad effects to the conspirators; and if mercy be
not showed in the midst of Justice, its feared the bright Axe will be died of a
skarlet hue: The Presbyterian seems angry, and much displeased with the present
authority, and many invective speeches will proceed from those, who formerly
shined like glorious Lights amongst us, having performed wonderful actions for
the service of this Commonwealth; but notwithstanding this their change, and
perverting of their purer judgments, I heartily wish, that the State of
England, may look upon their former merits, and say, as Solomon, upon the
failings of Abiathar; Because you, from the very beginnings of our troubles,
have suffered with us, fought for us, and now only unfortunately have erred,
and receded from your former obedience, be you forgiven of God, we remit this
your casual trespass.

Septembers Astrologicall Predictions.
SOme pestilent broyls, or unparalleled results, give cause of fear to our
Governors, but a few days patience promises a comfortable composure: Lift up
your heads, you English Cedars, and faithful Commoners be not sad; the
unchangeable decrees of Eternal providence, have well provided for your ease;
although some discord and contention, may for a time seem to discontent us, by
reason of some astonishment arising from the Citizens of London, and great
disputes happening between party and party; but the sufferings of this Nation
are almost quite over, and I could wish the like in Ireland; but it seems there
is much to be done, some money and men's lives to be spent; but I hope all those
who are lovers of Religion, liberty and freedom, will most willingly lend
their helping hand, for their relief and assistance. Alas! poor England cannot
expect safety without a full conquest of Ireland, which I positively affirm, we
shall subdue this year, the several positions of heaven promising us no less
then victory, and the Irish downfall: But the sooner we send men, moneys,
clothes, and necessaries, the more will be our glory, and our brethrens
comfort: I wish a generation of our own at home, fail not herein.

Octobers Astrologicall Predictions.
I Reland is sensible of the actions of this Month, in one kind or other, but
probably in the worser sense; the soldiery seems very weary, by reason of some
unseasonable weather, and the searcity of bread and provisions; but its in vain
[O Ireland] to resist that overruling providence, which by the mercy of God
attends the English consultations: Diverse of the Irish Nobility, begin to
desert any further engagement with England, and many of them fly into other
Countries for relief and succor: The sick Scot is still lurking to take
advantage; but him we need not fear, though assisted with the Dane, who is
preparing for our annnoyance this Summer: The Swede we shall not find our
friend, nor does the German Emperor and the Princes of Germany, favor this
Government: The French have already, do still, and will hereafter abuse us for
a while; but the edge of their fury will within few Months be taken off, and
great will be their commotions, the commonalty endeavoring to cast off
Monarchy; and an invitation is upon a near arrival to England, for the
purchasing of liberty. The close of this Month produces good effects from the
Clergy, and those Divines who for many precedent Months walked very averse in
judgment, begin now to hold a mutual correspondency in Doctrine, and a good
understanding and concurrence, is with great joy, alacrity, and amity, assented
to.

November's Astrologicall Predictions.
SOme of our English Trustees begin now to soar high, having by their great
Offices enriched their estates, and filled their purses; which causes the
Communalty to swell with anger, and their spirits to boil with indignation, and
seriously to commune one with another, and questioning each others judgments,
why they made no better a choice; but they are pacified for a while, having
fair hopes of bettering their condition in the future. Let us hope well after
all our sufferings, there is some probability either of curing, or lopping off
such diseased branches of the Commonwealth, as have glutted themselves with the
peoples ruin and impoverishment. About this time there arises great changes
in France, and without doubt either a new molding of men, or just examination
of some Parliamentary matters. We shall have rumors of Wars, and hear of
preparations of Armies in several parts of Europe; but the English Statists
shall prepare the greatest Fleet for Sea, and the best Army for Land, that ever
was seen in these parts; for the English will be reputed so despicable a
people, in most parts of Europe, that the State will be forced to stand upon
their guard, both by Sea and land, and they will so discreetly manage their
affairs, that the greatest and wisest Politicians, with all their might and
power, shall not be able to annoy us, or set footing within our Territories.

December's Astrologicall Predictions.
THe year is now ending, but the great murmurings of the people not yet brought
to a period, but time by degrees may better inform their judgments: A sad
government which people neither fear nor approve of, but as necessitated: Great
are the complaints of the people to the Parliament, against public Officers,
who have sought their own interests, and served their own turns with the
public treasure. Were a full liberty granted, which [perhaps] may be, the
Commonwealth knows who to question, and where to find moneys. Something near
or about this time, a capital punishment is threatened: No admonition or
judgment will serve some of those who have quickened and excited our
differences; it is possible the just hand of God may find out some of them
miraculously, and suffer the execution of justice to be inflicted on them; at
which time, the Communalty will smile, and not cease from petitioning that
justice may flow in its proper current, and not be perverted either with
bribery or partiality.

January's Astrologicall Predictions. 1651.
GAllant things are in agitation this Month, the beginning of which produces
large disputes: Our Representatives proceed with great alacrity for the easing
of the Communalty of their Assessements, and heavy burdens, and tenderly now
consider, how they may be taken off, and much lessened or abated: Little action
this Month, words being more predominant then blows; yet a few discontented
spirits, seem to begin the year with mutinous paradoxes, and would attempt
against our State and Government, which will continue, if they derogate not
from their true and lawful principles.

February's Astrologicall Predictions.
A Melodious harmony sounds pleasantly in the ears of Englands Libertines this
Month; whose painful endeavors are now studious, how to present their
gratifications of love, unto such as have supported them and the Kingdoms
cause, with hazarding their lives, fortunes, and estates: The Londoners and
diverse others, do now unfeignedly make a recantation of their former
disobedience; who having tasted of the sweet fruits, which our Representatives
have with so great hazard and pains reaped, begin now to relish the virtue of
their proceedings, and and resolve to walk obediently in all just and lawful
ways, which they are required or commanded to; And although there is a portent
of division amongst some few great ones, yet the God of peace can convert some
absurd mistakes into a better temper then open hostility or public defiance.

March's Astrologicall Predictions.
BY the Conjunction of several Planets, this Month produces good effects,
and our long desired Peace, seems now firmly established: Several Agents and
Ambassadors from foreign Potentates arrive here near these times, desiring
unity between their Masters and our Representatives; The Governors of foreign
Plantations, desire to live under the protection of our English State: The
French seems a little troublesome, notwithstanding his ill success the last
year, and the Danes would be with us, but dare not. Some new commotions in
Scotland, by discontented spirits, for advance of Monarchy, but all in vain.
The Presbyters in England, receive a general change, and endeavor nothing
more, then the preservation of their peace and liberty, and frustrating the
malign designs of the adverse party.

April's Astrologicall Predictions.
OUr English spirits soar high; the soldiery are resolute and undanted, and in
so good a posture, that no enemy can annoy us: The Hollander is very active,
making great preparations for Sea; what their design is, time will suddenly
discover; they are a subtle self-ended people, and it behooves England being so
near a neighbor diligently to attend their motion: The Scots begin to desist
from playing fast and loose any longer, and (in some measure) to conceive
aright of our present Government and Authority, who in its purity, is like to
continue many Generations: And I am confident, all true Englishmen, and lovers
of their Countries freedom, will generally unite, and endeavor (for the
future) the preservation and safety of this Commonwealth wherein they live.

FINIS.
