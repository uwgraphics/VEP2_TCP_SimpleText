THE STATE OF A CHRISTIAN, lively set forth by an Allegory of a Ship under
Sail. Prove. 31.14. Job 9.26. Isay 23.1. Rev. 8.9.

MY Body is the Hull; the Keele my back; my Neck the Stem; the Sides are my
Ribs; the beams my bones; my flesh the plankes; Gristles and ligaments are
the Pintells and knee-timbers; Arteries, veins and sinews the several seames
of the ship; my blood is the ballast; my heart the principal hold; my
stomach the Cooke-roome; my Liver the Cesterne; my Bowels the sink; my Lungs
the Bellows; my teeth the Chopping-knives, except you divide them, and then
they are the 32. points of the Sea-card both agreeing in number; Concoction is
the Caldron; and hunger the Salt or sauce; my belly is the lower Deck; my
kidneys Close Cabbins or receptacles; my thighs are long Galleries for the
grace of the ship; my arms and hands the Canhookes, my midriffe is a large
Partition or Bulk-head; within the circumference of my head is placed the
Steeridge room and chief Cabbins, with the Round house where the Master
lies, and these for the more safety and decency are enclosed with a double
fence, the one Dura matter something hard and thick, the other Pia matter very
thin and soft, which serves in stead of hangings; The ears are two doors
or Scuttles, fitly placed for entertainment; the two Eyes are Casements to let
in light; under them is my mouth the Stowidge or Stewards room; my lips are
Hatches for receipt of goods; my two Nostrills serve as Gratings to let in air;
at the one end stands my chin which is the Beakehead; my forehead is the upper
deck; all which being trimmed with my fat in stead of pitch, and hair in
stead of Ockham, are colored with my skin.

The fore-decke is humility; the stearne Charity; active obedience the sails;
which being hoysed up with the several Yards, Halliers and Bowlings of holy
precepts and good purposes, are let down again by fickleness, faintings, and
inconstancy; Reason is my Rudder; experience the helm; hope of salvation my
Anchor; passive obedience the Capstaine; holy Revenge the Cat and Fish to hawle
the sheate Anchor or last hope; fear of offending is the Buoy; virtues are the
Cables; Holy desires and sudden ejaculations the shroudes; the zeal of Gods
glory is my Maine-mast, premeditation the foremast; desire of my own salvation
the Mizzen-mast; saving knowledge the Boltesprit; ^ircumspection a sounding
line; my Light is illumination, Justice is the Card, Gods word the Compass;
the meditation of life's brevity a Foure-houre glass; Contemplation of the
Creatures the Crosse-staffe or Jacobs staff; the Creed a Sea grammar; the
life of Christ my Load star; the Saints falls are Sea-markes; Good examples
Land-markes; Repentance Pumps out the sink of my sins; a good Conscience
keeps me clean; imputative righteousness is my Flag, having this Motto
(BEING CAST DOWN WE PERISH NOT) The Flage-staffe is sincerity; the ship is
victualed afresh by reading, hearing, receiving; Books are Long-boates;
Letters are little Sciffes to carry and recarry my spiritual merchandise;
Perseverance is my speed, and patience my name, my fire is lust, which will
not be clean extinguished; full feeding and strong drink is the fuel to
maintain it, whose flame (if it be not suppressed) is jealousy; whose sparks
are evil words; whose ashes is envy; whose smoke is infamy; Lascivious
talk is as flint and steel; Concupiscence as tinder, opportunity is the match
to light it; Sloth and idleness are the Servants to prepare it.

The Law of God is my Pilot; Faith my Captain; Fortitude the Master; Chastity
the Masters mate; my will the Coxen; Conscience the Preacher; Application of
Christ's death the Surgeon; Mortification the Cook; Vivification the Calker;
Selfedeniall is an Apprentice of his; Temperance the Steward; Contentation his
Mate; truth the Purser; thankfulness the Pursers mate; Reformation the
Boatswain; The 4 humors, Sanguin, Choler, etc. are the Quarter masters;
Christian vigilance undertakes to supply the office of Starbord and Larborde
watch; Memory is Clerk of the Check; Assurance the Corporal; the Armor
Innocence; the Mariners Angels; Schismatickes are searchers sent aboard; my
understanding as Master Gunner culls out from those two Budgecaskes of the New
and old Testament cerraine threats and promises which is my only powder and
Shot; and with the assistance of the Gunners mate, holy anger against sin,
charge my tongue, which like to a piece of Ordnance shootes them to the shame
and overthrow of my spiritual Adversaries.

My Noble Passengers are Joy in the holy Ghost and the peace of Conscience,
whose retinue are divine graces; my ignoble or rather mutinous passengers are
wordly cogitations and vain delights, which are more than a good many; besides
some that are arrant thieves and traitors, namely pride, envy, prejudice* but
all these i will bid farewell when I come to my journeis end, though I would but
cannot before.

Heaven is my Country, where I am registered in the Book of life; my King is
Jehovah; my tribute Almesdeeds; they which gather it are the poor; Love is my
Countries badge, my language is holy conference; my fellow companions are the
Saints.

I am poor in performances, yet rich in Gods acceptance; The foundation of
all my good, is Gods free Election; I became bound into the Corporation of the
Church to serve him in my baptism; I was enrolled at the time when he first
called me: my freedom is Justification, it was purchased with the blood of
Christ, my evidence is the earnest of his spirit; my privileges are his
sanctifying Graces; my Crown (reserved for me on high) is Glorification.

My Maker and Owner is God, who built me by his Word which is Christ, of earth
which was the material: he fraught it with the essence of my soul which is
the Treasure; and has set me to sail in the sea of this world, till I attain
to the port of death, which lets the terrestrial part into the harbor of
the grave, and the celestial into the kingdom of heaven; in which voyage
conveniencie of estate is as sea-roome; good affections serve as a tide, and
prayer as a a prosperous gale a wind to help forward.

But innumerable are the Impediments and perils; for here I meet with the
proffers of unlawful gain, and sensual delights as so many Sirens; the
baits of prosperity (as high banks) on the right hand or weathershore, and
there with evil suggestions, and crabbed adversity (as Rocks) on the left
hand or Lee-shore ready to split me; the fear of hell like quickesands
threaten to swallow me; Original sin like weeds clog me, and actual
transgressions like so many Barnacles hang about me, yea every sin I commit
springs a new leake; my senses are as so many storms of rain, hail and snow
to sink me; lewd affections are roaring billows and waves; selfe-confidence
or to rely upon any thing but divine assistance, is to lose the bolt-sprit;
Restitution is heaving goods over board to save the ship; Melancholy, is want
of freshwater; the scoffs of Atheists and contempt of religion in all places,
is a notable becalming; the lewd lives and evil examples of the most a
contagious air; Idleness furs it, and is a shrewd decay both of Hull and
Tackling. Moreover sailing along and keeping watch (for they that are Christ's
friends you know must look for all they meet to be their enemies) we no
sooner look up but presently we ken a man of war, and then we must be for
war too, and provide for a skirmish.

Now the Gallyon that has our Pinnace in chase, and always watches for
advantages to surprise it, is the Piracy of hell, the synagogue of Satan; her
freight is Temptations and persecutions, with all the Engines of mischief; in
which the Devil is Master; m^lice the Masters mate; cruelty the Captain;
Murder the Cook; Flattery the Calker; profaneness a quarter master; riot the
Steward; never content his mate; pride the Cockeson; superstition the Preacher;
hypocrisy the Boatswain; covetousnes the Purser; lust the Swabber; fury the
Gunner; presumption the Corporal; sedition the Trumpeter; drunkenness the
Drummer; vices are the sails; custom the Maine-mast; Example of the multitude
the Foremast; Lusts and passions the Cables; blindness of mind the Rudder;
hardness of heart the helm; the wisdom of the flesh the Card; the mystery
of iniquity the Compass; the five senses, or if you will scoffing Atheists,
profane fowle-mouthed drunkards, and all the rabble of hell are the Mariners;
lewd affections the Passengers; little conscience the Load-starre, she has two
Tire of great Ordnance planted in her, heresy and irreligion (being either for
a false God or none) Oaths blasphemy and curses are the powder and shot, which
they spit against all that worship the Lamb, or fight under the ensign of
faith; her armor is carnal security; the Flag in her top, is infidelity, the
motto (There is no God but Gain) Her ballast which keeps her upright, is
ignorance; most of her tackling she has from Rome, and Amsterdam; Antichrist as
Pilot, steares her in such a course that she goes on swiftly, proudly,
securely, scorning and scoffing ( Sennacharib like) to hear that any Lord
should deliver this poor pinnace out of her hands; yet in the sequel this
silly Pinke having the insurance of Gods omnipresence, finds not only succor
from the Stock of the Churches prayers, which like another Merchant man comes
in to the rescue, but likewise that Gods Almighty power and providence is near
at hand as a strong Castle of defense to free her, whereby she escapes even as
a bird out of the snare of the hunter, to praise the Lord, who has not given
her as a pray unto their teeth, that would have swallowed up all quick, but
delivered her from such swelling waters, floods of affliction, and streams of
persecution, as else had gone over her, and even drowned her soul, as it is
Psalm 124, while this great Gallion (though, it seem like that Invincible
Armado) flies, and (having no Anchor) when the storms of Gods wrath arise,
down she sinkes to desperation, and perishes in the bottomless pit or
burning lake of fire and brimstone, where we will leave her to receive a just
recompense of reward.
