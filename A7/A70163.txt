Printed for Sir Balthazar Gerbier Kyt Douvilly. Anno 1660.

To the KING of Great Britanne.
May it please your Sacred Mayesty.
AS all the World takes a respect full notice of your Sacred Majesty's most
gracious care for the advancement of his Loyal subjects good, and itt would
be a horride president that in the number of those whose zeal is awakonned by
so great and matchless example, one should be found neglect full in his
duty, not immitating those who sail not to set their little pockett
watches by the grand Dyall of the Sun, (parfaict in its coursse and splendour)
I have most devoutly persuaded my self that the following Summary Description
(and Advertissement) ought to be made public, to the end all men (desirous
to improve themselves by Plantations) might be well informed on what certainty
thy could engage.

And as your Sacred Majesty's subjects have a great experience in Plantations,
yett most of them to have bestowed much time, labor, and cost on Plantations
in the Charibdien Eylands, butt have not been so well informed of better
progresses to be made under the best clyme of the firm Land on the Coast of
America, and may draw benefitt of relations grounded on certanty: I have
therefore thought it my duty to putt forth the said Sommary Description, as a
mark of the Loyal Zeal, and dependency of

Your Sacred Majesty's Most humble, most obedient, most Loyal Zealous
naturallized subject and Servant B. GERBIER Douvily.

A Sommary DESCRIPTION, Manifesting that greater Profits are to be done in the
hott then in the could parts off the Coast off AMERICA: And how much the public
good is concerned therein Referring to the annexed ADVERTISSEMENT, For men
inclined to Plantations.
AN Advertissement for men inclined to Plantations manifesting that greater
profits are to be done in the hott then in the could parts off the Coast off
America, (and which was printed at Rotterdam as appears by the annexed) has
promissed this Summary Description / and the which was conceaved fit to be
published with all due and zealous respects unto his Sacred Majesty, as at so
great incomparable an example (of his most extraordinary gracious care for the
public good) all men are obliged to be awakened / and to offer (according
unto their tallent whatsoever may be off use: And should not all men do so?
then must every one be an open enemy to himself / as also onworthy that a
Souverayne should (as to say) fatigate himself in seeking and pracktysing all
advantages / whereby benefits may be procured unto them / which has so
manifestly appeared as forrayne nations have not only admired his gracious
bounty in the behalffe off his Loyal subjects, butt moved some to offer
likewise certain expedients. Whereby his service and the good off his subjects
may be much advanced.

The said being not only a manifest truth concerning forrayne Nations in
Europe, but a most remarcable one in the Inhabitants off the coast off America,
who about the time of his Sacred Majestys, returning into England) when no
Courriers nor weeckly Intelligencers could bring that happy neewes their)
expressed their ressentments / which may well deserve to be taken / notice off
/ as lickewyse that thy had the tyding even in the month of May Anno 1660.
which the heavens must have brought unto them.

The said wild (in name but nor wild in nature for that thy are off a most
mild disposition) said that thy could not endure those men who do not love
their Anna Cajoury (which is to say king or Scheeff) butt bid wilcome all such
as are true unto him bring them / refrechments off Annasses. And other fruits
/ as also Wild dear, fish, and foul, besides all what thy could find in
those parts which thy do inhabit.

And as thy know that number off them are on the Hands of Barbados / S.
Christosters / as also on the same Coast of America as at Sarename, thy (for as
much their capacity makes them discuss matters) do not a little wonder how
such as leave the cold clyme in Eurorope will transporte themselves to the cold
parts of America, and not prefer the hot where it never winters / and no fire
needs to be made but to boil their fish and Crabs / and to cost wild
dear and foul.

That then the love off a Christian (for the advancement of the public good)
may not be said to be more could then the frozen Northeren clyme / nor the
innocent Charibdiens reproache unto such a one (who thy have not failed to
visitte and to impart unto him what the hot parts off America is capable off)
his want off charity. This Summary Description must defend / and most
seasonnably free from desadvantagious explications on the fresh return off a
notable Equipage which in the year 1659. has been sent from Amsterdam to the
Coast of America, and that likewise no men (sudued with common Sense) may have
any just cause to^ doubt of the truth that this Description is well grounded /
it has seemed necessary to hold forth the cause of the re in facta return of
that Equipage; and wy the men who were sent to that much more beneficial hot
part off America thou the cold did not settle their / which though it should
require every ample Description has been thought fit to contract in as
seemlynes as possibly may be / since it is but to serve as replaye unto the
particular Quaeritur which may be made concerning the cause of such return;
yet must the said description be taken from the spring off the evil / the
which proceeded from a hellish ambition off certain Thrusties sent whith the
before said Equipage, and who before their departure from Texell conbyned
against the cheeff Commandor and Patron off an intended Colonie to be settled
on the Coast off America. To make them selves masters, so thy could dispocesse
him, or distroy his persson and his familly, that their might remain no
pretenders to the Land which he was to pocesse.

Which conbination being discovred to the said chief Commandor Sir Balthazar
Gerber, authorized by special commission off the Lords Estates general off
the united Provinces / and off the West-Indian Company / obliged him (by the
prime Law of selffe preservation, to defend him selffe (as much possibly he
could against such a damnable plot / which never oughst to have been expected
from rationals / nor from men to whom he was a benefactor / and who would
not have been admitted without his consent).

Yet so far had the spirrit off Diluzion charmed them as forgetting God / and
the property off Human Souls / thy only represented to them selves (as the
Phabulous Midas) tot choke them selves with Gold and Silver / and to run
head long to those parts were precious things are said to be had; as also to
meet with cheefs off famillies who might sheew them the way to el Dorado, and
Manua.

Thy thought on nothing elsse save to destroy their cheeff Commandor / and his
familly / as Otto Keye the prime leader who could not so much as dissimule his
murdering inclination / when as he vented (before his departure from Texel)
That he would make short work with the Commandor, and his familly; and (being
once set on firm ground in America) either get a golden fleece, or a rope
about his neck) that he would theirefore copulate with one off the cheef
Indian his Daughter, and then kill him, to make him selffe master off all. So
as killing and murdering was the mayn delight and scope off this worsse then
Barbarian disposition / as that off his choice fellow trustees.

In fine / so as the evili begun it was pursued; and never ceased until
after the arrival of the Equipage on the Coast of America.

The Equipage did consist off three good Vessels / well provided with all
necessaryes / as Victuals / Ammunition / Cargazoen / to Traffic with:
materials / Ingredients to purge myneralls Toels to work with / and to manuer
the Land; One Rijnier Van Buren the Commissary off the Magazyn (a notable
hellish monopollist) agitating (as inpudently and Inprudently said) according
unto his secret instructions received before his departure from Amsterdam to
combyne against the said Commandor resolved as Well as the others after having
made use off several stratagemes. to make an end off the said Commandor and
off his harmless familly / remitting as his other fellow trustees the
prosecution off the establishing off the Colonie / and all the main for the
which the Equipage was sent until thy should have performed their bluddy
work which thy compassed in part; as is particulaly mentionned in the
afforesaid annexed advertissement; Whereby the Quaeritur concerning the
reinfacta return of the Equipagie is answered / and may well serve for an
argument that the sand Sir Balthazar Gerber could never have done anny good
with such men / who as thy minded but his extirpation / never suffered him
after the arrival off the Equipagie on the Coast off America to settle the
intended Colonie / nor to repair in persson n'ay not so much as to enquire
after all such things where unto the Equipagie was set forth / for thy thought
to have gotten outt off him all what soever thy were to purchasse in America
and were confident enouff that their was a fleece to be had / butt thy would
putt it into their particular sack / for thy were not Ignorant that all the
world has spoken off El Dorado, and Manva, as credible men have published that
Don Diego d'Ordas, Capitayn to Cortez, (who conquered Mexico) did discover
richesses in the King dome off Guaiana, as Gaspar de Sylva, and Jean Gonzales
did relate Wondrous things off that continent / so have thy been sought by
Philip d'Uren, Pedro de Lympias, Geronimo d'Ortal, Ximenes, the brother off
Ximena de Guesida, Pedro d'Ossima and the monek Sala who braught cast golden
Aigles from thence

Therefore the said combinators kneew well also / that it was said that when the
Duke of Buckingham was attending the Prince of great Britane at Madrid, one
Don Anthonio Hennin, had (by Sir Balthazar Gerbeer, been examined / and
Introduced to the said Duke, that the said Don Hennin produced the mynerall /
which he had braught from America, and that the said mynerall did render a
verry rich quantity off gold Thy kneew also (especially Otto Keye who had been
present at Delff when by the appointement off that Magistrate a proefe was made
off the mynerall) That itt did render gold / and that it was off the same which
in the year 1656 (in a Schip called the Liefde) was braught from the coast
off America.

But so great theere unjust scope was as to mind naught butt what might
contribute to the rendering off them sole pocessors off all / and suffer
themselves to be persuaded to make use off anny falcehoods / whereby thy might
disguise their bluddy dessyne / and sent horride relations to their confident
Patrons / among whom their is one who was not ashamed to boaste to have said
to a Souverayne Prince that Sir Balthazar Gerber did not agree with their
Trustees: which if he had done by yielding to their intent (which was to
distroy him and his Innocent familly) had been a most barbarous resolution in
him / and a shameful sign off weaknisse / As would at present argue no less
incensibillity in him in casse he should not (as a second Colomba) aquaint men
capable off truth off the apparent good which may be done in the hott parts
off the American coast / and wherefore this Sommary description is putt forth /
where off the particular an notations must be on this Principle / That the
profits to be done in the hott parts off America are incomparably more then
those which men inprudently seek in the cold, Which to prove on certain
grounds it will be best first to fix on a calculation concerning the charges
which men who transporte them selves toward America must be at / and
therefore to specify a particular some off money / which some have put forth on
like occasion / As for example / that men who had bestowed one hundred and
seventy nine pounds / for their necessary expenses for their transportation /
and the preparing off fit grounds in the cold part off America, had not (at the
end off a years turmoyle and Labor) advanced a bove three pound / which
should seem to be almost Incredible.

But that this truth may plainly appear the following calculation may serve
for the manifestation off the same.

First, a man must for transportation and food for him selffe; his Wife, two
Servants, children, and also for transportation off his household - stuffpay at
the least ff 52 - 0 - 0 For one Child. ff 1 - 4 - 0 For the first years
maintenance for food clothis and light for him selffe, his Wife child and two
Servants at the least 20 Sc. per Week, which is per anum. ff 52 - 0 - 0 For
the heyer off two laborers for a year ff 12 - 0 - 0 For two Kowes ff 24 - 0 -
0 For Scedes ff 4 - 0 - 0 For a Cart and Plowe ff 6 - 0 - 0 For two beds,
cheeres and coverleds ff 5 - 0 - 0 For Schuvels, Spades, Axes, Hatchets,
Pickakes, and other tools (necessary to the manvering off Lands) ff 18 - 0 - 0
For the Building off a housse, for the Carpenter, with a man, daily wagers and
Victuals ff 6 - 0 - 0 For the Iron work necessary to the house ff 9 - 0 - 0
For all Kind off necessary household stuff, as Kettels, Pots, Disshes, and
Pannes ff 12 - 0 - 0 179 - 4 - 0

And is to be considered / that before anny profit can be had In such a cold
clyme (from Lands that must be prepared) two years Will Be spent at the Least;
for that those Lands (as Well as others) must be cleared from the Woods Which
thy do bear / the roets and stomps Well removed.

That one man cannott clear / prepare nor mannuer (during the time off a
year) more then ten Akers of ground / consisting off six thousand Rods.

So as a man must Weekly clear / prepare and manuer about one hundred and
fifty Rods / and / consequently daily ^ynthien Rods.

And who daily shall clear such a parcel off ground both off the Wood /
roets / and stomps / must labor verry hard as Slaves do.

Yett Were it so that in a years time a man could Infalibly prepare so much
ground to make it fit for the Plowe. And that he could reap some benefit
there on in the second Year / yet must he from those ten Akers reserve two
for hay / and grass / for two horses / and two kowes / Which scarcely Wilbee
fedd / by reason off the difference off Lands neewly made / and those Which are
troughly and fully groune.

So is it necessary to keep two Akers of ground for grass for the kowes / and
the two horses /

So as off the ten Akers remaynes six to sow / where of three may be sown
with Wheat; one off the three others with Rye; the two other remaining with
Barley / Oats / Pease / and Beans / where off the Rye (growing upon one off
the Akers) will be necessary for the maintenance off the familly / since an
Aker off good ground (which can be sown with one sack of Rye) does noth
produce above sixteen sacks / which a familly (consisting off a man / woman /
two strong laborers and children) Will need for a years time; As lickwyse the
same familly shall need the production off the two other Akers off ground /
for housekeeping / the Barley for Bear / Pease / and Beans / for Salt Porc /
and the Oats for Horses.

The groathe off the remaining three Akers being reserved allone for the
making good off the expenses and the clering off debts made;

But there cannot be gotten from the said three Akers above fifty four sacks
off Corn.

Which (when all is considered) cannot yield more then the number off people
their can set aprisse thereon / no advantage being to be expected by
transportation off Corn to other parts off the World / which needs not to send
for Corn in America.

So as when all what can be done in the could clyme off America. (Being put
together at the best) will argue it to be the worst which (men who seek to
make a fortune) can be pitched upon in consideration off the advantages too
be made in the hott clyme off that continent.

It will be verry easy to all rationalls to grant that the said hott clyme
ought to be preferred before the could / where the ground bears all the year
long / because it never whiters their / grapes culd all the year long from
the Stallee; as all other fruits. Cattle producing abondantly; no such cost
necessary as cloathe clothing (and other chargeable defense) against the
feercenisse off Winter season / and no such indisposition tormentig the boddyes
of men as occasionned by could mists / piercing Winds / Hayles / Snow / and
hard frosts / etc.

All which is found to be true / and not needing other tongues to speak it /
nor pens to write it / then those off that people inhabitting the Charibdis
Eylands / as likewise Sarenamme, and Cajana, on the Coast of the firm Land off
America; where (as is mentioned in the before said annexed advertissemeut for
men inclined to Plantations there) a most profitable settlement can be made /
and by the Service of Slaves (who need no cloathis against the could / nor
bedding / nor anny other such chargeable accommodations as a could Clyme does
require; from which hott clyme ready returns of precious things can be made
without the loss off two years time / as in the could clyme;

Were no such cost must be bestowed for the buylding off houses for men / nor
Stables and chargeable barrins for the placing off Cattle; for as the
inhabitants (called the wild thoug verry tame good people) will in feew days
make a convenient habitation for one Axe, hatchet, and some knyffs, the Cattle
lives all the year long in the open air.

The Slaves need no clothis / and being once baught and paid are during all
their lyffe time workmen Without Wagers; when by one day free to themselves in
the Week thy get their one Living / and who do more Work (at there ease)
then two Christians can perform / both in the manuering off the ground / and
in digging off mines.

Nor is in the hot parts of America in the beginning off Plantations much
Cattle necessary for houskeeping / and the Laboring of grounds / the great
abundance off fruit considered: off fish / foul / and Will be Dear / which
all the year long is to be had their / Nor need habitants furnish their
houses with such chargeable household stuff as thy must necessarily have in the
could parts / nor bedding / nor Scheetes / for that in the hot parts a Hamack
(to be had for one hatchet) is the best bed that can be made usse off / both
for the night / and for a fresh repose in the day time /

The difference off the profits which are to be done on the commodityes which
can be gotten from the said hot parts (and those which are gotten in the
could) being as great as the difference off the worth off them is / and were
of anny understanding person can make the estimate / especially such men who
know what distinction their is to be made between precious things / or of
great exteeme / and ordinary commodityes / As the precious to be had in the
Hott parts of America are Gould, Silver, Stonnes, of great vallue, precious
Woods, for all kind of rare works, for Dye, Colors, as Orian, Rocous for
scarlet dye, and the Ultermarin, precious Balms, Armadac, Bolus, Cassia, rare
Gumes as Lemnae; sennement, which has the Vigor off Cloves, bessydes Honey,
clear as Crystal, and Wax, as their has been found store off Nutmegs with
Mace about them; which though some men gathered during the rayny months, (that
thy where as unrype Aprikoks fallen youngh to the ground) have taken to be but
Wild / yet in all appearance (by reason of their shape / color / inward
veins / and their taste) may (being full grown and parfaict ripe) prove to
be right / and of great concernment.

The soul (by reason off the degrees onder the which it Lyith / and the rain
which falls in the Season which in Europe is the winter / and yet in America
continual warm days) bears continual / without Intermition / and in such a
quantity as Jean Claasen Langendijck the Commandor in Cajana (five degrees by
North the Line Equinoctial) both assure / that certain part off his most
rocky grounds which had been cleared to have within sirmonts time after (for
want off continual trimming off the same) been as high over groune again as
other part off Lands would not have been in six Years / the which ground Sir
Balthazar Gerbeere and his familly has seen; and otherwise would have douted
off the report.

The Planters lykwise did relate that Sugar reeds have been found there as
thick as a man's arm / and that their cannot be better ground in the World
for Sugar / Indigo / Cotton / Tobaca / and all kind off Seeds.

On which infalible principle all men (desirous to Improve them selves by
plantations) may take there Levells / and be justly moved to prefer the Hot
clyme off America before the could / and that Without scrupule off making use
off Slaves by reason off an opinion entertained by some / that it is not
Christian-lycke to use rational creatures in that quallity off Slavery / when
as the custom Was permitted in the old Testament, the neew forbids it not,
and the Imperial Laws suffer the use off them; because Slaves bought in
several parts off Africa (where thy will sell them selves again / though by
the death off their masters thy are become free) live their in the Slavery
off the Divill, but by their transportation among Christians are in the first
place (by education and good example) changed as from brutes / into
rationnalls / and in the second by a custom (which must work upon them /
except God be pleased to suffer his extraordinary Mercy to say hold on their
Souls) braught co call upon his name / by faith in Christ Jesus, for the Which
their Slavish condition proves to them a verry great bliss / since otherwise
thy (as experience has manifested but to often) returning unto their one /
will likewise as Dogs return to their Vomit; besides Which reason (to serve
against nisse and over scrupulous men) it may well be said that theere is a
great mistake in manny who do Imagine that the keeping off Blacks in that
manner be a rasse more hard then that off Servants who all their Lyffe long
like in servitude / and who do as much work (according unto the constitution
off their boddies) as anny off the Blacks, called Slaves / who do not as the
Holland mades Scour and wach on the Sabath Day) yet do not the Holland madens
fair on the delicatnesses which the hot parts of the world do afforde / and
may be said that Anthonius (at the Table off Cleopatra) had not better; no
Kings in Europe tasting to Annas, the fruit which King Jeames (off blessed
memory) said the Wild were on worthy off /

So all men inclyned to Plantations (by the best profits to be done with the
necessary husbandry (which in matter of Inprovement / by negotiation / and by
manuering off grounds is a capital point) may (if thy please) also reflect on
the following calculation / Whereby it appears / With how much less charge a
Planter may fit and transporte Sim selffe to the hot parts off America, then to
the could) Where off an estimate is set in the beginning off this sommary
description / vir.

If a familly (consisting off husbond / Wyff and Children) shall resolve to
transporte it selffe to America, as the Patrons of a Company Wilbe^ contented
to bear the charges / to receave them a gain out of the fruits of the
grounds / which the Planters can (by a feew things taken allong with them
(before their departure) fijnde wherewith to make good those charges at an
easy ratte / the which cannot be done in the could parts of America, I
parceell of knyves (worth three pence a piece) some Axes / hatchets / Sizars /
Razers; Glass beads / and old coursse Linen will avayle / them / as is
mentionned in the aforesaid printed advertissement / to get food / both of
flesh / fish / and foul / and drink in abondance / as lickwyse many things
whereon thy will make great profitt / Parets / Aeps / Monckis / Hamacks / and
several other things / besides the honny / Balms / Cummes / and Colors /
which the Indians will bring unto them.

And as thy shall not pay for the transportation of their servants / so thy
shall not need to provide before hand to the nurrissement of such Slaves as
thy would Employ and shall be delivered unto them on the place / save but for
eight months time / until the unprepared ground shall have been made fit / and
produce farinne / whereof bread is made.

Their must then (in the first place) be reckonned the charges for the
Cassavy, which is a root where off the Indians do make ^^ead / and is sold by
them for a toy of beads / or a knijffe / not worth speaking of / So is their
drink ( called parnaw) as good Bier / Cawaw / and the delitious drink
called Jamany, fish / foul / and wild dear accordingly / and as is
particularly mentionned in the affore said printed advertissement.

Whereby it appear that Whoesoever leaves the could parts of Europe, to
repair to the cold of America, betters not his condition / but that those who
do go to the hot part makes as to a Land of promise / and may well serve to
Christians to conclude / that it must be very good being in Heaven, since
their is such a well being on Earth.

If therefore men should be inclyned to putt a stock of monny to gether / to
make an Improvement / wherein the public good often those of the Christian
profession is concerned / and the encreasse of Traffic in all the Charibdien
Eylands / in the which several things are requisitte / and in some of them
wanting / as the inhabittants at S. Eustaches well know / and feel; besides
others / who (out of certain respects shall be spared to publish) The
undertaking might be begun with a fashionnable Equipagie, and fit to
transporte a number of Planters, and men to work in mines, and well skild in
the extractions off myneralls: The vessels must not draw above 9. or 10. fotre
water.

The Planters must be rationalls, and not be accompanied neither with Dames
that cannot live without codlings, and rose Water, nor without to see a Cock
end a Bear by ting, nor with Holland Idolatrous mad weomen, that cannot live
without scouring, robbing, and washing on the Sabath day, nor expect trimmings
in prancking houses, with a fect of Porcelyns; But good Husiffs, that will pust
their hands to the Planting off good Sugar reeds; at the least be as God
maid them for, faithful helping hands to their husbonds in the survaying off
his workmen, and Slaves:

Thy must be persons known in their Parishes to have a good repute off a
temper to live according unto the Laws off God and men. for that otherwise it
is inpossible to make any good establissement / especially in an unhabitted
part off the World / when boistrous men shall turn more wild then the
Salvages: and (at the Damnable Example of others) harbor but murdering
thoughts / as experience speaks but to many have done; and Especially those of
Tabago know, those of other parts can tell, and those of Cajana can relate,
that the cheef Commandors have been murdered, some in their Cabin, some in the
woods, some headlong thrown in the Sea; by a rebellious generation as that of
Vijpars yest Europians / forsooth.

In Equipage (well manned and well provided) may take for the fittest time of
departure the beginning of the month of march / or the latter end of it / at
furthist) to arrive (in fit season) on the coast of America after the rayny
months may be past / which commonly is at the end off may.

The Equipagie must be a companyed with a bark built at the Bragantyne
fashion: forty footelong / thirteen foot wide / and covered / a convenient
Cabin a last / the bark drawing but 3 or 4 foot water / to serve on the
Rivers / and may be provydes with two brass pieces of ordinance / the said

and Surgery drugs, and Ingredients. a trumpetter to call the people to assemble
/ and for other necessary Warnings.
Finally / it will be very easy for Patrons of such a Plantation to Judge that
thy may do good profits for their disbursement on such a dessyne in the a
foresaid hot parts of America, and that thy will have great reason to prefer
them before other ordinary ways to profit by / since thy well know what small
rents Lands do yield / to what Love an Ebb traffic is in this age / and how
by reason of the great number off men (who profess a trade) every trades man
is almost reduced to a kind of Slavery / for that men must work from break
of day until late in the night / as cohabitants in streets where hard trades
are practiced can witness the same / and are early and late a wakned by the
noise / when as all Patrons of Plantations may in the aforesaid hot parts of
America from Lands which thy need not to buy / nor to fight for (but only
settle people on them as thy are of a vast extent) make their revenue the
greater / and by the worth of what thy will produce get more then the treble /
nay the quadruple cent per Cent for the stock thy shall pust forth.

Therefore at it is a providence to Employ a stock of money on several things
(as to put marchandises in different Vessels) So lords / gentlemen / merchants
and others may find it to be good husbondry to bestow some part of what thy
can lay assyde to the trial of this most apparent good / and think that a
brase of hundred pounds less spent in sports / feastings / and other
unnecessaryes (as Tulips and Tockell Schells) would incensibly serve for this
well promissing dessyn / and answer the prudence beseeming good Commenwealths
men / and the care of Fathers of famillies / to leave an incessant growing
benefit for their posteritye / more then by other expedients thy can promise
to them selves; As likewise not only to encreasse traffic to the people which
has settled it selffe on the Charibdes Eylands but to become a support and
main defense to them / against Powers) who (as the Portugises envaded
Brazill) might in time set upon them / and depryve them of all the expectation
of their many years endeaviours.

FINIS.
ADVERTISSEMENT For men inclyned to PLANTASIONS IN AMERICA.

At ROTTERDAM, Printed by Henry Goddaeus, Book Printer at the red Bridge / In
the Book Printing. ANNO 1660.

ADVERTISSEMENT.
AS men who do resolve to leave their natural Country to apply them selves
to Plantations must have for their maine Scope either the public or their
particular interest / which thy must promote by right and most convenient
means / without which it otherwise would be impossible to compass the same.

So men whom do leave a could Country transporting themselves far from
thence / to plant in as could a clyme into annother part of the World (as that
wherein thy were borne and bred) cannott Improve themselves by Plantations / as
thy might well in a more hott region / where the ground yelds frinte and grothe
all the year long / according as credible travelers do report; and as thy
prove how much the greater profits can be made on the Charibdis Eyslands (as
Tobago Granada / Mardeloupe. S. Eustache / Lucie / Martinique / Christoffers /
and Barbados / etc. (seated under a warm degree) then in Virginia / Eskeve /
Niew Engeland / etc. So it is most certain that the firm Land on the coast of
America (from One until 9. and ten degrees by Nord the line) is to be
preferred before the Eylands; for as that coast is not subject to Hieracans /
(as the Eylands are) it is most fruitful / and has many convenient Diverse for
Plantations; and in several parts inhabitants (though very fiew in number) of
very good natuere

By the late Surwey which has been made of the coast of America / experience
tells that from one until 9. and ten degrees by Nord the Line / their are
Lands where on store of People could be settled / and that the grounds are most
fit for Sugar / Tobacco / Indigo / Cotton / and all Seeds of Fruits soever /
Store of wild Boares Deares and Rabits to be had their; as all kind of good
fowls / the Seas and Rivers abounding in store of great / fatt / and wholesome
fish / besides an infinite number of Tortuses / which is a wholesome food; as
likewise Seakowes / which the natifs (called the wild) are willing to take /
and do serve for those that will either transporte the same to the Eylands or
feed on them; as thy may be had for so small a thing as is almost incredible
to wit a Cortlis (where on 20 men may plentiously feed a whole day / for an
Irron hatchet / and 2 pennyworth off glass beads; The Sea-kow (waying four a
five hundred pound) for a couple off Axes / and one hatchet / with some small
beads; twinty ^ thirty pots of drink (called Pernaw as good as any bear) for
one knijf with a wihtt bone handle / worth two pence and halve / wild dear /
fish / fruit / and foul according unto that ratte; So as besides the feeding
there with number of men their can be a very profitable trade settled / and
driven with the aforesaid Sea-Cowes / and Tortuses; thy being salted / and
transported to the Enlands / where for one pound of that salted fish two a
three pound of Tobaco may behad; and as for a Hamoc (which costs butt one
hatchet worth two schillings) twenty schillings man be gotten.

And as the Lands on the main continent are more fruitful then the Eylands
and wholesome / so are thy of a large extent; and do bear in certain parts
costly woods for diverse works / and dyinge / all kind off excellent gummes /
as Lemnae; Balms / Rocoux (which is a Scharlat dye) and other colors /
Armadac / Senniment-Clove / nutmeg / and Mace / as their is Honny as clear as
Crystal / and ware; So is their most certainly mines of Silver / and Gold /
where of proofs have been made / and certain cheefs of the Charibdiens have
shuen several patterns / as also off several woods / Colors / gummes / and
other hings off worth to be had their / some off these natiffs also knowing in
what parts and in what Rivers precious / Stones are to be found / as likwyse
with what nations Must be treated for the same / so men will (and can) live
without giving offense on the subject of their Wives and Daughters.

The several parts which can be inhabited by Planters and that are free (nor
needing armed men to take pocession off them) have good Rivers / some large
Bays / affording number of Sea-kowes; so their Strands Store of Tortuses.

Those who would plant on Rivers which end with watter falls must have small
flatt bottom boats / as Indian Canoos; to hayle them from one water fall to
the next River over Land / to get upp deep into the main Land; carry allong
store of victuals / and drink / of Strange water / fear the want there off
make them loose their labor / and hop-full expectation; as happened to
several french and others / woe did seek for el Dorado / and Manva / and said
to have come shortt butt one days Journey of Hills that prommissed wonder full
Tresors; Not to be sauht in an imaginary region / butt to be found on that
continet by Perssons who are suffered to apply their best Endeaviours to the
same / and who are not Traitorously (and murdorously) used as Sir Balthazar
Gerbeer has been in the year 1660. on the 7. day off May / when after his
arrival on the aforesaid Coast of America / and that he had gained on the
affections off certain cheef of the Charibdis (who braught unto him several
paterns of the things before mentioned / and as wyett in his pocession;
contracted frenshipp with him by their grab Tie of Ponnary) was by Trusties
(send along from Holland) not only set upon / butt alsoo the perssons off
his Wyff and Daughters; those unnatural men (worse then Heathens pocest with
evil Spirrits) their horride dessyne being as then to murder an Innocent
harmless familly / to the end that their might not remain one a life of the
familly who could pretend right in those parts / in consequence off a grant
which the said Sir Balthazar Gerber (in a time that his Majesty of great
Bittane nor none of his party was in casse to coutenance a Plantation in that
part off the World where off the late Duke of Buckingham during his being at
Madrid in the year 1623. got Notice.) had received from the Lords Estates
general of the unyted Provinces / and from the West Indian Compagny.

To which bluddy dessyne (of the murderers which cost the life off one off the
said Sir Balthazar Gerbeers Daughters to wit Catharin, the said murderers
trustees were (as has been since discovered) secretly instructed / by a
particular ring-leder (even from the beginning of the voyage from Holland) to
set upon the Proprietary / as the main grand scope of men who would betray
their oune fathers / and brothers / to attain to the Mamon of the World.

Truth having manifested the same on this particular casse / and that thy made
no scruple to exercisse any open Violence / which thy were not ashamed to putt
in practice by hailing Sir Balthazar Gerbeer (and the remnant of his family)
violently from the aforesaid Coast / to the end the abetters off the pryme
Trustye might remain as independents / and send to the place a broede off
their own Tribe; and therefore commended highly that prime thrustie for his
doings; Necessity to preserve their interest it so requiring (said they) and
being not as hamed to argue that their said Interest had been in great
dangiour in casse Sir Balthazar Gerbeer should have knouwnen that the king off
great Brittanne was restorred to his right / for that ten he would have
advertised the English nation (the best off all others aquanited with
Plantations) off the good which was to be done on the Coast of America / and
how thy might have enlarged the Colonie of the English at Sarenamme.

And therefore (say they) their prime thrusty to have deserved great applause
for all the violence committed against Sir Balthazar Gerbers persson; and they
to have had great causse to drive him to a non plus / after his return to
Amsterdam; hinder him (if possibly thy could) from departing from Holland; to
remaayne in pocession of his papers / Original Evidences against the
murderers; and producing any witnesses against them / finally to remain master
of his graunts / and ^^troys / which thy forced from him by an outrageous
apprehention of his persson with violation off their contracts; and yett
pretending that the infraction of them and the injurious proceeding against the
said Sir Balthazar Gerbers persson was without knowledge off the whole
association / and only hammered by two or three off their members / in number
above thirty two / and pretending (as these two or three at the most said)
only to satisfy their particular curiosity with the view off his papers / and
off the graunts / Swearing and vouwing that none off all those off the Company
had the least thought off the World ever any more to look after Gould nor
Silver on the American coast / nor to send theither / when as to the contrary /
thy being no soever in pocession off all Sir Balthazar Gerbers Evidences (nay
of papers which did not concern that dessyne and as yett by them shame fully
and unjustly detayned) Butt thy immediately caused the ship called the Ecudracht
to be prepared / and retained as many of the men as might fit their turn /
which thy have appointed to return to the place from whence Sir Balthazar
Gerber and his familly was so violently hayled; and have ordered their said
brood to spend a year or two in a general Search throughout all those
Territories / for all what is to be gotten their.

But hou such men so unjustly proceeding may speed God (whose arm reatcheth
further then the ends off this visible World) knowith; and time will Manifest /
As this may serve to althose that are curious to know sommarily the truth of
this casse; and to onderstand on what conditions which might engage on such a
good dessyne / and houw Planters may inprove them selves in those parts; as
namly. All Planters may pocesse gratis in propriety so much Land as they can
mannuer, with an entire freedom to dispose thereof, either by will, deed,
Covenant or Contract, all Planters be free off Customs, rights, or duties,
during the thime of ten years; have slaves for fifthien pound a piece, pay
them either in reddy monny or with the commodities off thire own plantations,
taking the time of five years for the same. Freely enjoy all such mines off
Salpeter, Irron, Copper, Silver, Gould, Crystal, Precious, Stonnes; Marble, as
Planters may find within their allotted Lands; paying for them after the five
years a certain duty offten in the hundred, fisshing, hunting, and cutting
off wood for building and fire free; and enjoy liberty off Consience: be
transported to the place within the time off two months, the winds being
prosperous, and make choisse off their habitations, either near the Bays or
Rivers where the Sea-Cowes are in great abundance, or lower, toward Cap
Orannie; or in the River Wi^poca, wherein ships (drawing deep ten foot water)
may well ride at an A^ker, as in that off Apperwake (4 degrees by North the
Line) for that the said River off Apper, wake is in its entrance (at half Ebb)
fourtein foot deep, and has 3. 4. and 5. fadoms wator until 14. dutch
leagues up the River; 50. has the River on the east side in the River
Apperwake, and good Lands, some 6 or 7 mysles high: WIA between 4 and 5
degrees (and syding on the Eyland Cajany) a goodly River, Wherein Ships (that
draw 12 foot) may enter and ride safely; and is deep 4. 5. a 6 fadoms. the
Land (two mysles from the Sea) a most fruitful Soill; so is Cunanama and
Tamary by Nord Cajany, toward Sarenamme.

What profits such Planters (that have somewhat to bestow on ares / hatchets /
glass beads / and coursse Linen for the inhabitans / to wit / certain
Charibdiens who frequent those Rivers with their Canoos) may do is plainly
expressed in this Advertissement.

Wat profit a company may do (without to great charges) is lykwijse
demonstrated / for as a quantity, off Salt taken from the Eylands may serve to
salt Sea-Cowes, and Tortuses, to send to the Charribdis Eylands; as likweyse a
Chargarsoen off Beeff, Porc; Oil, Sac. strong waters, stuffs, and Linen Coers
and other. will quitt all the charges for the transportation, and settling off
the Planters. so the setting men at work on the mykes / gathering of all
things off profit / and making sarch through those parts / according unto the
contents off this advertissement / and the secret information which the author
had long sincs / which as he intend it for the public good / so may all men
(desirous to improve them selves that way) be further satisfied on what their
Interests may require concerning the same; by making their adresses unto him.

And See by the following Lines / what just cause the author has had (making
mention of the perfidious proceeding of men against his persson and familly) to
point so particularly (as he does) at some off them / since thy have been so
maliciously Inpudent as to vent a woreld off falce hoods concerning his
proceeding / and to expound the best care he could apply for the furthering off
the dessyne in an ill perversse and horridde sense; their trusties having been
so abominabel wicked as to pocesse all the People (that was inbarckt at
Vessel) that his dessyne was to epose them all to a Boucherie off other nations
in Europe. by cause he on the occasion off a crake which the main mast of the
prime Ship had gotten on the hight of Hitland) consulted the Captain off the
Ship where annother mast could be had / where on the Captain replied England
/ which the perfidious Trusties made use of as to argue the same to have been a
plott to run with all the Equipage into England and that after his arrival
at the Eyland Cajana 5. degrees bynord the Line (where one Jan Klaessen
Langendijck. One of the Westdian Companies Officer their received the authors
familly / and lodged the same during a necessary time off refreshment when
Denis Bringor (here to fore Captain off a French Shipp butt now a Planter on
Cajana; did speak with Sir Balthazar Gerber, as likwyse one Capitayn Tillet
did / where on (though the said perssons their conversation / with Sir
Balthazar Gerber, tended butt to advertise him of advantages to be made in
those parts / yett The blud thirsty disguised the more their resolved ficious
thereon / and traitorously abused even off the Lords States General by framing
an act off arrest of the persson of Sir Balthazar Gerber, wherein thy alleged
/ that thy where authorized to proceed as thy did / and that by the said Lord
States Order; and having in that manner surprised the capacity off Soldiers
(which thy had made drunk with strange Waters / and provided with arms and
Shot) Ledd them on the 7 of May the year 1660 (when the Commander Langendyck
was not in his Fort) to break in his House / as thy did about dinner time;
set upon the said Sir Balthazar Gerbers famully / and after thy had (...) to
kill Debora his Youngest Daughter / shot Catharina) who departed this World
that night / sho^t Mary her Sister through her right Leg / and set a pistol
on the head off Sir Balthazar, butt failed / yett would have dispatched him and
the remnant off his family had the Murderers not been prevented by the
Inhabitants off Cajany; and by the return off the Commander Langendyke, who
putt some off the murderers in the Irrons; save one Rijnier van Buren who did
act his Traiterous act so (according unto the secret instructions which he
pretendid to have had before the departure off the Equipage fron Terell) as to
gain the masters off the Ships / and the Seamen to hoyle Sir Balthazar Gerber
and his familly on board / to work outt that dessijne where by his abetters
would stripp the proprietary as aforesaid of his right; which being matter off
fact / has been (by witnesses examined upon Interrogatoires) declared upon
oath / before the Magistrate off Amsterdam / as appeared by their declaration
and their City Scale their unto applied; In conclusion it may be said that
who has had to do with such a broad may allege the words.

I have labored in vain. I have spent my strenght, for naught, and in vain;

These will (...) be had (at the weekly Intelligencer at London / as (here
after) an exact description of the profits to be done more in the warm then
in te could contries of America.
