JOHN BARFORD, HIS PETITION TO GOD, FOR KING, AND PARLIAMENT. 1645
O God, thou God of Truth, I pray thee hear
My Souls request, for all that do Thee fear.
There Is but one Truth; to which both hold and bring
All thy own People, to our sovereign King.
And He to them, and all to join in One,
To cast out factious Sects, and suffer none:
Which do Gods facred Ordinance refuse, * Math. 18.17. 2 Pet. 2. 2.

Led by their Fancies, and do Truth abuse.
All Sins foul plotters; let them be to him
As Gangrens, to the State, and to each limb.
A Body perfect, may no Member miss;
Nor Kingdom stand, that long divided is:
No more blind Bullets, Fire, nor bloody Sword,
Dissentions end, but let just Law accord:
Brute bankerupt Ruffians, and Blasphemers are
All chief rejoycers, when true Christians jarre;
That they may Plunder, Pillage, Drink, and Whore,
And mourn when Mischief they can do no more.
O GOD! thou need^st no Instrument of Hell
Fight for thy Truth, thy Breath can them expel:
Let not our Foure-score years of Joy, thus turn
To horrid Outcries, and just cause to Mourn.
But let our King be guided whole by Thee:
In Happiness to keep his Kingdoms three:
And Banish all the Jesuitick crew,
That we may sing Thee praises old and new.
Now hear sweet GOD, and settle Truth and Peace,
AMEN, I cry, Amen and never cease.
