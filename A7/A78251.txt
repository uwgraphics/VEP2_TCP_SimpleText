Printed in the Year 1647.

To the King's most excellent Majesty.
SIR,
THis poor Pamphlet I intended at first should have kissed your Royal hands
at Hampton Court, not that I conceived it a Present worthy the acceptance of a
King, but only I presumed, that Loyalty being a precious Jewel in this age,
could not be unwelcome, though presented from the meanest, and the most
unworthy of your Subjects.

Some persuasions of your true Friends first put me upon the Enterprise, and
urged to me a necessity, that it should be done out of hand, that all your
loyal Subjects might be informed in what a sad condition you lay, and how
miserably you have been abused from time to time: so that it being the
Production of but a day and a night (a little more time than Nature takes to
the making of a Mushrome,) nothing can be expected in it but plain Truth
hudled together without any artificial method or dressing. And yet I hope it
will find your Majesty out in this your happy retirement; wherein if it speak
but any tolerable sense to entertain your Majesty for an hour, and such as may
take Impression upon the hearts of your Subjects, then (though done in have) it
is well done.

I. The Case of the King in relation to the two Houses.
IF we look upon the ancient Majesty of the Kings of England for which this
our native Country has been held in as venerable an esteem, as any Kingdom in
Europe whatsoever, and consider the present despicable condition of our now
dread Sovereign, into what an Abyss of misery he is plunged by the Treachery
of his own Subjects, (yet all under the specious pretense of loyalty,) as there
is no generous heart but must lament the Infamy which returns upon us, in the
opinion of other Nations, so no Tongue or Pen will ever be able to fatham the
depth of their vilany, no vengeance equal their impiety, who first contributed
to that cursed design, which God has permitted (for causes best known to his
unsearchable wisdom) to render a pious and glorious Prince, a flourishing and
obedient People, thus wretched and miserable, by a most horrid Rebellion.

It is now more than five years, since the devouring sword first ranged about
the Kingdom; full seven years since this Parliament began; the whole Body
whereof I cannot accuse for the Authors of this unnatural war, but (to speak
mildly and conscionably) they were some few Members of it (whom it is not my
business to name, leaving that to History,) who first taught our Hands to war
and our Fingers to fight. Yet he that will trace the design of this war to
its Original, shall find it of an elder date than 7. years: For, all the
seditious Carriages of the Puritan-Faction (so called) against the government
of the Church, in the days of Queen Elizabeth, King James, and our Sovereign
that now is, were but as so many preparatives to the work in hand, or so many
throws in Travail, till the Faction was delivered of the Monster, in the
year 1641. which was then Christened by the name of REFORMATION.

And whereas in the Reigns of the two former Princes, this Faction was with
great wisdom and policy, kept under Hatches, and so not arrived to that height
of Impudence they afterward attained, their numbers being then not very
considerable among the Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy of the Kingdom, and so they
wanted men to back them both in the Senate and Pulpit; yet in process of time
being very active and industrious, (as all Innovators must be) they drew
Disciples after them in all Counties of the Kingdom, among all degrees and
conditions of men: so that then their Reputation increasing with their number,
and both being mightily advanced by an artificial and counterfeit piety, they
daily gathered advantage to cry down the Government of the Church by Bishops,
as Antichristian, to make way for (as themselves termed it) a glorious
Reformation; This was made the Stalking horse to the whole designs, and
through this pretense they the rather prevailed upon the credulous people, by
reason of the rash and furious carriage of some of the Episcopal Clergy, which
rendered their Adversaries a daily occasion to add fuel to the fire of zeal
among the multitude, and prepared them to entertain any Change, though to
their own prejudice.

Which being quickly apprehended, and Counsels mutually communicated, by many
of the Gentry, and a Lord or two (some of broken Fortunes, but all of ambitious
minds) they judged then they had met with a fit occasion to repair and advance
their Fortunes and their Friends, to the great Offices and Honors of the
Kingdom, and so became Candidalets of this desperate Faction. And knowing that
this could never be effected but by surprising the King's Majesty and the
chief Officers of State, in a Parliamentary way, they labored tooth and nail
(their expectations having been frustrated in former Parliaments) to make sure
of all in this Parliament: And this they managed most stoutly partly by
canvasing Elections for Creatures of their own in the Counties abroad, partly
by working upon the City of London, with religious pretenses; and finally upon
their own Members with high promises; and that which gave the maine stroke of
all was, their having the Scots ready at a Call (as the world well knew) upon
all occasions to back them.

By which means having made their party paramount among the Laity, and knowing
there was little hope but that all the learned Clergy of the Kingdom would
stick firm to their own Principles, as they attempted so they prevailed upon
few of them; But well weighing the Proverb, That none is so bold as blind
Bayard, and that, Ignorance is the mother of blind Obedience, they knew none so
fit to work to their own ends, as the meanest and most illiterate of the
Clergy, who were as ready to swallow the great Benefices, as themselves the
great Offices of the Kingdom; and these they employed both at Press and
Pulpit, to libell and rail down the ancient received government both of
Church and State.

And now the Boutefeu's of the Faction being thus prepared, they proceeded to
give fire, immediately dis-mounted the chief Officers of State, and chased the
Bishops out of the House of Lords, and levelled all exorbitant Courts both
spiritual and temporal; to all which His Majesty gave his Royal Assent, as
also for Trienniall Parliaments. To which special Acts of Grace and Favor, he
added also that highest of all, for the continuance of this Parliament at the
discretion of our new Masters; and what more could have been desired, or
granted? But they not yet satisfied, and the Court being crowded daily with
unreasonable demands, extorted by the Factious Party, from the Houses, and as
unreasonable and audacious Tumults from the City, to the intolerable affront of
the Royal Person, his Majesty plainly saw the design was next to chase
himself away, and experience tells us, it was a plot on purpose to lay a
Foundation for war, by driving him to extremities, that themselves might invade
the Throne (as we see they have done,) and reign like Princes.

Now having perfected the Plot thus far, and attained the cheef of their
desires, which was His Majesty's absence (whereupon they took occasion of
advantage in the opinion of the people, (as they ever have done upon the most
necessitous and innocent of his Actions) to scandalize him for a Deserter of
his Parliament) it was consulted next, to keep him away, and drive him to
further extremities, and so they prosecuted him still with such imperious
Messages and Demands, as became neither a wise nor loyal People to ask, nor
an English King to grant, if he meant to be a King any longer, or they had
meant really to have him return back to London, with any hope of being used
like a King.

But on they proceeded, and the next work was, to disrobe him, of all the
Ensigns of Royalty; and first, to ravish the Crown of its choicest Jewel,
the Militia both by Sea and Land; the very life and soul of a King quatenus
King, and without which Monarchy is but a dead Carkase, a Scar-Crow, a mere
Shadow. But because it had been too gross to make so high and positive a
Demand, without some gilded pretense, immediately wild Fears and Jealousies
were raised to amaze the people, concerning a Popish and Profane-Party, ready
to join in Arms with the King, for the destruction of the Protestant
Religiion, and inslaving them to an Arbitrary Tyranny, whereupon they founded
an invincible necessity lying upon the Houses to borrow the Militia for a
certain time out of the hands of the King, to secure the Religion, and
Liberties of the People, thereby reflecting upon the Honor and Integrity of His
Majesty, as if the Power of the Kingdom in his hands, had been like a sword in
the hands of a Madman, and no security to be expected, unless it were put
into their own; all which was cunningly represented to the Kingdom by way of
Remonstrance and Declaration from London, and all their frivolous Allegations
and pretenses in them, as wisely answered, and the Rights of the Crown
substantially defended by his Majesty, in several Declarations likewise from
York.

To be short, this business of the Militia (which is his Majesty's chiefest and
undoubted Right) was that which set this unnatural war on foot; for, th
Houses having seized it into their hands, and so his Majesty being first
assaulted, and knowing well whereto these unparalled'd Attempts tended, by the
Series of their past proceedings, even to the diminution (if not utter
destruction) of the Royal Authority, which not to have defended and vindicated
against manifest Usurpation, had been to betray his Posterity, and the Majesty
of Empire; it must needs remain clear to all the World, that as his Majesty
was necessitated to a defensive posture, for the preservation of his Crown and
Dignity (thus impiously invaded) so the two Houses (or rather a factious party
in them) were the first Authors and Actors of this miserable Civil War, and
of all those mischiefs thence arising to the Public, in pursuance of their
own private ends.

Thus far it was judged necessary to premise in justification of his Majesty's
Honor and Innocence, touching the ground of the War betwixt Him and the two
Houses. Now as touching the Continuation of it, we must add that likewise to
their Account who were the first Contrivers: for Blows being past on both
sides, and so the War well on foot, and they having tasted a while of the
sweets of Sovereignty, proceeded still to prosecute it upon the same Principles
that they began it, and kept of his Majesty from all possibility of an
Accommodation, by fresh supplies of Demands more Monstrous and unreasonable then
the first. And of this strain were the Nineteen Propositions presented by
Commissioners of both Houses, to his Majesty at Colebrooke, the Propositions of
both Kingdoms presented first at Oxford, a second time at Newcastle, and now
lately again at Hampton Court; to all which his Majesty returned convincing
Reasons of his Denial, they being such as he could not Assent unto, without
manifest Violation of his Honor, and Conscience, by yielding up the Regal
Dignity, with the Revenues, Rights, and Indowments of the Church (which he is
sworn to defend) and a wilful condemnation of his own most just Cause, and
all those that have adhered closest to him in the midst of Adversity.

And as Propositions have been made use of hitherto, only to vex Him, and
delude the Kingdom, with pretended Offers toward an Accommodation, the same
has been the Aim likewise in all their Messages and Treaties, but especially
that maine one at Vxbridge, where it is a shame to consider how far his
Majesty condescended unto them, out of his indeered affection to his wearied
and wasted Subjects, toward the procuring of a firm and well grounded Peace,
valuing the quiet and comfort of his People, before many known and undoubted
Prerogatives of the Crown. But the Houses having then for some years engrossed
the greatest places of Honor and Profit in their own hands, had not made then
full Markets at the price of the Peoples blood, and therefore kept still at
such a distance, that all his Majesty's endeavors for Agreement, were rendered
fruitless and unprofitable; so that instead of the sweet Music of Peace
expected by that Treaty, the Kingdom trembled again with fresh Alarms unto the
war, and all turned to confusion.

And in process of time, Divine Providence permitting his Majesty's Affairs
to fall into a very low condition, by a continued hurry of Losses from that
miraculous and fatal Battle of Naseby to a total disbanding in the West; and
when none had escaped the fury of the Enemy, but a few scattered languishing
Garrisons in the heart of the Kingdom, his Majesty was forced to make many an
Overture for a personal Treaty; for the better expediting whereof, he offered
himself (upon security given) to come and Treat with them at Westminster: But
the deaf Adders stopped their ears, and would not hearken to the voice of the
Charmer charmed he never so wisely; though he promised to give and take all the
satisfaction that could be required by Reasonable and Conscientious men. And so
his Majesty having failed of his last Refuge, a Personal Treaty, he was not
long after beseiged in Oxford by Sir Thomas Fairfax, and driven to such
extremity, that he was glad to quit the Town in a Disguise, and betake
himself for security, to the Scottish Army about Newarke upon Trent.

The Scots, they entertained (I will not say they sought it) as an happy
Occasion, to bring their own Ends about with the Houses; and knowing that the
Person of the King in their hands, was a Jewel that the two Houses would
purchase at any Price (they not thinking themselves secure without such a
Possession) it was not long ere they struck a Bargain to deliver his Majesty
into the hands of Commissioners, appointed by the Houses to receive him; which
was done accordingly ( Proh Deum atque hominum fidem!) and the Scots received
200000 li. in part of their Arreares, and had a time set for tho payment of the
Residue.

His Majesty thus yielded up (to say no worse of it,) was conducted by
Commissioners to reside at Holdenby, during the will and pleasure of the
Presbyterian faction; which then ruled the Roste, and mued him up there many
Months, in hope to tire him out of his Noble Principles, and make him submit
to be yoked by the Propositions; yet all in vain,

But the Army under Sir Thomas Fairfax quarteridg round about, and being most
of them of a contrary Faction, and trampled upon by their Opposites,
confederated with high Resolution, to make that advantage of his Majesty's
person which others had done before. And because it was an Attempt of an high
Nature, which might seem upon a sudden to reflect upon the Authority of the
Houses, wherein their Adversaries then bore sway, the superior Officers agreed
to carry it so cleanly, that they would not be seen at first to have any hand
in the business, but it was left to a select number of the private Soldiers,
over whom a Coronet (by name Joyce) was set Commander in Chief, to seize upon
the person of the King, and carry dim from Holdenby: which was done with
expedition, and though the Superior Officers disclaimed the Act at first, yet
they began to own it by Degrees and carried him along with the Army from place
to place, giving him and his party great hopes in their several Declarations,
of their candid Intentions to restore him to hs just Rights, with Honor and
Safety, and the Kingdom to a speedy Peace; by which means they won the hearts
of all, and rendered themselves so formidable, that they beat down the adverse
faction, overawed and subdued the City, and brought the Houses to act wholly
for them and their Party.

At length, after his Majesty had been settled some time under the power of the
Army at Hampton Court (where he still continues) they having likewise been used
to Rule, became loath to return to the condition of Obeying, and forgetting the
establishment of his Majesty (according to promise) thought of nothing, but
which way to establish Themselves in a Military Posture of 30000. for a
perpetual burden to the Kingdom, and have left his Majesty to be vexed again
with Propositions from the Houses, as unreasonable as the former; yea worse,
insomuch that the Independents little finger proves heavier then the Presbyters
loins: which gives us just occasion to suspect, that seeing now at the last
cast, they mean to make no end, and give us no hopes of a settled Peace, by
tendering such Propositions as his Majesty may with Conscience and Honor accept,
both they and the Houses have some desperate ends upon his Majesty, as well as
their brutish Adjutators, though at present they seem to drive contrary ways.

For, what may we expect, when we see so little hope of an end? Has not His
Majesty been a Prisoner a long season? Is he not so still? and what hope is
there of his deliverance? let all Loyall-Subjects lay this to their heart. For
the experience of former Ages and our own Histories will tell us, that a King
long a Prisoner in his own Kingdom, is like Lazarus in the Grave, and can
hardly expect a Resurrection, but by miracle: For, his Adversaries knowing the
crime of Imprisoning to be unpardonable, will be tempted at last to some
further mischief for their own security, according to that of Seneca; Scelera
sceleribus propaganda, and that part of the Devils Lecture in Machiavell, that
he which once draws his Sword against his Prince, must throw away the Scabbard.

Thus have I stated the whole progress of affairs, according to Truth,
betwixt His Majesty and the two Houses, wherein who sees not how grossly he
has been abused, both in the original and continuance of this uncivil
Civill-Warre, to the apparent hazard of Monarchy it self, the danger of His
Royal Person, and the desolation of His Kingdoms? what then remains, but
that the Houses should enter into a serious consideration.

First, that though it being neither desired nor expected, that they should
make an open Recantation of their former proceedings unto the world, it being a
rule among Statesmen never to repent in the sight of men, whatsoever they do
before God, for fear of losing their Reputation; yet it is wisdom to retreat
as speedily, and with as little noise or reluctancie as may be, out of an
erroneous Engagement: Nor is it safe to dally with old out-worne Pretenses any
longer, now the people begin to be convinced daily, and in all Countries to see
how strangely they have been deluded: For, though the multitude are usually as
pliant as wax, and apt to be inamored of any Novelty that promises much to them
of Ease, Liberty, Reformation, etc. which are the most taking Pretenses that
can be made use of to inveigle them, and the only Allurements first practiced
by this Parliament to draw them on; yet when they find their expectations
defeated, and themselves laden with oppressions worse than the former;

-- nec Bellua saevior ulla est,
Quam servi rabies in libera colla furentis.
Their Splenes are ready to burst with Revenge; they carry all before them like
a furious Inun lation, and usually become the first Executioners of their
friendly Pretenders.

Secondly, it is true that Histories tell us, that Subjects have prevailed so
far as to depose, and execute direful Tragedies upon their Sovereigns, and
I could wish that our own Island and the memories of some of our Ancesters had
never been stained with the guilt of so Prodigious a Crime; But then withal
you shall find, that those executions were attempted only upon such as were
vicious in their lives, cruel and savage toward their Subjects, and
incorrigible in their Government: But as for our gracious Sovereign Charles,
has he not been of an unspotted life? catechize your consciences, and tell me
what one habitual vice can he be taxed with? has he not all his days been a
Pattern of admirable Clemency, even to his very Enemies? has he not obliged
heretofore most of those which have been the Ring-laeders against him, (those
Monsters of Ingratitude) with many special benefits and favors? And touching
his Government, if any thing were am^le (as all the false colors begin now to
wear away) never did any of his Predecessors condescend so low, to give
satisfaction to the people. By which gracious demeanor being highly mounted in
the major part of his Subjects, it is impossible the malice of his Adversaries
should extend to the ruin of his Person, or to the prejudice of the Regal
Dignity, without some sharp and swift Revenge upon the traitorous Abettors.

Thirdly, the Houses having rendered themselves odious, both by their Ordinances
and Agents, even among those which have been heretofore then fast-^runds, who
finding nothing but oppression upon oppression, with daily Rapes committed upon
their Estates and Persons, as the only recompense for all their Service which
they have done them, and no likelihood as yet, that their miseries will have an
end, by reason of that stubburne distance which they keep still, from all
probability of an Accommodation with His Majesty; the people begin now to look
upon him as one abused, and much to be pitied; they behold him as the only
Restorer of Liberty, and upon whose Restoration depends their own (as indeed
it does) together with the Happiness, Peace and Tranquillity of the Kingdom:
Is it not the common voice, we shall never see a good world till the King be
in his Throne? What less then can be expected by reasonable men, but that the
whole Body of the People (tired out with extremities) will ere long be
inflamed into an unanimous design upon the Houses, as the Authors of all
these did actions? And then as they set on Tumults from the City, to drive
away His Majesty from Westminster; so it is probable an universal Tumult may
bring him back again, to be revenged upon his Enemies.

Fourthly, seeing the Houses have had now His Majesty a long time in durance,
(the highest and boldest Attempt which can be made upon a Prince and the
lowest condition he can be driven to; and which if it be a Plag e to a
private man, must needs be an Hell to a King,) and yet notwithstanding all
their Batteries by Persuasions and Frights, they have not been able to shake
him from those Royal Principles whereupon his Interest is firmly founded, and
which are indeed his maine Security; To what end do they keep Him and his
People any longer in Bondage, without all hope of Settlement? Let them
consider, that what they have done hitherto, they have attained by the love of
that part of the People, upon whom they have had the luck to prevail by their
artificial Pretenses: But now that the Vizard is taken off, and every man is
seen with his own face; now the Curtain is withdrawn, and every man appears
what he is in the close of the Tragedy, and how he has Acted all this while a
knavish part under a religious disguise, they must needs at length prove a
shame to each other, and a scorn to their Adversaries, when their Considents
shall withdraw their Affections, and expose them to the malice of the oppressed
and unruly multitude, or yield them up a Sacrifice to the mercy of the Laws and
their injured Prince.

Fifthly, If all other ways of ruin should sail, yet being divided into
Factions, there is a necessity they must at length become their own
Executioners as they have been in part already, in that business of Impeaching
many of their Brethren in iniquity in both Houses. In the prosecution whereof,
though they cool at present (as it is wisdom so to do) and there be a kind
of friendly correspond betwixt both the Factions; yet the friendship is but
like that of two Mastives tired with fighting, which still and pant over each
other, till the one can recover breath and advantage to fall again upon the
other. The reason why the Presbyterian does not bustle, is, because as yet he
cannot, and dares not, though his Appetite be keen enough; and the cause why
the Independants are so moderate toward the Presbyter, is, because the pride of
that Faction being quelled, and themselves become the only men of power, they
are contented to let the other live by them like Brethren (though no otherwise
but as underlings) to serve their ends upon them; which condition they are glad
to accept of, but not without much regreet and disdain against the Independent
Conquerours: so that as by their mutual Bickerings they have made each other
contemptible, so this forced love and seeming unity must (upon every alteration
of Affairs) break forth into such flames of dissension, as will in short time
prepare them for final ru ne and destruction.

Lastly, Since these things are so, we must necessarily conclude, that as it is
contrary to Conscience for the two Houses not to contribute their utmost
endeavors to restore a firm and happy Peace, after such a cruel War, to
receive the spirits of their dejected Countrymen; so it is apparent to all the
world, that there is no visible way left to procure this Peace, but a speedy
Accommodation with His Majesty, by sending to him such Propositions, as may
agree with Right Reason, Conscience and Honor: And if the Peace of their
languishing bleeding Country be not a sufficient Motive, yet let a tender
regard be had to their own security, in this their tottering condition.
Retreat, Retreat Gentlemen with speed; you have been at your highest pitch
long since, and now in the opinion of all wise men are declining; take heed of
a fall; it will be the most dangerous, one next to that of the bottomless
Pit: the eyes of the Kingdom are upon His Majesty, as the rising sun that must
clear up their clouded spirits, and dispell all those mists that are about
him, and upon your selves, as the only hinderers of his and their happiness.
While ye have time make use of it, for, the night is far spent, the day is at
hand wherein God will judge with righteous judgment. As yet ye may save your
credits in part, if you please; as yet it is possible ye may recover your
Friends and allay the splenes of your old Adversaries; but remember my words,
if ye sin wilfully against all the obligations of Religion, Honor and Policy,
a time is coming wherein ye must repent, and with sorrow confess, that you
neglected those things which so nearly concerns the happiness of your selves, and
of these Kingdoms.

The Case of the King in relation to the Army.
Having made it manifest unto the world how His Majesty has been abused from
time to time by the two Houses, we come now to consider of his usage since he
has been under the power and disposition of the Army.

After that this Army under the command of Sir Tho. Fairfax had cleared the
Kingdom, and wholly suppressed the royal party, having no enemy to encounter,
and being the only forces considerable in the Kingdom for number and
Reputation, and being elevated with the opinion of their own merits; and the
Houses committing that great oversight of not disbanding the major part of
them (which had been sufficient to prevent those Inconveniences which have
since ensured,) these sword men having little further use of military Counsels,
began to reflect upon Affairs of State, and being for the most part of a
Faction contrary to the Presbyterian, which then swayed all in the Houses,
wherein likewise themselves had their Partisans, from whom they had
intelligence of all Proceedings of the other Party, at length the factions grew
jealous of each other. The Presbyterian they had reason to dislike, that men of
opinions and Interests different from themselves, should continue any longer in
Arms, and accordingly drove on for a speedy disbanding: And the Independent on
the other side, interpreted this a design on purpose to ruinate the Army and
inslave the Kingdom. Upon these grounds jealousies and differences grew higher
and higher; the Presbyterians having the Votes in the Houses on their side, and
sheltring themselves under the Authority and Privilege of Parl. grew very
confident and active toward a disbanding, while the Independent valuing the
sword in their hands above the noise of an empty Privilege, pitched upon very
high resolutions, and concluded of no less than an Impeachment against eleven
Grandees of their adverse party in the House of Commons, as enemies to the
Peace and welfare of the Kingdom, and carried it on with so high an hand, that
at length they not only purged the Grandees out of the House, but prevailed in
a short time to overawe all their opposites, both in the Houses and the City.

But such attempts as these being lofty and dangerous, and fatal ever to the
undertakers, it not well founded; therefore the superior Officers of the Army,
before they had adventure, continued which way to make sure of the Soldiers,
that they might adhere to them courageously, in so difficult and doubtful an
Enterprise; and they adjudged it a politic course to erect such a new
military Order of men, which were never heard of in any Army but this, and
these they named Agitators, chosen most out of the private Soldiers, and some
of the Inferior Officers, whose business was to agitate in the behalf of
each respective Regiment, Troop or Company at the Council of War, and there to
represent the grievances of their respective Regiments, Troops or Companies,
with such expedients as they conceived necessary for the removal of those
grievances, by which means the meanest Soldier being interested in the
affairs of the Army, and having free access to the Council of War, by their
Agitators or Deputies in all cases of discontent whatsoever, they became the
more firmly obliged in the midst of all extremities and acted with the greater
cheerfulnes and unanimity.

And though this course was at first extreme beneficial to the promo-thing of
the design then in hand, yet it was not long ere the Commanders in Chief had
experience of those manifold Inconveniences, which must necessarily follow,
where private Persons, and the Rabble of the vulgar are admitted to the
cognizance of public affairs: for by degrees they proceeded from private
businesses, to intermeddle (as the superior Officers taught them the way) not
only with the maine Concernments of the Army in general, but also with the
grand Affairs of State, and Proccedings of the Houses; and at this day they are
arrived to such a height, that they are bold to stand in competition with the
superior Officers themselves: so that as the case now stands, we must consider
two divisions of power in the Army, the superior Officers and the Agitators,
and these to be distinct in their Motions, as it is pretended; for the
superior Officers pretend to be for the King, and the Agitators profess
downright to be neither for this King nor any other, but proclaim themselves
enemies to Monarchical government, and the Question now propounded at every
Muster, is, whether we shall have a King or no King? And in pursuance of their
wicked Purposes, they are drawing up an impeachment against His Majesty, which
yet is publicly disclaimed by some (but not all) of the superior Officers;
but the maine Quere is, whether they are real in it, or not; which I must
conclude in the Negative for these following Reasons.

First, if they are real against the design of the Agitators, why then do
they not quicken the Houses to some speedy Agreement with His Majesty, since
there is no other probable way of quelling the extremity of such desperate
Proceedings? for we perceive plainly, they run on with the Houses in the old
deceitful way of pretending toward Peace, by new Propositions cast in the same
mole with the former; which are indeed the same with, and in some Particulars
worse then the old, only they shall visit His Majesty after a new way: for as
they were presented heretofore all in a Bundle, so now they mean to shufflle
and out with them one by one; and then if His Majesty refuse to sign them (as
their Consciences tell them before hand, he will, must and ought,) then they
and their Houses have agreed, to settle the Affairs of the Kingdom without
him, as shall seem best to their own Wisdoms. And now since these men are no
fools, unless it be in that highest point of folly (as the Psalmist speaks)
to imagine there is no God, and so are not ignorant, that there is no way of
security which loyal Subjects may expect, nor any way of settlement, but one,
in this Kingdom, and that is by the royal Assent in all things to be
established; what then may we expect, if they settle things after their own
humor, and leave His Majesty unsettled, but that they mean to shake the Crown
from off his Head, as well as the Agitators, the Devil prompting them
thereunto upon a wicked principle of selfe-preservation, to establish their own
safety against all after-claps of revenge, by a destruction of the Prince, and
a depriving of his Posterity, by an alteration of Government.

Secondly, Though this seem to be a most prodigious Course, and such a one as
honest moderate men scarce dream of, especially at this time now that the
Council of War pretends against the Agitators, yet if we reflect upon the
Principles of their leading men, we can expect no less, as long as they keep
at such a distance from his Majesty. For, they have Martin a Demi-god amongst
them, who preached this Doctrine long since in the House against the King, that
it were better one Man and his Posterity should perish ROOT and BRANCH, than
the Kingdom, that is, than Themselves and their Faction should miscarry. And
Major White (he that professed openly He knew no Authority in the Kingdom,
but the power of the Sword,) He is a man that plants and waters the Army with
the same Principles as Martin, and proclaimed the very same doctrine in the
Head of the Generals own Regiment, at their last Muster in Hartfordshire. And
if we consider M. Cromwell's old Tenets, he is never a jot behind in madness,
notwithstanding all his Smooth Tricks at present. Nor will Ireton's whining
Plea for the King, with all the Noise he made lately against the Agitators,
pass for any other but mere Shadowy Pretenses, unless we receive some
visible hopes of a Substantial Accord betwixt them and his Majesty, by a
moderate and speedy Condescension; else we must conclude, that the late
Carriages were but so many subtle Policies to make a fair show to the
Kingdom, till their design should be fully ripened, and then when they had a
sit Opportunity, to have Closed with their Agitators.

Thirdly, It must be very probable, that They and their Agitators are one in
design, because They, the Houses, and the Agitators, appear one in
resolution: For, as the Houses and Themselves have agreed already, that upon
his Majesty's refusal of their Propositions, they will dispose of Affairs at
then own pleasure; So the Agitators have told us in Print plainly, that They
are resolved not to depend for the Settlement of their Peace and Freedom, upon
the King, who (they say) intended their Bondage, and brought a cruel War
upon Them; and atheism, that as it is the highest disparagement to the Supreme
Authority of this Nation, the Parliament, that when they have Commanded an
Army in Service against the King they should not have sufficient power to save
them harmless for obedience to their Commands; so as the Highest dishonor to
the Army, that they should seek to the conquered Enemy to save them harmless
for fighting against Them, which is to ask him pardon, and so will remain as
a perpetual Reproach upon them. And now what difference (I pray you) betwixt
the Sense of the Houses, the superior Officers, and their Agitators? Are they
not all one? They were all agreed in private to ruin his Majesty, and the
Agitators were to act it first in public: From whence it is as clear as the
Sun that shines at noon day, that as their first Pretenses when they got the
King into their possession, were all for the good of his Majesty and the
Kingdom, which we have found by experience to be but fained and false; So
their last Actions are like to manifest that their chiefest Aim was, and is no
other, but to deprive the King and his Posterity of th ir just Rights, and our
Nation of that honorable name and constitution of a Kingdom, whereby it has
flourished many hundreds of years, even to the admiration and envy of all the
Kingdoms in Europe.

And that this may be fully laid open to all men, let us next of all consider
how far the Agitators have driven on the design and in what Particulars. And
herein I shall faithfully quote them and their Abettors, in all their
Representations and Proposalls.

First, They resolve in the Case of the Army stated, etc page 6. to take away
the Negative voice of the King, esteeming it unreasonable, that they having
purchased by blood what was their Right, of which the King endeavored to
deprive them, should yet solely depend on his will, for their relief in their
grievances and Oppressions; and that satisfaction and security is to be given
to the people in relation th^^ publ^q^^^^^s for which they expended so much
treasure and blood, before the King shall be provided for.

Secondly, They have declared page 15. That all power is originally and
essentially in the whole body of the People of this Nation, and their free
choice or Consent by their Representators, is the only Original or foundation
of all just government, and therefore that it be insisted upon positively; That
the Supreme power of the Peoples Representors, or Commons Assembled in
Parliament, be forthwith clearly declared; as their power to make Laws, or
repeal Laws, as also to call to an Account all Officers in this Nation
whatsoever, for their Neglects or Treacheries in their Trusts for the Peoples
good, and to continue, or to displace and remove them from their Offices,
Dignities, and Trusts, according to their demerits. And farther, that a Power
to constitute any kind of Governors, or Officers, that they shall judge to be
for the peoples good, be declared: And that upon the aforesaid considerations
it be insisted upon, that all Obstructions to the freedom and equality of the
peoples choice of those their Representors, eitheir by Patents or Charters, or
Usurpations, or pretended Customs, be removed by these present Commons in
Parliament, and that such a freedom of Choice be provided for, as the People
may be equally Represented: Which power or Commons in Parliament, is the thing
against which (they say) the King has consented, and the People have defended
with their lives, and therefore ought now to be demanded, as the price of their
blood.

Thirdly, page 17. That all those large Sums of money that were allowed to
needless pretended Officers of the Court, which did but increase wickedness
and profaneness, may be reserved for a public Treasure, to be expended in
paying those Forces that must be maintained for the Peoples Safety, that so
through a good and faithful Improvement of all the Lands pertaining to the
Court, there might be much reserved for levying; the public Charges, and
casing the people.

Fourthly, That the power of this, and all future Representatives of the Nation
is inferior only to theirs who choose them, and does extend without the
concurrence or consent of any other Person or Persons, to the enacting,
altering, and repealing of Laws; to the erecting and abolishing of Offices and
Courts; to the appoynting, removing, and calling to an Account Magistrates and
Officers of all Degrees; to the making War and Peace; to the Treating with
Foraine States: And generally to whatsoever is not expressly, or employed,
reserved by the Represented to themselves.

Fifthly, That in all Laws made, or to be made, every Person may be bound
alike, and that no Tenure, Estate, Charter, Degree, Birth, or Place, do
confer any exemption from the ordinary course of legal proceedings,
whereunto others are subjected.

And now let all the world judge from these particulars, whether the design be
not point blank against Kingly Government, when the King (whom by their known
Principles they reckon for no more but an Officer of State) shall be divested of
his Negative voice, and of all power and privilege, and stand liable to
criminal Accusations, and be utterly deptived of his Nobility, which are the
main props of his Prerogative and Crown. This is plainly evident to any common
understanding that weighs the foregoing demands.

But in that desperate Pamphlet, entitled A Call to the Army etc. the language
is far more plain, where they tell us, that they are not to be frighted by
the word ANARCHY, unto a love of MONARCHY, which is but the gilded name for
Tyranny; proclaiming his Sacred Majesty the veriest Tyrant living in the word,
page 1. taxing the Houses, that they did not punish him in the first place, as
the chief Author of all our miseries, and an abuser of his Office, and a man
over-head and ears in blood, page 5. and pressing to dispatch their
Impeachment against him: And to sum up all their villainy, they conclude in
these very words, that those of their friends that are about him, should not
permit any Agreement to be made with him, but be sure to keep him, as they keep
their lives, and not to part with him upon any terms till they can refer him
to a free Parliament.

So that now their Design appears with a broad face in the world, that they
were resolved not to come to any Agreemet, or Accommondation with his Majesty,
but to have mued him up till the time should come, wherein they had determined
this Parliament should expire, and then to have destroyed him in a New
Parliament (forsooth) or rather a Tumultuous Assembly of their own framing.

Nor do they steep in this cursed business, but have Agents of their own in
all Quarters of the Army, the Countries abroad, and the City of London, to draw
in Persons to subscribe to the afornamed damned particulars. And it has been
my good hap to light upon a Copy of Instructions agreed upon by the Agents of
the City of London, and the Army, to the respective Counties, Cities, and
Parishes, whereunto several Papers of those particulars were directed by the
chief Conspirators, for the more orderly carrying on, and the more speedy
effecting and bringing in the subscriptions. The Instructions are these:

First, that the Papers be delivered to such faithful persons, as will be
vigilant, and active in prosecution of them.

Secondly. That they be desired to meet at places which they shall judge most
convenient, to take the Subscriptions of the City or place where they reside.

Thirdly, that there be appointed one or more Agents, as they shall judge meet,
to bring in the ^ubscriptions as soon as possibly they can, to the Saracen's
Head in Friday-street in London, where there will be Agents to receive them, or
the Master of the House (let that fellow be taken notice of) will direct them
where they shall be received.

Fourthly, that one or more active faithful man be appointed for each County,
City, or Place, as aforesaid, to act and transact such things as may conduce to
the good of the work in hand.

By all which it appears, that the Case of the King in relation to the Army,
was a very sad one, and such as represents him in a most desperate condition,
while he resided among them; especially, if we consider that part of his
Majesty's Letter directed to the Houses, and left behind him in his Chamber,
at his departure from Hampton Court, which confirms all that is before
specified, and wherein he lets the Houses know, That he had as much as in him
lay, endeavored to give them satisfaction, and to re-establish a settled peace;
but he saw nothing reasonable would content them; That he had certain
Information that the Agitators, or some of that Faction, had an Intent to
murder him; and that Master Peter's had lately expressed so much to an intimate
friend of his, for which Cause he was resolved to retire to some private place
for a Time, for his own Preservation etc. as it was high time so do, when the
long plotted villainy was come so near an execution.

The Case of the King in relation to the Scots.
FOrasmuch as it is very convenient to bury all the past Injuries done to his
Majesty, by his own Nation, they having afforded us so great hope in their late
Address unto the House, that they mean to redeem the Time and recover their
credit, by a solemn profession and vindication of their Loyalty; I shall
forbear to rub old soars, or mention that strange Act, in yielding up the
King to the power of the Houses, his professed Enemies; which themselves at the
first positively denied to do in their Answer to the Papers of the Houses; and
condemned it, as a thing unheard of, and not to be in reason expected, it being
contrary to the Law of Nature and Nations, that they should yield up their own
Prince, sled unto them for Resuge to the power of another Nation.

And though by forfeiting this Principle of Truth and honor, they have
contracted a grand Odium in the opinion of the Royal Party at home, and other
Nations abroad (as they well know,) insomuch that men will hardly be persuaded
they intend any good toward his Majesty; yet their own interests and ends being
bound up in it (as I shall evidently demonstrate, and beyond which the
jealousy of the English Nation can build no considence upon them) I shall
evince it to every man's understanding (and to quicken the Scots themselves)
that as his Majesty has no hope as yet of a recovery, but by their means; so
in all reasons a necessity lies upon them, the State of their own Affairs
requiring them to assist, and restore his Majesty: which will appear more
clearly by these following Reasons:

First, a principal end in all the Actions of this Army, and their partakers
in Parliament, has been utterly to banish all Scotch Interest our of England;
which they have in a manner wholly effected, by crushing the Grandees of the
Presbyterian Faction; only to still and pacify the Scots at present, they have
permitted the residue to sit still in the House to serve their own ends upon
them; and so likewise the Presbyterian Church Government is on foot too, but
only upon courtesy for a time, to seed them with hopes, and keep them from
running upon extremes, while in the mean time the Independents are plotting to
make sure work, and then when they see convenient, to kick off, both
themselves, their Covenant and Discipline, past all hope of a recovery; and
when they have prevailed so farce as to shut the Scots out of doors to bolt
them fast after them, and not leave the least hope of a Re-entry.

Secondly, It cannot stand with the honor of the Scots to have their whole
Nation bassted by an inconsiderable Party in this: And by the ordinary rules of
Policy, every Faction is obliged to quell its Opposite, or lose that Interest
which is contended for betwixt them. And therefore if the Scots sit still, and
break not the Cariere of this Independent Party, by a timely Interposition but
let them settle upon the Kingdom, what can they expect, but that when all is
subdued to their will here, their next Design will he upon them in their own
Kingdom?

Thirdly, the Scots have often declared heretofore, that the happiness of both
Kingdoms were mutually involved so as that nothing of prejudice could befall
the one, but it must reflect upon the other: And in their Papers from Newcastle
presented to both Houses when his Majesty was among them, and in their late
Letter directed to the House they having publikly declared (how unhappily
soever they departed from that Principle heretofore) that their safety and
happiness was included in that of his Majesty's person, it is impossible they
should make so slight of their Faith, as to sacrifice it with eternal Infamy,
and hazard themselves and their liberty to serve their enemies, for the love of
those Arreares which are yet behind.

Fourthly, they may receive those Arreares as easily and with more honor, from
the hands of his Majesty, and with the consent and love of the whole Kingdom,
when they have restored his Majesty.

Fifthly, their Party being wholly broken here, and the Houses likewise
themselves, there is no hope of serving their ends any longer in a
Parliamentary way; but upon the King they may, and serve him too: So that they
have no way left to procute an Interest again to any purpose in this Nation but
by closing with the King.

Sixthly, notwithstanding their former Parliamentary engagements, they are not
to seek of a cleanly pretense to stand for his Majesty, as long as the Covenant
is in being, and the Houses and Army have broken that Covenant, by their
palpable endeavors not only to ruin his Majesty's Person, but also to root
out the very Principles of Monarchy, both which both They and the Houses have
Covenanted to defend.

Seventhly, there can be no doubt of carrying the work through, because the
miscarriages of the Houses, and the Affronts of the Army, have wholly made ship
wrack of the Affections of the City; and as for the rest of the Kingdom,
variety of oppressions has made them absolutely the Kings own, reckoning their
own deliverance to depend on his Rostauration.

Lastly, though it may be objected, there is a great distance betwixt the Scots
and the Royal Party, in matter of Church Government, and so little hope of a
cordial uniting betwixt them; yet I am bold to imagine, that since all the
world knows the Design of a Presbytery by them upon this Nations, was only to
quell their Adversaries, the Bishops, that were the only men which vexed them,
and hindered them from thriving so well as they desired in this Kingdom, and so
to make a sure footing here by trampling them under; it will be no hard matter
to reconcile them so far, as to let us have Bishops again, upon condition they
may establish themselves here with them. And it is probable, they will be
contented to save their own souls in their Kirk of Scotland, and let us alone
with ours, if their Bodies and Purses be well provided for in the Commonwealth
of England.

The Case of the King in relation to all his Loyal Subjects.
What the Spaniards have often boasted of themselves, as the only Nation under
Heaven most zealous of the Honor of their Princes, might with as much truth
and more modesty, have bin verified in former times upon the English Nation, it
having bin an old received Maxim of State amongst them, That the glory of the
Kingdom consist, much in the State and Majestic splendor of their King.

And God be blessed this Loyal principle is not yet worn out, unless it be
in the hearts and pract ses of some few in these later years, who have sold
themselves to work wickedness, and been Ringleaders in an open and most
horrid Rebellion, wherein they had drawn in a great part of their fellow
Subjects, to serve their own factions and ambitions ends, as has been
manifested sufficiently in stating the several passages betwixt his Majesty,
the two Houses, and the Army.

Now it remains in the next place to show how the City of London, and the rest
of the Kingdom, has been abused likewise, as well as the King, and what
obligation lies upon them all, for the immediate entering upon some Course for
the Restoration of the King, and the deliverance of the Kingdom from the
slavery and oppression of a tyrannical Parliament, and a more tyrannical and
insulting Soldiery.

No way more ready to find out how the City and Kingdom have been abused,
than by recounting the innumerable Tricks that have bin used to milk the Purses
of the people, in pretense of maintayning the War, when the least part (God
knows) has been employed that that way, but either treasured up in the purses
of the Members, or laid out by them in rich and fair purchases at home, or
transported to serve their turns abroad, against a rainy day, while the
Soldiers have pined for want of pay in their religious cause, and devoured the
poor Countrymen by Free quarter: For, whereas one or two ways well ordered,
would have served the turn, they have made use of so various ways, for
raising of vast and incredible Sums of money, as were never heard of before
at a time in one kingdom; whereof I will here set down the Catalogue. 1 Royal
Subsidy of 300000 l. 2 Pole Money. 3 The Free Loanes and Contributions upon the
Public Faith, amounted to avast incredible sum, in Money, Plate, Horse, and
Arms, Bodkins, Thimbles, and Wedding-Rings of the zealous Sisters. 4 The Irish
Adventure for sale of Lands a first and second time. 5 The weekly Meal. 6 The
City-loane after the rate of fifty Subsidies. 7 The Assesments for bringing in
the Scots. 8 The fifth and twentieth part. 9 The weekly Assesment for the Earl
of Essex his Army. 10 The weekly (or monthly) Assesment for Sir Tho. Fairfax
his Army. 11 The weekly Assesment for the Scottish Army. 12 The weekly Assesment
for the British Army in Ireland. 13 The weekly Assesment for my Lord of
Manchesters Army. 14 Free Quarter (at least) connived at by the State, because
the Soldiers having for a time subsistence that way, were the less craving
for pay; whereby their Arrears growing stale, must at last either be frustrated
by a tedious Committee of Accounts, discount it out of the Commanders Arrears,
whereby the State saves it. 15 The Kings Revenue. 16 Sequestrations and Plunder
by Committees, which if well answered to the State, would have carried on the
work; which may be thus demonstrated: One half of all the goods and chatrels,
and (at least) one half of all the Lands, Rents, and Revenues of the kingdom
have bin Sequestered And who can imagine that one half of the profits and goods
of the Land, will not maintayn any Forces that can be kept and fed in England,
for the defense thereof? 17 Excise upon all things; this alone, if well
managed, would have maintained the war: The Low Countries make it almost
their only support. 18 Fortification money All which amounting to about forty
Millions, have bin expended heretofore; whereto we may add since, the sale of
a great part of Bishops Lands, which the unmeasurable sums arising still by
Fines for Delinquents Compositions, with the continuance of the Excise; and yet
not so much as a penny disbursed for the pay of the soldiers, insomuch that
they threaten every moment to come and levy their Arreares within the City of
London, which is become now the common mark of all intolerable affronts and
injuries that the ingratitude of the Houses, or the insolent threats of the
Soldiers can cast upon them. And the Country groans still under those three
heavy burdens, Excise, Taxes, and Free Quarter, without hope when, or how they
shall have remedy: But rather on the other side they see nothing but a cloud of
perpetual misery and slavery hanging over their heads, ready to fall upon them
by the late Votes of the Houses and the general Council of the Army, for the
establishment of thirty thousand standing Forces in the Kingdom, with constant
pay to be levied (for ought we know) if they once settle, to more then the
third generation.

Then seeing these things are so (my dear Country men) it is very evident how
the Case stands betwixt his Majesty and you. Is not his Case your own? have ye
not been alike abused, gulled, and oppressed? Is not he deprived of his Crown,
as you are of your Liberties and Estates? Is it not plain that his Prerogative
and your Freedom must fall together? And is not a speedy settlement the only
means to preserve them? And is there my probability of settling, till his
Majesty be seated in his Throne? And has it not been evidenced unto you, that
there is no way to effect this, unless the Houses condescend to an
accommodation with his Majesty? And this they will never do, unless all the
Loyal hearts of the Kingdom do give them to understand by way of Declaration,
or Petition, that they are very sensible of their own and his Majestyes
distressed condition, and are resolved with theit utmost possibilities (all as
one man) to restore his Majesty to his regal dignity, as the only means to
procure ease and tranquillity, to these wearied and distracted Kingdoms; toward
which I commend unto them these few considerations.

First, seeing the Houses and the Army stand wholly engaged against the King,
(as I have proved notwithstanding all fair pretenses,) and seeing they are both
resolute and active, and have the power of the Sword in their hands, there is a
necessity, unless we intend to have our miseries intailed upon our posterity,
that all delays be laid aside, and some speedy course taken to balance their
power, before they have strengthened their party too much, and quite overrun
the Kingdom, and made sure of all both by Sea and Land, at they have well nigh
done already.

Secondly, though the Army are a considerable Body for number, and so the very
appearance of it might deter men from stirring, yet if we consider its
constitution, either in whole, or in the parts of it, we shall find it to be
an Aggregate of differing Interests, opinions, and persuasions; and since they
agree in nothing, but to ruin us, so if any appearance should be made against
them, or any vigorous engagement be set on foot in the behalf of his Majesty,
so as that they be reduced to the least plunge of hardship and difficulty, they
would all moulder away to nothing: for, a great part (I dare say most) of the
private Soldiers are such as have done, and would do his Majesty service, if
occasion were offered; whereas they have betaken themselves to that Army, and
continue there, not out of any devotion or affection to their Cause, but only
as Soldiers of Fortune, that have no where else at present to subsist, and so
are willing upon any terms to embrace ease and maintenance upon Free Quarter.

Thirdly, the Houses and Army have quite lost the affections of the City of
London, the only considerable party in this Kingdom to uphold a Design, and so
of course now, seeing they can settle no where else, nor otherwise secure
themselves and their estates, they must return unto his Majesty. And besides,
they openly profess, they would with all their hearts spend as much more as
they have done to restore his Majesty, and be revenged upon their Riders: So
that if they be wrought upon by apt Instruments, against a right nick of time,
they are ready to entertain any course that carries a probability in the face
of it, to redeem their lost liberties and reputation.

Fourthly, as the whole Kingdom is dis-obliged by the Houses and the Army,
insomuch that their own friends (especially of the Presbyterian faction) are
become as absolute enemies to them as the Cavaliers; So the Scots being reputed
the leading men of that party, and having declared in their late Letter to the
House, their dislike of the Kings being in the power of the Army, and of their
intended dealing toward him; And withal, that the Kingdom of Scotland does
reckon their stability and happiness, to depend upon the safety and
preservation of his Majesty's royal person, and are resolved that no
alteration of affairs, shall ever separate them from the duty and allegiance
they owe unto his Majesty, nor from their constant resolution to live in all
Loyalty under his Government, then if they proceed really in this way they have
begun, it will bring in all the Covenanters of both Kingdoms to the royal
Party, and make their fingers itch to be in action against the adverse Party,
now predominant in the Houses and Army.

Lastly, since God has been pleased so to provide for the good of these
Kingdoms, and the safety of his Majesty, that he has thus cleanly escaped
their hands, and thereby the Army has lost their maine advantage in the
possession of his Person, and that his Majesty has retired himself, and has
freedom to show himself in the head of any party when a happy opportunity
shall be offered; Then if the Houses and Army shall persist still in their
horrible extremities, without all hope of a reasonable accommodation, it is the
duty of all men whose consciences are touched but with a spark of honesty, to
assist him with their utmost endeavors, against the rigorous demands and
dealings of unreasonable and cruel men, enemies to him as he is a King,
enemies likewise to the Kingdom, and professed enemies to all regular Forms of
Government; From whom good Lord deliver him, and set an end to his affliction.

Vive le ROY.
FINIS.
