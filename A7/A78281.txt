THE CASE OF WALTER DELAMAR, Gent.
HIS Majesty the 19th Day of October, 1696. in Consideration of a Fine of about
700 l. Sterling, made a Lease to the said Delamar of some Forfeited Lands in
Ireland for Twenty One Years, at and under an improved Rent of 9 l. 16 s. 9 d.
Sterling per annum, over and above the Quit-rents and Crow-rents, amounting
Yearly to 55 l. 13. s. 2 d.

That before the said Lease was made, the said Lands were set by the
Commissioners of Forfeitures on the Public Cant or Auction to the highest
Bidder, and the allowance to be made the said Delamar, in Consideration of the
said Fine, was ascertained by the King's Auditor-General.

That at the time of making the said Lease, the Encumbrances appearing to the
Commissioners of Forfeitures to be due on the said Lands, amounted but to about
120 l. per annum.

That since the making thereof, there is a Dower of near 500 Acres of the
Premises recovered and taken away from the said Delamar; and another Debt of
200 l. placed on the same, over and above the said former Encumbrances of 120
l. per annum; and thereby the said Delamar is so much a loser of what was
intended for him, and he contracted for.

That on the Credit of the said Lease, several Considerable Sums to the Value
of about 1000 l. are laid out in improving the same: So that he and his
Numerous Family will be utterly undone, unless Relieved by the Equity and
Charity of the Honorable House of Commons.

That there is not any other Lease of this kind made in the Kingdom of Ireland;
and it appears by the Commissioners Report that it was made in Consideration of
this Fine.

The said Delamar throws himself on the Mercy of this Honorable House for
Redress in this his Deplorable Condition, and humbly begs that his Case may be
considered; and will, without repining, submit to the Good Pleasure of so
August an Assembly.
