The Discourse between A Soldier and his Love.
Showing that she did bear a faithful mind,
For Land nor Sea could make her stay behind.
To the tune of Upon a Summer time.




Soldier. MY dearest dear adue,
since that I needs must go
My Fortunes to pursue
against some Fo^raine Foe.
Being that it is ^o,
I pray thee patient be,
And do not kilt thy Coat,
to go along with me.

Pegge. Alas my dearest heart,
if that thou leave me here,
Death kills me with his dart,
as plainly may appear.
For sorrow grief and smart,
will quickly make me dye,
Therefore I Will kilt my Coat,
and go along with thee.

Soldier. Over the dangerous Seas,
Whereto I must repair,
Will breed thee some disease,
and change thy color fair.
Therefore my Love forbear,
and well advised be,
And do not kilt thy Coat
to go along with me.

Pegge. There Is nothing can withstand,
a willing settled mind
There neither Sea nor Land
shall make me stay behind.
I think I were unkind,
to leave thy company:
Nay I will kilt my Coat
and go along with thee.

Soldier. Sweetheart let me persuade,
that thou will stay at home,
And mark what shall be said
as all to pass will come.
When we have past the Seas,
and come unto the Land,
Against our Enemies,
in Armor we must stand.

Pegge. Well I for one will stand,
Whilst that my life does last,
And fight with heart and hand,
till dangers are ore past.
And then I will releive
thee in extremity,
Therefore I^e kilt my Coat,
and go along with thee.

The second part
to same tune.




Soldier. TO lie in open fields,
in time of Frost and Snow,
Without or house or shields,
where bitter blasts do blow.
It will thy body change,
my dear I tell to thee:
Then do not kilt thy Coat,
to go along with me.

Pegge. Sweetheart I do suppose,
all that you say is true,
I am as sure a cho^ce,
as I appear to you.
I think I were unkind
to leave thy company.
Therefore I Will kilt my Coat
and go along with thee.

Soldier. It is a dangerous thing,
my sweet, my fair, my dear,
To hear the Cannons ring,
like thunder in the air.
The sword, the Pike, the Spear,
the dreadful enemy:
Will much affright thy Coat
to go along with me.

Pegge. I Will lay all aside,
what ever may befall,
Whatsoever does betide
I Will verture life and all.
The matter were but small,
though for thy sake I dye,
Therefore Ill kilt my Coat,
and go along with thee.

Soldier. My griefs would still abound,
if I should see thee want,
Thy cries would still resound,
and make my heart to pant.
Swee^-heart let not thy mind,
be bent unto the sea,
Nor do not kilt thy Coat
to go along with me.

Pegge. Why, do thou not despair,
nor trouble so thy mind:
Howsoever I do fare
I Will take it as I find.
and I will thee comfort
in midst of thy woe:
Then do not say no more,
but yield that I may go.

Soldier. Then welcome with my heart
seeing thou will go with me
Thou playest as kind apart
as did Penelope,
Thou comfortst all my woes,
I Will have thy company:
Therefore love kilt thy Coat
and go along with me.
No Turtle to her mate,
could ever be more true,
For she with fortunes fate,
all dangers did pursue
She ventures lore and life,
most like a lover true:
God send me such a wife,
and so kind hearts adue.
