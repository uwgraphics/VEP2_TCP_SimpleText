In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.

Our Father which art in he^ven, hallowed be thy Name, Thy Kingdom come. Thy
will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses, (...) we forgive them (...) trespass against us.
And lead ^e not into temptation. But deliver us from evil,

Amen.
