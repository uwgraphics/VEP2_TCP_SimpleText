A PROCLAMATION FOR Setting apart a Day of Solemn and Public Thanksgiving
throughout the whole KINGDOM.
CHARLES R.

WHereas it has pleased Almighty God to manifest his own immediate Goodness,
Wisdom, and Power, in his late Providence toward Us, and Our Kingdoms,
wherein, beyond all Humane Deans and Contrivances, as well of Our Friends for
Us, as of Our Adversaries against Us, he has by the interposition of his own
Power and Wisdom, after a long and tedious Exile, returned Us home to Our
People, and, after a long, and seemingly invincible, Interruption, restored Our
People and Kingdoms to their ancient Rights. Liberties, and Government; and all
this brought about, by his most wise and overruling Hand, without any effusion
of Blood: But, instead thereof, filling the Hearts of Us, and Our People, as
full of mutual Love, Confidence, and Joy, as became such a Restitution of King
and People, whereby the Merry is not only advanced, but the hopes of most
happy consequences, thereupon, are increased: We cannot upon the due
consideration hereof, but with all humility admire and adore the Merry and
Goodness of God, in these his signal manifestations thereof; and we looked, and
still look upon them as invitations from Heaven to Us, and all Our People, unto
most entire Thankfulness for the same unto Almighty God, and public and
cheerful Expressions thereof.

And whereas in the midst of those Our considerations, both Our Houses of
Parliament by their Address of the One and twentieth of May last, have humbly
showed unto Us, That such is the inestimable blessing of Our Restitution to Our
Royal Throne, which at once has put a period to the Calamities of Three
Kingdoms, and to all the Sorrows and Sufferings of Our Royal Person and Family,
that they cannot but account it as an entrance into the state of Joy and
Happiness, which obliges all Our Subjects to render an Everlasting Tribute of
Praise and Thanksgiving to Almighty God, for these glorious Mercies to his
afflicted People.

And to the end, some solemn Time may be set apart for the public performance
of this Duty; and that all Our Subjects in England and Wales, and the Town of
Berwick upon Twede, do equally share in the joys of this Deliverance, may be
united in these Devotions, which are offered for it, They therefore humbly
beseeched Us, that We would be pleased by Our Royal Proclamation to set apart
some Day, for a public Thanksgiving throughout all these Our Dominions. We
willing that the just Tribute of Praise and Thanksgiving to Our Great Sovereign
the King of Heaven and Earth be returned by Us, and all Our People for these
his Deliverances and Mercies; and that as his Mercy is of Universal concernment
to Us and all Our Subjects, so, to the end, that the public Returns of Our
Praise to God, for the same, though it cannot equalize, yet it may in some
measure answer the amplitude of the Benefit.

We do hereby Publish and Declare, That the Twenty eight day of this instant
June, be set apart and observed as a day of Public Thanksgiving to Almighty
God, throughout Our Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of Berwick,
for this his great Mercy; and We do direct and appoint, that this Our
Proclamation be publicly read in all Churches and Chapels, on some Lords day,
precedent thereunto, to the end that notice be taken thereof, and due Thanks
and Praise may, upon the said Twenty eighth day of June, be offered up unto
Almighty God by Us and all Our People, with one Heart, and that humble
Supplications be poured out before him, for his continual Assistance and
Improvement of this and all his Mercies, to the honor of his great Name, and
the Safety, Peace and Benefit of all Our Kingdoms and Dominions. We willing and
strictly commanding all Persons within these Our Dominions, with all Sobriety,
Reverence, and Thankfulness, to set apart that Day to this Duty, and to observe
the same as becomes so solemn an occasion.
