ALL Gentlemen Merchants, and others, may please to take notice, That if they
send their Letters by the Old Post, they will have a Free and Safe Going and
Coming as formerly, and at the Lowest Rates: But if they send by those that
style themselves, The New-Vndertakers, Their Passage will be interrupted.
