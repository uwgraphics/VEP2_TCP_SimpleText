The Barkshire Lady's Garland,
The First Part.
Tune of, Slaves to London.
BAtchelers of every Situtation,
Mark this strange and true Relation,
Which in brief to you I bring,
Never was a stranger thing:
You shall find it worth your hearing
Loyal Lvoe is most indearing,
when it takes the deepest Root,
Yielding Gold and Charms to Boot.
Some will wed for store of Treasure,
But the sweetest Joy and Pleasure,
Is in faithful Love you will find,
Graced with a noble Mind.
Such a noble Disposition,
Had this Lady, with Submission;
Of whom I this Sonnet write,
Store of Wealth, and Beauty bright:
She had lest by a good Grannum,
Full five thousand Pound per Annum,
Which she hell'd without control;
Thus did she in Riches roll,
Though she had vast store of Riches
Which some Persons much bewitches,
Yet she bore a courteous mind,
Not the least to pride inclined.
Many noble Persons courted,
This Young Lady it is reported:
But their Labor proved in vain,
They could not her Favor gain:
Yet by Cupid's true assistance,
She was conquered after all;
How it was, declare I shall:
Being at a noble Wedding,
Near the famous Town of Reading,
A young genteel Man she saw,
Who belonged to the Law,
As she viewed his sweet Behavior,
T'ry courteous Carriage gave her
New Addition to her Grief;
Force she was to seek Relief.
Privately she then inquired,
About him, so much admired,
Both his Name, and where he dwelt,
Such was the hot Flames she felt.
Thenat Night this youthful Lady,
Called her Coach, which being ready;
Homeward straight she did return,
But her Heart in Flames did burn.
Part Second.
NIght and Morning for a Season,
In her Closet would she Reason
With herself, and often said,
Why has my Love my Heart betrayed?
I that have so many slighted,
Am at length as well requited,
For my Griess are not a few;
Now I find what Love can do.
He that has my Heart in keeping,
Though I for his sqake lie weeping,
Little knows what Grief I feel;
But i will try it out with Steel.
For I will a Challenge send him,
And appoint, where i will attend him
In a Grove without delay,
By the Dawning of the Day.
He shall not the least discover,
That I am a Virgin Lover,
By the Challenge which I send,
But for Justice I contend.
He has caused sad Distraction.
And I come for Satisfaction,
Which if he denis to give,
One of us shall sease Relief.
Having thus her Mind revealed,
she Letter closed and sealed;
Nwo when it came to his Hand,
The young Man was at a stand.
In her Letter she conjured him,
For to meet, and well assured him,
Recompense he must afford,
Or dispute it with a Sword.
Having read this strange Relation,
He was in a Consternation;
Then advising with his Friend,
He persuades him to attend.
Be of Courage, and make ready,
Faint Heart never won fair Lady;
In regard it must be so,
I along with you will go.
Part Third.
EArly on a Summer's Morning,
While bright Phoebus was adorning
Every Bower, with his Beams,
A fair Lady came it seems,
At the bottom of a Mountain,
Near a pleasant christial Fountain,
There she left her gilded Coach,
While the Grover she did approach.
Covered with her Mask, and walking,
There she met her Lover talking
With a Friend, that he had brought,
Straight she asked him who he sought.
I am Challenged by a Gallant,
You resolve to try my Tallant;
What he is, I cannot say,
But I hope to show him play.
Lady.] It is I, that did invite you!
You shall Wed me, or i will fight you
Underneath those spreading Trees,
Therefore choose you, which you please
You shall find I do not Vaper,
I have brought my trusty Rapier;
Therefore take your choice, says she,
Either fight, or Marry me.
Said he, Madam, pray what mean ye,
In my Life I never have seen ye:
Pray unmask, your Visage show,
Then i will tell you, aye or no?
L.] I will not my Face uncover,
Till the Marriage rights are over;
Therefore choose now which you will,
Wed me, Sir, or try your skill.
Step within that pleasant Bower,
With your Friend one single Hour,
Strive your Thoughts to reconcile,
And i will wander here the while.
While the charming Lady waighted,
The young Bachelor debated,
Quoth his Friend The hazard run.
If my Judgment may be trusted,
Wea her, Sir, you cannot be worsted:
If she is rich you will rise to Fame;
If she is poor, why, you're the same.
He consented to be married,
In the Coach they all was carried,
To a Church without delay
Where he Weds the Lady gay,
Those sweet pretty Cupids hovered
Round her Eyes; her face was covered
With a Mask, he took her thus,
Just for better, or for worse.
With a courteous kind Behavior,
She presents his Friends a Favor;
And withal dismissed him straight,
That he might no longer wait.
Part Fourth.
AS the gilded Cocach stood ready,
The young Lawyer and his Lady,
Rid together till they came
To her House of state and same.
Which appeared like a Castle,
Where he might behold a parcel
Of young Ceaders tall and straight,
Just before her Palace-gate.
Hand in Hand they walked together,
To a Hall, or Parlour rather,
Which was Beautiful and fair,
All alone she left him there.
Two long Hours there he waited,
Her return, at length he fretted;
And began to grieve at last,
For he had not broke his fast,
Still he sat like one amazed,
Round a spacious Room he gazed,
Which was richly beautified,
But, alas, he would lost his Bride.
There was peeping laughing, fleering,
All within the Lawyers hearing;
But his Bride he could not see,
Would I was at home thought he.
While his Heart was melancholy,
Said, the Steward, brisk and jolly,
Tell me Friend, how came you here,
You have some design I fear?
He replied, Dear loving Master,
You shall meet with no Disaster,
Through my means in any case,
Madam, brought me to this place,
Then the Steward did retire,
Saying, That he would enquire
Wherthe it was true or no;
Never was Lover hampered so
Now the Lady who had filled him
With those Fears, full well beheld him
From a Window, where she dressed,
Pleased at the pleasant jest,
When she had herself attired,
In rich Robes to be admired;
Like a moving Anlge bright,
She appeared in his sight.
L.] Sir, my Servants have related
How you have some hours waited
In my Parlour, tell me who,
In my House you ever knew.
Madam, if I have offended,
It was more than I Intended;
A young Lady brought me here:
That is true, said she, my Dear,
I can be no longer cruel,
To my Joy and only Jewel;
Thou art mine, and I am thine,
Hand and Heart I do resign.
Once I was thy wounded Lover,
Now those Fears are clearly over,
By receiving what I gave,
Thou art Lord of all have.
Beauty, honor, love and treasure,
A rich Golden stream of Pleasure,
With his Lady he enjoys,
Thanks to Cupid's kind decoys.
Now he is clothed in rich Attire,
Not Inferior to a 'Squire;
Beauty, honor, riches store,
What can Man desire more,
Enter acording to Order.
