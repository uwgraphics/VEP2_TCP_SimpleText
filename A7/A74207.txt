THE HUMBLE PETITION, OF The peaceful, obedient, religious, and honest
Protestants of this Kingdom, presented unto the Honorable House of Commons,
by Doctor Hynton, in their behalf the 7. day of January, 1641.
THat you will be pleased to reflect upon the divine Service of God, according
to the ancient laws of this kingdom, that thereby the poor Protestants
between the two extremities of zeal may not suffer a disturbance of their
religion.

That you will be pleased to preserve Gods anointed his immediate Vicegerent
our true and lawful Sovereign Lord the King, in his person in all his Regal
Dignities and lawful immunities without any impeachment of his Regality in
whose honor the reputation of the Kingdom depends.

That you will be pleased to ratify and confirm all things both concerning
His Majesty and the state of this Kingdom as they were in those blessed days
of Queen Elizabeth and King James, that we may thereby live in these latter
and turbulent times; with as much peace to our consciences, with as much
dignity to our Nation, in as true love and obedience to our lawful Sovereign,
and with as much liberty and liberality of our fortunes as our forefathers
heretofore have done.

That you will not suffer Learning to be defaced nor discountenanced by the
ignorant, but rather that you will be pleased to advance it to its Dignity, it
being the maine supporter of lawful obedience, of order, civility, and
regularity in all States.

That you will be pleased to qualify the exorbitancies of the Separatists and
unworthy persons, that thereby the City of London and the Suburbs may be
disburdened from their continual cares and fears, besides their loss of
time, healths, and fortunes, which the Trainebands, and the double and treble
Watches and Wards continually do sustain.

That you will be pleased, as the State has by election both made you members
of this Honorable House, and adopted you our Fathers to govern our fortunes,
to establish our Laws, and to regulate our actions: so we now beseech you to
satisfy our consciences, to preserve our reputations, and to admit of a
liberal and free debate in Parliament, concerning all these particulars,
without interruption that thereby the glory of God may be exalted, the dignity
of our King and Kingdom preserved, the immunities of the House according to
the ancient custom of England continued, all precipitated tumults appeased,
all discords amongst us peacefully united, the valiant and renouned acts of our
predecessors revived, our tottering fortunes established, our King and Kingdom
united; that so our minds and consciences may be fully satisfied. etc.
