A CITIE-DOG IN A Saints Doublet: A missive to the Sage Common-Councell-men of
London, who now they can neither will nor choose; are willing to have his
Majesty to London.

To the Rebel City.

Strumpet disloyal to thy Sovereigns Throne,
Famous for thy base prostitution;
Thou have not yet for thy vile loosnesse smarted,
But when the Bawdes at Westminster are carted,
Thou shall be whipped, whipped till thy shoulders bleed,
Justice has sworn it, Fates have so decreed.
Thou have these seven years (base slut) and more
Been to each Iunto-man a common Whore;
And now thou see thy Paramours must fall,
Their strength and stock being vaded, past recall,
Now to thy husband to whom thou were wed,
Thou art in hope to be re-married;
He in the Isle of Wight though bolted in
By revelation, knows thy cursed sin,
And is resolved nere more to bed with thee,
And so, though London was, yet York may be.
Printed in the Year. 1648.

A City-Dog in a Saints Doublet.
WIth what Furies the Rebels were first inspired, and with what madness the
Citizens of London were possessed, when they first mutually covenanted to
rebel against their most gracious King, is now obvious to all men, now that
the vizor of their dark projections is plucked off, and the deformity of their
intents pointed at by children; so that they can no longer deceive the Kingdom
with shadows, or feed them with painted meat, unless they run the hazard, (I
mean both Junto and City) the one party to be haled out by the ears, and
carted to Tyburne with violence; and the other to have their throats eut, and
their houses fired about their ears, they are (temerity, and not loyalty,
persuading them thereto) contented, that their Babell be demolished, and the
stones and timber thereof swept into the Sea, least the children of Beliall
that should fucceed, should employ them a second time to the defacing of Gods
glorious Worship, the nulling of the fundamental and known Laws of the Land,
the overthrow of Monarchical Government, (the lively representative of the
Government amongst the Angels) and to the murdering, impoverishing and
ruining of a free, and if not incensed by Factionists, of themselves, a calm
and quiet people, as by lamentable experience has been verified amongst us of
the English Nation for these seven years.

For which thanks Isaac Pennington to thee,
And the rest of thy sweet Fraternity:
Pim broacht the But of Wormwood, Brooks drew out,
And drank a health to Cromwell and his Snout;
To Essex and his branchers grown so high,
They bore up Cynthia, as she friskt in the sky:
To thee for ever nulling of the Laws,
And to the happy thriving of the Cause,
To the confusion of all Discipline,
All ancient Orders Moral and Divine.
To the freedom of the brothers, and their Trubs,
The metamorphosing Pulpits into Tubs
For reverend Symkin, that reformed Translator,
The Sisters and the Gospells propagater,
Who with the Toiler Wood-house, can with ease
Cut out a new Religion if he please,
To mount aloft, and there unto the Rabble
Pure nonsense, blasphemy, and treason babble:
For Wiggs the Vintner and his headman Fouch,
Who each day can a new Religion broach;
For Tate the Druggist, as he will to vary,
And Wilkins the divine Apothecary.
For M. Edge the Haberdasher Rock,
His journey-man to put on any block;
The Cutler Ask when Farrington is gone,
Can furbush over a new Religion:
Needome the Dier, when he list to err,
Can take Religion and new color her;
So can Tomkins the Painter, but it is true,
His varnish makes her ugly unto view:
Fowler the Draper too takes a great pleasure,
Religion by his own yard to measure;
So Finch the Mercer, but there is some do tell
The Scripture gives a yard, he takes an ell,
The Weaver Robinson whose beard does bloome,
Can cast Religion upon any Loome.
Hoskins the Mariner while his brains does rock
Can bring Religion into any Dock:
Carew the Barber, (not one like to him)
Can as he list Religion shave and trim.
The Gardner Elverton who is forced to hop
On wooden legs, yet can Religion crop;
The Blacksmith Day, most zealously does urge,
And without fire can a Religion forge.
But to our matter, Brooks drank deep to all,
Who sought Religion, King, and Kingdoms fall:
Penington pledged him, and so liked the the cup
Of deadly Aconite he quaft it up;
Draw out apace quoth Brooks, we will now begin
Our Mask since we have drawn the City in;
Quoth Atkins, now let us aim above our reaches,
And then the first time he beshit his breeches:
Fairfax with fancies tickled, skip'd about,
For then he was not troubled with the Gout,
Though since the pockey humor seized on him,
And now feeds on his bones in every limb.
The Fuckster Martin tripping on his toe
Among painted whores in his Seraglio,
When he heard of the thriving of the plot,
Cried now my Ducks we will have the the other pot,
And the other pleasant skirmish on the bed,
Since now my hopes cannot be Cuckolded:
Then all the reverent Ganders of the City,
Incorporated with the State-Committee,
Most zealous cock-braind, sottish, factious elves
Plotted the way how to undo themselves,
Which soon they did contrive, and now would feign
Have Discipline and Orders once again:
And Warners Worship has plucked out the sting,
And says, he wishes, that there were a King.
The clouds are dispelled, that have so long hovered betwixt truth and the
peoples eyes, and they perceive that the great Law-making Court is quite
metamorphosed to Polemicall Committees, and to a Council of War, who seize on
their lives and persons at their pleasures, and who no sooner hear that a man
is rich, but he is made capable of death for his goods, who are so far from
hearing, much less redressing the grievances of the people, that one may go
from one Tropic to the other, and cross the Equinoctial twenty times ere a
Petition tending to the peace of the Kingdom, can be taken into consideration;
had the rebellious Devils at Westminster, and the deluded Factionists of the
City confined the fire of Reformation in the funnell of the chimney, and
appointed some to sweep down the foot, there needed not have been that shooting
up of Muskets, whereby the whole house is in danger of burning. I confess the
common people will still be common people, they will sometime or other show what
they are, and vent their instable passions, and I conclude, that men will be men
while there is a world, and as long as the Moon has an influxious power to
make impressions upon their humors, they will be ever greedy and covetous of
novelties and mutation, I also very well know, that Kingdoms, States and Cities
and all bodies politic are subject to convulsions, to Calentures and
Consumptions, as well as the frail bodies of men, and must have an evacuation
for their corrupt humors, and may perhaps be Phlebotomized; but I would not
have the emblem of innocence, the decent garment for the Ministry, called the
Surplice, the unquestionable Book of Common Prayer so perfectly agreeable unto
the Word of God, and the same in effect which has been for more then five
hundred years in the Church of Christ, which has been so hated by the several
Popes, and their Conclaves, and have been so esteemed of by the Martyrs, for
instance, M. John Hallien fellow of Kings College in Camebridge, who was
Martyred in Q. Mary's days, Anno. 1557. and being at the stake amongst many
other books that were thrown into the fire unto him, it happened that the
Common Prayer Book fell between his hands, which he joyfully receiving opened
it and read till the smoke and flame suffered him not to read any more, and
then he fell to Prayers holding his hands up to heaven, and the book between
his arms next his heart, thanking God for that mercy in sending him it; I say,
I would not have the Surplice so decent, the Common Prayer Book so holy, and
the other indifferent Ceremonies of the Church, be the occasion of rebellious
combustions, and bloodshed, to beat Religion into men's brains with a Poleax,
is to offer victims of humane blood an acceptable service to Molech, but not to
Messiah: but as the excellent Tragedian Webster makes Francisco speak in his
white Devil Divinity wrested by some factious blood,
Draws swords, swells battles, and destroys all good.


Thus far permit me serious, now I shall come to my Cozens of the City a second
time, and perhaps be too much sportive, ye fools and madmen who envied your own
quiet, and like some of your lightheeld wives, when conceived of a -- even
longed for a mutation of your estates, you have been apt to rebel in all ages
on all occasions, but your forefathers never mutinied on so slender grounds,
as you have done, tell me my fine Wittolls, was it not better to have the
Government of the Church by Archbishops and Bishops, then to have no Church at
all? or at least, managed by those who know not how to write their names,
preach printed Sermons, and who edify none but your wives after bathings and
Sack-possits. Was it not better to have a King to reign over you, whose
clemency you had so ample experience of, who denied you no immunities requisite
for you to ask, and convenient for him to grant, then to have a house full of
Emperors, who sit from morn till night, and stretch their inventions upon the
tenters how to bridle and saddle you, and not be kicked, and to screw money out
of your purses, and not have you imagine they hoord it up for themselves, who
have made you these seven years their Sumpter-horses to bear their coin, their
stairs on which they have ascended to the top of their hopes, (though now they
have fallen from top to bottom, so that their backs are broke) their Bawds, for
it is well known that some of them have entered into your wives Closets, while
you have been calling customers into your shops; are you there Mildmay? I meant
not you Sir, for I know you hate laced mutton more then Martin does a Curtezan,
what need I tell you of M. Rogers his wife, since you so well know her already?
my spruce Cits you must know, that Tom Fairfax has the Gout, which will hinder
his ascent unto a throne, and Nol Cromwell the iron Saint has taken his
progress into the other world; Poyer has given him his pass, so that if
yours and the Juntoes cursed plot to poison his Majesty with a perfumed suit of
clothes, or to mingle poison in his usual beveridge, had taken its wished
effect, a hundred to one, but you had involved your selves in a new war about
the Crown, each thinking himself worthy to be a King.

Warner I Will warrant you, Would think it vain,
To weild a Scepter, though he wear a chain;
And reverend Atkins sure has learnt mo^e wit,
For fear his royal garments he --.
Though Skippon stalk about with stately pace,
Yet sure the Mushrump has attained more grace
Then for to wish a power over all,
It Is best still to be Major-Generall
Of lice and fleas; to lead the boys about,
And with his staff of office, bang the rout.
Or would you, have some Lord, whose worthy merit,
Bespeaks him fit Prince Charles to disinherit,
Las my Sord Say had rather still dispose
Affairs, and lead the faction by the nose,
Till he has shown them Machavillian Play,
And brought them to the whirlpool of decay,
For Wharton, he would not be Sovereign,
For fear he fall into a pit again;
Not like the Sawpit, into which he fell,
But one as may Mount Aetna parallel,
My Lord of Kent would sure scorn the motion,
Since to his guts he has so much devotion
That his great belly goes beyond its verge,
And struts more then the tun at Heildeberge.
But would you have the man that rides the Moon,
Or he that is naught but name great Algernoon,
Alas he dares not for his Ribbon cracks
His George is broken and a -- lacks,
Nor will the Sea-gull Warwick be a King,
Seeing the Seamen will have no such thing;
His Lordship has no list to hunt for Crowns,
Since his crown 'scap'd a cracking on the Downs.
For Denbigh he gapes when the plum will fall,
When Fairfax dies he must be General,
Although he wish the King were surely dead,
The only mean that can keep on his head.
To conclude, ye Serpentine Cuckolds of the Common Counsel, and ye cuckolly
Serpents of the City, now after all your Rebellions, Treasons and Impiety,
after you have sold your selves to do mischief, abused God, King, Kingdom and
your selves, bought and paid for your -- Treacheries at the price of many
millions, used all ways and means to take away Kingly Government, to kill your
King and disinherit his posterity, to set up a crew of Rebels and mechanical
Traitors in the manner of a State, who suck the heart bloods of the people, and
esteem it their chief glory to be cruel, impious and irreligious, after you
have permitted the bloodhounds at Westminster, yea and backed them while they
have murdered, Imprisoned and plundered all his Majesty's loyal Servants and
friends, I say after all this now that you see your Dagon State must fall
before the Ark of the Lord his Anointed one, our dread Sovereign Lord King
Charles, now you are contented (since you can neither will nor choose) that his
Majesty be admitted to London with honor, freedom, and safety. O you Dogs in
Saints Doublets, now you are very tender of his Majesty's Person, and are
very scrupulous least his Prerogative be abridged: Curse upon you, do you
imagine the Kings heart so flexible, that Justice will permit him ere to look
upon you with a gracious eye?

No you cursed Cuckolds know your Charters gone,
Quite forfeited for your Rebellion;
And you shall be the Subject of each pen,
Characterizing you basest of men.
FINIS.
