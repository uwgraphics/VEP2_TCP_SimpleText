Masters, Collectors, Officers and Soldiers, 5. of July 1649.
THE Estates of Parliament taking into their serious consideration the manifold
grievances and complaints within the Kingdom against Masters, for oppressing
their Tenants in outreiks of horse and foot, payment of the monthly
Maintenance, and in Quarterings, as also against Officers and Soldiers, and
Collectors of moneys for their disorderly carriage and unjust dealing. For
remedy and redress herein, they do Statute and Ordain, I. That the several
Presbyteries send in to the Committee of Estates, a list of nine or ten
understanding and conscientious men, that upon consideration thereof, and such
other Information as shall be given to the Committee of Estates concerning
these or any other persons, they may make choice of five or six, to employ in
that trust, and any three of them to have power to do and put in execution all
things within the bounds of each Presbytery, which are referred to them by this
Parliament, and that all grievances and complaints for wrongs done since the
first of October last, or which shall be committed in time coming, being such
as are by this Act referred to them by the Parliament, shall be presented to the
said persons so nominated and chosen, and that the person first nominated in
the Commission, shall conveen the rest at their first meeting, and take their
oaths for the faithful discharge of their duty, and then the next in
Commission shall take his Oath; and that thereafter they meet at such times and
places as they shall think fit, That they shall have power to conveen all
persons interessed within the bounds of the Presbytery before them, to take the
Oaths of parties, and to examine witness upon Oath, when they shall see it
needful, and that all Officers and Soldiers shall be assistant to them upon
their direction for executing the power committed to them. II. That in all
Levies of horse, the Tenant shall only furnish a sufficient man, and shall be
free of all charge and expense whatsomever, unless they be rentallers or
others, who have lands set unto them under the known worth and value, in which
case, the Commissioners of each Presbytery to be chosen as aforesaid, shall
have power to determine what shall be the proportion of the rentaller or others
aforesaid, according to the ease they have of the land under the known value;
Consideration being had what the tenant gave to the master at his entry to the
lands together with the yearly duty and service; And that no rentaller, nor
other aforesaid, shall be liable to the payment of any part of the said Levy,
but upon decree of the Commissioners aforesaid, and that the heritors in the
interim put forth the Levy; It being always understood, that where rentallers
are already valued, distinct from the heritors by the Comissioneres appointed
for the valuation of the shire that they shall pay conform to their valuation
III. That in the Levies of foot the master shall find arms, and pay the
advance or loan money, and that the tenant shall only find a sufficient man,
and shall give unto him that shall go forth the sum appointed by act of
Parliament to be given by tenants, unless they be rentallers or others before
mentioned, in which case, the said Commissioners shall determine as aforesaid
what shall be their proportion. IV. That no master shall for benefit, spleen or
private revenge, put forth any tenant of senyant in Levies, but that where
there is any such complaint, the Commissioners aforesaid shall Judge of the
fitness of the person. V That the Monethlie maintenance shall only be paid by
the master, and the tenant to be free, unless they be rentallers or others as
aforesaid, in which case, the Comissioners are to determine their proportions
as is before expressed. VI. That all quarterings, whether local or transeunt
shall be allowed in payment of the Monthly maintenance in manner following, viz.
that the master, or such as have power from the master to do his affairs,
shall deliver to the Collector a certificate, subscribed by two of the
Comissioners aforesaid, that he has allowed to his tenants the said
quarterings (which are also to be instructed according to the Act of
Parliament) in their maill or yearly rent and duty, and given them discharge
for the same, before he get allowance of the quarterings in payment of the
monthly maintenance, and that the Collector deliver the said certificate to the
General Comissary; Or in case the master refuse to give the said certificate to
the Collector, that then the collector bring two of the Comissioners
certificate of the master his refusal, and if the Collector shall fail herein,
that then he make account to the General Commissarie, for the whole monthly
maintenance, without any deduction for quarterings, and that the Comissioners
take care that the masteres so refussing do allow the said quarterings to the
tenant in their maill and duties. VII And because quarterings upon particular
persons, may exceed their proportion of the monthly maintenance, It is
therefore statute and ordained, that the Collector of every shire shall make
payment to all such persons as shall be so overburdened with quarterings out of
the monthly maintenance of the shire, at the direction of the committee of
war; And if the whole monthly maintenance of any shire shall be exhausted, that
then the general Commissarie shall make payment to them for the said quarterings
out of the monthly maintenance of other shires whose maintenance is not
exhausted by quarterings. And in case any master shall thrall his tenants, and
force them to lay out any moneys in levyes otherwise then according to the
directions of the Parliament, or being desired, shall not allow them the
maintenance when they have been necessitated to pay the same for their masters,
or quarterings, not exceeding the Maintenance, The Estates of Parliament do
Declare, that upon probation thereof before the said Comissioners (the master
for so doing shall beside restitution to the tenant) pay as much to the
Comissioners for the use of the public. VIII. That where tenants have not
concurred in James Grahams rebellion, or been accessorie to the late unlawful
Engagement against England, or the late Rebellion in the north, but have
suffered therein, effectual course be taken for their ease and relief, that it
be not in their masters power to oppress and destroy them; And that the losses
of all such tenants as have suffered for their affection (there masters being
guilty of any of the Crimes aforesaid) be cognosced and tried before the said
Comissioners, and what allowance and deduction shall be decerned by them, to be
retained from their aforesaid masters (guilty as said is) shall be a sufficient
exoneration and discarge to them of the mails and duties pro tanto, and is to
be so allowed by all and whatsoever Judges before whom the said duties are to
be pursued. And that the master be not permitted to pursue them for these
duties before their own Courts, and if the master shall do otherwise, the tenant
to have repetition pro tanto, provided, that nothing herein contained, shall
extend to infringe any capitulation approven by Parliament. IX. That all
Collectors of moneys within shyres have testificats of their honesty and
fidelity from the Presbytery, and subcollectors from the sessions where they

upon any for their deficiencie in payment of public dues, unless they have ane
warrant for the same, under the Collectors hand, or have order from the
Committee of Estates or General Commissarie: And if any collector or officer
do otherwise, that he shall be cashiered and removed. XI That if any
Collector shall exact more from any master or tenant, then the just proportion,
or shall cause them make twice payment of the same sum, that he shall pay the
double thereof to the persons whom he has so wronged, and not only be removed
from his office, but shall be declared incapable of any trust hereafter; likeas
if any Collector shall refuse to allow quarterings from the first of this
month, being rightly instructed, and within the monthly maintenance he shall
be punished in the same manner, and this is without prejudice of the Act of
Parliament for relief of preceding quarterings. XII That if any officer or
soldier shall exact money by paction or otherwise from any master or tenant
to Burgh or land beside their pay, viz. in time coming twelve pence for the
trooper, and six pence for the foot soldier, or shall plunder any goods, that
he shall repay the double unto them, forfeit all his arrears to the public, be
cashiered with disgrace, and declared incapable of any trust hereafter, and
shall be further punished according to the Articles of war. XIII That in case
any officer or soldier, shall force master or tenant to Burgh or land, to give
him a discharge when he has paid no money, or less, then his quarterings
extend to, or shall offer any violence against Master or tenant, by beating
them or otherwise, the same Punnishment shall be inflicted on him. XIIII. That
