HIS MAJESTY'S SPEECH In the House of Commons, 4o Januarii 1641.
Gentelemen,
I Am sorry for this occasion of coming unto you: yesterday I sent a Sergeant
at Arms upon a very important occasion, to apprehend some that by my command
were accused of high Treason, whereunto I did expect Obedience, and not a
Message. And I must declare unto you here, that albeit no King that ever was in
England shall be more careful of your PRIVILEGES, to maintain them to the
uttermost of his power then I shall be; yet you must know, that in cases of
Treason no person has a privilege, and therefore I am come to know if any of
those persons that were accused are here; for I must tell you, Gentlemen, that
so long as these persons that I have accused (for no slight crime, but for
Treason) are here, I cannot expect that this House can be in the right way that
I do heartily wish it: Therefore I am come to tell you, that I must have them
wheresoever I find them; well, sithence I see all the Birds are flown, I do
expect from you, that you shall send them unto me as soon as they return
hither: But I assure you, in the word of a King, I never did intend any force,
but shall proceed against them in a legal and fair way, for I never meant any
other.

And now sithence I see I cannot do what I came for, I think this no unfit
occasion to repeat what I have said formerly; That whatsoever I have done in
favor, and to the good of my Subjects, I do mean to maintain it.

I will trouble you no more, but tell you, I do expect as soon as they come to
the House, you will send them to me, otherwise I must take my own course to
find them.

FINIS.
