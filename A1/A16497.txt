plainly, and breifely declared, whereby such as are ignorant may be helped, to
hear Sermons with profit, to read the Bible or other books with judgment,
to receive the Lords Supper with comfort, to discern between truth and error,
with understanding, and to give an answer to their Minister, or any other that
shall ask them a reason of their faith, with readiness.

TO THE RIGHT Worshipful his very good Patron, Mr. Henry Hall Esquire, one
of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace and Quorum in the County of Kent; and to
the truly Pious, and Religious Gentlewoman, Ms. Jane Hall his Wife: All
Felicity, Internal, External, Eternal.
THE saying of one (Right Worshipful) is most true: French hist. 1187.
Compare vice with vice, and evil with evil: Ingratitude is the most odious
and the worst. Vitium omnium Theodoric. dom. 14. post. trin. p. 2. d. 3.
Ingratum si dixeris omnia dixeris.
teterrimorum teterrimum, of all foulest vices the most foul, admitting no
parallel. And yet notwithstanding, it is the common vice of this vicious, and
flagitious age of ours: a Gangrene that has diffused it self far and near.
Para. in Genesis 1970. b.
Turpissima ingratitudine plerique omnes obliterare solent beneficia accepta.
It is the guise of the most, with filthy ingratitude to obliterate received
favors. Injuries are engraven in brass, but benefits are written upon the
waters: And Genesis 40.23.
Pharaohs Butler has but too many consorts, who remember not, but forget their
Joseph's, their benefactors. My desire is not to be found in this list: And
therefore I am bold to present you with this poor oblation. A poor present I
confess to gratify them withal, to whom I am so deeply engaged. It Is but a
silly mite, I owe you many talents, yea (as Hieron. Sophron.
Hierom sometime said to one) and quae possum, and quae non possum, both what I
can, and what I cannot, make tender of. And such are your merits toward me,
that (as Effecisti vt viuerem and morerer ingratus. Senec. lib. 2. de benef.
cap. 25.
Furnius once to Caesar) I must live and die ingrate. Howbeit, whatsoever it
is, be pleased to vouchsafe it your favorable acceptance, as a Symboll and
Testimony of my grateful mind, and dutiful respect toward you both; for your
great undeserved favors. In confidence whereof (not meaning to tire you with a
tedious incult Epistle) I humbly take my leave, and rest

Your Worships most obliged, and in the Lord ever to be commanded, John
Boughton.

God and Man.
Jacob. WHat is Catechizing?


Benjamin. It is a plain 1 Cor. 3.1.2. and 14.19. Nehem 8.8.
familiar, and brief declaring by lively voice, of the Heb 5.12. and 6.1.
Principles of Christian Religion, out of the Acts 18.28. and 28.23. 2 Timothy
4.2. Exodus 12 26 and 13.8. Deuteronomy. 6.6 etc. 2 Pet. 1 21.
Scripture or Word of God.


I. Who was the author of this form of teaching?


B. Even God himself.


I. Has it been of any long continuance in the Church of God?


B. Yes surely, it was diligently used in the times of the Gal 6.6. The
original word is Catechize. Heb 5 12, 13. and 6.1. 1 Pet. 3.21.
Primitive Church, and in the days of the Apostles themselves: yea, even the
Genesis 19, 19. Exodus 12 26. Deuteronomy. 6, 7, 8.
Fathers of the first world, long before Christ's Incarnation, after this manner
instructed their families, and such as were under their tuition, charge, and
government.


I. What profit or benefit does there arise from this kind of teaching?


B. The benefit which may be reaped hereby, is very great and manifold: 1 Pet.
3.15.
For first it will enable us to give a ready answer to any man that shall ask
us a reason of our Faith.

Heb. 5.12.
Secondly, it will greatly help us to understand, remember, and profit by the
Scriptures. Our people, for the most part, are rude and vncatechised: and
therefore they profit little or nothing by Sermons. A Sermon to such persons,
is like a great loaf ser before a Child. M. Perk. in Gal. c. 4 v. 20. 1 These
5.21. Heb. 5.14. 1 John 4.1. 1 Cor. 11.29.


Thirdly, to hear the Word of God preached with much more fruit and commodity
to our souls, then otherwise we should do.

Fourthly, to try what we hear or read, and readily to discern true Doctrine
from that which is false, and erroneous.

Fifthly, it will much further our due and worthy receiving the Lords Supper: to
the which none ought to be admitted before they be skilled in the grounds of
our holy Faith, neither without some competent knowledge thereof, can any with
comfort be partaker of it,

Sixthly, it is the high and ready way to bring to sound and settled knowledge;
to the which, Heb. 5.11, 12. 2 Timothy 3.7.
whosoever is vncatechised in the Principles of Religion, can never attain,
but will be ever learning, and ever ignorant.

Lastly, 1 Chronicles. 28.9 Deuteronomy. 17, 18. Pro. 22.6. Matthew. 22.29. Acts 3.17. Rom
3.11.12. Ephesians. 4.17, 18, 19.
it is a sovereign preservative against all infection of error, impiety, and
profaneness; and a most effectual means to maintain the purity of sound
Doctrine.


I. Is this exercise necessary only for children and youth?


B. No, but also for men of years and aged persons, who either through their
Deuteronomy. 20.18, 19. etc.
own default in their youth, or Pro 22.6. Ephesians 6.4. Genesis 18, 19. Deuteronomy. 4.10.
theirs that should have seeene them better brought up, are oftentimes but 1
Cor 3.2. and 15.34. Heb. 5.11, 12. Ioh. 3.10.
children, yea, babes in understanding, and such as have need of milk, not of
strong meat, scarce knowing one foot of the way to Heaven, when almost both
their feet are in the grave.


I. Is it not therefore the duty of every Minister, diligently to use this holy
exercise among his people, as well as Preaching?


B. Yes, questionless, and greatly it is to be wished, that Gal. 6.6. 1 Cor.
3.2. Heb. 5.12. and 6.1
al of that sacred function would make conscience constantly so to do, the
neglect hereof being one maine principal reason, why many of rare and most
worthy gifts, though they preach often and with great zeal, yet see little or
not fruit of al their travel: for who can erect a building, where Luke 6.48.49
and 14.29. 1 Cor. 3.10.
the foundation upon which it should stand, is not first firmly laid?


I. Why say you, that Catechizing is a declaring of the Principles of Religion,
out of the Scripture or Word of God?


B. Esaias 8.20. Acts 17.11. 1 Cor. 11.23. 2 Timothy 4.2, 3.
Because nothing is to be delivered nor received for a Principle of Religion or
true Doctrine, which has not foundation in this Word, or is not contained
therein.


Scripture.
I. What call you the Scripture or Word of God?


B. All John 5 39. Matthew. 22.29. Luke 24.27. Ephesians 2.20.
those Books of the Old and New Testament, penned by holy Luke 1.7. Ioh.
16.13. 2 Timothy 3 16. 2 Pet. 1.19 20.21.
men of God, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost; commonly called the Bible.


I. Which be the Canonical Books of the Old Testament?


B. They may be divided into three orders. The first contains Historical
books, being narrations of things done: which are, Genesis, Exodus, Leuiticus,
Numbers, Deuteronomie, the book of Joshua, Judges, Ruth, two books of Samuel,
two of the Kings, two of the Chronicles, the books of Ezra, Nehemiah, Hester,
and Job.

The second are Doctrinall books, teaching divine Doctrines and Precepts.
These are the books of the Psalms, of the Proverbs, of the Preacher or
Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs or the Canticles.

The third comprehends Prophetical books, foretelling things to come, whereof
some are greater: namely, the Prophecy of Esaias, Jeremy, whereunto belongs his
Lamentation, Ezekiel and Daniel: Some smaller, to wit, Hosea, Joel, Amos,
Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahu^, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and
Malachie; all which were written in the Hebrew tongue.


I. Which be the divine Canonical books of the New Testament?


B. They are distinguished into three ranks or orders. The first contains
Historical books, which are five: The Gospel of S. Matthew, Mark, Luke and
John; and the Acts of the Apostles. The second is, of Epistles which are twenty
one in number: one to the Romans, two to the Corinthians, one to the
Galathians, one to the Ephesians, one to the Philippians, one to the
Colossians, two to the Thessalonians, two to Timothy, one to Titus, one to
Philemon, one to the Hebrews; of James one, of Peter two, of John three, and
of Jude one. The third, one only Prophetical book, called the Apocalips or
Revelation of Saint John; which books were penned in the Greek tongue.


I. Are not Esdras, Tobit, Judith, and the other books, commonly joined in one
volume with the books before mentioned, and interiected between Malachy the
last of the small Prophets, and the Gospel of Saint Matthew, parts of the
Canonical Scripture and Word of God also, and of equal authority and credit
with the rest mentioned?


B. No surely, and therefore are not to be alleged for confirmation of any
Doctrine, or grounds of our faith, though they may be profitably read for
example of life, and instruction of manners.


I. What reasons can you render for the proof of that you say?


B. My reasons are these: First, Luke 16.29. and 24.27. 2 Pet. 1.19. Confer
these Scriptures with the Preface before Ecclesiasticus and 2. Macab. 2.23.
Also Malachie was the last Prophetical Writer, as may be collected by Malac.
4.5.6.
because they were not written by any of the Prophets, or such as were
immediately called of God.

Secondly, 2 Timothy 3.16. 2 Pet. 1.21 See the Prologue before Ecclesiasticus and
2. Maccab. 2.24.25.26. unto the end of the Chapter.
they came not by divine Inspiration.

Thirdly, there be many Apocryphal Ester Chap. 12.5, 6. and 15.7. compared
with Canonical Ester Chap. 6.3. and 3.1.2. etc. and 5.2. Tob. 5.12. and 12.15.
Judith 9.2 conferred with Genesis 49.5, 6, 7. Eccles. 46. ver. last, with Revel.
14.13. The History of Bell. ver. 31. Dan. 6.18.
false and some 2. Maccab. 12.39, 40, 41, etc. and 14.41.42. etc. Judith 9.1,
2.11.13, etc.
impious things contained in them.

Fourthly, throughout the whole New Testament there is not so much as one
Testimony to be found cited out of any of these books, either by our Savior
Christ or his Apostles, to give witness or approbation unto them.


I. What Arguments are there to assure us, that those books of the Old and New
Testament are the Scriptures and undoubted Word of God?


B. Acts 2.16, 17. 2 Timothy 3.16. 2 Pet. 1.20.21.
First, the outward testimony of themselves, for they testify of themselves
that they are so.

John 14 26. 1 Cor. 2.10, 11 12, 13. 1 John 2.20.27.
Secondly, The inward testimony of the Holy Ghost, which does most effectually
persuade our hearts that they be divine.

Thirdly, their Antiquity.

Fourthly, the singular Majesty and sublimitie of style, which euerywhere
shines in them.

1 Mac. 1.56, 57
Fifthly, the miraculous preservation of them, against the rage and fury of
adversaries.

Gen 15.13.14. compared with Exodus 1.11.13, 14, etc. Chap. 7. 20. Chap. 8, 9,
10, 11, and 12. also 14.27, 28. Esaias 7.14. accomplished. Mat. 1.21, 22, etc.
Mich. 5.2. Mat. 2.1. Luke 2.4, 5, etc. Genesis 49.10 Luke 2, 3, etc. Genesis 12.2.
Exodus 1.7.12. Numb. 26.4, 5, 6, 7, etc. Genesis 3.15. Col 2.14, 15. Heb. 2.14, 15.
Sixthly, the precise and wonderful accomplishment of the Prophecies therein
contained, in the same manner as they were fortold, though many hundred years
after, coming to pass.

Seventhly, Revel. 6.9.
the constancy of the Saints and holy Martyrs of God, which have sealed the
same with their blood. John. 3.2. Ex. Chap. 8, 9, 10. Acts 5.12, etc. Mark.
16.20. Heb. 2.4.


Eighthly, the rare miracles by which God has confirmed the Doctrine and
approved the Penners thereof to be immediately called of him.

Ninthly, Ex. 32.23.24. etc. Numb. 12.1, 2, 3. and 20.11.12. Psalm. 51. and
73.2, 3.13. 14. Mat. 26.69, 70. etc. John 20.25 Acts 15.39.
the impartial faithfulness of the Penners of them, not sparing to record unto
all succeeding ages, the faults and blemishes both of themselves and such as
were nearest and dearest unto them.

Tenthly, the 1 Cor. 14.24.25. Heb 4.12.
admirable power and exceeding efficacy they have in the consciences of men, 2 Timothy 3.16.
conuincing, 2 Cor. 3.6.
killing, Acts 2.37. and 24.25.
terrifying and amazing some; Psalm. 19 7.8. and 119.99.100.104.105.
illuminating, Psalm. 19.8. and 119.111.
rejoicing, Romans 15.4.
comforting, and Psalm. 19.7. Acts 26.18.
converting others, etc,


I. What are the properties of these Scriptures?


B. They have their whole authority from God alone the Author of them, and not
from the Church.


I. How prove you this?


B. Psalm. 19.7. and 119.1.2.88. Esaias 8.20.
First, because the Scriptures are the Testimony of God; now that cannot
receive authority from men, and therefore neither the Scriptures.

Secondly, because the Scriptures are before the Church; for it is Esaias 2.2.
Mat. 28.19. Acts 1 8.9.10.
gathered, James 1.13. 1 Pet. 1.23.
regenerated, and Acts 20.32. etc. Ephesians. 4.11.12, 13. Psalm. 119.9.105. Ephesians.
2.20.
governed by them.

Thirdly, because the Church it self does depend upon the Scriptures, and
borrows all her authority from them, being built upon the foundation of the
Prophets and Apostles.


I. Rehearse the second property of the Scriptures.


B. All things necessary to salvation, Deuteronomy. 12.32. Psalm. 19.7. 2 Timothy 3.16.
Reu. 22, 18.19.
both concerning faith and manners, are therein fully comprehended.


I. What is the third property of the Scriptures?


B. Psalm. 19.7. and 119.105.130.
All points or Articles of faith needful to be known unto salvation, are
plainly and clearly set forth in them. 2 Cor, 4.3. 2 Pet. 1.19.



I. What are we further to know concerning the Scriptures?


B. That they are the only Esaias 8.20. Deuteronomy. 17.8, 9, 10 18, 19. John 5.39.
Acts 17.11.
judge of controversies, and rule of faith and manners.

Secondly, that there is but one Nehem. 8.8.
true and genuine sense of every place of Scripture, which is the litterall,
expressed sometimes in proper, and sometimes in borrowed or figurative speeches.

Thirdly, that they are to be interpreted Nehem. 8.8. Luke 24.27.
by and out of themselves.

Fourthly, that they are Luke 16.29. 2 Timothy 3.16. Romans 15.4.
necessary, and Psalm. 12.6. Prou. 30.5. Ps. 119.9.7 5.86.106.113.128.142.160.
Mat. 22.29. John 17.17. Pro. 8.8
pure, being f free from all vanity, folly, injustice, error or falsehood in
the least degree.


I. For what ends and uses were the Scriptures written?


B. To teach all truth and saving Doctrine, 2 Timothy 3.16, 17. Romans 15.4. Psalm.
119.23.50 81.92.
to instruct in righteousness and virtue, to correct all sin and
wickedness, and to comfort in all distrosses and perplexities.


I. To whom does the knowledge of the Scriptures appertain?


B. Deuteronomy. 17.18, 19. Psalm. 119.9. 2 Timothy 3.15. John 5.39. Deuteronomy. 6, 7, 8. Col.
3.16.
To all men, of what age, condition, quality, rank or degree whatsoever. Yea,
all sorts of men without exception, are bound to get the knowledge thereof.


I. But how shall all men attain to knowledge and understanding of them, since
they were written in Greek and Hebrew, which are languages which but a very
few are acquainted with?


B. They ought to be 1 Cor. 14.18 19. Acts 2.4, 5, etc. 1 John 4.1.
translated into all Languages, and Nehem. 8.8, etc. Luke 24 27.
plainly expounded to the capacities of the unlearned.


I. What are we especially to learn out of the Scriptures?


B. The saving knowledge of God, of Man, and of him that is both God and Man,
the only and all-sufficient Savior of mankind Jesus Christ.


Of God.
I. IS there any God?


B. Ps. 14.1. and 90.2. Esaias 41.4.
That there is, ever has bin, and ever shall be a God, is a thing so
conspicuously apparent, that it ought not once to be called into question,
especially among Christians; and the Psalm. 79 6. Ierem. 10.25.
cruellest death is too gentle a punishment, for any that shall deny it.


I. You say true. Howbeit because there have Diagoras. Theodorus Cyrenaeus.
been and yet are many such Monsters, as fear not to deny it, let me hear
what arguments you could bring, were you to deal with such an one, to convince
him of this truth?


B. This most glorious frame of heaven and earth, Job 12.7, 8 9. Psalm. 19.1.
Romans 1.20.
with the innumerable multitudes of admirable creatures in them both, does most
evidently euince against all the Atheists in the world, that there must needs
be some intelligent nature, of infinite wisdom and power, (which is God) from
and by whom all these things should exist. For it were most absurd and absonous
from reason, to think, that they either came by chance, could create
themselves, or were from everlasting.

Secondly, Job 38.5, 6, 7, 8, etc. Mat. 6.26. A and s 14.17.
the continual preservation and most wise and powerful government of the
world, and al things created in the same, does argue no less.

Thirdly, all Nations the Jonah 1.5, 6. Acts 1^.23.28. Gal, 4.8.
most savage that can be named, have ever had this persuasion engraven in
their hearts by light of nature, that there is a supreme Power and Deity, whom
they ought to serve and adore: which most manifestly appears in this, in that
all of them even the most barbarous Pagans, have ever worshipped some thing or
other for their god, yea, even senseless Ps. 115.4.5.6. etc. 135.15, etc. Dan.
5.4.23.
stocks and stones, rather then they would be thought to have no god at all.

Fourthly, the fearful judgments which are inflicted upon ungodly men even
the greatest of them, Exodus 14.27, 28 Judge. 1.4, 5, 6, 7. Dan. 4.31, 32, 33.
Acts 12.23.
and that such many times as do so lively resemble the sins whereby they
have offended, as that they may be (as it were in Capital letters) read in
their plagues: is also an undoubted argument of a Deity ruling the world, and
taking notice of the actions done by men.

Genesis 4.14. Dan. 5.5, 6. Mat 27.3, 4, 5. Romans 2.15. Humane Histories abound
with examples of this kind. Theodorick King of Goths, Nero, Caligula, Richard
the third of this Kingdom, etc.
Fifthly, the insufferable terrors of conscience, those hellish twitchings and
tortures, wherewith the wicked of this world, even those of highest place, and
such as have therefore no cause to fear any man whatsoever, are often
tormented, and racked, for their crimes even in secret committed. This must
needs be an argument invincible to prove the certainty of a God, before
whose tribunal they must one day be conuented, to answer and receive sentence
of deserved punishment for their wickedness.


I. What is God?


B. What God is in his divine Essence and nature, John 1.18. Job. 11.7. 1 Cor.
2.10.11.
it passes the capacities of all the men in the world either to express or
conceive, only what manner of one he is, he has revealed in his Word, out of
which some description may be given of him, to distinguish him from all false
and feigned gods and all creatures, but no true and perfect definition.


I. How may he be described?


B. Thus: God is an Psalm 90.2.
uncreated John 4.24.
Spirit, Exodus 3.14. Romans 11.36.
having his being of himself, most Deuteronomy. 6.4.
simple, Mat. 5. and last.
perfect, Ps. 139.7, 8, etc
infinite, Revel. 1.8.
eternal, James 1.17.
immutable, 1 Timothy 6.16.
immortal, Gen 17.1.
omnipotent, 1 John 3.20.
omniscicient, most Psalm. 147.5.
wise, Psalm. 33.5.
good, Exodus 34.6.
gracious, John 3.16
loving, Psalm. 86.15.
patient, Luke 6.36.
merciful, Leuit. 11.44.
holy, Reu. 6.10.
true, Genesis 18.25.11.1.
just, Ephesians. 1.11.
free and Psalm. 104.1.
glorious, the Genesis 1.1.2, 3, etc.
Creator, Mat. 6.26.30. and 10 29, 30.
Governor and Psalm. 36.6. Acts 17.25.28.
Preserver of Heaven and earth, and of all things in them, visible and
invisible.


I How many Gods be there?


B. 1 Cor 8.4, 5, 6. Gal. 3.20. 1 Timothy 2.5.
No more but one only.


I. What reasons can you give beside Scripture, to prove the oneness or
unity of God?


B. There can be but one thing most perfect, but one omnipotent, one
omnipresent, one all-sufficient, one first, last, and chiefest good. But God is
all and every of these, therefore it is impossible that there should be more
then one only. Besides, many Heathens by light of nature have seen and
acknowledged this truth.


I. 2 Cor. 1.^ and 13, 14. 1 Iobn 3.7.
But the Scripture makes mention in many places of three; namely, the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and affirms each of them to be God; it seems
therefore that there are three Gods, and not one, as you affirm?


B. It is true indeed, that, as the Scripture witnesses, every one of these
you have named, both the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, are very God;
yet notwithstanding, they are not three but one God.


B. How can they be three and yet but one?


B. They are three in persons, Genesis 1.26. and 3 22. Mat. 28.19. and 3.16.17.
and 15.26.
but one and no more in essence.


I. But if there be three persons among men propounded, whereof every one is a
man; as for instance, Peter, James and John: can it be truly affirmed of them
all, that they are but one man?


B. No. But we must beware of measuring the profound things of God, by the
leaden rules of man's hollow reason, especially this Trinity in Unity, and
Unity in Trinity, which of all other, is a mystery of mysteries, and a
secret to be adored, but not curiously inquired into.


I. You said that God is one in essence, and three in persons; tell me what
these words import?


B. Exodus 3.14. Psalm 9^.2. Romans 1.20.
The Offense of God, is the Deity or Godhead it self, by which, God from and
by himself absolutely is, and existeth, and is distinguished from all other
things whatsoever.


I. What is a person of the Deity?


B. Heb. 1.3. John 1.1 and 5.19.37. and 14.9. 16. Col. 2.9.
It is a subsistence in the divine Essence, having in it by nature the whole
Godhead or divine Essence, but distinct from the other persons, by a peculiar
and incommunicable property.


I. How many persons are there in the Godhead?


B. Mat. 28.19. 1 John. 5.7.
Three, neither more nor fewer; and those truly and really John 1.14.18.32, 33,
34. and 5.17, 18, 19. Romans 8.11.
distinct one from onother, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.


I. What is the Father?


B. The Mat. 28.19. 1 Ioh. 5.7.
first person of the Deity, having original of none, existing from himself,
and not from any other, who of John 1.14.
himself, from Pro. 8.22, 23. John. 1.1, 2, 3. and 8.58.
everlasting has Psalm. 2.7. Heb. 1.5.
begotten his John 1.14.18 and 3.16.18.
only Son, and Ioh. 14.26. Ioh 15.26.
together with his Son, sends forth the Holy Ghost.


I. Why is he called the Father?


B. First, in respect of Christ, who is his Heb. 1.2. Mat. 3.17.
Son by nature. Secondly, of the faithful, who are all his Ephesians. 1.5. Romans
8.14, 15.
Sons by grace of adoption.


I. What is the Son?


B. He is the Pro. 8.22.23. and 5.26. Mat. 11.27.
second person of the Deity, that in the John 10.30. and 17.21, 22.
unity of Essence, is from all Pro. 8.22, 23.
eternity Heb. 1.3.5.
begotten of the Rom 8.32.
substance of the Father, and together with John 15.26. Romans 8.9.
him, sends forth the Holy Ghost, and so has done from everlasting.


I. Why is he called the Son?


B. Because he is begotten of the substance of God the Father. Heb. 1.3. Phil
2.6.



I. Why is he called the Word?


B. First, because nothing in the world serves so fitly, to resemble and
shadow forth unto us the manner of his eternal generation of his Fathers
substance, as does the conceiving of a word in the mind of man.

Secondly, John 1.18.
because as men reveal their minds one toward another by their words: so the
Father from the beginning of the world, has revealed his mind and will
concerning man's duty and salvation by his Son Jesus Christ.

Acts 10.43. Luke 24.27. John 5.39.46.
Thirdly, because he is the maine and principal subject of the whole written
word of God.


I. What is the manner of his eternal generation?


B. Deuteronomy. 29.29.
This is a mystery that cannot be comprehended, and therefore may not be pryed
into by the dim eye of humane reason.


I. How prove you that the Son is God?


B. The He is called God, Esaias 9.6 Tit. 2.13. Lord, Romans 6.8.9. Lord of glory,

and actions of God are attributed to him in Scripture.


I. What is the Holy Ghost?


B. The Mat. 28.19.
third Job 33.4. Acts 20.28.
Person of the Trinity, eternally John 14.26. and 15.26. Gal. 4.6.
proceeding from the Father and the Son.


I. What is the manner of the proceeding of the Holy Ghost?


B. This is as the generation of the Son, a secret inconceiuable.


I. Is there any difference between the generation of the Son, and the
proceeding of the Holy Ghost?


B. Yes doubtless, there is some difference between them, but what it is, Rom
11.33.
is one of the unsearchable things of God, and a way of his past finding out.


I. What reasons have you to prove the Holy Ghost to be God?


B. The He is called God, 2 Samuel 23 2, 3. Acts 5.3, 4.
names, titles, essential He is eternal, Genesis 1.2. Infinite, Psalm. 139.7, 8.
Omniscient, Esaias 11.2. John 16.13. Omnipotent, Esaias 11.2.

26.13. He preserues the same, Gen 1, 2. Gouernes it, Act. 16.6. Romans 16.25.
Works miracles, 1 Cor. 12.4.10. Calls Prophets and Ministers, Act. 13.2 and
20.28. Reueales Gods will, etc. John 14.26. 1 Cor. 2.9, 10. Distributes divine

5.22. Comforts, John 14.28. Acts 9.5. Iustifies, 1 Cor. 6.11.
works and operations of God, are attributed to him, as well as to the Father
or the Son in Scripture.


I. Why is the Holy Ghost called Spirit, more then the Father, or the Son,
since they are Spirits as well as he?


B. He is termed Spirit, not only because of his spiritual nature, which is
equally common to all the three persons, but for that he is spired and (as it
were) breathed forth from the Father and the Son, he proceeding from them
both.


I. Why is this title (holy) given to him, more then to the other Persons, who
are of no less purity and holiness then himself?


B. 1 Cor. 6.11. 2 These. 2.13. 1 Pet. 1.12.
Because he immediately sanctifies the elect and children of God.


I. What things are common to these three Persons?


B. The Essence, all As Eternity, Immensity, Immutability, Omnipotency, etc.
the essential properties, and outward As Creation, Preservation.
works of the Diety, respecting the creatures.


I. How are they distinguished among themselves?


B. First, by their names, the first person being called the Father; Mat 28, 29.
the second, the Son; and the third, the Holy Ghost.

Secondly, by their order; for the Father is the first Person, because he is
the fountain of the Divinity of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

The Son is the second Person, because the Deity is communicated unto him of
the Father, by an incomprehensible generation.

The Holy Ghost is the third Person, Mat. 28.19. 1 John. 5.7.
because the Deity is communicated unto him from the Father and the Son, by
an incomprehensible spiration,


I. Is not then one of these Persons before another?


B. Yes, in manner of existence, but not in time; there is an order among them,
but no priority or inequality, but they are all Coessentiall, Coeternall and
Coequall.


I. Is not this order of Persons kept also in their outward works?


B. John 1.3. and 14. 2^. and 15.26. and ^ 19. Col. 1.16. Heb. 1.2.
It is so; for though all outward works are done by the common will and
operation of the whole Trinity, yet so as the Father of himself, works by
the Son and the Holy Ghost; the Son from the Father, by the Holy Ghost; the
Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son.


I. How are these three Persons distinguished among themselves?


B. By an internal incommunicable property.


I. What is the incommunicable property of the Father?


B. That he being of none, has from everlasting begotten his Son
consubstantiall to himself.


I. What is the incommunicable property of the Son?


B. That he is begotten of the Father from all eternity, by an
incomprehensible and unspeakable generation.


I. What is the incommunicable property of the Holy Ghost?


B. That from all eternity he proceeds from the Father and the Son.


I. What are we further bound to know out of the Scripture, concerning God?


B. His Works, especially, his Predestination, Creation, and Providence.


Of Predestination.
I. IS there any Predestination? Mat. 20.16. John 10.26. 28 29. Ephesians. 1.4.11.
Jude 4.



B. Yes certainly, the Scripture in many places teaches us so.


I. Ought the Doctrine of Predestination to be taught?


B. Yea surely. First, because it is a thing Deuteronomy. 29.29. Romans 15.4.
revealed in Scripture. Secondly, it makes much for the Romans 9.22, 23 Ephesians.
1.6.12.
illustration of Gods glory. Thirdly, for the 1 These. 5 9, 10, 11. Luke 10.20.
2 Timothy 2 19.
consolation of the faithful: and fourthly, for stirring them up to Romans
12.12. Ephesians. 1, 2, 3, 4.
thankfulness to God in word and deed.


I. What is predestination?


B. It is the Ephesians. 1.4. 2 These. 2.13. 2 Timothy 1.9.
eternal, Romans 9.11.15 18.20. etc. Ephesians. 1.5.
free, Rom 11.33. 1 Cor. 1.25.
wise, Mal. 3.6. Romans 11.29.
immutable, and most Deuteronomy. 32.4. Genesis 18.25.
just 1 These. 5.9. Romans 9.11.
decree of God, whereby, before Ephesians. 1.4. Jude 4.
the foundations of the world were laid, he has Romans 9.22, 33. 1 Pet 2.8.
appointed all men to an everlasting Psalm. 16.11. Mat. 25 46.
estate, either of happiness or 2 These. 1.9 Revel. 14.11.
misery, to the glory of Romans 9.17.22.23. Ephesians. 1.6.12.
his mercy and justice.


I. What be the parts of Predestination?


B. Romans 9.23.20. 1 These. 5 9.
Two, Election, and Reprobation.


I. What is Election?


B. It is the decree of God, whereby he has Rom 8.30. Ephesians. 1.4.
ordained some men to everlasting life, and the Romans 8.30. 2 These 2.13.
means that bring thereunto, for the glory of his Rom 9.23. Ephesians. 1.6.12.
grace and mercy


I. Why did God elect some to life?


B. Romans 9.15, 16. 18, etc. and 11.5. Luke 13.32.
Only for the mere good pleasure of his will.


I. Did he not elect men for their foreseen faith and works?


B. No. Romans 9.16.
For election is the cause of Acts 13.48. Tit. 1.1.
faith and Romans 8.29. Ephesians. 1.4.2.10
works, in whomsoever have them.


I. Are not all men elect?


B. No. Mat. 20.16. John 13.18. Romans 11.7.
For then there should be no election at all.


I. Can the Elect be certain that they are predestined to eternal life?


B. They Luke 10.20. Romans 8.16 38. etc. 2 Timothy 4.8.
can, and ought to be, 2 Cor 13.5. 2 Pet. 1.10.
giving all diligence to make their election sure.


I. What are the signs of an elect vessel, whereby one may be infallibly
assured that he is such an one?


B. The undoubted fignes hereof are Acts 13.48. 2 These. 2.13. Tit. 1.1.
faith and constant Ephesians. 1.4. Mat. 10.22. 1 Cor. 15.58.
holiness of life, which whosoever are in truth endued withal, may, yea and
ought to be as certainly persuaded of their election, as if God by some
extraordinary revelation, or by his own voice from heaven, should make known
the same unto them.


I. What if a man find not these graces in himself?


B. He is not therefore to despair of his salvation, or to judge himself a
Reprobate and castaway, Romans 10.8. 1 Cor. 3.5. John 15.3. Acts 26.^8.
but must diligently labor in the use of the means ordained of God, that they
may be wrought in him, remembering that God calls at Mat. 20.1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
Luke 23.40, 41 42.
all hours.


I. Tell me now what is Reprobation?


B. It is the decree Romans 9.18.21 22. 1 Pet. 2.8. 2 Timothy 2.20.
of God, whereby he has from all eternity ordained, not to have mercy on some
men and women in Christ, nor to make them Mat. 11.25. Acts 13.48. John 8.47.
partakers of the means of salvation, but to pass them by, John 8.21.24
leave them in their sin, and for them justly to condemn them to perpetual
torments in Hell, Pro. 16.4. Romans 9.17.23.
for the glory of his power and justice.


I. What is the moving cause of Reprobation?


B. Romans 9.18, 19, 20. Ephesians. 1.11.
None other but the good pleasure of Gods Will.


I. Were not foreseen Infidelity and other sins, the cause why some are
Reprobates?


B. No. God John 3.18.36 John 16.9. Mark. 16.16.
condemns none but for their infidelity and John 8.21.24 Romans 2.8. and 6.3^.
etc.
sin: but these were not the causes of his reprobating any; for then none
should have been Elect, but all Reprobates, in as much, as he foresaw all
men of Psalm. 51.5. Romans 6.17.20. and 3.9, 10, etc. Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3.
themselves, would be alike unbelievers and sinful.


I. But will not this argue God of injustice, for his will sake to reprobate
men?


B. No. Genesis 18.25. Nehem. 9.33. Romans 9.14.
Because whatsoever God wills, is therefore just, because he wills it: his will
being the supreme rule of all justice and righteousness.


I. Is there a certain and definite number of Elect and Reprobate?


B. Yea undoubtedly, John 13.18. and 10.3.14.27. 2 Timothy 2.19.
with God there is, so as the same can neither be augmented nor diminished, or
he which is once Elect become a Reprobate, nor any Reprobate of the Elect. But
to us men, the number both of the one and the other is altogether unknown.


I. Which number is the greatest, of the Elect, or of the Reprobate?


B. The number of the Elect, considered in themselves is very Mat. 8.11. and
20.28. Revel. 7.9.
great; but in comparison of the Reprobate, and such as shall be damned, it is
but Luke 12.32.
small and little.


I. Are the Elect so certain of salvation, as that they cannot perish; and on
the contrary, the Reprobate of damnation, as that none of them can be saved?


B. Yes assuredly, it is impossible for any one of Gods Mat. 24.24. John 10.27,
28, 29. 2 Timothy 2.19,
chosen to miss of eternal life, or so much as Revel. 20.15. and 21.27.
one reprobate to escape everlasting death.


I. But will it not follow, if the case be so, that neither the Elect can
perish, nor the Reprobate be saved whatsoever they do, that it matters not
then how men live, or demean themselves in this world?


B. God predestinates none to the end, but he predestinates them also to the
means conducting to that end.
No. God forbid that any should make such a heilish and devilish conclusion,
from so divine and heavenly a doctrine. For it is most certain, that
whomsoever God has elected, he purifies their hearts by Acts 15.9.26.18.
faith, and 1 Cor. 1.30. and 6.11. 2 These. 2.13.
so sanctifies them by his renewing spirit, at the time of their effectual
calling, as that afterward they Romans 6.4, 5, 6.14. and 8.1. Ephesians. 1.4.
cannot but lead an holy and godly life, and Ier. 32.40. Phil. 1.6.
persevere so to do unto the end. And as for the Reprobate, God so leaves them
to their own Psalm. 81.12. Acts 14.16. Romans 1.24.26.
corruption, and to the will of Romans 11.8. Ephesians. 2.2. 2 Timothy 2.26.
Satan the tempter, as that they Ier. 13.23. Mat. 7.16, 17, 18. John 8.34.45.
cannot but live and continue in infidelity and sin, till their dying day.


I. What is the inference then that men should make from the certainty of the
Elects salvation, and the Reprobates damnation?


B. Surely this, which is clean contrary to the other; namely, That it stands
every man and woman upon to endeavor with all their power, to avoid sin, and
to walk in holiness and righteousness before God, and so resolve with
themselves at all times to do, that by this means they may get assurance to
their souls that they are of the number of Gods Elect, whose salvation is so
sure; and not of the Reprobate whose damnation is so unavoidable: an holy and
unblameable conversation being the 2 Pet. 1.10. Ephesians. 1.4.
mark whereby the one is discerned from the other, as also the Pro. 10.17. and
12.28. and 15.24.
means and way to attain everlasting life.


Of Creation.
I. What is Creation, the second special work of God (as you affirmed) that
we are to inform our selves of out of the Scriptures?


B. It is a most Esaias. 40.26. Romans 1.20.
powerful Genesis 2.2.
work of Esaias 44.24. Job 38 4, 5, 6. etc. 1 Cor. 8.6.
God the Father, the John 1.3. Col. 1.13.
Son, and the Genesis 1.1.26. Job 35.10.
Holy Ghost, by which in the Genesis 1.1. Pro. 8.22, 23. John 1.1, etc.
beginning, in the Genesis 1. Genesis 2.1, 2, 3.
space of six days, by his Genesis 1.3.6, etc. Ps. 148.5.
Word only, out of Pro. 8.22, 23. Romans 4.17. Heb. 11.3.
nothing, he made the Psalm. 19.1.103.22. Pro. 16.4.
Heavens and the earth, with all things in them visible and invisible; to the
Romans 11.36. Revel. 4.10, 11.
praise of his infinite power, wisdom and goodness.


I. How did God create all things?


B. Genesis 1.31.
Exceeding good.


I. How can it be said that God made all things exceeding good, since we see
that there are so many noisome, venomous and hurtful beasts, herbs, and other
things in the world, as also wicked and unclean spirits, nam^^, the Devils?


B. No creatures were hurtful by Gods creation, but they became so by the Genesis
1.17.
sin of man, for a punishment to him for the same. And as touching the Jude
6. John 8.44. 2 Pet. 2.4.
Devils, God made them good, holy and happy, but of their own will they
rebelling against God, fell from that excellent estate they received by
Creation, and so became evil, etc. as they are.


I. You said that God created the world with the creatures therein, in the
space of six days; tell me what he created the first day?


B. The earth, waters and light. Genesis 1, 2, 3, etc.



I. Which were the works of the second day?


B. The firmament, and the division of the waters under the firmament from them
above the firmament. Genesis 1.6, 7, 8, 9



I. What made he the third day?


B. The third day he collected the waters under the firmament into one place
which he called Sea, Genesis 1.9, 10, 11 12, 13.
dried the earth, and made all sorts of herbs and trees upon the same.


I. What did God create the fourth day?


B. The Sun, Moon and Stars, and that for these purposes; namely, Genesis
1.14.15.
that they might divide the day from the night, be for signs and seasons,
days and years, and give light to the earth both by day and night.


I. What did God create the fifth day?


B. Genesis 1.21, 22, 23.
All kinds of Fishes and Birds.


I. What did God create the sixth and last day?


B. Genesis 1.24.25, etc.
All manner of beasts, cattle and creeping things, and last of al man, of the
Genesis 2.7:
dust of the earth.


I. In which of these days were the Angels created?


B. It is most certain they were created in one of them, Genesis 2.1.2. Col.
1.16. 1 Kings 22.19.
but in which, is not revealed; howbeit it is most probable that they were
created the first day together with the Heavens, the place of their abode.


I. Why does not Moses express the time of their creation, as well as of all
other things?


B. Because his purpose and project was, only to entreat of the visible
creatures, and such as are subject to our senses.


Of the Angels.
I. NOw we are fallen into the mention of Angels; tell me what are Angels?


B. They are Mat. 22.30. Luke 20.30.
immortal 1 Kings 22.21 Psalm. 104.4.
Spirits, or spiritual Dan. 7.10.
substances, free Mat. 18.10.
from bodies, of exceeding 2 Kin. 19.35. Esaias 37.36.
power, 2 Samuel 14.17.20.
wisdom, and 2 Kings 19.35. Esaias 6.2.
agilitie, Genesis 2.12. Col. 1.16.
created after the Job 1.6.2.1. Mat. 22.30.25.31.
image of God, to minister Psalm. 104 4. Psalm. 103 21.
to him, and men his 1 Kings 19.5. Heb. 1.14.
children.


I. How many sorts of Angels are there?


B. Two. Good and bad.


I. What are the good Angels?


B. The good Angels are those 1 Timothy 5.21.
Elect spirits in Mat. 18.10.22.30.24.36.
heaven, Mat. 25.31. Luke 9.^6.
which by the grace of God continued in the truth and integrity, in which they
were created; and by the same grace are so confirmed in that estate, as that
now they Mat. 18.20. and 22.30.
cannot fall from it, but are for ever blessed.


I. What are the actions of the good Angels?


B. With all Job 1.6. and 2.1. Mat. 6.10. and 18.10.
readiness and cheerful willingness to Psalm. 103.20. Dan. 7.10.
obey and serve God, and Psalm. 103.20.21.148.2. Esaias 6.3.
celebrate his praises; to Genesis 19.12, 13. Dan. 9.21, 22. and 10, 11, 12, etc.
instruct, Genesis 19.16.28.12.15. 2 King. 6.16, 17 19.35. Psalm. 34 7.
preserve, keep, defend, 2 Samuel 24.16 17. Luke 1.20.
correct and Genesis 21.17.18. Luke 1 30.22.43.
comfort the faithful: in the hour of death to convey their Luke 16.22.
souls into the Kingdom of Heaven, and in the day of judgment, to Mat.
24.31. Mark 13.27.
gather them together, from the four Winds, from one end of the heavens to
the other. Lastly, in respect of the wicked, to Genesis 19.12.17. Exodus 12.29.
plague and punish them in this life, and at the last day to separate Mark
13.41.
them from the Elect, and Mat. 13.42.
cast them into everlasting fire.


I. Dan. 7.10. 2 Kings 6.16, 17. Psalm 103.20, 21
Are there many of these good Angels?


B. Yea, innumerable multitudes.


I. What are the evil Angels?


B. They are those 1 Timothy 3.2.
reprobate infernal Luke 8.31. 2 Pet. 2.4.
spirits, commonly called the Luke 4 2 8.12 Heb. 2.14. James 4.7.
Devils, which 2 Pet. 2 4. Jude 6.
stood not in the truth and integrity they were created in, but of their own
will fell from the same, and so of good became evil, and of happy most unhappy
and miserable, being Mat. 13.28, 29 1 Cor. 10.21. 2 Cor. 6.15.
irreconciliable enemies to God, and he to them.


I. When did they fall?


B. The Scriptures expresses not the time of their defection, Genesis 3 1, 2 etc.
1 John 8.44. John 3.8.
only this is evident by them, that it was before the fall of our first
parents, Adam and Eve, even in the beginning of the world.


I. What was their sin?


B. The Scripture peculiarly does not define this neither.


I. What are their actions?


B. Continually to Zach. 3.1. Mat. 4.9.13.28 29. Therefore he is called Satan,
Job 1.6 12 and 2.1.6 and often else where.
hate, oppose and resist God; to 1 Chronicles. 21.1 Gen 3 15. 1 Pet. 5.8. Revel.
12.7.10.13, 14. In this respect also, is he so often in Scripture called
Satan, which signifies an enemy or adversary
malign, persesecute and Job 1.9.11. and 2.5 Revel 12 9, 10. hence so
frequently termed Devils.
falsely accuse his children; to Mat. 13.19. 1 These. 2.18.
hinder (what lies in them) all good, Genesis 3.1, 2, 3, etc. Mat 4.3, 4. The
tempter, Mat. 4.3. 1 These. 3 5.
solicit to all evil, Job 1.7. and 2.2. 1 Pet. 5.8.
ever to be laboring how to bring men to perdition and destruction; to Ephesians.
2.2. 2 Timothy 2.26.
work mightily in the wicked, carrying them headlong into all manner of
sins, to plague Judge. 9.23. 1 Samuel 16.14, 15.
them in this life, to Luke 12.20.
carry their souls when they die into Hell, and there for ever to torment them.


I. What does the Scripture further reveal unto us concerning these evil
Angels or Devils?


B. That they are almost Mat. 8.30.12 45. Revel. 1^.7.
infinite for number, exceeding Revel. 12.4.12.17.
malicious, Job 1.13, 14, 15, etc. and 2.7. Mat. 15.22. Therefore called
Dragon, Revel. 12.3, etc. and 16.13. and 22. and Lion, 1 Pet. 5.8.
cruel, Gen 3.12. etc. 2 Cor. 2.11. and 11.3. Hence called Serpent, and old
and crooked Serpent, Esaias. 27.1. Revel. 12.9.14, 15, 20.2. Therefore called
also (...) and (...) wise, learned, skillful, expert, etc. Mat. 8.31. Revel
16.14.18.2. as elsewhere often.
subtle, Genesis 3.1, 2, etc. 1 Kings 22.22, 23.
false, Mat. 10.1.12 43.
filthy, Mat. 6.13. Ephesians. 6.12.16.
wicked, and 2 Pet. 2.4. Jude 6.
everlastingly condemned without the least hope of redemption.


I. What think you of their power?

limited and restrained, as they cannot do what they would, nor the least
thing of all without the will and permission of God: and therefore (which is a
singular comfort to all the Saints) it is impossible that they should ever
prejudice the Mat. 24.24. Luke 22.31, 32
salvation of any of Gods Elect; yea, or do them so much as the Job 1 12.2.6,
7. Mark 5.12, 13.
least evil in any kind, which God their heavenly Father will not have befall
them.


Of Providence.
I. What is the third work of God, which you said we are especially to
learn out of the Scriptures, namely, his Providence?


B. The providence of God is a most Heb. 1.3.
powerful action of God, whereby according to his Ephesians. 1.4. 1 Cor. 2.6, 7.
eternal, Psalm. 147.5. Romans 11.33.
most wise, 2 Chronicles. 19.7 Nehem. 9.33.
just, and Psalm. 33.11. Heb. 6.17.
immutable Ier. 50.45. Acts 2.23.
decree, he Psalm. 36.6.40.2. Acts 17.25.28.

gouernes the whole world, all and every thing in the same, together with their
Genesis 26.50.19, 20.
actions, disposing all to their foreappointed ends, for his own Exodus 9.16.
Romans 9.22, 23.
glory, and the Genesis 45.7.50.19.20. Romans 8.18.
salvation of the Elect.


I. Are the sinful and wicked actions of men disposed and governed also by the
providence of God?


B. Yes Genesis 45.5. Acts 12.23. and 4 28.
certainly, for being omnipotent, it is Romans 9.9. Ephesians. 1.11.
impossible that any thing should come to pass which he will not have to be.


I. But will not this make God to be the cause and author of sin?


B. No. For he Rom 9.14. James 1.13.
cannot sin himself, neither does he Deuteronomy. 18.12. Psalm. 5.5, 6, 7. Esaias
1.13, 14. etc. and 66.3, 4, etc.
will, approve or command sin; neither tempt, persuade, allure, help,
provoke or compel unto it, nor yet instills wickedness into any, but forbids,
extremely hates, detests and Deuteronomy. 28.15, etc. Leuit. 26.14, 15, etc.
punishes the same. Only the Acts 17, 18. Ephesians. 1.11.

own corrupt lusts, and the power of Satan the tempter. Ephesians. 2.2. 2 Timothy
2.26.



Of Man.
I. What are we to learn out of the Scriptures, concerning man?


B. His fourefold estate or condition. Of confection, defection, refection,
perfection.
First, of innocence by creation. Secondly, of misery by his fall. Thirdly, of
grace by Jesus Christ. And lastly, of glory, being immediately after death in
his soul, and consummate both in body and soul again reunited after the
general resurrection.


I. Who were the first parents of all mankind?


B. Their names were Adam and Eve. Genesis 2.20 and 3.20. 1 Timothy 2.13.



I. Of what parts did they consist?


B. Of a body, Genesis 2.7. Mat. 20.28.
and an immortal soul.


I. Of what matter was the body of Adam formed? Genesis 2.7. Eccles. 12.7. Genesis
2.21, 22, 23. 1 Cor. 11.8. Genesis 2 7. Zach. 12.1.



B. Of the dust of the ground.


I. Of what was Eues body formed?


B. Of one of Adams ribs.


I. Whereof were their souls made?


B. God inspired them of nothing.


I. How may the soul of man be described?


B. Thus. The soul is an Genesis 2.7. Mat. 10.28.
immortal Eccles. 12.7. Acts 7.59.
spirit, or a spiritual substance, endued with Genesis 2.20. Nehem. 8.8.
understanding, Deuteronomy. 15.15. Eccles. 12.1.
memory, Romans 2.15. Heb. 13.18.
conscience, John 8.44. Romans 7.19.21.
will, and Deuteronomy. 6.5. 1 Samuel 1.10.15. Mat. 26.38. Luke 1.47.
affections, Genesis 2.7. Eccles. 12.7. Esaias 57.16.
created out of nothing, and immediately infused of God into the body, to Genesis
2.7. Acts 5.5.10.
quicken it, fit it for actions, and together with the same, to make the Genesis
46.26. Exodus 1.5.
person of a man.


Of man's first estate of Innocence by Creation.
I. IN what estate were our first Parents created?


B. Genesis 1.27. Psalm. 8.5.49.20.
In a most glorious and happy condition, even according to the image of God
himself.


I. In what respects were they created after Gods image?


B. First, in Gen 2.7. Zach. 12.1. Exodus 1.5. Acts 7.14.59.
respect of their souls, in that as God is, so are they, of a spiritual,
simple, intelligible, incorporeall, immortal, invisible nature; also as he is
but one in Essence, yet diverse in persons, so the soul of man is but one, yet
having sundry faculties.

Secondly, Genesis 2.19, 20.23. 1 Chronicles. 28.9. Romans 1.19.20.21. and 2.15. Col.
3.10.
in respect of the divine gifts and graces they were adorned with, to wit,
singular wisdom, and knowledge, so that they rigthly and perfectly knew both
themselves and God their Creator, as also his will and works, even the
several natures, dispositions and properties of all his creatures. Deuteronomy. 6.5.
Eccle^. 7.31. Mat. 22.37 38, 39. Ephesians. 4.24.
Also perfect righteousnes^e and holiness, so that neither in their minds
they did conceive, neither in their hearts desire, nor with the members of
their bodies act or commit (during the time of their integrity) any thing, but
that which was most consonant and agreeable to the will of God their maker.

Thirdly, in respect of their dignity, Genesis 1.28. and 9.2. Psalm. 8.6.
in that they had sovereignty and lordship given them over all other creatures


I. In what other things did their happiness consist?


B. First, Genesis 1.28.
in that the love and favor of God was set upon them.

Genesis 1.28, 29. Ephesians. 4.18.
Secondly, in that blessed communion and fellowship they had continually with
him.

Thirdly, in their bodies, which were endued with perfect health, Genesis 1.31.
and 2.25. and 9.2. Psalm. 8.5. and 49.20. 1 Cor. 12.23.
strength, agilitie, impassibilitie, immortality, with a princely majesty,
most incomparable beauty, and in a word, with all perfections that might give
grace or glory to them; the image of God (though properly seated in their
souls, yet) illustrating and most gloriously shining in their bodies also by
the effects thereof.

Genesis 2.8.
Fourthly, in the place of their abode, which was Paradise, where they enjoyed
an heaven upon earth, even whatsoever might give content or delight.

Genesis 3.17.19.
Fifthly, in that their labor was without any the least pain, grief or
wearisomnesse that can be imagined.


Of Man's estate of misery by his fall.
I. DId they continue in this glorious and happy estate?


B. No alas, they did not, Genesis 3.1, 2, etc. Psalm. 49.20.
but soon lost the same, and fell away from God that had given it them.


I. How came that to pass?


B. By their voluntary and wilful disobedience to the commandment of God,
Genesis 3.6. Eccles. 7.29.
in eating of the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.


I. By what means were they drawn to eat of this fruit, contrary to Gods
commandment?


B. By the temptation of the Devil, Genesis 3.2, 3, etc.
who by his wily subtilty beguiled the woman, making her believe that it would
redound to the great good both of her and her husband to eat thereof; by which
persuasion she being overcome, took of the fruit, and did eat, and gave of
the same to her husband, who did eat also.


I. What was the good which the Devil bore the woman in hand they should gain
by their eating?


B. Wisdom and Knowledge. Genesis 3.5, 6.



I. What befell them for this transgressing Gods Commandment?


B. They were instantly stripped of Genesis 3.7.8.10.17, 18, 19. 23, 24 and 2.17.
Leuit. 26.14, 15, etc. Deuteronomy 20.15, 16 etc. and 27.26 Job 14 1. Psalm 49 last.
Romans 6 23. Gal 3.10. Tit. 3 3.
that glorious and happy estate of their creation; and moreover, made obnoxious
to innumerable legions of sorrows in this life, to death of body, and to the
neuer-ending wrath of God in body and soul, in the life to come.


I. But do you not think that God herein inflicted too great a punishment
upon them for their sin?


B. No undoubtedly, he did not.


I. Why so?


B. Because thereby they transgressed the commandment of him who is an
infinite Majesty, to the breach of whose least Commandment, there can be no
less due then an infinite weight of vengeance.

Secondly, because this was no small or petty sin, as it may seem to be, if
we look no further then the baseness of the external object; but a most
grievous, horrible and capital crime, even in the highest degree.


I. This sin may well be called with the wicked spirit in the Gospel,
Legion, because it was a combination of many execrable sins together in one.
Genesis 2.17.
How make you this to appear?


B. First, because it was not one simple and single sin alone, but a
composition, and as it were, a concourse and conglobation of many several, and
those most heinous sins together.


I. Which were they?

First, damnable infidelity, in that they believed not God, menacing death
unto them, if they disobeyed his Commandment.

Secondly, fearful contempt of the sacred Majesty of God, Genesis 3, 4, 5, 6.17.
in that they give credit and yield obedience to the voice of the Devil,
rather then to his.

Thirdly, detestable covetousness, Genesis 3.6.
in that not satisfied with those most excellent and glorious prerogatives they
were endowed withal, they gape after more, and seek for a higher estate then
God was pleased to confer upon them.

Fourthly, Satanicall pride, Gen 3.5.
in that they most insolently aspire to an equality with God himself.

Fifthly, intolerable ingratitude, in that when God had made them the
principal and noblest of all his creatures, yea, Genesis 3.
their sovereign Lords and Kings; and further, dignified them with his own
image; all this is forgotten, vilified, and made of no account with them,
unless they may be his fellows and equalles: also in that they so soon let
slip the memory of those manifold unspeakable favors bestowed upon them.

Genesis 2.17.
Sixthly, sacrilegious theft, in that they put forth their hands to that which is
none of theirs, but another, and expressly interdicted them.

Genesis 3.6.
Seventhly, itching curiosity, in that they affect greater wisdom, then God
had given them, and other knowledge then he had revealed.

Genesis 3.1, 2, 3, etc.
Eighthly, horrible blasphemy, in that they subscribe and give consent to the
saying of Satan, in which he had charged God with lying and envy.

Genesis 3.6.
Ninthly, epicurish intemperancie, in that they must needs gratify and please
their palate, though Heaven it self be incensed and displeased for it.

Romans 5.12. 1 Cor. 15.22.
Tenthly, cruel, unnatural and most bloody murder, in that they plunge
themselves and their posterity with them, into death both of body and soul.


I. What other circumstances are there which may aggrauate this sin of theirs,
and evidence the heinousness of it?


B. First, Genesis 1.27.9 9 1 Cor. 11.7.
because they had power and ability given them, not to have sinned if they
would, but to have kept the Commandment of God.

Secondly, Genesis 1.29.2.16, 17.
because the Commandment given them, was so easy to have been observed.

Thirdly, Genesis 1.29. and 2.16, 17.
the great reason they had to keep it; namely, the innumerable and inestimable
benefits of God toward them, and in particular, his great bounty, in giving
them free liberty to eat of all other the trees and fruits in the Garden,
whereof there were great abundance, and all most delectable; this one only
and no more among them all, being excepted and forbidden them.


I Had Eve, who was first in the transgression and the means to draw her
husband to transgress Gods Commandment, no greater punishment inflicted on
her then Adam?


B. Yes. Genesis 3.16.
For besides all the things before specified, wherein she had equal share with
him; as a further plague and punishment, God laid upon her extreme sorrow and
bitter anguish in conceauing and bearing children, as also subjection to the
will and rule of her husband.


I. But what think you, did this happy condition we have spoken of, wherein
Adam was created, or that woeful misery and wretchedness, wherein by his
disobedience he plunged himself, any whit concern his posterity, and such
as are descended of him?


B. Yes questionless, both the one and the other, concern every one of us
which are come out of his loins.


I. How so?


B. Romans 5 12.18, ^9. 1 Cot. 15.22. Genesis 5 3. Job. 14 4. Psalm. 51.5. Job, 14.1.
^en 3.27.19. Esaias. 30.33. Man. 25.41. M^^k. 9 43, 44. Revel. 19, 20, and 21.8.
Because by the most just appointment of God, Adam was not a private man, but a
public person, representing all mankind, and every particular person to
descend from him; in whom all were, as in a common Root and Stock: and
therefore every man in him received the Image of God, and all those inualuable
gifts, graces and privileges, which he was en^bled withal, to have possessed
and inioyed them for ever, had he remained in his integrity and kept them:
and he sinning and losing them, we al likewise sinned and lost the same in him,
and together with him became most unhappy, forlorn, and sinful wretches,
obnoxious to the curse and wrath of God, in this life and for evermore in the
life to come.


I. Wherein stands that sinfulness which you say is in all the children of
Adam, through his fall?


B. In that we are all, Genesis 8.21. Job 14.4. and 15.14. Psalm. 51.1. and 58.3.
even from our mothers wombes, miserably defiled with original sin, and
guilty of a numberless number of actual transgressions, which, through the
whole course of our lives we cease not to commit against the most holy
precepts of God.


I. Is there any original sin?


B. Yes. Genesis 5.3. Psalm. 51.5. Job. 14.4. Ephesians. 2, 3. Romans 5.12.
The Scriptures in many places testifies, that all men are conceived and borne
in sins and trespasses.


I. What is that you call original sin?


B. First, Romans 3.23.7, 8.
the want of that purity and holiness wherein Adam was created, and we in him.

Romans 5.12.19.
Secondly, the guilt of his defection and transgression imputed unto us.

Thirdly, an Romans 7.18. 1 These. 5.23 The mind is corrupt, Ephesians. 4.22, 23.
Ephesians. 2, 3. It is coue^ed with a sea of ignorance, Romans 2.11. Ephesians. 4.^8. It

senseless, Ephesians. 4.19. 1 Timothy 4.2. tormented, Genesis 4.13, 14. Dan. 5, 6.9.
Acts 2.37. accusing when it should excuse, Mark 10.19.20. Esaias 29 13. and
contrary, excusing when it should accuse, John 16.2. The will impotent to good,
Romans 5, 6. Phil. 2.13. potent to evil, and infinitely rebellious to God, Ier.
18.12. and 44.16, 1^. The affections altogether irregular and disordered, 1
Kings 2 14 and 22.8. Gal. 5.24. The members of the body are occasions of sins
conceiving in the soul, Genesis 3.6. 2 Samuel 11.2.21. and instruments to put it in
execution, being there conceived, Romans 3.13, etc. and 6.13.19.
universal corruption, diffused throughout our whole nature, both bodies and
souls, together with all the parts, powers and faculties of either, whereby we
are To. 7.8.14.23.
prone to all manner of actual sin whatsoever, and To. 8.7. Tit. 1.16.
auerse and Romans 5, 6, and 7.18.
wholly disabled to any thing which is good and pleasing to God.


I. Why is it called original sin?


B. Genesis 3.6, 7, etc.
Because it was from the original or beginning of the world, even as soon as
Adam was fallen.

Secondly, because it is derived to all mankind by hereditary propagation from
Adam, Gen 5.3. Job 14.4.
who is the original or beginning of us all.

Thirdly, Gen 8.21. Psalm. 15.5. Esaias 48.8.
because it is in all men and women whatsoever, from their first original and
beginning, even from the first moment of their conception and birth.

Fourthly, James 1.14, 15. Mat. 12.35. 2 Pet. 1.4.
because it is the original and beginning of all actual sins, which issue
and flow from the same, as from a fountain.


I. Is this original corruption in all men?


B. Yes, 1 Kings 8.46. Job 14.4. Psalm. 51.5. Romans 5.12.14. and 7.24. Ephesians. 2,
3. 1 John 1.8.
in every one that is but a mere man, of what sex, age or condition soever
he be, both infants and men of years, unregenerate and such as are
regenerate and borne anew, are infected with this sin.


I. But is there no difference between the being of this corruption in the
regenerate and unregenerate?


B. Yes, great difference; for in the regenerate it is grieved 2 Samuel 24.10
Psalm. 51. Romans 7.22, 23, 24.
for, and detested, in them it Romans 6.11.14 22. and 7.15.19.21, 22.
reigns not, is in part mortified, and is not at all Ephesians. 1.7. 1 John 1.7.
imputed to any of them; but in the It is not grievous but sweet unto the
unregenerate, Job. 15, 16. and 20.12.13 Pro. 2.14. Secondly, in them it
reigns, etc. Romans 6.17 19, 20. and 7.5. Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3. Thirdly, it is also
imputed to them, Job 20.11. John 8.21.24.
unregenerate all is contrary.


I. Is this original impuritie in like degree and measure in all by nature?


B. Yea, all men which descend from Adam by natural generation, Ephesians. 2, 3.
Pro. 27.19.
are equally infected therewith, not one more, another less.


I. Whence is it then that all men do not alike break forth into the same
degree of actual vice and wickedness?


B. This comes to pass from Gods Genesis 20.6. and 31.24.39.
restraining grace in some, from his Genesis 39.7, 8.9, 10. Ier. 32.40.
renewing and sanctifying grace in others, as also from other As fear of
punishment from the civil Magistrate, Romans 13.3, 4. Of Gods temporal
judgments, 1 Kings 13.3, 4. Of danger from men, Mark 11.32. Mat. ^1.46. Acts
5.26.
lets and impediments.


I. What punishment is due to original sin? Romans 5.14.17.18.



B. The same which is to every actual sin, even eternal death. Romans 6.23.
Ephesians. 2, 3.



I. What is actual sin?


B. It is every Exodus 20.1, 2, etc. 2 Cor. 5.10. Gal. 5.19.
action, or Mat. 3.10. and 25.30.41, 42. etc.
omission, every Mat. 5.22. and 12.36.
word, Genesis 6.5. Mat. 15.19.
thought, Exodus 20.17. Romans 7.7. Gal. 5.17.
desire, purpose, wish or motion of the heart, 1 John 3, 4.
contrary to any of the Laws or Commandments of God.


I How many kinds of actual sins are there?


B. There is great variety of them. First, 2 Cor. 7.1.
some are inward, some outward. Secondly, some immediately against 1 Samuel 2 25.
Leuit. 24.11.
God, some against our 1 Samuel 2.25. Mat 18.15.
neighbor, some against our Tit. 2.12.
selves. Thirdly, some of Exodus 20.1, 2. etc. 2 Cor. 5.10.
commission, some of Mat 3.10. Luke 13.7.
omission. Fourthly, some of Luke 23.34. Acts 3.17.
ignorance, some of Luke 12 47. Romans 1.32.
knowledge. Fifthly, some are John 8.34. 2 Pet. 3 5.
voluntary, some are Romans 7.7.
inuoluntary. Sixthly, some of Romans 7.19. Gal. 6 1.
infirmity, some of Psalm 19.1^.
presumption. Seventhly, some Psalm. 19.12.
secret, some known. Eighthly, some are To. 6.12.14.
reigning, some are not Romans 7.20. 1 John. 3 6.9.
reigning. Ninthly, some 1 Cor. 6.18.
without the body, some against it. Tenthly, some Genesis 4.10. and 18.20, 21.
crying, some of Acts 17.30.
tolleration. Eleuenthly, some simply All those we commit our selves.
ours, Heb. 10.26.
some by Ephesians. 5.7.11. 1 Timothy 5.22. 2 Ioh. 11.
participation. Twelfthly and lastly, some are Mat. 12.31. Mark 3.28, 29. Luke
12.10. Heb. 6.6. 1 Ioh. 5. 16, 17.
pardonable, 1 Timothy 5 2 4.
some for ever Mat. 12.31. Mark 3.28, 29. Luke 12.10. Heb. 6.6. 1 Ioh. 5.16,
17.
unpardonable; namely, the sin against the Holy Ghost.


I. Are all actual sins of equal or alike guilt, etc?


B. No. But some are Ezekiel. 16.47. Mat 5.22. and 7.3, 4, 5. John. 15.24. John
19.11. 1 Timothy 5.8. 2 Pet. 2.20, 21.
greater, some smaller, some in a higher degree offensive, and more heinous
before God, some less: Yet so, as that the least that can be committed or
named, is Romans 6.23. Gal. 3.10. Ezekiel. 18.20.
mortal and damnable of it own nature, if it be not pardoned through Christ.


I. You said that actual sins were such as are committed against the
Commandments of God, tell me therefore which are those Commandments you
speak of?


B. They are those ten, recorded in order, in the twentieth Chapter of Exodus.
1. Thou shall have none other gods before me. 2. Thou shall not make to thee
any graven image, nor the likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, etc.


I. Have you sufficient power perfectly to keep and fulfill all the
commandments of God, as you ought?


B. No Eccles. 7.22. Psalm. 19 12. James 3.2.
in no wise, neither any man living be he never so holy, but even the most
righteous that are, do break them every day in thought, word and deed, yea,
in the most Nehem. 13.22 Esaias 6 4.6. Revel 8 3.
perfect and holiest performances that proceed from them, they grievously
offend against them.


I. What punishment do they make themselves liable unto which break any of
these Commandments?


B. To Genesis 3.17, 18 19. Leuit. 26.14, 15 etc. Deuteronomy. 28.15, etc.
all the miseries, woes, crosses, plagues and calamities of this present life;
to Romans 5.12.14 1 Cor. 15.55, 5 6.
death of body in the end of this life, and to Deuteronomy. 27.26. Ezekiel. 18.20. Romans
6.23.
everlasting and inconceiuable torments both of body and soul after this life,
in Hell fire. All this and no less is the deserved punishment of every, even
the lest breach of any of these Commandments, though it be but in wish,
desire, or thought, and that but once only, and no more, during the whole time
of our soiourning here in this world.


I. How can this be?


B. Because the author and giver of these Commandments, is an 1 Timothy 1.17.
eternal, Genesis 18.14.
omnipotent, Psalm. 139 7.8, etc. and 147.5.
infinite and Psalm. 145.3.
incomprehensible Majesty, even God the high Genesis 14.22.
possessor of Heaven and earth, the King of 1 Timothy 6.15.
Kings and Lord of Lords.


I. Yea, but God is most merciful gracious, and full of compassion, he will
not, nay, he cannot therefore punish sin so extremely?


B. It is true indeed, God is exceeding Exodus 34.6. Psalm. 103.8. Psalm. 145 9.
merciful, yea, infinite in mercy and compassion; but it is also as true, that
he is exceeding Exodus 34.7. Job 34.10.11.12
just, and as infinite in justice as in mercy, and therefore cannot punish
sin with a less then an infinite and eternal punishment. For this justice
requires, that the punishment be proportionable to the offense, which takes it
greatness, not from the person by whom it is done, neither from the thing
about which it is conversant, nor yet from the time in which it is finished;
but from the quality, dignity and eminency of the person, against whom and
whose laws it is committed, and by this is to be measured.

Moreover, God is most Deuteronomy. 32.4. Number 23 19, 20 John 14.6.
true of his Word (yea, o truth it self) he therefore having said, that the
fore recited punishment, all and every part of it shall be the reward of every
sin, it is as impossible that it should receive any easier recompense, as it
is that he 1 Samuel 15.29. Tit. 1, 2.
should lie or deny himself.


Of Man's estate of grace by Jesus Christ.
I. But is there no remedy for us, who by the sin of our first parents, and
our own personal, original and actual transgressions, which are
innumerable, are subject to all this woe and misery you have mentioned, whereby
we may be delivered from this dreadful and damnable condition?


B. In Exodus 34.7. Ps. 49 6, 7, 8, 9. Mich. 6.6, ^. Mat. 16.26. 1 Pet. 1.18.
our selves or any mere creature in Heaven or in earth, or ought that we or
they can do, none at all. Howbeit, God out of his infinite love to mankind,
John 3.16. 1 John. 4.9.10.11.
has Ephesians. 1.4. 1 Pet. 1.20.
appointed, and in his Word revealed a most effectual means, which, whosoever
make right use of, they shall not only be saved from all their sins, and the
eternal and infinite wrath of God, due unto the same, but also be possessed of
a far more happy estate then ever in Psalm. ^30.7.8. Luke 20.36. John 10.10.
Rom 5.17.
Adam they were created in. Mat. 20.28. John 14.6. and 10 10. Acts 4 10. and 20
28. Romans 3.23.24. Gal..13. Ephesians. 2.14, 15. Col 1.14.20. 1 Timothy 1.15.



I. What is that means which God has appointed for this purpose?


B. Jesus Christ and his merits.


I. What is this Jesus Christ?


B. He is the John 1.14. and 3.16.
only begotten son of God, the Mat. 28.19. 1 John 1.7.
second person of Trinity, who of Genesis 3.15. Luke 1.31.
the seed of the Esaias 7.^4. Mat. 1.20.21. etc.
Virgin Mary, Mat 1.20. Luke 1.34, 35.
sanctified by the Holy Ghost, Heb. 2.16, 17. Phil. 2.6, 7, 8.
assumed, and the same, personally united unto his Deity, a true humane John
1.14. Heb 10.15.
body, endued with a reasonable Mat. 26.38. Mark 14 34.
soul, and so in John 3.13. 1 Timothy 3.16.
one and the same person, became true Esaias 7.14 John 1.1.
God and true 1 Cor. 15.21.47. 1 Timothy 2 5.
Man, in all things Heb 2.17. and 4.15
like unto us, 2 Cor. 5.21. Heb. 4.15. 1 Pet. 2.22.
sin only excepted.


I. How are the two natures of Christ his Godhead and Manhood united together?


B. In such sort, as the one cannot be John 3.13. Ephesians. 4.10, 11.
severed from the other, neither is Romans 1.3, 4. and 9.5. 1 Timothy 3.16. 1 Pet.
4.1. Luke 2, 52. Mark 13.32. John 2.19.24.25. and 4.6. and 10 17, 18, and
21.17. Acts 3.21. 2 Cor. 13.4.
mixed nor confounded with, either converted into the other; but so, as both
remain really and truly distinct one from the other, both in essence,
properties, wills, actions and operations.


I. Was it necessary that our Redeemer, should be thus God and Man in one
person?


B. Yes altogether, for otherwise he could never have wrought the work of our
redemption.


I. For what cause was it needful he should be God?


B. First, the greatness of the evil that oppressed us. Secondly, the
greatness of the good we stood in need of, necessarily required it so to be.


I. In what things consists the greatness of our evil?


B. The Ezra 9.5, 6, 7 Psalm. 40.12. Tit. 3.3.
horriblenesse of our sins. Secondly, the infinite Gen 2.17. Ezekiel. 18.20. Gent.
26, 27.
wrath of God due unto the same. Thirdly, by the Romans 5:14. and 6.23.
dominion of death. Fourthly, the Ephesians. 2.2. 2 Timothy 2.26.
tyranny of the Devil; from Psalm. 49.6, 7, 8, 9. Esaias. 43.11. Mat. 16.26.
all or Not from wrath, etc. Deuteronomy. 4.24. Nahum. 1.6. Revel 19.15. Not from
sin, Esaias 43.25. Mark 2.7. Not from death, Hos. 13.16. 1 Cor. 15.57. Not
from the Devil, Rom 16, 20. Revel. 1.18.
any of which, no mere creature was possibly able to deliver us.


I. What are the good things we stood in need of?


B. First, Esaias 43.25. Mark 2.7.
remission of our sins. Secondly, 1 Cor. 15.54 55.56, 57. Romans 16.20.38.39,
40. Romans 8.35, 36. etc. 1 Pet. 1.5. Romans 6.23. Mat. 25.34. Luke 12.32.
deliverance from death and Satan. Thirdly, Psalm. 51.10. Ezekiel. 36.26, 27.
restitution of Gods image. Fourthly, Ierem. 32.38, 39.40. Romans 8.35, etc.
defense against sin, the World, Devil and Hell. Fifthly, z eternal life and
happiness: neither of which we could attain unto, but by him who is truly and
essentially God.


I. Why was it necessary he should be Man?


B. Ezekiel. 18.20. Romans 5 17, 18, 19. and 8.3.
First, because the justice of God required, that the same nature which had
offended should also be punished, and that in no other, but in that in which
his Laws were violated, satisfaction for the breach of them should be made.

Secondly, because the person that should be our Savior, was to suffer Mat.
16.21, 22, 23, and 20.1^ 18, 19. Heb. 2.10.
many things, yea, Mark 10.34. Heb. 2.9.
death it selse, and to shed his Heb. 9.18, 19, etc. Mat. 26.28. 1 John. 1.7.
blood for us, without which we could not be redeemed.


I. Why must he be God and Man in one person?


B. First, that so he might be a fit mediator between God and Man, as it were
an indifferent person to both, Ephesians. 1.10. Col. 1.20. 1 Timothy 2.5.
and alike affected to either party, both offending and offended, being (as it
were) as nearly allied to the one, as to the other, and on either side both of
them to him.

Secondly, Acts 20.28. 2 Cor. 5.19. 1 John 1.7.
that the works performed by him in his Manhood, might be of infinite merit,
and so consequently, sufficiently available to make expiation for our sins,
by which, no less then an infinite Majesty was offended.


I. In the description of Christ our redeemer, you said he was in all things
like us, sin only excepted: show me therefore how it came to pass that he
descending from the corrupt and sinful stock of Adam, as well as others, yet
should be free from sin, when as it is contrary with all other men beside
that come from him, Ephesians. 2.1.
who are all from their mothers wombs most lamentably infected therewith, and
even borne dead in sins and trespasses.


B. The reason is, because though Christ came from Adam, as all other men do,
Mat. 1.20. Luke 1.35.
yet his conception and birth were not after the common and ordinary manner of
other men's, but after a peculiar, extraordinary and miraculous; he being formed
of the seed of a most pure Virgin, which never knew man, by the wonderful and
ineffable power of the Holy Ghost, who in the very first moment of her
conception, sanctified that seed of hers, and severed it from all, even the
least defilement of sin, which can be imagined.


I. Was it necessary that he should be so holy and righteous, without any
stain of sin at all?


B. Yea certainly, Heb. 7.26.27. 1 Pet. 3.18. 2 Cor. 5.21.
most necessary, for otherwise his works and sufferings could have been of no
merit or efficacy, to save us from the guilt and punishment of our sins, but
he Ezekiel 18.20. Romans 6.23. Gal 3 10.
himself should have needed a Savior for his own redemption.

Secondly, because his humane nature was to be perpetually and personally
united to the Godhead it self, Psalm. 5.4. 2 Cor. 6.14.
which could never have been, had it so much as in the least degree that can
possibly be conceived, been polluted with sin.


I. By what means has this Jesus Christ effected the work of our redemption?


B. Partly by his passive obedience or sufferings, and partly by his active
obedience or righteousness.


I. What understand you by the passive obedience or sufferings of Christ?


B. His most Ioh. 10.17, 18 Heb. 10.9.
voluntary and willing undergoing and bearing in our Esaias 35.4, 5.6, etc. Romans
4.25.
behalf, both in his 1 Pet. 2.24.
body and Esa. 53.10, 11 Mat. 26.36, 37, 38.
soul, the Esa. 53.3, 4, 5.6, etc. Luke 22.24, etc. Gal. 3.13. Phil. 2.8.
full punishment and wrath of God, which by our sins we had deserved to
endure for ever and ever.


I. What benefit do we reap by this passive obedience or the sufferings of
Christ?


B. Rom 3 24, 25. and 5.9, 0 and 8.1 Col 1 14. Tit 2.14.
The justice of God is thereby fully satisfieded for all our sins, so that we
are for ever cleared from them, and the whole punishment due unto them; God of
his endless mercy, imputing the merit thereof unto us, and so accounting and
accepting of it, as if we our selves had made most exact satisfaction for them.


I. How comes it then, since Christ has borne the burden of our sins, and
satisfied the justice of God for them, that notwithstanding, the faithful are
so Psalm. 73.14. and 34 9. 1 Cor. 15.19.
grievously afflicted in this life, and also subject to may 57.1. Heb. 9 27.
death in the end thereof?


B. The miseries and afflictions the faithful endure in this life, are not
properly punishments, neither may they so be termed, but loving and 1 Cor.
11.32 Heb. 12.5, 6, 7.
fatherly chastisements of God, that they may not perish with the children of
this world. And as for death, it is no 1 Cor. 15.55.56. Number. 23.10.
curse, no evil to them; but contrariwise, the greatest blessing and good
which can befall them; for it frees them from all Romans 7.24. Ephesians. 5.27. Col.
1.22.
sin and Revel. 14.13. 2 Cor 4.17. 2 Kings 22.20.
misery; and immediately Phil 1.20.23 2 Timothy 4.7, 8. Revel. 14.13.
possesses them of unspeakable and everlasting happiness in Heaven.


B. But is not this injustice and cruelty in God, to lay the punishment of us
who are the offenders and transgressors of his Law, upon Christ, a most
guiltless, innocent and holy man?


B. No thing less, in as much as Christ took upon himself to be our pledge
and surety, Heb. 7.22.
to make satisfaction to God for our sins.

Secondly, because he was no way compelled to undergo the penalty due unto
us; but most freely, Mat. 16.21, 22, 23. and 20.28.
willingly, and of his own accord, did suffer, and submit himself thereunto.

Thirdly, Romans 9.5. Tit. 2.13. Heb. 7.24, 25.26.
because he being not only man, but God also, and consequently, of infinite
power, he was able to bear the full wrath of God incensed against us, to
wind out of the same and overcome it.


I. But how can this be, that Christ being but one single man, that his
obedience and sufferings which were also but for a short space, should be of
that merit and efficacy, as to make satisfaction for the sins of so many
innumerable men and women, when as every particular sin, even the least
ungodly thought, deserves no less then everlasting destruction, both of body
and soul?


B. Because the obedience and passions of Christ, are not the obedience and
passions of a mere man alone, but of him, who in unity of person, is God as
well as Man, and therefore of infinite Glory and Majesty. Now as himself is
infinite, so must needs his obedience and sufferings be of no less then
infinite and unlimited force, value and efficacy.


I. What mean you by the active obedience or righteousness of Christ?


B. Mat 1.20. Mark ^4. Luke 1.35.
First, the innocence, sinlesnesse, and most perfect holiness of his
conception; he being conceived and borne most pure, without the least stain of
sin.

Secondly, the actual obedience of his life, Mat. ^^7. John ^.^9 46. John 4.34.
whereby on our behalf, he fully and most perfectly, even to his death, kept
all the Commandments of God, shunning with detestation all and every sin
forbidden; and performing with all alacrity and joyous gladness, all and every
good work required by the same.


I. What is the benefit we receive by this active obedience or righteousness
of Christ?


B. By this we have right to eternal life and happiness, 1 Cor. 1.30. and 2
Cor. 5.21. Romans 10.4.
God of his infinite goodness imputing the same unto, and accepting it on our
behalf, as if we our selves had perfectly fulfilled the Law in our own
persons.


I. Is then the actual obedience of Christ, necessary to our salvation, as
well as his passive obedience and sufferings?


B. Yea certainly, because his sufferings do but only Romans 4.25. 1 John.
1.7. Revel. 1.5.
expiate and make satisfaction for our sins, and deliver us from hell and
damnation, the wages thereof; but it Leuit. 18.5. Mat. 19.17. Romans 10.5.
is the imputation of his righteousness, which inuests into, and gives us
title unto the Kingdom of Heaven, there being no possibility, nor hope of
entering thereinto, without fulfilling the whole Law of God.


I. And is Christ's pure and sinlesse conception necessary for us, as well as
the obedience of his life?


B. Yea, we have need of both; of the one, to answer for the Psalm. 51.5.
Ephesians. 1.2, 3.
impuritie of our polluted conception and births; of the other, for the
sinfulness of our wicked Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3. James 3.2.
lives and actions.


I. But Christ was bound to perform obedience to the Law for himself: was he
not?


B. No. Because from the first moment of his conception, his Manhood was
personally united unto the second person of the most holy Trinity, Mat 1.20.
Luke 1.25.
and consequently, was not only Man, but God; and therefore was not bound to
any Law, neither stood in need of any legal righteousness, being already
endued with a far more excellent and exact righteousness, even the
righteousness of God; so that the only end for which he fulfilled the law,
was, that the same might be Romans 4.6. and 9.30. Phil. 3 9.
imputed to us, and we thereby endued with such an absolute and perfect
righteousness, as might entitle us to eternal life.

Luke 17.7, 8, 9, 10. Exodus 20.6.
Moreover, had Christ been bound to perform obedience to the Law, as a duty
from, and for himself due to God, his obedience (though never so exact) could
not have been meritorious at all, no, not so much as for himself.


I. What are we yet further taught in the Scriptures concerning Christ our
Savior?


B. That he is the sole and only 1 Timothy 2 5. Heb. 9.15.
mediator between God and the Elect, to 2 Cor. 5.19. Col. 1.19, 20, 21
reconcile them for ever; to obtain from God, and effectually confer upon
them, John 10.28. and 17.2.22.24.
eternal life and glory, with As remission of sins, Mat. 9.6. Regeneration,
Mat. 3.11. John 1.33. The graces of Gods Spirit, John 4.10.14. John 1.14.16.
Adoption, etc. John 1.12.
all things whatsoever are requisite thereunto.


I. How many are the offices of Christ, as he is our Mediator?


B. They are three, to wit, his Deuteronomy. 18.15. Acts 3 22. and. 3.37.
Prophetical, Psalm. 110.4. Heb. 2.17.
Priestly, and Esaias 9.7. John 18.33, 34, 36, 37.39.
Kingly office, in respect of which, he is called Psalm. 2.2. Acts 4.27. Romans
1.1.3.
Christ, that is to say, Anointed.


I. What are the functions of his Prophetical office?


B. Esaias. 16.1. Mat. 11.27. John 1.18. Luke 24.25. Acts 16.14. Mark 9 24. Luke
17.5. Heb. 12.1.
First, to reveal unto us the will of God his Father.

Secondly, to illuminate our minds to know and understand it.

Thirdly, to work our hearts to believe and obey the Doctrine which is taught.


I. Wherein stands the office of his Priesthood?


B. First, in Heb. 6, 7.26.27. etc. and 9.13.14.26.
offering up himself Heb. 9.12.25, 26, etc. 1 Pet. 3.18.
once for all, an Gal. 3.13. 1 John 1.7. and 2.1, 2. Romans 8.34. Heb 7.5.
all-sufficient, propitiatory and expiatorie sacrifice for the sins of Gods
Elect.

Secondly, in making continual intercession for them, to his Father in Heaven.


I. How does Christ make intercession for us?


B. First, by Heb. 9 24.
presenting himself and the infinite merit of his oblation unto God his
Father, with a continual John 17.24.
desire, that for the same, we may for ever be reconciled unto him, abide in
his favor, and be made heirs of eternal glory.

Romans 8.26.
Secondly, by stirring up in us by his holy Spirit, sighs and groans which
cannot be expressed.

Thirdly, Revel. 8.3, 4.
by offering up our prayers and thankesgiuings to God his Father, and making
them (howsoever stained with many weaknesses and imperfections, as they
proceed from us) pleasing and acceptable unto him.


I. You think not then, that Christ prostrates himself upon his knees to his
Father, and makes any vocal prayers or supplications unto him in our behalf,
do you?


B. No, in no wise. This is but a fantastical conceit and foolish dream, of
such as cannot distinguish between earthly and heavenly things, between
Christ in his humiliation, and in the height of his glorious exaltation: yea,
it is no less then an execrable blasphemy, against the sacred person of our
Savior, so to affirm.


I. Proceed we now to the Knigly office of Christ, and tell me how he does
execute that?


B. He executes his Kingly or Regal office two ways; one in respect of his
Elect: the other in respect of his and their enemies.


I. How does he execute it in respect of his Elect?


B. First, in Acts 18.9, 10, 11.26.18. Mat. 28.19, 20.
collecting them out of this world, and kingdom of Satan, to become the
members of his Church.

Secondly, in ruling and governing them, being so collected, by his Esaias 2, 3.
Ephesians. 4.11, 12. etc.
Word and Rom 8, 9. 1 John 2 27.
Spirit.

Thirdly, by Joel. 2.28. Acts 2.16, 17, 18. 1 Cor. 12.8, 9. etc.
pouring upon them the Gifts and Graces of the Holy Ghost.

Fourthly, in Psalm. 34 9, 10. Mat 6.25, 26. Romans 8.31.
providing for them so far as he sees expedient, the blessings of this life.

Fifthly, in defending them against their enemies, both Mat. 18.10. Acts 5.19.
and 18 9, 10.
corporal and John 10.28. and 17.11, 12. Jude 1.
spiritual: and lastly, possessing them of Mat 25.34.46. John. 10.28.29. Luke
10.18, 19. Acts 9.3, 4. etc. and 13.8, 9. etc.
eternal glory and happiness.


I. How does he execute this kingly office, in respect of his and their
enemies?


B. In x curbing, repressing and Exodus 7.19. etc. and 8, and 9, and 10, and 11.
Chap. Act 13.11.
plaguing them in this life. Secondly, in Psalm. 2.9.
destroying and confounding them: which he does partly in this Exodus 14.27,
28. Acts 12.22, 23.
world, but especially in the day of 1 Cor. 25.24, 25. 2 These. 1.6, 7, 8, 9.
judgment, when he shall be the full and final perdition of them 2 Pet. 2, 4.
Jude 6. Romans 16.20.
all, and shall tread down Romans 16.20.
Satan himself, our arch and capital enemy, under his feet.


I. But is he that person whom we profess and believe to be the true Savior
of the world indeed, and he on whom we are solely and wholly to rely for
eeternall life and salvation?


B. He is undoubtedly; Acts 2.36.17.3 and 18.28. and 2.36. John. 11.27. 1 Pet.
1.20. Acts 2.23.
there is not the least scruple to be made of it.


I. How prove you him so to be?


B. First, because God before the foundations of the world, ordained him and
none other to be the Savior of mankind.

Secondly, John. 3.17.34. and 17.4.18. Gal. 4.4.5.
God has sent him into the world, unto this end and purpose, to accomplish the
work of our redemption.

Thirdly, the properties of a true Savior, are to be found in him, and in him
alone.


I. What are the properties of a true Savior?


B. First, that he be very Man. These particulars are proved before.
Secondly, a holy Man. Thirdly, God as well as well as Man. And lastly, God and
Man in one person. All and every of which, are truly accomplished in this
Jesus, in whom we believe, and never were, are, or shall be in any else.


I. What other reason can you give, to prove him to be the true and only
Savior of the world?


B. It was prophesied of him that should be the Messiah and Savior of the
world, that he should come of the seed of David, Ier 23 5 and 33.15. So did
Jesus, Mat. 1.16. Luke 2.4. and 3.24. That he should be borne at Bethelem, Mich
5.2. So was Jesus, Mat. 2.^ Luke 2.6, 7, etc. That his birth should be, when
the Scepter wa departed from Judah, Genesis 49.10. Then was Christ borne, Luke 1,
2, etc. That he should be the Son of a Virgin, Esaias 7.14. So was Jesus, Mat.
1.23, etc. Luke 1.34 and 2.4. That he should be of a mean and poor condition,
Zach. 9.9. So was Jesus, Luke 2.7. Mat. 8.20. 2 Cor. 8, 9. That he should be
contemned, rejected, vilified, etc. Psalm. 22.6. Esaias 53.3. So was Jesus, more
then ever any before or since, Mat. 26.67, 68. and 27.39, 40. etc. Mark 15.17,
18, etc. and 6, etc. 29, 30, etc. Luke. 22.62 63, etc. That one should go
before him, to prepare his way, Esaias 40.3. Malach. 3.1. so had Jesus, Mat. 3.1.
Mark 1.4, etc. Luke 3.3, etc. That he should come riding on an Ass, Zach.
9.9. So did Christ, Mat. 21.1, 2, etc. Mark. 11.1, etc. Luke 19.29, etc. That
he should be grievously afflicted, Esaias 53. So was Christ, Mat. ^^.38. and
27.46. Mark 14.34. and 15.24. Luke 22.42, 43, etc. That the Jews and Gentiles
should conspire to destroy him, Psalm. 2.2. So they did against Christ, Mat.
26.34. Mark 15.1. Acts 4.25, 26, 27, etc. That he should be prized at thirty
pieces of silver, Zach. 11, 12, 13. So was Christ, Mat. 27.3. That he should be
betrayed of one near unto him, Psalm. 41.9. So was Christ, Mat. 26.49. and
27.34. Mark 14.43. Luke 22.21.48. That he should be numbered with
transgressors, Esaias 53.12. So was Christ, Mat. 27.15.17, and 38. Mark 15 6, 7.
and 6.27, 27. John 18.39, 40. That he should be spit upon, buffeted, etc Esaias.
50.6. So was Christ, Mat. 27.30. Mark 14 65. That his hands and his feet
should be pierced with nails. Psalm. 22.16. So was Christ served. Mat. 27.35.
Mark 15 24 ^ohn ^9.18. and 20.25, 26, 27. Acts 4.10. That in his thirst and
agony Vinegar should be given him to drink, Psalm. 69 21. So to Christ, etc.
Mat. 27.48 Mark 15.23.36 John 19 29, 30. That they should divide his Garments,
and cast lots on his vesture, Psalm 22.^8. So Christ's, etc. Mar. 27.35. Mark
15.24. John 19.^3 24. That he should be put to death, Esaias 53 12, etc. So was
Christ, Mat. 27.50. Mark 15.37.44, 45. John 19.33. That he should rise from
death, Psalm. 16.10. So did Christ, Mar. 28.6. Mark 16.6. Luke 24.6, 7. Acts 4
10. That he should ascend into Heaven, Psalm. 68.18. So did Christ, John. 20.17.
Acts 1.9, 10, 11. Ephesians. 4.8, 9 That he should sit down at the right hand of
God, Psalm 110.1. So Christ, Acts 7.56. Ephesians. 1.20, 21. Col. 3.1.
Beside all that has already bin alleged: This also does most unanswerably
euince him to be, because all those several, and almost innumerable things
which were prophesied by God in the Old Testament, concerning that person, that
should be the Messiah and Savior of the world, do all concur, and are most
exactly fulfilled in him, and in no other.


Of Faith.
I. SHall there be a general and universal salvation of all men and women,
by this Jesus Christ his merits?


B. Mat. 7.13, 14 21, 22. and 20.16 2 These. 1.8, 9.
No. Though his obedience and sufferings be of Acts 20.28. 2 Cor. 5.19.
sufficient price, to redeem all men in the world, yea, of ten thousand
thousand worlds, if there were so many; yet only such shall effectually be
saved by him, as Habak. 2.4. Mark 16.16. John 3.14, 15, 16, 17, 18.26.
believe, and by a true and lively faith, make application of his merits to
themselves.


I. What is a lively faith?


B. It is the Romans 12.3. Ephesians. 4.9. and 2.8. Phil. 1.29.
gift of God, wrought in Mat. 20.1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
his appointed time, by the 1 Cor. 12.9. 2 Cor. 4.13.
holy Ghost, in the Acts 8.37. Romans 10.9.10.
hearts of his Acts 13.48. Tit. 1.1.
Elect, by the Romans 10.17. 1 Cor. 3.5.
preaching of the Word Mat. 18.6. and 19.14. Luke 1 15.
ordinarily, whereby they are made to Esaias 53.11. John 4.36. and 10 38.
know and understand the doctrine of salvation by Christ and his merits, to
John 17.8. James 2.19.
assent to it for truth, and to make peculiar Job 19.25. John 20.28. Gal. 2.20.
application thereof unto themselves, being persuaded that Christ and all his
merits, belong unto their own persons in particular, so as whatsoever he has
done or suffered, for the salvation of any: he has done, and suffered the same
for their salvation, and that for the same, their sins are forgiven them,
they are accounted righteous before God, and shall eternally be saved as well
as any other.


I. Is not the knowledge of the Scripture and the mysteries of salvation
therein contained, and believing the same to be true, sufficient to eternal
life, without particular application thereof, unto every man's own person?


B. No verily. But beside this, particular application or affiance, is
necessary to a true saving justifying faith, yea, the principal part thereof,
the very soul (as it were) the form, pith and marrow of it.


I. Let me hear your reasons?


B. First, because many Mat 7 23. John 17.12. 2 Pet. 2.20, 21.
Reprobates which shall never be saved, yea, the very James 1.19.
Devils themselves, that are irrecouerably damned, know the Scriptures, and
believe the Articles of faith and the Word of God to be true.

Secondly, Job 19.25. John 20.28.
the Saints already glorified, have been saved by no other but this
particularizing Faith.

Thirdly, we are to pray for remission of our Mat. 6.12. Luke 11.4
sins, and the imputation of Christ's merits, for our selves, therefore also
Mark 11 24 James 1.5, 6.
particularly to believe the same.

Romans 5.1.
Fourthly, it is only this particularizing faith, which gives to a man true
peace of Conscience.


I. By what degrees does God work this saving Faith in the hearts of his
Elect?


B. First, he reueales unto them their Deuteronomy. 27.26. Romans 6.23.
cursed and damnable estate through sin, by the knowledge of the Law, thereby
Mat 11.28. Acts 2.37. Romans 7 9, 10.
humbling and terrifying them with the dread of death and damnation.

Secondly, he Acts 2.38, 39 etc. and 16.31, 32.
makes known unto them, the sweet promises of the Gospel concerning Christ
Jesus; and thereby brings them to an hope that their sins are curable and
pardonable.

Thirdly, he Mat. 5, 6. Acts 2.37. and 16 30.
breeds in them an eager hungring and thirsting after the righteousness and
merits of Jesus Christ; even as one almost famished, hungers and thirsts after
meat and drink.

Fourthly, most Hos. 14.2. Psalm 51.12, etc. Luke 18, 13.
fervent and importunate prayer, for the pardon of their sins, and imparting
to them the merits of his Son.

Lastly, after the particulars mentioned (to the 1 Pet. 1.8.
unspeakable comfort of their souls) he imprints in their hearts a Mat. 7.7.
and 9.2. Gal. 2.20.
particular persuasion, that their sins are remitted, their persons
justified, and shall eternally be saved by and through Jesus Christ.


I. Is every believer endued with a like measure of faith?


B. No; in some it is weaker, in some stronger: some have a greater, Luke 17.5.
Rom 1.17. and 12.3. and 14.1.
some have a lesser measure of it, according as it pleases God the author and
giver of the same, to deal to every man.


I. What is a weak faith?


B. When a man out of true Mat. 11.18. and 9.13.
humiliation for his sins, and Genesis 4.13.
persuasion of the pardonablenesse of them, does Mat. 5.6. Revel. 21.6. Luke
1.53.
hunger and thirst after Christ and his merits, crying Psalm. 10.17. and 145.19.
Luke 18 13.
to God in his heart, with Romans 8.26.
sighs and groans which cannot be expressed, to have the same imputed to him,
that his sins may be pardoned, and his person reconciled to him.


I. What is a strong faith?


B. It is a plerophorie, and full assurance of the heart, whereby one makes
sure and resolute account, Psalm. 23.6. Romans 4.20, 21. and 8 38, 39. Heb. 10.22.
that the merits of Christ appertain unto him, that God loves him in
particular, has pardoned all his sins, is reconciled to him, and will most
certainly possess him of everlasting life.


I. Romans 4.21. and 8 38, 39.
Cannot a man be saved, unless he have a strong faith, such as was in Abraham
and Paul?


B. Mat. 12.20. Mark 9.24, etc. John 20.27.
Yes. The least measure of faith, though it be but as a grain of Mustard
seed, if it be in truth and sincerity, is effectual to salvation.


I. What reasons beside Scripture, can you give, for further confirmation of
this point?


B. Mat. 6.30. and 8.26. Mark 9.24.
First, because the least measure of faith that can be named, is true faith, as
well as the greatest: even as the least drop of water, is as truly water, and
as the smallest sparckle of fire is as truly fire, and have the nature of water
and fire in them, as well as the whole Ocean or greatest flame.

Secondly, faith saues not as it is a 1 Cor. 13.9.12. Ephesians 4.13. 2 Pet. 3^.8.
quality, grace or virtue of the mind, either in respect of any dignity, merit
or worthiness in it self; but as it is an John 1.12. Gal. 2.16. Phil. 3.9.
instrument, and (as it were) the hand of the soul, to apprehend and apply the
merits of Jesus Christ. Now this the weakest faith does as truly, though not so
firmly and powerfully as the strongest; even as the feeble hand of a young
infant can hold a piece of Bread, as well and truly, though not so stably and
steadfastly, as the strongest and stoutest Sampson or Goliath.

Thirdly, Mark 16.16. John 3.14, 15, 16.18 36. Acth 10.43. and 16.31.
the promises of God are made indefinitely to all believers whosoever, and no
where appropriated to such as have a strong faith; and therefore the weak in
faith, have interest in them, as well as the strong.

Fourthly, God commandes us not to reject, but to Romans 14 1. 1 These. 5 14.
receive the weak in faith, and with all loving affection to tender them, etc.
Himself therefore whose Exodus 34.6. Esaias ^9.15. Psalm 36.5.
compassions infinitely surpass all men's in the world, cannot be less
gracious, etc.


I. May one then that has but a small measure of faith, content himself
therewith, and rest in it?


B. No, by no means, but must heartily be Mark 9.24.
grieved for the weakness and infirmity of it, unfeignedly 1 Pet. 2.2. Mark
9.24.
desire increase, and earnestly labor in the use of all good 1 Pet. 2.2. Luke
17.5. Acts 2.4.2.46.
means ordained of God, to get it strengthened and augmented. Yea, whosoever
has in truth attained to the least dram or grain of this saving grace, he
will do all these things, as also be changed and renewed both in Acts 15.9.26
18. 2 Cor. 5.17. James 2.18. Tit. 3.8.
heart and conversation.


I. Is it not the duty of every man, to prove and examine himself, whether he
be endued with this gift of faith, or no?


B. 1 Cor. 11 28. 2 Cor. 13.5.
Yes surely, and it greatly concerns every man to have an especial care so to
do.


I. May a man then know whether he have says or no?


B. Acts 8.37. 1 Cor. 2.12. 2 Timothy 1.12.
Yea surely, every true believer knows he does believe.


I. What are the marks or notes whereby one may know and be assured, that he
is a faithful person?


B. Romans 5.1. Romans 8.15, 16. Gal 4.6.
First, true believers have peace of Conscience.

Secondly, the Spirit of God testifies to their spirits that they are his
children.

Thirdly, Rom 7.23, 24. Gal. 5.17. Acts 2.21. and 9.11.14 Romans 8.16. and 10.14.
Job. 2.3. and 27.8, 9, 10, Psalm. 119.109.141.143.157. Reu. 22.17.20. Romans 8.23.
2 Timothy 4.8.
they feel a conflict within themselves, between the flesh and the spirit,
corruption and grace.

Fourthly, they religiously exercise themselves in prayer.

Fifthly, they continue to fear, love, obey and serve God, in adversity, as
well as in prosperity.

Sixthly, they desire the coming of Christ to judgment.

Seventhly, they desire and endeavor to bring Esaias 2, 3. Luke 22.32. John
1.41, 42.45, 46.
others, especially those under their Genesis 18, 19. Josh. 24.1^. A and s 10.2.
Job 17.9. John. 15.2. 2 These. 1.3.
charge, to the faith, knowledge and service of God, and to further the
salvation of others as well as their own.

Eighthly, they grow and increase in grace.

Ninthly, they heartily and unfeignedly love the Psalm. 15.4. Act 4.34, 35. etc.
Gal. 5, 6. 1 John 3.14, 15.23. Col. 1.4.
children, the Psalm. 119.103.111.113.167, etc. 1 Pet. 2.2.
word, and faithful Mat. 10.41. Acts 16.15.33. Romans 1^.4.
Ministers of God.

Tenthly, their constant care, study, Psalm 119.94. John 15.5. Iam. 2 18, 19, 20
and labor is, to keep all the Commandments of God, being fruitful in all
good morkes, Romans 8.1. 1 John 1.7.
to the praise of his great and glorious name.


I. Is faith then always accompanied with good works?


B. Yea certainly, they are ever inseparable companions, Acts 9.36. Luke
23.40, 41 42. Luke 19.8.
so as the Sun can no more be without light, or the fire void of heat, or a
good tree in the season thereof, destitute of fruit, then faith can be without
works.


Of good Works.
I. What do you call good Works?


B. They are actions Deuteronomy 12.32. Esaias 29.13. Mat. 15.9.
commanded of God, and done by persons Genesis 4.4. Mat 7.18. John. 15.4, 5.
regenerate, and ingrafted into Christ, in Romans 14.23. Heb. 11.6.
faith, 1 Cor. 13.1, 2, 3. 1 Timothy 1.5.
love, Luke 17.10. and 18. 11.
humility, 1 Samuel 15.22.
obedience to God, and for his Mat. 5.16. 1. Cor. 10.31.
glory.


I. Are any able to do good works of themselves?


B. 2 Cor. 3.5. Phil 2 13. John ^5.5.
No. We cannot so much as think one good thought, but by the grace of God.


I. Are the good works done by the faithful in this life, perfect and without
blemish?


B. No, Eccles. 7.20. Esaias 64.6.
but even the best and holiest that proceed from them are full of infirmities,
and greatly defiled with sin.


I. How comes this to pass?


B. Because their regeneration, Romans 7.23, 24. Gal. 5.17. Mark 19.24. Mat.
14.31. 1 Pet. 2.2, etc.
faith and love of God, and their Neighbors, which are the roots from whence
all good works do spring and grow, are ever imperfect in this world.


I. If the works of the faithful be so imperfect and defiled with sin, how
then come they to be acceptable and pleasing to God?


B. Through Christ, Mat. 3.17. and 17.5. 1 Pet. 2.5.
with whose righteousness (as with a Mantle) all their imperfections and
defilements are covered, and for his sake, are fully pardoned and remitted them.


I. Do good works justify?


B. No. Romans 3.20.28. and 4.4, 5. Phil. 3.9.
A man is justified by faith only, without the deeds of the Law.


I. Why cannot works justify?


B. First, Ephesians. 1.6, 7. and 2.7, 8.
because then Christ should be but an imperfect Savior.

Psalm. 143.2. Phil. 3.8, 9.
Secondly, because the Saints of God have renounced their works in the matter
of Justification.

1 Kings 8.46. Pro. 20.9. Acts 15.10. Ioh. 15.2.4, 5. Genesis 4 4. Mat. 3.17.
Thirdly, because no man can perfectly fulfill the Law.

Fourthly, because we must be justified, before we can do any good work at
all.


I. Do the good works of regenerate persons or believers merit everlasting
life?


B. No, in no wise.


I. What are your reasons?


B. First, because no works of the most sanctified can be absolutely good,
Esaias 64.6. Eccles. 7.20. James 2.10.
but even the best they do have many wants and faylings in them, needing mercy
and forgiveness.

Luke 7.10 and 1 74, 75. Romans 8.12. Ephesians. 2.10. Job. 22.2. and 35.7, 8. Psalm.
16.2. Romans 8.18. 2 Cor. 4.17, 18.
Secondly, what good works soever they do, or possibly can do, are due to God
from them.

Thirdly, they can be no way profitable or beneficial to God.

Fourthly, there is no proportion at all, between them and eternal life or
salvation.


I. But has not Christ merited, that our works might merit?


B. He has merited to make our Ephesians. 1 6 and 2 ^^ 14, ^5, 16.18.
persons and ^ Pet 2.5
works acceptable to God his Father: but that he should merit to make our
Romans 4.4 and 11 6. Gal. 2.21. and 5.3, 4.
works meritorious, is a brainesicke conceit, and newfound device, of such as
be enemies to him and his merits.


I If good works can neither justify, nor merit ought at Gods hands, why then
should we do them? Leuit. 19.2. Mat. 5, 16 48. 1 ^et. 1.15, 16.17.



B. First, because God commands them.

Secondly, that thereby we may testify our thankfulness to him, for his
Josh. 32.6. Confer with the Verse before, and 24.14 with Verse 5. Esaias 1, 2, 3.
Romans 2.4.
gracious benefits, especially our Luke 1 74, 75. Romans 12.1. 1 Pet. 1.17, 18.
redemption from everlasting woe and misery.

Thirdly, that we may Mat 5.16. John 15.8.
glorify him. Fourthly, edify the 1 Cor. 10.33
faithful. Fifthly, win the 1 Pet 2.12 and 3.1, 2.
faithless. Sixthly, give no Luke 17.1, 2. 1 Cor. 10.32.
offense to any. Seventhly, Tit. 2.10.
adorn the Gospel. Eighthly, Phil. 2.15. 1 These. 5.4, 5, 6.
beautify our profession. Ninthly, Tit. 2.8. 1 Pet. 2.12.15.
stop the mouths of Mat. 7.18. James 2.17, etc. 26.
ungodly men, that seek all occasions to defame us. Tenthly, that we may get
assurance of the truth of our s faith, 11. 1 Cor. 6 11. James 2.24, 25.
Justification, 12. 1 John 3.9 and 5.4.18.
Regeneration, 13. 1 John 3.10. Rom 4.14.
Adoption, 14. and Ephesians. 1.4. 2 Pet 1.5, 6 etc. to 11.
Election, 15. Leuit. 26.15, 16, and Deuteronomy 28.15, 16, etc.
escape Temporal, 16. and Mat. 7.19. Romans 8.13.
eternal punishments, 17. and obtain the blessings of Deuteronomy 28.1, 2, 3, etc. 1 Timothy 4.8.
this life, 18. and of that which is to Ezekiel. 18.5, 6. Psalm. 1, 2. and 15. all.
come.


I Do you hold then that good works are necessary to salvation?


B. I do so; and it is most certain that they are, as a Pro. 11.18, 19 and
10.17.
way to come unto it, or as Romans 8.1. Heb. 12.14. Psalm. 24.3, 4, 5.
signs and marks of such as shall be saved, or as inseparable Gal 5, 6. James
2.14 etc
truits and consequents of true saving faith, whose 1 Pet 1.9
end is salvation; or as qualities which God has decreed all shall be endued
withal, Ephesians 2.10. and 1.4.
that shall be made heirs of his Kingdom, but in no wise, as any Ephesians.
2.5.8. Tit. 3 5. John 14.6.
causes or merit thereof.


I. But Christ has freed us from the John 8.36. Romans 7.6.
Law, how then can there be such a necessity of the works of the Law to
salvation, as you affirm, or we at all bound to do them?


B. Christ has freed us from the Law indeed, in respect of the Mat. 11.30. 1
John 5.3. Acts 15.10.
rigorous exaction thereof, whereby it imposes upon every man, without
exception, a necessity of perfect obedience, even to the least title or tote
of it; as also in respect of the Gal. 3.13. Romans 8.1.
curse and malediction thereof, for transgressing the same: But, as it is a
rule of righteousness and holy Psalm. 119.5. Mat. 5.19, 20. etc. and 13.
obedience, so he has freed nor released none from it, but charge all that
will be saved, carefully and conscionably, to conform their lives and actions
thereunto.


I Proceed we now in the doctrine of Faith, and tell me, is this grace ever
lost, or utterly taken away from any that are truly endued with it?


B. No undoubtedly. It may be, and often is, even in Gods dearest children,
through the violent storms of temptations and their grievous falls, sorely
Psalm. 42.5, 6.11. and 77.7, 8, 9, 10. Psalm. 51.11, 12. Mat. 26.71, etc.
shaken, obscured and so buried (as it were) in their hearts, like fire in the
ashes, as that they have little or no feeling of it at all for a time; but it
is not, nor ever can be totally and finally Psalm. 1.3. Ier. 32.39, 40. Hos.
2.19, 20.
extinguished in any, to whom God has vouchsafed the same in any, though the
least measure.


I. Show your reasons.


B. Romans 11.29. John 13.1.
First, because the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

Luke 22 ^2 John 17.11.15.17.20.
Secondly, Christ has prayed for every one of the faithful, that their faith
may never fail.

Thirdly, nothing is able to separate any true believer from the love of God in
Jesus Christ. Romans 8.38, 39. Esaias 54 10.


Phil. 1.6.
Fourthly, God will perfect that good work which he has once beg^^^ne in his
Elect, to the end.

^iftly, God is both John 10.29. Romans 16.25.
able and Mat. 12.20. Mat. 18.14. John 10.28.
willing to uphold, confirm and strengthen the faith of all his children,
until they attain to the end of their faith, to wit, the everlasting
salvation of their souls.


I. Is the faith of any of Gods Elect perfect in this life?


B. No certainly, but even they which have it in fullest measure, have much
Mat. 6.30. Mark 9.19.24 John 20.25. 1 Cor. 13.9.12.
weakness, ignorance and doubting, mingled with it; and therefore Mark
29.24. 2 Pet 3.18.
must ever be laboring to get their faith strengthened and increased more and
more.


I. What are the means which God has appointed us to use for the
strengthening and increasing of our faith?


B. First 1 Pet. 2.2. and 2 Pet. 3.18. Acts 20.32. 2 These. 4.11, 12 13, 14
reading of his sacred Word, 2. and especially x hearing the same preached or
Catechized, 3. Luke 17.5. Jude 20. Mat 7.7.
frequent and fervent prayer, 4. religious and conscionable use of the Genesis
17.11. Romans 4.11. 1 Cor. 11.23, 24 etc.
Sacraments.


I. How are we to read the Word of God, that we may be edified thereby?


B. With Psalm. 25.4, 5. and 119.12.26.27. James 1.5.
prayer, 2. and Psalm, 119 161. Heb. 12.28.
reverence, 3. Luke 1.1.3. Acts 11.4.
order, 4. Heb. 4.2. John 5.46, 47.

meditation, 12. John 5.39. Acts 8.30.31.
care to understand, 13. Deuteronomy. 6.6, 7, 8. Psalm. 119.93:
remember, 14. Deuteronomy. 6, 7. Col. 3.16.
confer of, 15. Deuteronomy. 4.1.5. and 29.9. Revel. 1.3.
and practice what we read, using 16. Psalm. 1.2. Deuteronomy. 17.19, 20.
a daily diligence herein, yet ever with such a wise and discreet moderation,
as that we at no time, 17. Mat. 9.13. Eccles. 5.12.13.
neither tire our spirits before we give over, or 18. Exodus 20.9. Ephesians. 4 28.
neglect the duties of our personal and particular callings.


I. How are we to hear the Word preached or catechized?


B. Of every one that desires to hear so, as to be profited by his hearing,
three sorts of duties are carefully and conscionably to be practiced.


I. Which be they?


B. Some are to go before, some to accompany, some to follow after our hearing.

I. What duties are the people bound to perform, to the able and faithful
Preachers of the Word of God?

Of Prayer.
YOu said that prayer is also a mean to increase faith: what is prayer?

B. It is an Esaias 29.13. John 4.23, 24. Rom 12.12. and 10.1.1.
hearty and earnest Luke 18.1. John 14.14.
craving of Exodus 8.12. Dan. 9.3, 4.
God such things as belong to his Luke 11.2. 1 Cor. 10.31.
glory, and the Mat. 7.11 Luke 11.3, 4, 5, 6.11, 12, 13.
good of our selves, and Ephesians 6.18. 1 Timothy 2.1.
others, with Col. 3.17. and 4.2. Phil 46.
thanksgiving for such benefits as we have received.


I. Is every Christian bound to exercise himself in this duty of prayer?


B. Yes, Psalm. 50.15. Mat. 6.9. and 7.7, 8.
every one that has the use of reason, without exception of what age, state,
degree, condition or sex soever they be, and that Luke 18.1. etc. 1 These. 5.17.
daily.


I. What motives are there to stir us up so to do?


B. First, the Ier. 33.3. Esaias 55.6.
Commandment of God. 2. The Abraham, Genesis 17, 18. and 18.22.24 etc. Isaac,
Gen 28.34 and 24.63. Jacob, Genesis 32.11, etc. Moses, Exodus 15.25.17 4.11, 12.
David, Psalm. 55.1, etc. 16, 17. Psalm. 119.145, 146, 147, 164, and most of his
Psalms and prayers. Daniel, Dan. 6.10.
examples of the Saints and Servants of God, both in the Abraham, Genesis 17, 18.
and 18.22.24 etc. Isaac, Gen 28.34 and 24.63. Jacob, Genesis 32.11, etc. Moses,
Exodus 15.25.17 4.11, 12. David, Psalm. 55.1, etc. 16, 17. Psalm. 119.145, 146,
147, 164, and most of his Psalms and prayers. Daniel, Dan. 6.10.
Old and New Anna, Luke 2.37. The Apostle, Acts 1 14.24 3.1. and 4.24. and 6.4.
First believing Christians, Acts 2.42. Cornelius, Acts 10.2.4. with many others.
Testament, and of our Mat. 14.23. John 17. Luke 3.21. and often elsewhere.
Savior Christ himself, who upon all occasions used to power forth their
souls unto God by prayer. 3. It is a Psalm. 50.15. Luke ^ 37. Hence the Temple
called the house of prayer, Esaias 56.7. Mat. 21.13. Hence also prayer is often
put for the whole worship of God, etc. 1 Cor. 1, 2. 2 Timothy 2.22.
principal part of that worship and divine service we owe unto God. 4. It is
the means to get deliverance from all Exodus 8.^, ^, 1^, and^. and 9.28, 29.33.
2 Chronicles. 6 24, 25, 26.
evils which are upon us, and to obtain all Mat. 7.7, 8. Luke 1^ ^^. John 15.7.
good things we stand in need of, either for soul or body, as also to have
the same 1 Timothy 4, 5.
sanctified unto us. 5. It is a Romans 10.14. 1 Cor. 1.2.
mark of Gods Children to exercise themselves in holy invocation, and
contrarily, of a Psalm. 14 4. and 79 6. Ier 10.25.
wicked man and profane Atheist, not to pray.


I. Can any man of himself perform this duty of prayer as he ought? Zach
12.10. Romans 8.15 26.



B. No, none, of what gifts or graces soever, can pray as he ought, without the
help and assistance of Gods Spirit.


I. To whom must we direct our prayers?


B. Neither to Col 2.18. Revel 22.9.
Angels, nor Esaias 63.16. John 14.6.
Saints, nor any other Deuteronomy 4.19. 2 Kings 21.2, 3. Esaias 42.18.
creature whatsoever, but only to Psalm. 5.2, 3. and 77.2, 3. A and s 10.2.
God the Mat. 6.9. John 16.24.
Father, Acts 7.59. Revel. 1.5.
Son, and Holy 2 Cor. 13.14. Revel. 1.4.
Ghost.


I. Why must we pray only to God?


B. Because he only is 1 Kings 8.27. Psalm. 139.7, 8.
every where present to hear us, all Genesis 18.14. Ephesians. 3.20.
sufficient, omnipotent, and Psalm. 24.6.9, 10.15.18. and 50 15. Mat. 7.7, 8.
willing to help and give us what we crave, also he only knows our 1 Chro.
28.9. Psalm. 139.1, 2.
hearts, and is alone to be John 14.1. Romans 10.14. Ier 17.5.
believed in.


I. In whose name are we to offer up our prayers unto God?


B. Only in the name of John 14.13, 14. Col. 3.17.
Jesus Christ, who is the only and perpetual John 14.6. Romans 8.34. 1 Timothy 2.5.
mediator between God and Man, not of redemption and propitiation alone, but
also of intercession.


I. What is it to pray in the name or mediation of Jesus Christ?


B. To entreat God to vouchsafe unto us, the things we pray unto him for, not
for any Dan. 9 7.8.18. Ezra. 9 6, 7.15.
merit or worthiness in our selves, or any other creature in heaven or in
earth; but only for the worthiness, intercession and merits sake of Dan 9.17.
Heb. 10.19, 20, etc. Romans 8 32.
Jesus Christ his Son, in and through whom alone he is well Mat. 3.17. and
17.5.
pleased.


I. What things are we to pray for?


B. Only for such as are agreeable to the Psalm. 19.14. 1 John 5.14.
Will of God, revealed in his Word, which are of three sorts: First, such as
concern the Mat. 6.9, 10. Luke 11 2.
glory of God: Secondly, the Mat. 6.12, 13. Luke 11.9.
salvation of our souls: Thirdly, our Mat. 6.11. Pro. 30.
corporal good and welfare in this present lise.


I. How are we to pray for these things?


B. The two first kinds; namely, the things belonging to the Mat. 6.9, 10.33.
Psalm. 51.1, 2, 7.
glory of God and our salvation, are principally, and in the first place to be
craved of us, as also absolutely, without any condition or limitation at all:
but the last, to wit, the things of this life, with condition of Mat. 6.10.
Mat. 26.42. Romans 1.10.
Gods will, their making for his Mat. 6.33. 1 Cor. 10.31.
glory, and our own and brethrens good and Pro. 30.8. Mat. 16.26.
salvation.


I. For whom must we pray?


B. For all men, of what quality, 1 Timothy 2.1: Ephesians, 6.18.
rank or condition soever, either now living, or hereafter for to John 17.20,
21. Psalm 90.16.1
live, such only excepted, who are apparently known, to have committed the
unpardonable sin against the John 5.16. 1 Samuel 16.1, 2. Ier. 7.16.
Holy Ghost.


I. May we not also pray for the dead?


B. No; in no wise.


I. Why so?


B. Because we have no warrant so to do, either by commandment from God, Romans
14.5.23.
or approved example of any of the faithful, recorded in Scripture which have
done it, or by promise to be heard, if we do it, or threatening to be punished
if we do it not.


I. What other reason can you render against praying for the dead?


B. It is a mere vain and frivolous thing, to pray for any departed this
life, they being either such as dyed in the faith, and are consequently for
ever Revel. 14.13. 2 Cor. 5.1, 2. Phil. 1, 23.
blessed in heaven, and therefore need not our prayers: or such as dyed in
their sins, and so are irrecouerably damned in Luke 16.23, 24 etc. Revel. 21.8.
Hell, to whom our prayers can do no good; neither for procuring their full
and final redemption, nor so much as the least Luke 16.23.24, etc.
intermission or mitigation of their torments.

What conditions are required in our prayers, that they may be acceptable to
God, and graciously heard of him?


B. Unfeigned Job 11.13, 14 Psalm. 26.6. John 9.31.
repentance, Mat. 5.23.24. 1 Timothy 2.8.
love, Genesis 18.27. Psalm. 5.7. Heb. 12.28.
reverence, Dan. 9.3. Mat 14.23.
minds purified from all cares, carnal, worldly and wandering thoughts; Nehem.
9.34 34, 35. Dan. 9.4, 5, etc.
confession of sins, Psalm 17.1. Heb. 10 22.
sincerity, Genesis 32.10. Luke 18.13.
humility, 1 Cor. 14, 15.
understanding, Phil. 1.4.
wisdom, Phil. 1.4.
joy, Ezra. 9.6, 7. Mat. 11.28. Psalm. 86.1. Esaias 26.16.
lively feeling of our sins and wants, Col. 4.12. James 5.16.17.
fervent desires to have them supplied, craving things for righteous and holy
James 4.3. Mat 6.13.
ends, namely, the glory of God, the furtherance of our own and brethrens
salvation.

Moreover, Heb. 11.6. Romans 10.14.
saving faith, Mark 11.24. James 1.6.
confidence to be heard, Luke 18.1. Ephesians. 6.18.
perseverance, in case we have not present audience, humble Psalm. 51.18.
Lament. 3.26. Mat. 6.10. Luke 22.42. Psalm. 78.41. Psalm. 40.1.
submission to the good pleasure of God, both for the things themselves we sue
for, as also their quantity, quality, manner and time, how, and when it shall
please him to bestow them on us; neither conditioning with, nor limmiting him
to any circumstances, but merely referring all to his most wise and fatherly
dispose, who knows what is best for us: a religious Pro. 2, 3.4. Nehem. 4.9.
care to frame our practice according to our prayers, joining thereunto the use
of all sanctified means for obtaining the things we pray for.

Lastly, all our prayers must ever be accompanied with our 1 Timothy 2.1. Phil.
4.6.
heartiest praises and thankesgiuings for blessings received, not being like
the nine, but that one Leper, Luke 17.12.18. as ready ever to glorify God for
his mercies obtained, as forward to beg the obtaining of them.


I. Is it necessary that these conditions be observed of us in perfection?

No, neither can they so be of any, Psalm. 80.40. Esaias. 64.4. Romans 8.26. Revel.
8.3, 4.
how holy soever, but of all that desire a blessed success of their prayers,
they must be observed in sincerity and truth, with sorrow, repentance, desire
of pardon for faylings, with earnest striving also to their uttermost power to
come as near perfection, as possibly they can: which whosoever do, all
blemishes, infirmities and imperfections shall be graciously passed by, and
forgiven of God in Jesus Christ.


I. How many ways does God hear the prayers of men?


B. Two ways, first in mercy and favor, as when he gives them such things as
be 1 Samuel 1.17.20. Luke 1.13, 14.
good for them.

Secondly, in 1 Samuel 8.5, 6. etc. Psalm. 78.29, 30, 31. Mat. 27.25.
wrath and indignation, as when he sends the evils and mischiefs which they
sinfully wish upon themselves.


I. How many ways does he hear the prayers of his children?


B. Two ways also, first by giving them what they 2 Kings 20.2.5. Exodus 14,
15, 16, etc.
desire, according to his will. Secondly, in not giving them that, but a better
Mat 26.39. Heb 5.7. 2 Cor. 12.8, 9.
and more expedient for them, hearing them according to their weal, although
not according to their will.


I. Why does God many times defer to hear the prayers of the faithful?


B. First, to try them: Secondly, to exercise their faith and patience: Mat.
15.22, 23, etc. Mark 10.46, 47. Psalm. 22.1, 2. and 69.3.
Thirdly, to cause them to be more frequent and fervent in their prayers:
Fourthly, to convince them more thoroughly of their own disabilities to help
themselves, that so he may keep them from sacrificing to their own Nets, and
make them acknowledge that the blessings they receive, come wholly and solely
from the hands of his providence: Fifthly, to prepare the heartier welcome, and
more thankful entertainements for his benefits at their hands: Sixthly,
because he sees it expedient for us to delay the granting our Petitions: or
finally, for some other reason best known to himself.


I. Why does God many times not hear men's prayers at all?


B. Either because they ask such things as they Acts 8.19. Mat. 20.20.21.
ought not to ask, or though good in themselves, yet hurtful to them: or else
because they ask James 4.3. 1 John 5.14, 15 Esaias 1.15. and 59.1, 2, 3, etc.
amiss, not in that manner, nor for those ends, nor with that religious
observation of the due conditions and circumstances of holy prayer, spoken of
before, as they ought.


I. May we use a prescript or set form of prayer?


B. Yea doubtless, for as much as such prayers are not only Mat. 6.1, 2. etc.
Psalm. 92. Observe the Title of it, and the Title of Psalm. 102. 2 Chronicles. 29, 30.
Luke 11.1.
approved of, but also Number. 6.23.24, 25, etc. Luke 11.2. Hosea 14.2.
enjoined and commanded in the Word of God. Howbeit, every Christian ought to
labor to get himself so furnished with the Zach. 12.10.
Spirit of supplication, as that he may be able to deliver his own
Ambassages, and prefer his own petitions to the Lord in 1 Kings 8.22, 23,
etc. Ezra 9.7, 8, etc. Jacob Genesis 32.9, 10, etc. 1 Samuel 1.10, etc
words of his own conceiving.


I. How many kinds of prayers be there?


B. Two, Luke 2.37. Acts 3.1.
public, which is performed in the public assemblies of Gods children, in
which the Minister or Pastor in a 1 Cor. 14.
known tongue, with plainness of speech, and an audible voice, is to go
before, as the mouth of all the rest: and the whole Congregation with silence,
in their hearts and affections to follow; and in conclusion, with conjoined
voices, by saying It is a fault in many Congregations: Let the Minister pray
never so loud, the people are mute to say Amen; contrary to the laudadle
practice of the Primitive Church, whose Amen was like a clap of thunder, as
Hierom witnesses.
Amen, to testify their communion in their prayers, their assent unto the
same, their earnest desires to have them heard, and assured confidence, that
they shall so be through Jesus Christ.

Secondly, Private, which is performed either by Mat 6.5, 6. 1 Kings 14.42
our selves alone, or together with Act. 1.13.14 and 12.12. and 16.25.
others, in any private or secret place.


I. Are Christians bound to use both these kinds of prayers, public and
private?


B. They are: neither the Psalm. 35. Mat. 21.13. Luke 2.37.
one, nor the Mat. 5, 6. and 14.23. Acts 1.13, 14.
other may be neglected of any that desire to live like Christians, and men
fearing God; especially, the public, which is most to be Psalm. 26.8. and 84
1, 2. etc. Acts 3.1.
set by and esteemed of every man.


I. Is the use of the voice necessary to prayer?


B. To public prayer it is, which 1 Cor. 14.
always ought to be vocal, that the people (in whose name they are conceived)
may answer, Amen; but in private prayer it is not simply Exodus 1 4, 15 1 Samuel
1.13. Romans 8.26.
necessary, so that the Psalm. 25.1. Lam. 2.19. John 4.24.
heart and affections be lifted up to God; howbeit, it is helpefull for the
Psalm. 130.1, 3. and 141.1. and 142.1.
kindling of our affections stirring up, and continuing our devotion, keeping
our minds in order and restraining them from wandering. In which respects it is
vere fit and convenient to use the voice, even in private prayer, as also,
because in so doing, we do in a specall manner, consecrate our Iame. 3.9.
Psalm. 51.14.16. and 145.21.
tongues to the end for which God gave them us; namely, to honor and glorify
him withal.


I. In what place is this duty of prayer to be performed of us?


B. John 4.21. 1 Timothy 2.8.
In x any, without difference or exception: yet for order sake, it is fit that
public prayers be made in Esaias 56.7. Psalm. 134.2. Acts 3.1.
public places, appointed for the public worship of God: and private, in
places Dan. 6.10. Mat. 6.6. Acts 10.9.
private, as our houses, chambers, etc.


I. Ephesians. 6.18. Col. 4.2. 1 These. 5.17.
When are Christians to pray?


B. At all times, and upon all occasions.


I. What especial times are there, in which every one ought to give himself
to set and solemn prayer?


B. Ordinarily every Psalm. 88.13. and 92.1, 2. Mark 1.35.
morning after our rest, before we enter upon the duties of our personal
callings. Secondly, at all our 1 Timothy 4, 5. Acts 27.35. Mark 6.41.
repasts, when we are comforting ourselves with the good creatures of God.
Thirdly, every Dan. 6.10. Psalm. 55.17. Psalm. 92.2.
night when we betake our selves to sleep: Romans 12.12. Ephesians. 6.18.
Extraordinarily at all other times whenever occasion is offered, especially
in the Psalm. 50.15. James 5.13, 14. Psalm. 18.6.
time of trouble and affliction.


I What helps of prayer are there?


B. Luke. 21.36. Ephesians. 6.18.
Watchfulness, 1 Pet. 4.7.
sobriety, h gestures, and Mat. 17.21. Acts 10.30.
fasting: The three first whereof, are to be used at all times; the latter,
especially upon extraordinary occasions.


I. What gestures must we use in prayer?


B. There are many Some of Gods children have prayed kneeling, as Solomon, 1
Kin. 8.54. Dan. 9, 10. Our Savior Christ, Luke 22.41. Steven. Act. 7.60. and
others. Some fallen on their faces, as Moses and Aaron, Number. 16.22. Ezekiel,
Chap. 9.8. Some lying, as David, 2 Samuel 12.16. Ezekiah, Esaias 38.2. Some
sitting, as Jacob, Genesis 48.2.15, etc. Some standing, as the Publican, Luke
18.13. Some with eyes elevated or lifted up, as David, Psalm. 121. Some with
eyes dejected or cast down, as the Publican, Luke 18.13. Some with hands
spread abroad, as Moses, Exodus 9.29. Some with hands lifted up, as Moses,
Exodus 17.11. and David, Psalm. 28.2. Some smiting their breasts, as the
Publican, Luke 18.13.
described, but none precisely prescribed to us in Scripture. Notwithstanding,
we must be careful in all our prayers, to use such as be grave, sober, and
beseeming so sacred and divine an exercise, and may best serve both to express
and excite, stir up and further the reverence, devotion, humility, seruencie
and holy affections of our hearts.


I, What is fasting, which you say is an help of prayer?


B. It is a Hest. 4.16. 2 Samuel 12.16, 17.20.
voluntary and Hest. 4.16. 2 Samuel 12.16, 17.20.
general abstinence from all meats and drinks, as also from 1 Kings
21.27.29. Dan. 10.3. Jonah 3.6, 7.
all other comforts and delights of life, for a convenient time, not
prejudicial to Hose 6.6. Leuit. 23.32. 2 Samuel 1.12. and 3.35.
health or nature; that thereby the 1 Cor. 9.27.
flesh may be subdued, our Joel 2.12, 13. Ezra 8.21. Nehem. 9.1, 2.
humiliation and unfeigned Esaias 58.5, 6, etc. Jonah 3.8.
repentance for sin testified and furthered, and our selves better fitted for
1 Cor. 7.5. Luke 2.37. Act; 10.30. Ier. 36.9, 10.
prayer, and the service of God.


I. Are Christian bound to fast?


B. As this exercise of fasting is a Joel. 2.12, 13.
testification of, and a furtherance to humiliation and repentance for sin.
Secondly, a 1 Cor. 9.27.
means to repres^e and mortify our rebellious flesh, and a 1 Cor. 7.5.
help to make us more fervent and devour in prayer, and other religious
services of God; it is a Joel 2.12, etc.
duty, when time and occasion requires, of Christians not to be neglected:
yea, it is utterly a Esa. 22.12, 13.
fault, that the use thereof is no more frequent among us, there being As Gods
judgments upon us, and hanging over our heads Our unbridled Iusts so much
needing mortification. The impious and hellish crimes which every where reign,
etc.
so many occasions, public and private, that daily call and provoke us
thereunto: Howbeit, in it self simply considered, without relation to these
holy ends, for which it ought to be observed, it is but a thing Mat. 9.14, 15.
Romans 14.17, 18.
indifferent, and no part of divine worship; much less may it be esteemed
Ioh. 19.28.30 Heb. 10.14. Luke 17.10. 1 Ioh. 2.1, 2. and 10.14.
satisfactory for sin, or meritorious of temporal or eternal benefits, as
the Papists most blasphemously teach and affirm.


I. When is fasting especially to be used?


B. When we our 1 Samuel 7.6. Nehem. 9.1, 2.
selves, or 1 Cor. 5.12.
any that appertain unto, or live among us, have dishonored God, and
scandalized the Gospel, by falling into any notorious crime. Secondly, when we
or they have any fearful judgment of God, either already 2 Samuel 12.16.
Nehem. 1.4.
lying upon us, or 2 Chronicles. 20.2, 3. Hest. 4.3.16.
hanging over our heads. Thirdly, when Ezra 8.21.22 23. Mat. 17.21. Acts 13.2,
3.
we desire to obtain some special and singular benefit at the hands of God.


I. What are the kinds of fasting?


B. They are two; first private, when a man is Dan. 10.2, 3. 2 Samuel 12.16.20
alone by himself, or with those of his Zach. 12.11.12, etc. Hester 4.16.
family, or some other his especial Job 2.11.12, 13
friends or neighbors; for some of the premised causes, gives himself to this
exercise: the second is public, when by the Ezra 8.21. 2 Chronicles. 20.3. Joel 3.7.
appointment and proclamation of such as are in authority, men publicly 2 Chronicles. 20.4, 5. Joel 1.13, 14.
assemble together, thus to humble and afflict their souls in the sight of God.


I. What pattern has God prescribed us to frame our prayers by in Scriptures?


B. That most divine and heavenly prayer, Mat. 6.9, etc. Luke 11.2, etc.
which our Savior Christ in the days of his flesh, taught his Apostles, and
in them all Christians, commonly called the Lords prayer.


I. May we use no other form of prayer but that?


B. For John 14.13. Mat. 26.41. and confer Mat. 6.11. and Luke 11.3. also
Mat. 6.12. and Luke 11.4. and you shall find a difference for words, in their

Of the Sacraments in general.
I. YOu affirmed the Sacraments to be another means, appointed of God, for the
confirmation and increasing of our faith; let me know of you therefore, what a
Sacrament is?


B. A Sacrament is a holy, outward, or visible Genesis 17.10, 11 Romans 4.11.
sign and Romans 4.11. Mat. 26.28.
seal, Genesis 17.10. Exodus 12.1, 2, 3, etc. 1 Cor. 11.23, etc.
instituted of God, to be joined to the Mat. 28.19. Acts 20.7.
preaching of his Word, to 1 Pet. 3.21. 1 Cor. 11.26.
declare and Romans 4.11. Mark. 16.15, 16 Acts 2.38.
confirm, unto every Mark 16.16. Acts 8.37.
believer, that for the only merits of Christ Acts 4.12. and 10.43.
his Son, he bestows remission of sins, and life eternal, upon themselves
in John 20.28. Gal. 2.20.
particular, as well as any other, by receiving whereof, we also promise,
covenant and bind our selves, to Acts 8.37. Mat. 28.19.
believe his promises in Christ, and to walk in all dutiful Genesis 17.1, etc.
Romans 6.4, 5, 6. Mat. 3.11.
obedience to his will, all the days of our lives.


I. Why are these signs called Sacraments?


B. They had this name imposed upon them, by ancient worthy Divines, in regard
of the semblance and agreement between them and a Sacrament; that is to say, a
solemn oath, by which Soldiers bound themselves to their Emperor or General.


I. Wherein does this semblance or agreement consist?


B. In these particulars. First, as Soldiers (by this form of oath called
Sacrament) did addict, vow and bind themselves, to serve and obey their
General, and to fight couragigiously and faithfully under his banner, in
defense of him and his Commonwealth: So we that are Christians by the use of
these holy mysteries, do addict, vow and for ever bind our selves, as it were,
by a solemn oath, in the presence of God himself, Men and Angels, to serve
and obey him in all things, and like valiant Soldiers, manfully to fight under
his Banner, against his and our enemies, the World, the Flesh and the Devil,
unto our lives end.

Secondly, as Soldiers at their taking of this oath, received their Emperors
Cognizance, that thereby they might declare themselves to be, as it were,
consecrated to him and his only service. In like manner we, Genesis 17.11. Mat.
28.19.
when we publicly participate in these sacred ordinances of God, the
Sacraments, do, as it were, put upon us, the Cognizance and Arms of Christ
our Lord, King and Emperor, declaring and professing to the world thereby,
that we have and do consecrate and dedicate our selves to him and his only
service for ever.


I What conditions are required to a true Sacrament?


B. These six. First, an Mat. 3.11.13 16.
external visible sign.

Secondly, an Mat. 26, 27, 28. Acts 2.38.
internal invisible thing, signified thereby.

Thirdly, an apt August. If Sacraments had not a similitude of the things
whereof they are Sacraments, they should be no Sacraments at all. Hence it is,
that the name of the thing signified is attribu^ed to the sign. Act. 22.1^ and
Mat. 26.26.27. Ti^. 3.5
correspondence and agreement between them both.

Fourthly, that their institution be of Mat. 28.19. 1 Cor. 11.23.
God, not of man.

Fifthly, that their use be warranted by Gods Genesis 17.9, 10, etc. Mat. 28.19.
Commandment.

Sixthly, that there be a Mark 16.16. 1 Cor. 10.16. and 11.24, 25.
promise passed from God, concerning them, to ascertaine us, that the the
things signified and represented, shall in our lawful partaking of them, be
communicated unto us: where all or but any one of these be wanting, there can
be no true Sacrament.


I. Are the Sacraments necessary to salvation?


B. Necessary they are in respect of Gods Mat 28.19. Luke 22.19. Acts 22 16.
Commandment, who charge us to receive them: and as they are Mat. 28.19.
Romans 4.11.
means appointed of God for the confirmation and increase of our faith, which
has need of all Mat. 6.30. Mat. 9.24.
helps, to support and strengthen it. But simply and absolutely necessary they
are Mark 16.16 Luke 1.15. and 23.43. The children of Israel not Circumcised
for forty years space in the Wilderness, Joshua 5.2, 3, etc.
not, so as that whosoever partakes not of them, must of necessity perish: for
not the want of the Sacraments, when they cannot, but the profane, wilful and
irreligious Genesis 17.14. Luke 7.20.
contempt of them, when they may be enjoyed, is that which is damnable in the
sight of God.


I. You do not hold then, that grace is tied to, included or shut up in the
Sacraments, or that they of themselves, by virtue of the work done, confer
grace, remission of sins, regeneration, justification, etc.


B. By no means: they have no such power or force in them.


I. Show your reasons.


B. First, the Sacraments are only Genesis 17.11. Romans 4.11.
signs, seals, tokens and pledges, not causes, workers, conueying vessels,
Pipes or Conduits, as it were, of grace.

Secondly, it is proper to Mark 1.8. Romans 3.30.
God alone, to confer and bestow these things.

Thirdly, the 1 Cor. 3, 4, 5. James 1.18.
preaching of the Word, conferres not grace of it self, neither can do, and
therefore neither the Sacraments.

Fourthly, some have received remission of sins, been justified. etc. Romans
4.11. Acts 10.47.48.
before the use of the Sacraments; others So many baptized in their infancy.
long after the use of them, others that Luke 23.43. So the Emperor Valentine.
never were partakers of them. Also many have been partakers of the
Sacraments, yet never at all of the John 17.12. Mat. 7.22. 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3.
things signified thereby, but have dyed in their sins, and everlastingly
perished.


I. When are the Sacraments used in an holy and lawful manner?


B. When they are used according to the Romans 14.23. 1 Cor. 11.20.23 2 Chro.
35.6.13
institution of Christ, by the Acts 8.37, 38. Mark 16.16. Heb. 11.28.
faithful, for whom, and to Mat. 3.6.11. Acts 2.38.
those ends for which they were ordained.


I. What are the ends for which God has ordained Sacraments?


B. First, that thereby our communion with Christ and all his benefits, Acts 2
38.41. Romans 4.11. and 6.^. 1 Cor. 12, 13. Gal. 3.1.27. 1 Cor. 10.16.
might be, as it were, in lively pictures most evidently declared, as also more
and more scaled and ratified unto us, and our faith in the through persuasion
of these things, strengthened, and the more confirmed.

Secondly, to be testimonies and Genesis 17.1.7, 8, 9. etc. Acts 7.8. Exodus 12,
13.
pleadges of the Exodus 19.5. Deuteronomy. 7 12. Ier. 31.32, 33, 34. Heb. 8, 9, 10, etc
Exodus 24.3.7.
covenant between God and us, of his binding himself to become, and for ever
remain our God, and to give us remission of all our sins, his spirit of
sanctification, and eternal life, through his Son Jesus Christ: and on the
contrary, of our binding our selves to become and for ever remain his people,
to Acts 8.37. Mat 28.19.
believe his promises, and to obey all his Commandments.

Thirdly, Genesis 34.14. Exodus 12 43 44 Ephesians. 2.11, 12. etc.
to be outward marks and characters of our Religion, to distinguish us the
true Church and people of God, from all other Sects, Professions and Societies
of men whatsoever, which believe not in Jesus Christ.

Fourthly, Ephesians. 4.3, 4, 5. 1 Cor. 10.17. and 12.12.13.
to be bands and means of mutual love, concord and brotherly amity, between
the faithful.

Fifthly, Mark 1.4. Mar. 28.19. Acts 20 7. 1 Cor 11.18.20.23.
to occasion holy assemblies of Gods Children, and be a means of preserving
and propagating the Gospel and public ministry thereof, to the worlds end.


I. Where ought the Sacraments to be administered?


B. 1 Cor. 11.20.
In the public place of Gods worship, the people of God being there met
together.


B. Who are to administer them?


I. Mat. 28.19. Mark. 16.15, 16 Heb. 5.4.
Only such as be lawfully called to be Ministers of Gods Word.


I. How if a private person take upon him to administer the Sacraments?


B. He shall greatly incense the wrath of God against him, for presuming to
meddle with his holy things, 2 Samuel 6, 7. 2 Chronicles. 26.16, 17.
having no calling thereunto: and as for his action, it is wholly void, the
Sacraments administered by him, are no Sacraments, but mere nullities.


I. How if the Minister which delivers the Sacrament, be a profane, vicious,
wicked man, a scandalous liver, an hypocrite, etc. may the Sacraments
nevertheless be effectual, and profitable to the receiver?


B. Phil. 1.15, 16, 17, 18. Mat. 23.2, 3. John. 3.5. 1 Cor. 4 4.6, 7.
Yea doubtless, no less then if they were dispensed by one that is truly
religious, godly and faithful, so that we for our parts, participate of them
as we ought, and as God requires; for the virtue and efficacy of the
Sacraments depends not upon the holiness and worthiness of the Minister, but
wholly and solely upon the institution, promise and blessing of God, the author
and ordayner of them.


I. Can any Minister give the things signified by the Sacraments, as remission
of sins, regeneration, etc?


B. No assuredly, Mat. 3.11. Luke 3 16. Deuteronomy. 30.6. 1 Cor. 3.6, 7. John. 6.32.
be he never so holy, zealous or religious; of never so rare and singular gifts
and graces of God; yet he can only confer the outward signs and elements;
and whosoever receives any thing else, he has it not from the Minister, but
immediately from God himself.


I. Is it necessary, that the Word of God be always preached, when the
Sacraments be administered?


B. It is Mat. 28.19. Mark. 16.15, 16
very fit and meet, that preaching should always accompany the Sacraments,
and greatly to be wished, that as our Savior Christ joined the Commandments
of them both together, so that they might be always joined in their
administration, as we also read in sacred Writ, both Mark 1.4.
John the Baptist and the Apostles to Acts 2.41.42 and 10.34, etc. and 20.7.
have done: Howbeit there is no such absolute necessity thereof, as that the
Sacraments being administered without preaching, should become either no
Sacraments at all, or not effectual and available to the worthy partakers of
them.


I. How many be the Sacraments of the New Testament?


I. Two only, and no more; namely, Mat. 28.19.
Baptism, which succeeded Col. 2.11, 12
Circumcision; and the Mat. 26.26 1 Cor. 11.25.
Lords Supper, which came in place of the Passover. Mat. 26.26 1 Cor. 11.25.



Of Baptism, the first Sacrament of the New Testament.
I. What is Baptism?


B. It is the Therefore administered immediately after conversion John 4.1. Acts
2.41. and 16 14, 15.3
first Sacrament of the New Testament, ordained by our Mat. 28.19. Mark 16.16.
Savior Christ, wherein by the outward Mark 1.5.9, 10. John 3.23.
dipping, Heb. 10.22. 1 Pet. 1, 2.
sprinkling or Acts 22.16. Ephesians. 5.26.
washing with Mat. 3.6.11. Acts 10.47.
water, in the Mat. 28.19.
name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, is signified and sealed to the
parties baptized, Mark 1.4. Acts 2.38.
remission of all their sins, by the Ephesians. 1.7. Col. 1.14.
blood of Chrst; Mat. 3.11. John 3.5. Ephesians. 5.26.
sanctification by his 1 Cor. 6.11. John 3.5, 6.8.
Spirit; their Romans 6.3. Gal. 3.26, 27.
into Union and Communion with him and all his Mark 16.16. 1 Pet. 3.21.
benefits, their Hence men immediately baptized, as soon as converted, etc.
Mat 28.19. Acts 8.12.36, etc.

contrary, they that are baptized, do promise, protest, vow and bind
themselves, to Mark 16.16. Acts. 19.4.
believe in God, fear Mat. 28.19. and 3.11. Rom 6.3, 4. Hence so frequently
called, the Baptism of Repentance.
honor, worship, serve and obey him in all things, as their only Lord;
renouncing all ungodliness, and all wordly lusts; and living soberly,
righteously and godly in this present world.


I. What is the outward sign in Baptism?


B. The Element of Acts 11.16.
Water, together with the action of Heb. 10.22.
sprinckling, John. 3.23.
dipping or washing the body therewith. Tit 3.5.



I. May not Baptism be administered with some other Element, as well as with
Water?


B. No, in no case; because this is directly contrary to the John 1.33.
institution of Christ, and practice of Mat. 3.11.
John the Baptist, the Act. 8.36, etc. and 10.47.
Apostles and Primitive Church, and with Leuit. 10.1, 2
Nadab and Abihu, to offer strange fire unto the Lord, such as he never
commanded; which cannot be but a fearful provocation of his wrath, and
exceeding dangerous to whomsoever shall presume so to do.


I. What manner of Water is to be used?


B. None other but pure, simple, natural and ordinary; Mat. 3.13. John. 3.23.
Heb. 10.22.
not waters compounded, mixed or artificial, either with addition of any other
Element whatsoever.


I. What is the thing signified in this Sacrament?


B. The Heb. 9.14. 1 John. 1.7.
blood and Mar. 3.11. Luke 3.16.
Spirit of Christ, together with our 1 Cor. 6.11. Mar. 1 4.
justification, John 3.5.
regeneration or sanctification, and communion Romans 6.3. Gal. 3.26, 27.
with him and his merits through the same.


I. What is the correspondence or agreement between the water and sprinkling,
or washing therewith, and the Blood and Spirit of Christ our Savior?


B. That even as the filth and uncleanness of our Mark 7.4.
bodies, Nehem. 4.23
clothes, etc. is purged and washed away with the Element of Water: so the
filth and uncleanness of our souls through sin, is purged and washed away,
by the blood, (that is to say, the Rom 4.25. and 5.8, 9, 10.
merit of his death and sufferings) and by the Spirit of Christ our Savior;
the one freeing us from the Revel. 1.5.
guilt and Romans 8.1. 1 John 5.24.
condemnation of sin, the other from the Rom 6.11.12.22. Tit. 3.5.
dominion and reigning power thereof, causing us to dye unto sin, and live
unto righteousness.


I. Does the outward, visible washing of the body with Water, and the inward
invisible washing of the soul with the blood and Spirit of Christ, always go
together?


B. Romans 2.28, 29 Acts 8.13, etc.
No. No Reprobate Ioh. 13.10, 11 and 14.17.
is ever partaker of the inward washing, though he be ^^the outward; but only
the 2 These. 2.13. 1 Pet. 1.2.
Elect, and they not always at the very instant of their baptism, but some of
them Romans 4 11. Acts 2.41.
before, some As many Infants, so Paul long after Circumcision. Phil. 3.5. Acts
9.4, 5, etc.
after, according as it pleases God, before or after, to work in their hearts
the grace of Gal. 3.26, 27. Acts 15.9. and 10, 43.
faith, and thereby to incorporate them into his Son Jesus Christ.


I. Does Baptism, being duly administered and received of the faithful, purge
them from all their sins?


B. 1 Cor. 6.9.10, 11. Ezekiel. 36.25. Acts 22.16. 1 John 1.7. And hence the
Scripture (which is worthy our observation) does apply the salvation we have
(through faith) in Baptism, to all times of our lives, both past, present and
to come, to the time past, (...) has saved us, Tit. 3.5. present, (...) does
save us, 1 Pet. 3.21. the time to come (...) shall be saved, Mark 16.16.
Yes, both from original and all their actual sins, flowing from the same,
whether past, present or to come; whenever, howsoever or whersoeuer
committed; that is to say, it seals and assures the free and full remission of
them all, to every believer.


I. But is original sin utterly taken away and abolished in Baptism?


B. As touching the Acts 3.38. 1 John 1.7.
guilt and Romans 8.1. John 3.36.
punishment, it is abolished in every regenerate person, as also in respect of
the dominion of it, for it neither does, nor can Romans 6.6.11.14. 1 John 3.8, 9.
reign in them any more. But touching the vice, matter, contagion, and
corruption thereof, it Rom 7.13, 14, 15, etc. 23, 24, 25. Gal. 5.17.
remains in them even after Baptism, yea, till death, though 2 Cor. 4.16.
daily mortified more and more; and is truly and properly Rom 7.17, 18.20 23.
Heb. 12.1.
sin, and in it self worthy of eternal Romans 6.23. and 7.23, 24 etc. Gal.
3.10.
damnation; but that it is freely Acts 10.43. Romans 7.24, 25, etc.
remitted, together with all their actual transgressions, the cursed fruits of
the same, through Jesus Christ.


I. What are the ends of Baptism?


B. To signify, seal and assure unto us, our blessed Romans 6.3. 1 Cor. 12, 13.
1 John 1.3.
union and communion with Christ, and through him, with the whole Trinity; our
Mat. 28.19. John. 4.1.
admission into the covenant, favor and Church of God, Acts 2.38.
remission of all our sins, x regeneration, and Mark 16 16 Tit. 3.5.
eternal life.

Secondly, to admonish us of, and provoke us unto Romans 6.3, 4, etc.
Mark 16.16 Acts 8.37.
faith, To. 6.1, 2, etc. Mat. 3.11. Col. 2.12.
repentance, new obedience, and holiness of life, whereunto, by the use of
this Sacrament, we solemnly oblige and bind our selves.

Thirdly, John. 4.1. Genesis 17.14. Mat. 28.19.
to be a badge of our Religion, and (as it were) a public note to distinguish
us from Turks, Jews, Pagans, Infidels, and all such as call not upon, nor
worship God according to his Word.

Fourthly to be a means of public Mat. 28.19. Mark 1.4.
meetings in the Church, as also of unfeigned 1 Cor. 12, 13. Ephesians. 4.3, 4, 5.
love and charity among Christians, who by Baptism are all knit together into
one body; and made members one of another.


I. Who are to have the Sacraments of Baptism administered unto them?


B. First, Mark 16.15 16. Acts 2.^8.41. and 10.47, 48.
men and women of years, which are instructed in the Principles of Christian
Religion, and make profession of their faith, and unfeigned repentance for their
sins.

Secondly, infants of 1 Cor. 7.14.
one or both believing and baptized parents.


I. How prove you that Infants as well as men of years ought to be baptized?


B. Genesis 17.7. 1 Cor. 7.14.
First, because they are within the covenant of grace.

Secondly, Circumcision in whose Col. 2.11, 12.
place Baptism is succeeded, and is i^ substance, effect, ends and
signification, one (...) the same with it, was administ^^s unto Genesis 17.1^.
Leuit. 12.3.
Infants in the old Te^^^^nt, and that by the express ^^mmandement of God.

Mat. 28.19.
Thirdly, God enioynes the baptizing of all Na^^^ns i^ general, without
^xception of sex or age.

Fourthly, Acts 16.14.1^.33. 1 Cor. 1.16. Acts 18.8.
the Apostles baptized whole families and households, in which who can or dare
say there were no infants?

Fifthly, the promises of grace, Acts 2.39. Luke 1.14, 15. Mat. 19.14. and 18.2,
3, etc.
remission of sins, sanctification and eternal life, belongs to them.

Sixthly, because our Savior Christ in the days of his flesh, Mat. 19.13, 14.
Luke 18.15, 16.
commanded little children to be brought unto him, most graciously entertained
them being brought, and openly professed, that the Kingdom of Heaven belonged
even to them in particular.


I. What fruit or profit can there be of Baptizing children, which are
destitute of knowledge and understanding, and have not the use of reason?


B. First, it is exceeding and maruailous comfort to all believing parents,
Genesis 17, 18. Acts 2.39.
who thereby have it confirmed and ratified (as it were) under the broad seal
of heaven, that God loves not them alone, but their children also; and that he
will be the God, not of themselves only, but of their seed and posterity, to
protect, succor, guide, bless, sanctify and save them, even to a thousand
Generations.

Secondly, the Infant has an unspeakable blessing conferred upon it, in that
so soon as he enters into the world, he is made partaker of Christ, his
saving graces and benefits, received into the love, favor, covenant,
fellowship, family and Church of God, and is instated (as it were) into the
Kingdom of Heaven. The consideration whereof, when he comes to years of
discretion, will be a most effectual motive, to make him love, fear, honor,
worship and serve, with all willing and careful obedience, that God, who from
his Mothers womb, has done such great things for him.

Genesis 17.7. Acts 2.39.
Thirdly, hereby God promotes his own glory, in approouing himself true of his
Word and Promise, of showing mercy to the faithful and their seed.


I. When are infants to be baptized?


B. Ac^s 22.16.
The Scripture has not expressly prescribed or limited us unto any certain
time or day: notwithstanding: it is the duty of all Christian Parents, to offer
and present their children to be baptized, with all convenient speed they may.


I. Why so?


B. Because in so doing, Genesis 17.23.24.
they shall testify their reverent esteem of the Lords Sacrament, and their
ready willingness to perform obedience to his Ordinances.

Secondly, they shall thereby declare their loving affection to their children,
and their desire to have them partakers of Christ, Romans 4.11. and 6.3. Mark.
16.15, 16
of his spiritual blessings, and heirs with themselves of everlasting life;
which things are sealed and assured by the holy use of this Sacrament.

Thirdly, because the Apostles Acts 2.38.41. and 8.12.36, 37. etc. and 10.47,
48.
instantly without any delay, baptized such as gave any probable evidences of
their belonging to the Covenant, Church and Kingdom of God; which we are to
repute all Genesis 17.7.12. 1 Cor. 7.14. Mark. 13, 14, 15
Infants of believing Parents to do, even from the first minute of their
births.

Fourthly, Ier. 48.10.
God denounces a curse against all those that do his work negligently.

Fifthly, Exodus 4.24, 25, 26.
God was highly displeased with Moses, and like to kill him, because he
delayed to circumcise his Son.

Sixthly, the Israelites so soon as possibly they might, in respect of By the
Ceremonial Law, every woman was unclean seven days after her delivery of a
Manchilde, and for that space, the child also was accounted as unclean; and
therefore during that time, was not meet to be partaker of the holy Sacrament
of Circumcision, Leuit. 12.1, 2, ^. Now, so soon as these days were expired,
even the v^^y next, the eight day, the children were circumcised, Genesis 17.^2
and 21.4. Luke. 1.59.
ceremonial uncleanness, and their weakness to endure the Genesis 35.24, 25,
26. Josh. 5.8. Exodus 4.25, 26.

Parents and Elders, in whose power Infants are, ought with their greatest care
provide, that they depart not this life without Baptism; which if they do
not, they most grievously sin, and shall be punished for it, for that they have
contemned the Sacrament^ instituted by God.

The sooner godly Parents do offer up their children to be baptized, the
better they do, that (if it be possible) they may not be deprived of this
benefit.


bitter pains of Circumcision, without deferring it so much as a day, did
circumcise their children, and were straightly commanded of God so to do.


I. What time do you think is to be held most fit and convenient for the
baptizing of children?


B. Mat. 20.7.
Either the next public meeting of the Church, if any be in the week, or the
next ensuing Sabbath after the birth of the child, which, unless upon some
very urgent occasion, would by no means be pretermitted.


I. How often are men to be baptized?


B. No more but once only. Ephesians. 4, 5.



I. What are your reasons?


B. Because God Mat. 28.19.
commandes the receiving of this Sacrament, but once. 2. The Acts 2.41. and
8.12, 13.38.
Apostles baptized none more then once. 3. The Jews were Genesis 17.10, 11, 12.
Leuit 12.3.
circumcised but only once. 4. The efficacy of baptism once received extends
it self to Romans 6.2, 3. Gal. 3.27.
all the sins and the whole life of every believer. 5. We are but once 1
Cor. 12.13.
planted into Christ, once Tit. 3.5.
newborn, once 1 Cor. 6.11. Acts 23.8.
justified, once Mat. 28.19. Genesis 17.11. Acts 10.48. Romans 11.29.
adopted, once Mat. 28.19. Genesis 17.11. Acts 10.48. Romans 11.29.
admitted into the covenant, love, Church, Communion and fellowship of God; of
all and every which, Baptism is a pleadge and seal.


I. How is Baptism to be administered?


B. In the Name of the Father, Mat. 28.19. Acts 19.2, 3.
Son and Holy Ghost, as our Savior Christ commanded; and other form then
this, ought not to be used.


I. What is it to be baptized in, or into the Name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost?


B. By As God, so soon as Christ was baptized, did proclaim him to be his
Son, Mat. 3. 17. So by baptism he does (as it were) publish and proclaim
us to be his Children.

That this is the true sense and meaning of these words appea^es by 1 Cor.
1.12, 13, 14, 15. Genesis 48.16. Deuteronomy. 28.10. 2 Chronicles. 7.14. 1 K ngs 8.43. Ierem.
25.29. Esaias 4.1. Hence it is, that we have names given us at our baptism: as
the Jews had when they were circumcised, Luke 1.59, etc. and 2.21. that so
often as we hear our selves called thereby, we may be admonished and put in
mind of these things.


this form of speech is signified, that the party baptized is received into
the favor, covenant, family and communion of God, the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, one in Essence, and three in Persons; and that he is dedicated unto
God, and bound (as it were) by a solemn oath, to believe, love, worship,
honor, obey and serve him, as his only God and Lord, according to his Word, in
holiness and righteousness, all the days of his life.


I. What is the difference between Baptism and the Lord Supper?


B. Baptism is a seal, etc. of our ingrafting into Christ, of our
regeneration, justification, adoption to be the sons of God, and of our
entrance into the covenant, favor, fellowship, and Church of God.

The Supper of the Lord is the Sacrament of our upholding, 1 Cor. 10.3, 4.16.
and 11.24, 25, 26.
continuance, preservation and nourishment, etc. in this blessed estate; and of
our growth and increase in grace, until we be translated into the full
fruition of our heavenly inheritance.


Of the Lords Supper, the second Sacrament of the New Testament.
I. HOw may the Supper of the Lord be defined?


B. Thus: It is the Mat. 26.28. Mark 14.24.
second Sacrament of the New Testament, ordained by our Mat. 26.26. Mark 14.22.
Savior Christ, in the Mat. 26.45, 46, etc. Luke 22.47.48, etc.
night in which he was betrayed, wherein, by Mat. 26.4 26. 1 Cor. 11.24.
taking and Mat. 26.26.
eating the Bread Acts 20.7.
broken, and Mat. 26, 27. 1 Cor. 11.25, 26 etc.
drinking the Mat. 26, 27. 1 Cor. 11.25, 26 etc.
Wine powered out into the Cup, is signified and sealed to every John 6.35.40
47.51. 1 Cor. 11.27.
faithful and worthy receiver, his 1 Cor. 10.16, 17. and 12.13.
communion with Christ and all his benefits, and that his Body Luke 22.19. 1
Cor. 11.24.
was crucified, and his M^t. 26.28.
Blood shed, for his sins upon the Cross; and that their souls, by the same
his Body crucified, and his Blood shed, are John 6.47.51. etc.
sustained, preserved, and nourished up unto eternal life, no less surely and
effectually, then their Bodies by the use of Ps. 104.15. Zach. 10.7. 1 Timothy
5.23.
Bread and Ps. 104.15. Zach. 10.7. 1 Timothy 5.23.
wine, are nourished, etc. in this present, natural and temporary life we now
enjoy.


I. Why is this Sacrament called a Supper?


B. Luke 22.20.
First in respect of the time when it was instituted, and first celebrated,
which was about supper time.

Secondly, of the thing it self, because it is a holy spiritual Mat. 26.26,
27, etc. 1 Cor. 10.16.
Supper, Banquet or Feast, whereby the soul of every true believer, in a
spiritual manner, is fed and refreshed with the Body and Blood of Christ, to
everlasting life.


I. Why is it called the Supper of the Lord, or the Lords Supper?


B. First, in respect of the 1 Cor. 11.23.
author or ordainer of it, who is our Romans 14.8, 9.
Lord.

Secondly, of the end, because it is celebrated in 1 Cor. 11.24, 25.
remembrance of him, his death and passion.

Thirdly, it may also not unfitly be so called, in respect of the time when it
has been, and yet is accustomed to be administered; namely, for the most part,
on the Acts 20.7.
Lords day or Sabbath.

Fourthly, as also of the food we partake of in it, which is the Flesh and
Blood of our 1 Cor. 11.24, 25. John 6.54.56.
Lord Jesus Christ.


I. What are the outward visible signs in this Sacrament?


B. Bread and Wine, Mat. 26.26, 27, 28. 1 Cor. 11.24.25
as also all the rites and actions about them, both in Ministers and
Communicants, as breaking, giving receiving, etc.


I. What are the things signified by these signs?


B. The Mat. 26.26, 27, 28. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25
Body of Christ crucified, and his Blood shed, with his John 6.27.51 52.
giving, and our receiving, or spiritual John 6.53, 54 etc.
eating and drinking the same, through ^ohn 6.29.35 40.47.51.
faith, that is to say, our 1 Cor. 10.16. and 1.24, 25.
union with him, even his whole 1 Cor. 1.9. John. 6.56.
person, God and man, and our communion with all his merits, gifts and benefits
^ohn 6.53. and 15.5. 1 Cor. 1.30.
flowing from the same.


I. What is the correspondence or agreement between these signs and things
signified?


B. It is this: As the P^al. 104.15.
Bread and Wine which we eat and drink, do nourish, confirm, and preserve
our bodies in this natural life; so the Body and Blood of Christ crucified
(that is to say, the merit of his Romans 5.9.10. He. 9.15.27, 28.
death and passion) applied unto us by the hand of John 6.47.54
faith, do as certainly and effectually John 6.51.53 54 56, etc.
nourish, and preserve our souls unto that eternal life which is to come.


I. Why did our Savior Christ, of all other things in the world, select and
consecrate Bread and Wine, to be the Symboles and representations of his Body
and Blood?


B. In regard of the excellent analogy and likeness, that is between the one
and the other, in their several properties and effects.


I. Wherein stands the analogy and likeness between the Bread, and Body of
Christ?


I. In these particulars, all worthy observation. First, as Bread by Genesis 18.6.
Leuit. 26.26. Esaias 28.28.
water and fire, as also with many pressings and breakings, is prepared to be
corporal food for us: So the Body of Christ, by the water and fire (as it
were) of Esaias 53.3, 4, 5, 6, etc. Mat. 26.37, 38.39.42.44. and 27.46. 1 Cor.
11.24. broken for you.
afflictions, with many pressures, miseries and bitter torments, was prepared
to be spiritual food for us.

Secondly, as bread does Genesis 42 2. and 43.8. Judges 8.5.
nourish, sustain, Genesis 18.5. Psalm. 1^4.15.
strengthen the body, Esaias 58.7. Pro. 27.2^.
expel hunger, Pro. 27.7. Luke 15.15, 16.
delight and benefit those which are hungry, but none whose stomachs are
already Pro. 27.7. Luke 15.15, 16.
full: So the Body of Christ does John 6.51, 52. etc.
nourish, sustain and strengthen the soul, assuage the hunger thereof,
delight and benefit such as 1 John 6.35. Luke 1.53.
hunger after grace and righteousness; but nothing at all any Pharisaicall
Mat. 9.1^. Luke 18.9, 1^, 11, etc.
Iusticiaries, which are filled and puffed up with presumptuous conceits of
their own righteousness, and feel no need of the Romans 3.22.
righteousness of God, which is by faith in Jesus Christ.

Thirdly, as bread is the Hence so often in Scripture bread is put for all other
meats, etc. as Genesis 39.6. and 43 31, 37. and in many other places, see Eccles.
29.21.
chief and principal of all nourishments appointed for man, and so necessary,
as that without it, all other would be Genesis 27.17. 2 Samuel 6.19.
unfit, insufficient and uncomfortable: So the John 6.27, 28 29. Phil. 3.7, 8.
merit of Christ's Body, it is the John 6.27, 28 29. Phil. 3.7, 8.
chief and principal of all things which we ought to seek after in this
life, and so necessary for us, as that without it Mat. 16.26. Phil. 3.7, 8, 9.
Luke 2.25.29, etc.
all other things whatsoever, ^e unfit and insufficient, to yield us any true,
sound, so^e comfort or benefit, or to bring us unto c eternal life.

Fourthly, as bread is the most Mat. 6.11.
common and ord^^^^ o^ meats, enjoyed of poor, John 3.16. Acts 4.12.
as well as rich; of Luke 11.3. 2 Samuel 9 7.
daily and continual use with all, yet not wearying, not cloying any, but is
sauory and welcome still to every healthy palate, when other things though of
N^m. 11.6.
sweetest relish, please not long, but soon breed lothing: Even so the body
of Christ and merit thereof, is a common Mat. 11.28. John 3.14, 15, 16. and
7.37. James 2.5.
spiritual meat, to all sorts and conditions of men that believe, without
exception, to the poorest Dungeon-Captiue, as the mightiest Sceptred-Monarch on
the earth, and is Ephesians. 3.17.
daily and continually fed upon, by all that have faith, yet not wearying or
cloying any, but remaining always Io^n 6.34.
most sweet, pleasant, and delightsome to every faithful soul: yea, is ever
the more Mark 9.24. Luke 17.5. Cant. 2, 3, 4, 5.
eagerly hungered after, and desired; the more often and frequently it is tasted
and eaten.

Fifthly, as bread parted and broken among many persons, is a testimony of
Psalm. 41.9. 2 Samuel 9 7.
love and unity among them: So the Body of Christ, broken with most grievous
Esaias 53.3, 4, 5, 6, etc. 1. Cor. 11.24.
torments and sacrificed for many upon the Cross, is a most illustrious
testimony of Christ's John 3.16. and 15 13.
infinite love to us, and of the 1 Cor. 10.16, 17.
love, unity and concord wherewith our hearts and souls ought to be glued
one to another.

Lastly, as one Lease of bread, 1 Cor. 10.16.17. and 12.27.
is made of many grains of Corn: so of us (which are many) partaking of one
bread, is made one Body of Christ.


I. In what things consists the Analogy and likeness between the Wine and
Christ's Blood.


B. In these specialties. 1. As Wine quenches the Pro. 9.5. Dan. 1.5.
th^^st, quickens the o spirits, Zach. 10.7.
cheeres she heart, and beautifies the Psalm. 104.15.
face: so the Blood of Christ quenches our John 6.35.54 55. and 4.14. and 7.37.
Ephesians. 1.7.
thirst after righteousness and remission of sins, it Acts 2.46. and 16.34.
1 Pet. 1.8. Ephesians. 2.13, etc.
glads our fainting hearts, and reuiues our drooping spirits, with the joyous
assurance of our reconciliation with God, Heb. 10.12. and 13.12. Ephesians. 5.25,
26, 27.
beautifies and adornes our deformed souls, with the glorious robe of his own
innocence, and makes us gracious, lovely and infinitely amyable, without spot
or wrinckle or any such thing, in the sight of God his heavenly Father.

Secondly, as Wine Luke 10.34.
purges the body of corrupt and noisome humors, also warmes and makes it more
apt and active for any employment: So the Heb. 9.1^, 14.
Blood of Christ purges our souls from all our sins, and warmes, yea,
inflames us with the Reue^. 12.11. 1 John 1.7.
love of God, and zeal of his glory; and makes us more ready, active and
nimble to all Tit 2^.14. Heb. 9.14.
good works, and with David, to run the ways of Gods Commandments.

Thirdly, as Wine moderately drunk, Pro. 31.6, 7.
expels fear, makes bold, courageous and eloquent: So the Blood of Christ,
drunk by faith, expels the fear of Mat. 10.28. Act. 5.28, 29, etc.
Tyrants and bloody Persecutors, of Luke 1.74. Heb. 2.14.
Satan, Luke 2.29. Acts 21.13.
Death, Heb. 2.14, 15. Romans 8.1.15.
Hell and damnation, and makes us John 1.29.30.31, etc. Acts 2.22, 23, etc. and
3.13, 14, etc. and 4.8, 9. etc. to 14.
bold, eloquent and courageous, to confess his faith and name, even before
Kings, and in the midst of most exquisite torments.

Fourthly, 1 Cor. 12.12, 13 27. Romans 12, 4, 5.
as Wine is made of many several Grapes, pressed and compounded together: So the
faithful, which are many several distinct persons, are made one with Christ,
and one together among themselves.


I. Why would Christ have two signs used in this Sacrament? to wit, both Bread
and Wine, and not one of them alone?


B. To certify and assure us, Ioh. 6.35.54, 55 Acts 4.12. Heb. 7.25.
that he is the complete and perfect nourishment of our souls, and that
whatsoever is needful to salvation, is to be found in him; even as our perfect
bodily nourishment consists of meat and drink.


I. Are these signs, the Bread and the Wine to be given and received, each of
them apart by themselves, or both together, mixed one with another, or the Bread
dipped in the Wine?


B. They are distinctly and severally, and not otherwise to be administered.


I. Why?


B. Because Mat. 26.26, 27. Luke 22.17, 18.
Christ and his 1 Cor. 11.23, 24, 25, 26.
Apostles so administered them; because this does John 19.34.
more lively represent and shadow forth the cruel, violent, and bloody death
and passion of our Savior Jesus Christ, in which his blood was separated from
his body; which is a special end for which this Sacrament was ordained.


I. What difference is there between the Bread and Wine in this Sacrament, and
the Bread and Wine commonly used in our private houses?


B. In nature, substance or essence none at all, but only in use, office, end
and application; 1 Cor. 10.16. and 11.24, 25.
the one, serving for the refreshing, comfort and nourishment of our bodies;
the other (to wit, the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament) being consecrated and
set apart, to be sacred signs, pleadges and diseases of the Body and Blood of
Christ, and of the spiritual refection, comfort and nou^ishment of our souls
thereby, unto eternal life.

As Wax being sealed, differs from it self before sealing, and from other
Wax, etc. and as Gold or Silver coined, from that which is not stamped with
the Kings Image: So differs Bread and Wine in this Sacrament, from other Bread
and Wine not applied to this sacred use.


I. How are the Elements of Bread and Wine sanctified or consecrated to this
divine and holy use; namely, to be the Signs, Symboles, etc. of the Body and
Blood of Christ?


I. By rehearsing and declaring the Institution and Promise of Christ; Mat.
26.26.27, etc. 1 Cor. 10.16.11 23, etc. 1 Timothy 4 4, 5.
as also by the prayers, thanksgiving and whole action of the Minister and
Communicants, according to our Saviors Institution.


I. How long does the Bread and Wine continue to be the signs of the Body and
Blood of Christ?


B. Only during the time of the celebration and administration of this
Sacrament, and no longer, 1 Cor. 11.24, 25.26.
but as soon as that is finished, they become common Bread, and common Wine as
other ordinary Bread and Wine are, and as themselves were, before their
consecration.


I. Are the Body and Blood of Christ locally, substantially, corporally or
bodily present in the Sacrament?


B. No. His Body and Blood are truly and really present with the signs
thereof, 1 Cor. 11.24, 25
to wit, the Bread and the Wine by Sacramental Relation, as words spoken, and
the things signified by them, are present together: as also to the Receivers or
Communicants spiritually Ephesians. 3.17.
by faith, and so are eaten and drunken of every believer: but other presence,
eating or drinking then this, there is none to be held or believed.


I What reasons can you give against the bodily presence of Christ in the
Sacrament?


B. First, were he corporally and carnally present in the Sacrament, then his
Body must of necessity be in many several places at one and the same instant,
which is directly contrary to the nature of a true humane body, such as Christ
assumed, John 11.15.21
retained, and so shall do for ever; even a body in H^b. 2.14. and 4.15.
all things like unto ours; sin only excepted.

Secondly, this carnal presence of Christ, destroys the end for which this
Sacrament was ordained of him, 1 Cor. 11.24, 25, ^6. Luke 22.19.
which was to keep him, his death and passion in continual remembrance among
us, until his coming again. Now this is altogether vain and needless, if
he be here in body present with us; for helps of remembrance are not of
present, but things absent only.

Thirdly, John 6.63.
because our Savior Christ in plain terms, affirms his corporal presence
and fleshly eating of him, to be wholly unprofitable, and to avail us nothing
at all to salvation.

Fourthly, nothing is more certain then that the Body of Christ is in Heaven,
Ephesians. 1.20.
and there must be till the day of Judgment.

Fifthly, the faithful in the Sacraments of the Old Testament, did eat the
same spiritual meat, 1 Cor. 10.1, 2.3, 4.
and drink the same spiritual drink, that we do in the Sacrament of the
New: But they could not eat the body of Christ, nor drink his Blood,
otherwise then by faith, for they were not then in the world, ergo, etc.


I. You do not hold then, that by virtue of these words (For this is my Body,
etc.) pronounced by a Priest over the Bread and Wine, the substance of the
Bread is turned into the very Body of Christ, and the substance of Wine into
his very Blood, so as nothing remains of either but the bare forms, shows,
likenesses or apparances of them only?


B. By no means, but contrariwise, I condemn and reject it for a most gross
and palpable absurdity, contrary to Scripture, to reason, to the truth of
Christ's humane Body, to diverse Articles of our faith; to the nature, end, and
use of a Sacrament; to the judgment of our senses, of ancient Fathers, of
whole Churches and holy Martyrs, who have sealed the contrary by their dearest
blood; yea it is an invention so infinitely monstrous, as that the very Patrons
and defenders of it, are contrary one to another about it, sighting like the
Midianites each against his fellow, and can no better agree together, then the
false witnesses suborned against our Savior Christ.


I. What then will you make to be the meaning of those words, when he affirms
of the Bread that it is his Body, and of the Cup, that it is his Blood?


B. They are not to be understood, neither substantially, as if the Bread
should be the very Body, or the Wine the very Blood of Christ; neither may they
be understood consubstantially, as if the Body of Christ were included in the
Bread, and his Blood in the Wine; but they are figurative speeches, in which
the names of the things signified are attributed to the signs thereof: And the
meaning of them is in effect thus much, as if our Savior had said; Those
visible Elements of Bread and Wine, do signify and represent unto you, my
Body crucified, and my Blood shed, for remission of your sins; and are
pleadges, scales and assurances unto you, that as verily as you receive these
creatures of Bread and Wine, into your bodies, to their comfo^t and
nourishment: So you are as certainly made partakers of my very Body and Blood
spiritually by faith, to the eternal comfort and salvation of your souls.


I. How do you prove, that this exposition which you have given, is the true
and genuine meaning of these words?


B. Because the 1 Cor. 10.16. It is the usual Language of the Scripture
speaking of Sacraments, to call the sign by the name of the thing signified;
as Genesis 17.10, 11. Rom 4.11. Exodus 12 11.13.27. 1 Cor. 10.4. Tit. 3.5. 1 Cor.
11.25.
Scripture it self, and ancient Tertul. Lib. 4. cont. Marc. Aug. cont.
Adimant. Cap. 12. and Epist. 23.
Fathers so expound them. Secondly, this Exposition does well consent with the
Luke 22.19.
words of Institution, with the Concerning the truth of Christ his humane
nature, his Ascension, session at the right hand of God, etc.
Articles of our Faith, and the Which ever necessarily requires an outward
visible sign, and an inward invisible thing signified thereby; both which, by
this Exposition, are ratified and confirmed to the Eucharist.
nature of Sacraments.


I. What are the actions to be performed by the Minister in the administration
of this Sacrament?


I. Mat. 26.26, 27. Luke 22.17, 18.19, 20.
First, to take the Bread and Wine into his hands. Secondly, to bless and
consecrate them. Thirdly, to break the one, 1 Cor. 11.23, 2^ 25.
and power forth the other. Fourthly, to give them both into the hands of the
Communicants.


I. Is the action of breaking the Bread an indifferent rite, so as it may be
admitted or omitted, used or not used at the pleasure of the Minister?


B. No; but it is a necessary Ceremony not to be neglected or passed over.


I. Why?


B. Because Christ himself the author and ordayner of this Sacrament, Mat.
26.26. Mark 14.22.
whose example we must Mat. 11.28.29
follow, gave not the Bread whole, but first brake it, and then gave it to his
Disciples.

Secondly, Luke 22.19.
he expressly commands the breaking of it.

Thirdly, the 1 Cor. 10.16.
Apostles and Pastors of the Church, As by the writings of the Fathers, and
Ecclesiastical Histories does appear.
for many hundred years after them, did ever observe this Ceremony.

Fourthly, the whole service of celebrating the Lords Supper, has his
denomination from this action, Acts 2.42.46. and 20.7.
and is often in the Scripture called breaking of Bread, which certainly
should not have been, were it not a necessary rite that might not be omitted.

Fifthly, it is a lively and most effectual representation of the breaking of
the Body of Christ, 1 Cor. 11.24. Gal. 3.13. Heb. 9, 26, etc.
and of the bitter death and infinite torments he endured for our sins; on
which, the whole hope and comfort of our souls depends, and for memorial and
representation whereof, this Sacrament was ordained.


I. What are the actions to be performed by the Communicants or Receivers?


B. Mat. 26.26, 27. 1 Cor. 11.23, 24, 25.
First, to take the Bread and the Wine into their hands. Secondly, to eat the
one, and drink the other, to the nourishment of their bodies.


I. Is the Wine then to be administered to the People, and they to drink of the
same, as well as to receive and eat the Bread?


B. Yes doubtless; for Christ in the institution of this Sacrament, Mat. 26,
27. Luke 22.17.
delivered the Cup as well as the Bread, to all his Disciples, in that action,
holding the place, not of Pastors, but of the people: and commanded them all to
drink the same.

Secondly, the Apostle Paul, not by any private motion, 1 Cor. 11.28.
but guided by the Spirit of God, enioynes all Christians to communicate in
both kinds.

Thirdly, it is a part of Christ's Will and Testament, Luke 22.20. 1 Cor. 11.25.
ratified by his death and bloodshed, which by no means ought Gal. 3.15. Heb.
9.16, 17.
to be violated, that the people should partake of the Wine as well as of the
B^ead.

Fourthly, because else the people should have but an half and insufficient,
See John 6.54.55, 66.
not a full and perfect nourishment of their souls, by Jesus Christ, resembled
and sealed to them in this Sacrament; for our perfect and complete bodily
nourishment, consists not in meat only, but in meat and drink both together.

Fifthly, the 1 Cor. 10.21. and 11.26, 27.29. and 12, 13.
Primitive Church administered the Communion under both kinds to the people;
and it has been the constant custom of the Christian Churches so to do, for
the space of more then a thousand years together, after the times of the
Apostles.

Sixthly, 1 Cor. 10.4.
the Israelites drank of the Rock in the Wilderness, which in effect, was
the same Sacrament with ours.

Seventhly, the Blood of Christ and Merit thereof, appertains no less to the
people, Acts 2^.28. 1 Pet. 1.18.19. Mat. 20.26.
being believers, then to the Pastors and Ministers; and therefore the sign
and seal thereof, which is the Cup or Wine, may be no more denied unto the one
then to the other.


I What is it to eat the Flesh or Body of Christ, and to drink his Blood?


B. Not to receive and feed upon his Body and Blood John 6.62, 93.
carnally, with the mouth of the body, but spiritually with the mouth of the
soul, which is, aliuely faith; that is to say, to John 6.35.47.50, 51, etc.
believe, and be persuaded, that the Body of Christ was crucified, and his
Blood shed, for a full remission of all our sins; and not only so, but
(after Ephesians. 5.32.
an incomprehensible manner) to be 1 Cor. 10.16, 17.
united unto Christ, as the members of the body unto the head, and so to be
made partakers of his Ioh. 6.55, 56.
righteousness, life, glory, and whatsoever his benefits, as truly and verily
as we are of the outward Elements of Bread and Wine.


I. Then no wicked impenitent, ungodly person, etc. unbeliever, hypocrite etc.
though they be present at this Sacrament, does eat the flesh, or drink the
Blood of Christ, does he?


B. No. It is not possible they should.


I. What receive they then in this Sacrament?


B. Only the outward Symboles or Elements, and nothing else; John 6.54, 55, 56.
they get the shell, but not the Kernel, they eat the Bread of the Lord, but
not that Bread which is the Lord.


I. What are the ends of the Lords Supper?


B. First, Luke 22.19, 20 1 Cor. 11.20.25. John 6.56.
to signify and assure our continuance, preservation and nourishment in the
covenant of grace, the family and Church of God, into which, by baptism we
had entrance and admission.

Secondly, 1 Cor. 10.16.
to seal and confirm more and more our communion with Christ, and all his
benefits.

Thirdly, 1 Cor. 10.17. and 12, 13.
to declare and admonish us of that near fellowship and communion, which is
between all faithful receivers of this Sacrament; who are all joint members
of the same body mystical in Christ, bone of each others bone, and flesh of
each others flesh.

Romans 4.11. 1 Cor. 10.16 and 11.24, 25, 26.
Fourthly, to strengthen and increase our faith and all other saving graces.

Luke 22.19.
Fifthly, to celebrate and preserve the memory of our Saviors death and passion,
and of the inestimable benefits we reap thereby, until his glorious
appearing to judge the world.


I. Whom are the Pastors or Ministers of the Church to admit to this Sacrament?


B. All and only such as have by Exodus 12.43, 44, etc.
Baptism been admitted into the Church, and continue the professed members
thereof, and are for years, 1 Cor. 11.24.29.
understanding and knowledge of the Principles of Christian Religion, and
particularly, of the Doctrine of the Sacraments, able to 1 Cor. 11.28
examine and prepare themselves for the worthy receiving of it; and withal,
do by their Christian and Mat. 7.6.
unblameable conversation, give probable testimonies, that they are endued with
a true saving faith in Jesus Christ, and unfeigned repentance for their sins.


I. Does it not therefore stand every Minister upon, to examine such as he
admits unto it?


B. Certainly it does; for it is his duty, to Ier. 15.19.
separate the precious from the vile, and to beware that he do not prostitute
the holy things of the Lord, to Mat. 7.6.
Dogs and Swine.

Secondly, it is his duty at all times to be careful of acquainting himself
with the state of his Flock; Pro. 27.23. Acts 20.28.
and therefore much more then, when he is to receive them to this holy Table.

Thirdly, 2 Chronicles. 35.6. and 30.17.
he is to help the people in their preparation, that they may be worthy
receivers.

Fourthly, whomsoever he admits unto it, being unworthy and unprepared, 1 Timothy
5.22.
he makes himself accessory to their sins, and culpable of profaning the
sacred pleadges of the Lords Body and Blood.


I. Then it is the peoples duty also to be willing and ready to submit
themselue, to their Ministers examination, is it not?


B. It is so, for every Christian is bound to be always ready to give an
answer to any man that shall ask him a reason of the hope that is in him: 1
Pet. 3.15.
much more therefore ought he to show this readiness to his lawful Pastor,
who, by God, is placed over him.

Secondly, God charge every man to be obedient to h^s Pastor, and with all
meekness and humbleness of mind, Deuteronomy. 17.11.12 1 These. 5.12. Heb. 13.17.
to submit themselves unto him, in all things which concern the worship of
God, and good of their own souls; of which nature this is one.

Thirdly, God requires of all such as are to be baptized, Mat. 3.6. Mark 1.5.
Acts 8.37. 1 Pet. 3.21.
being men of years, that first they give evidence of their knowledge, faith
and repentance, to the Minister that baptizes them: and therefore it is not to
be imagined that he requires any less of those that are to partake of the
Lords Supper.


I. Who may not be admitted to this Sacrament, but must be barred from it?


B. All Exodus 12.43, 44. 2 Cor. 6.14, 15, 16. Ephesians. 2.11, 12, etc.
Infidels, all persons Exodus 12.43, 4^ 48. Disciples, so Acts 20.7.
unbaptized, all These cannot eat, drink, remember Christ's death, etc. Mat.
26.26.
departed this life, all None of these are able to examine themselves, discern
the Lo^ds Body, commemorate his death, etc. 1 Cor. 11.24.25.26.27.28.29.
Infants, all Ignorants that know not the fundamental points of Religion; all
Idiots, Fools, furious, frantic and mad men; all P^al. 50.16, 17. Esaias 1.11.
and 66.3. 1 Cor. 10.21.22.
scandalous wicked impenitent livers, and whosoever are by the Governors of
the Church worthily Mat. 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.5. 1 Timothy 1.20.
excommunicated.


I. What are we to do that we may be worthy receivers of this Sacrament?


B. That we may worthily partake of it, to our comfort and edification, there
be some duties to be practiced of us, before we resort to it; some in the time
of our receiving, some after we have received.


I. What are the duties to be practiced before our resorting to it? 1 Cor.
11.28.



B. We must diligently prepare and examine our selves.


I. Why are we so to do?


B. First, because in the Old Testament, all were to prepare and sanctify
themselves, before they might either offer 1 Samuel 16.5.
sacrifice, or celebrate the 2 Chronicles. 35.6.
Passover.

Secondly, because we are bound to prepare our selves before other the services
of God, as Eccles. 5.2.
Prayer, Eccles. 5.1. Luke 8.18.
hearing his Word.

Thirdly, because whosoever receives unworthily, 1 Cor. 11.27.39.
is guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ, and eats and drinks his own
damnation.


I. What things must we examine our selves of?


I. 1 Cor. 10.15, 16.
First, whether (at the least in some competent measure) we know the grounds of
Religion, and in particular, the Doctrine of the Sacraments.

2 Cor 13.5. Heb. 11.6.28.
Secondly, whether we be endued with a true justifying, saving faith in Jesus
Christ, applying all his merits to our own souls, and resting upon them, as
appertayning to our selves in particular, as well as to any other.

Thirdly, whether we do 1 Kings. 8.48.
seriously and unfeignedly, 1 Cor. 5.8. and 1^.28, 29.31.
repent us of our sins, heartily 2 Cor. 7, 8, 9, 10.11.
sorrowing and grieuing for them, and that especially in this respect, because
thereby we have offended so loving and gracious a Psalm 51.4.
father; t^uly Psalm. 119.104 128.
hating and detesting them, and fully Psalm. 119 57.106.
resolving to Psalm. 34.14. Esaias 1.^6.
abandon them Ezekiel. 18.21.
all, for 2 Pet. 2.21.22
ever; and to lead a new Mat. 3.8.
life, in an Ier. 11.4.
universal and Psalm. 119.33.44.112.
constant obedience to all Exodus 19.8.
Gods Commandments.

Fourthly, whether we be in Mark 11.25
love and charity with all men, even our Mat. 5.44, 45.
Enemies; freely and heartily Mat. 6.12.14, 15.
forgiving such as have wronged or injured us, in word or deed; even as we
desire that God, for Christ's sake, should forgive us.

Therefore the ancient Christians were wont by a mutual kiss, to testify
their unfeigned love each to other, before their receiving of the Lords Supper.


I. What if a man upon examination find these graces in him, but in a very
weak measure, and with great and manifold infirmities and imperfections, is he
therefore to abstain?


B. No, by no means, if so be he perceive them in himself, though in never
so 2 Chronicles. 30.17, 18, 19, 20.
weak a measure, so they be in truth and sincerity; and please not himself
in his wants, but be unfeignedly i grieved for them, Mark 9.24. i
strives against them, and earnestly Mat. 5, 6.
desires to grow in grace; he ought to come whosoever he be. Yea, the
imperfections and wants of our faith, repentance, and other saving graces,
should be so far from keeping us away, or discouraging us from it, as that
they ought rather to be sharp Romans 4.11.
spurs and motives, to provoke us to a more frequent and diligent use of the
same, that thereby we may get them strengthened, confirmed and increased; this
Sacrament being the means appointed of God, for that very end and purpose.


I. What other duties are there to be performed of us, before our coming to
this Sacrament?


B. Mat. 5.6.
We are to provoke our selves to an ardent and longing desire after it.

Secondly, we must earnestly pray unto God, Acts 2.42.
that he will be pleased of his gracious goodness, to vouchsafe his blessing
upon our partaking of the same.


I. Is it necessary to our preparation that we come fasting to it?


B. Noe certainly; fittest it is for such as are able without prejudice of
their health to forbear meat so long, to receive it fasting, that in honor
of so great a Sacrament the Lords body may first enter into their mouths,
before any other earthly meats: but for such as are not, they may without
scruple of conscience, or offense to God, take some small refreshing before
they come; for God no where Esaias. 8.^0.
commands the contrary, neither does his Romans 14.17.
Kingdom stand in meat and drink. Also our Savior Christ administered it to
his Apostles after Supper Luke 22.20.
, and moreover (to make it without controversy) the Scripture expressly 1
Cor. 11.34
warrants and approoues of eating, in case one be hungry, before he communicate.


I. What duties are we to perform during the time while the Sacrament is
administering?


B. We must be careful to behave our selves with all seemly religious Leuit.
19.30. Psalm. 2.11.
reverence, duly considering that the Lord in a most special manner is here
present Matthew. 18.20. Psalm. 26.8.
among us.

Secondly, we must in our souls let the incense of our unfeigned and heartiest
Mat. 26.26.30 and 103.1.2. etc.
thanksgiving ascend up unto the Throne of God, for his unspeakable John 3.16.
1 Ioh. 4.9.10.11
love toward us, in giving his only begotten Son to such a cursed death, and
infinite torments for us; which in this Sacrament as it were in a Table, most
Gal. 3.1.
lively and graphically are purtraied forth unto us.

Thirdly we must with all heedfull regard observe the signs of bread and
wine, with all the Sacramental rites, ceremonies, and actions, both on the
Ministers and Receivers part performed about them; seriously weighing, 1 Cor.
11.24.25 Exo. 12.26. and 24.8.
and pondering in our minds, the several things signified, sealed, and
represented unto us thereby.


I. When we set two signs upon the Table, both Bread and Wine, what are we
then to think upon?


B. That Jesus Christ is both Bread and Water of life unto us, that is to say,
our perfect and all-sufficient Redeemer, Heb. 7.25. Ioh. ^.35.54.55 Heb. 10.14.
in whom, and in whom alone is abundantly to be found whatsoever is requisite
to our everlasting salvation.


I. When we behold the Minister by rehearsal of the institution, prayers, etc.
to consecrate and set apart the Bread and Wine to this sacred use, what
meditation are we then to have?


B. This; John 6.27. and 10.36.
that Christ Jesus was ordained, set apart, and consecrated by God his Father
to be our Savior and Mediator.


I. When we see the Bread broken, and Wine powered forth, what are we then to
call to mind?


B. That our blessed Savior Jesus Christ was as it were 1 Cor. 11.24. Esa.
53.3.5. etc.
broken with inexpresseable tortures, and his blood Ioh. 19.34. Luke 22.20. 1
John 1.7.
most cruelly shed, to make satisfaction to the justice of God for our sins,
for which otherwise we should both in body and soul have for ever Deuteronomy 27.26.
Romans 2.9. and 6.23.
endured the unspeakable torments of Hellfire.


I. What must the Ministers giving the Bread thus broken, and the Wine so
powered forth, suggest unto us?


B. That the body of Christ was so broken, and his blood shed for us and our
salvation in particular Gal. 2.20.
as well as for any other: and that as the Minister does visibly and
corporally give these signs of Bread and Wine unto us, which nourish our
bodies: So verily does God now inuisibly, and in a spiritual manner, offer and
exhibit the very John 6.32.50 51, 52. etc. 1 Cor. 10.16, 17
flesh and blood of Christ unto our souls, to be the food and nourishment
thereof unto eternal life.


I. What are we to do when we take and receive the Bread and Wine into our
hands from the Minister?


B. Then we must as it were awaken, and rouse up our souls to reach forth the
hand of faith, and thereby to take and apply unto our selves Jesus Christ, John
1.12. and 6.35 40.47.48. etc.
with all his saving merits.


I. What is our eating of the Bread and drinking of the Wine, to cause us to
meditate on?


B. Even upon that most near and straight union thereby signified, that is
between Christ Jesus, our selves, and every true believer; that he is no
less nearly and straightly joined to us, and we to him, as also to one
another, then the Bread and Wine which we receive, 1 Cor. 10.16.17 and 12.12,
13.
eat and drink, are to our bodies.


I. What duties are we to perform after we have received this Sacrament?


B. We ought every one, according to our ability, cheerfully and willingly to
consecrate some portion of that which God has blessed us with, 1 Cor. 16.2.
Nehem. 8.10. Heb 13.16.
toward the relief of our poor and niedy Brethren among us.


I. Is the receiving of this Sacrament, a thing arbitrary or indifferent, so as
we may communicate or not, at our own pleasures?


B. No; but all such as are baptized, being of years and fitness to examine
and prepare themselves, Mar. 26.26.27. 1 Cor. 11.24.25
and not having any just impediment, are bound to partake of it.


I. How may that appear?


B. First, because God has expressly enjoined and commanded it. Luke
22.19.20. 2. Chron. 30.8. confer with the verses preced.


Secondly, it is a part of his public divine worship.

Thirdly, the neglect of it, is a very heinous and grievous sin, Numb. 9.13.
Genesis 17.19. Ex. 4.24.25.26.
greatly provoking the wrath of God against such as are guilty of it.

Fourthly, it is one of the means appointed of God, to preserve, cherish and
increase in us our faith, and other spiritual graces. Romans 4.11. 1 Cor. 10.16.
and 11.24.25.26.


Fifthly, this Sacrament is one of the badges and cognisances, and as it were,
the arms of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ; by receiving whereof, his
pleasure is, that we should make public profession of being his Disciples and
Servants, Exo. 12.43, 44. Genesis 17.11, etc. Acts 2.41.42. Acts 20.7.
and be known and distinguished from all other Sects and professions in the
world.


I. How often are we to celebrate and partake of the Lords Supper?


B. We may not content our selves to come to it at Easter, or once, or twice in
the year, as if that were sufficient; but we must receive it as often as fit
opportunity is offered, and as with conueniencie we may.


I. Why are we to receive it often?


B. First, because our Savior Christ commands the frequent use of it. 1 Cor.
11.25.


Acts 2.41.42. and 20.7. 1 Cor. 11.26.
Secondly, the Apostles did often administer it.

Thirdly, it was the constant practice of the Christian Churches long after the
Apostles time, to communicate often; of some, as often as they met together, to
hear the Word of God; of some, every Lords day; of some every day in the
week; of all, many times in the year.

Fourthly, because our Savior Christ departing this world, enjoined us to
celebrate this Sacrament, Luke 22.19. 1 Cor. 11.24.29
in remembrance, and in testimony of our unfeigned thankfulness for his bitter
death and passion, which he endured for our sins. It must needs be
therefore horrible ingratitude not to do it often.

Fifthly, because it is a means ordained of God for the preserving, Romans 4.11.
1 Cor. 10.16.
nourishing and increasing of the spiritual life of our souls, and the
sanctifying graces of the holy Ghost, even as he has ordained his creatures
for preservation and nourishment of our corporal life: As therefore we do
often feed upon these, so ought we in like manner often to rec^iue the other.

Sixthly, to neglect receiving of it, when it is administered in that
congregation, whereof we are members, unless by sickness or some other
necessary impediment we be hindered, is a fearful contempt of Gods sacred
ordinances and seals of grace, as also of those inualuable benefits which in
the same are proffered and confirmed unto us; Genesis 17.14. Number. 9.13. 1 Cor. 10
16. and 11.24.25.
which cannot be but a most heinous sin, and greatly incense the wrath of God
against us.


I. I will propound but one question more unto you concerning this Sacrament,
and so pass from it. What think you, may we with comfort of conscience and
benefit to our souls, receive this Sacrament with those congregations wherein
notorious sinners, and scandalous impenitent livers are permitted to
communicate, and so as not to be partakers of their sins.


B. Doubtless we may, in as much as every one is enjoined to examine himself, 1
Cor. 11.28.
and not others, when he comes to this blessed banquet.

Secondly, because the sin and penalty of unworthy receiving, is limited and
appropriated by God, 1 Cor. 11.29.
only to the persons self unworthily communicating.

Thirdly, because the Esa. 1, 2, 3, etc. Iere. 6.13. etc. and 8.10. etc. and
5.1. Hos. 4.1, 2. read and observe the other Prophets also.
Prophets, the Luke 24.53. Act. 2.46. and 3.1
Apostles, yea, our most innocent and holy Luke 4.16. and 19.47. and 22.53.
John 18.20.
Savior himself, for whom it was impossible to err or sin living in most
profane, godless and irreligious times, when all wickedness and impiety
reigned and abounded among all sorts of men: yet none of them did separate
from, or forsake the assemblies of the people, but joined even with the ungodly
themselves in the public exercises of Religion, and the commanded duties of
Gods worship.


Of the state of Man after this life.
I. When men have lived a while here upon earth, Job 4.19.20.2^ and 14.10.
Genesis 35.18. Job 27.8. Eccle. 12.7.
what befalles them then?


B. They die.


I. What is death?


B. It is the separation of the soul from the body.


I. Shall all men taste of death?


B. Yes surely, every Josh. 23.14. Heb. 9.27.
man and woman, of what rank or condition soever, whether Ps. 82.7. and
146.3.4.
noble or Luke 16.2^.
base, ^ob 3. ^9, ^0 ^^^. ^9. ^, 7, 8, and^
rich or Luke 16.22.
poor etc. Romans 8.10, 11 Reu. 14.13.
elect or Job. 21.32. and 27.8.
reprobate, believer or unbeliever, must die; those only excepted, whom Christ
at his second coming, shall find alive upon the earth; 1. Cor. 15.51.52. 1 Thessalonians. 4.15.
who in a moment and twinkling of an eye, at the last Trumpe shall be changed,
of mortal being made immortal; which change to them shall be in stead of
death.


I. What becomes of men when they die?


B. The souls of the Eccle. 12.7. Luke 16.22. and 23.43.
faithful and godly, are by the elect Luke 16.22.
Angels Luke 23.43. Reu. 14.13.
immediately carried up into Heaven, there, forthwith to be made partakers of a
most unspeakable, glorious and blessed condition with Jesus Christ.


I. What becomes of the souls of the wicked and unbelievers?


B. So soon as they are severed from their bodies, they are instantly conveyed
by the damned infernal spirits into Hell, Luke 12.20. and 16.22, 23.
there to abide in most insupportable and inconceiuable torments.


I. You have told me what becomes of the souls of men, tell me likewise, how
it fares with their bodies after death?


B. The bodies of all sorts of men both godly and wicked, return to the dust
out of which they were made. Eccle. 12.9. Genesis 3.19.



Of the Resurrection.
I. But shall they for ever abide in this estate?


B. No; but they shall all of them be raised a^aine out of their graves, Dan.
12 2. John 5.28.29. 1 Cor. 15.
to life, and be reunited to their souls, never to be severed more.


I. How shall they be raised?


B. They shall all, both Elect and Reprobate, be raised by the John 5.25.28.29.
Math. 22.29. 1 Thessalonians. 4.16.
omnipotent voice and power of Christ, but the Elect, by virtue of his 1 Cor.
15.12.20.22 45. 1 Thessalonians. 4.14.
resurrection, he being their head, they his members; the Reprobate by his
Ioh. 5.25. etc.
judiciary power, and the Genesis 2.17. Dan. 12.2.
curse and execration of God: also the Elect to everlasting life, but the
Reprobate to ignominy, shame and everlasting contempt.


I. Shall the very same individual bodies, in which we live here in this
world, be quickened and raised to life again?


B. Yes assuredly, the very self same bodies in number, Job 19.25, 26, 27. 1
Cor. 15.53, 54
and for substance, which every man had and carried about with him in this
life, and none other, shall again be reunited.


I. But shall our bodies arise again, with the same qualities too, which they
had in this world, as well as the same for substance?


B. No; but maruellously altered; for the bodies of all the faithful shall be
1 Cor. 15.53, 54, 55.
immortal, 1 Cor. 15.42.52, 53, 54.
incorruptible, 1 Cor. 15.44. Math. 22.30.
spiritual, most 1 Thessalonians. 4.7.
nimble, 1 Cor. 13.10. Genesis 2.25.
perfect, Math. 22 30. Reu. 21.4.
impassible, of admirable 1 Cor. 15.43. Math. 22.30.
power, Dan. 12.3. Math. 13.43.
majesty, brightness and glory, even like the 1 Cor. 15.47, 48, 49. Phil.
3.20, 21.
glorious Body of Christ.


I. With what qualities shall the bodies of the Reprobate and wicked be
raised?


B. Their bodies shall be 1 Cor. 15.52.
immortal, and incorruptible too, as well as the faithfuls; but wholly Dan.
12.2. Esaias 66.24. Reu. 22.15. Math. 13.41, 42. and 25.41.46.
destitute of all glory, power, and spiritual dignity: and most vile, abject,
contemptible and deformed, full of ignominy and most hateful uncomeliness,
even ugly and abominable to behold: they shall be also passible, that they may
for ever suffer the deserved punishment of their sins.


Of the last and final Judgment.
I. When shall this Resurrection you speak of be?


B. At the day of Judgment.


I. Shall there then be a day of Judgment?


B, Yea most certainly; for God has Act. 10.42. and 17.31.
decreed it, his Eccle. 12.14. Math. 12.36. Jude 14.15.
Word so testifies, his 1 The. 1.6. etc. Luke 16.25.
Justice and mercy requires it; and otherwise, the 1 Cor. 15.19: Psalm. 73.5.
etc. 14.
godly and such as have most care to glorify him, should of all men be most
miserable.


I. But why should men be again brought to Judgment, since they receive
their judgments at the time of their death?


B. Because that Judgment concerns only the Luke 12.20. and 16.22.23.
soul; this, 2 Cor. 5.10.
both soul and body. Secondly, that God may make it Romans 2.5. 1. Cor. 4.5.
apparent to the whole world, that the Judgment he passes upon every man is
most righteous, and according unto equity.


I, When shall this day be?


B. The precise day, week, month or year, neither Man, nor any of the Angels
can tell; yea, our Savior Christ himself (as man) was ignorant of it, Math
24.36, 37, etc. Acts 1.7. 1 Thessalonians. 5.1, 2.
in the days of his flesh.


I. Why would God have this day unknown unto us?


B. To bridle our Acts 1.7.
curiosity, to try and exercise our 1 Thessalonians. 5.8. confer with preced.
faith, 1 Thessalonians. 5.8.
hope and James 5.7.
patience; to fear us from Math. 24.42, 43, etc. Mat. 13.34. etc.
carnal security, to make us watch and prepare for his coming continually,
having our loins girt, our Lamps trimmed with the Oil of faith and good
works, not deferring and procrastinating our repentance.


I. But though God (for the reasons you have alleged) be pleased to conceal
the day of Judgment: yet he has in his Word, revealed some signs, to
forewarne and admonish us of the approaching of it, has he not?


B. You say true, he has indeed.


I. Which be these signs?


B. They are of two sorts, some whereof proceed and go before it; others
concur and are joined with it.


I. Which are the preceding or foregoing signs.


B. First, the Math. 24.14. Mark. 13.10.
preaching of the Gospel to all Nations of the world. Secondly, a 2 Thessalonians.
2.2, 3. 1 Timothy 4.1.
general Apostacy or defection of the greatest part of men from the Faith and
Religion of Christ. Thirdly, the 2 Thessalonians. 2.3, 4
revelation or discovery of Antichrist. Fourthly, a Luke 18.8. Math. 24.12.
marvelous decay of faith and love, with an universal corruption of men's
manners. Fifthly, a Mat. 24.38, 39
general security and minding only the things of this world, a wonderful
sencelesnesse and deadness of heart among all sorts of men that live upon the
earth. Sixthly, Math. 24.6, 7, 8, etc.
dreadful calamities and horrible persecutions of the Church and people of
God. Seventhly, Mat. 24.11.24
arising of false Christ's, and false Apostles. Eighthly, the Reu. 18.8. etc.
burning, Romans 11.25, 26, etc.
final subversion, utter ruin and desolation of Rome, the throne of
Antichrist, that man of sin, and son of perdition. Ninthly, the calling and
conversion of the Jews to the Christian faith.


I. Are not most of these signs already accomplished and fulfilled?


B. It is apparent that they are, even all of them, the final ruin of Rome,
and the Kingdom of Antichrist, and the conversion of the Jews excepted; both
which also are undoubtedly very near at hand, and to be every day exspected;
and therefore the day of Judgment cannot be far off, James 5.8, 9. 1 Pet. 4
7. Reu. 22.12.
but of necessity must come upon us very speedily. The Judge stands at the
door?


I. What are the signs concurring and joined with the day of Judgment?


B. The darkning of the Sun and Moon, the falling of the Stars from
Heaven, the shaking of the powers thereof, the lamentation of all the Nations
of the world, and the dreadful burning and dissolution of Heaven and Earth,
with all the works that are therein, by fire; which (as learned Divines are of
opinion) is called in Scripture, Mat. 24.29, 30 ^ Pet. 3.7.10.11
the sign of the son of Man.


I. In what place shall this Judgment be?


B. Partly on the earth, where the wicked shall stand and hear their doom;

I. In what manner shall Christ come to Judgment?


B. In a Acts 1.11. Math. 24.30.

his Resurrection, he shall on a Math. 24.27.37, 38. etc.

Thirdly, he shall separate the godly and Elect, from the wicked and Reprobate,

present to their memories all their actions, etc. good or evil, when, where,

everlasting punishment, and the Elect immediately possessed of eternal life.


I. Tell me more particularly and fully, what shall be the event and issue of
this Judgment, to the Elect and Reprobate?


B. The issue hereof to the Reprobate shall be most terrible and dreadful;
for immediately, after sentence once pronounced upon them by Christ they shall
be driven and banished from she most joyous and blissful Math. 25.41. and

imagined, so much as for a minute of time.


I. What shall the event or issue of it be to the Elect or godly?


B. Infinitely happy, for they shall Mat. 25.46.
incontinently, with exceeding and Reu. 19.6, 7. If there be such joy in Heaven
among the Angels at the conversion but of one of Gods elect, Luke 15.10. Oh how

ever and ever, without all possibility of being deprived of, or losing the
same in whole, or in part, or having them interrupted so much as for the least
moment or particle of time that can be conceived.


I. But shall all the faithful have equal measure of glory and happiness in
Heaven?


B. Noe, but according as they have received greater or lesser measure of gifts
and graces, Luke 19.15.16, 17, 18, 19. 1 Cor. 3.8. and 2 Cor. 9.6.
and more or less faithfully dispensed the same to the glory of God the giver,
and the benefit of his Church and children: So accordingly (not of Luke 17.10.
merit, but of Gods free Luke 12.32. Ephe. 2.8.
grace, favor and Titus 1.2. Gal. 3.15, 16, 17, 18.29.
promise) shall they be crowned with a 1 Cor. 15.41, 42. Phil. 4.17.
greater or lesser eminency of glory, and felicity; yet so as he that has
least shall have such a Psa. 16.11. and 17.15. and 36.8 hence called a full
reward 2 Ioh. 8.
fullness as he is any way capable of, so that he shall neither covet
increase, nor grieve because he has so little, nor 1 Cor. 13.4.

otherwise; but be fully satisfied, and abundantly contented, exceedingly Psa.

12.25, 26. Then our love to one another shall be perfect. 1 Cor. 13.10. ergo
etc.
glory (though surpassing his) then in his own.


I. Shall there be also an inequality or differing degrees of torments in Hell?


B. Assuredly there shall, according as men have been Luke 12.47, 48 Ierem.
32.19. Math. 16.27.
greater or lesser sinners, more or less dishonored God by their ungodly and
impious deeds: So proportionably shall their woe and misery be the Math.
10.15. and 11.22.24. and 23.14, 15.
more or less grievous, and intolerable, yet so as that he who has least,
shall have so much as he is Math. 24.51. Luke 13.28. Hence called destruction,
and perdition of the creature. 2. Th. 1.9. 2 Pet. 3.7.
comprehensiue of, or possibly able to endure.


I. What service shall the Saints in Heaven perform unto God for all his
infinite and unspeakable love and mercy, unto them in his Son Jesus Christ?


B. They shall continually, with the blessed Quire of all his holy Angels, be
praising, Reu. 4.10, 11. and 5.12, 13.
lauding and magnifying his great and glorious Name for the same, world without
end.
