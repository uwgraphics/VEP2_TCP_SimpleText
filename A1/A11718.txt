CVM PRIVILEGIO. Anno 1638.

HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms
Charles R.

CHARLES by the grace of God, king of Scotland, England, France, and Ireland,
defender of the faith.
To our Lovits Maissars, Her aulds, Pursevants, our Sheriffs, in that part
conjunctly and severally specially constitute, greeting.
Whereas for the removing of the disorders which had happened of late within
this our kingdom, and for settling of a perfect peace in the church and
commonwealth thereof, we were pleased to cause indict a free general assembly
to be holden at Glasgow the xxi. of November last: And for our subjects their
better content and assurance that they should be freed of all such things as by
their petitions and supplications given in to the Lords of our privy Council,
they seemed to be grieved at, We in some sort preveened the assembly, by
discharging by our proclamation the service book, book of canons, and high
commission, freed and liberate our subjects from the practicing of the five
articles, eximed all ministers at their entry from giving any other oath then
that which is contained in the act of parliament, made all persons both
ecclesiastical and civil liable to the censure of Parliament, general
Assembly, or any other judicatorie competent, according to the nature of their
offense: had declared all bygone disorders absolutely forgotten and forgiven:
and last, for securing to all posterity the truth and liberty of religion, did
command the confession of faith, and band for maintenance thereof, and of
authority in defense of the same, subscribed by our dear Father, and his
household, in anno 1580. to be renewed and subscribed again by our subjects here:
And albeit that this our gracious and pious command, in stead of obedience and
submission, rancountred open and public opposition, and protestation against
the same: And that they continued their daily and hourly guarding and watching
our Castle of Edinburgh, suffering nothing to be imported therein, but at their
discretion, stopping and impeding any importation of ammunition, or other
necessaries whatsoever to any of our houses within this kingdom: Denying to us
their sovereign Lord that liberty and freedom, which the meanest of them
assume to themselves (an act without precedent or example in the christian
world) Like as they spared not boldly and openly to continue their conventions
and council tables of Nobility, Gentry, Ministers and Burgesses within the
city of Edinburgh, where not regarding the laws of the kingdom, without
warrant of authority, they conveened, assembled, and treated upon matters; as
well ecclesiastical as civil, sent their injunctions and directions
throughout the country to their subordinate tables, and other under ministers
appointed by them for that effect. And under color and pretext of religion,
exercing an unwarranted liberty, required obedience to their unlawful and
illegal directions, to the seen prejudice of authority, and lawful
monarchical government. And notwithstanding it was evidently manifest by the
illegal and unformall course taken in the election of the commissioners for
the assembly, whereof some of them were under the censure of this church, some
under the censure of the church of Ireland, some long since banished for open
and avowed teaching against monarchy, others of them suspended, and some
admitted to the ministry contrary to the form prescribed by the laws of this
kingdom, others of them rebels, and at the horn, some of them confined, and
all of them by oath and subscription bound to the overthrow of episcopal
government. And by this and other their underhand working, and private
informations and persuasions, have given just ground of suspicion of their
partiality, and so made themselves unfit judges of what concerns
episcopacie. And als albeit it was sufficiently cleared by the peremptory and
illegal procedures of the presbyteries, who at their own hand by order of law,
and without due form of process, thrust out moderators lawfully established,
and placed others, whom they found most inclinable to their turbulent humors,
associate to themselves for choosing of the commissioners to the assembly, a
laick elder out of each parish, who being in most places equal, if not more in
number then the ministry, made choice both of the ministers, who should be
commissioners from the presbyteries, as also of a laick elder, (which in time
will prove to be of a dangerous consequence, and import a heavy burden to the
liberty of church and church men) being more directed therein by the warrants
of the foresaid pretended tables, then by their own judgments, as appeared by
the several instructions sent from them (far contrary to the laws of this
country, and lowable custom of this church) some whereof were produced and
exhibit by our Commissioner, and publicly read: One whereof, direct to the
Noblemen and Barons of each presbytery, does among many other odd passages,
require diligence, lest (say they) by our own silinesse and treachery we lose
so fair an occasion of our liberty both christian and civil; a strange phrase
to proceed from dutiful or loyal hearted subjects. The other to the
moderators of the several presbyteries, under the title of PRIVATE
INSTRUCTIONS, AUGUST 27. first, contains that these private instructions
shall be discovered to none, but to brethren well affected to the cause:
secondly, order must be taken, that none be chosen ruling elders but
covenanters, and these well affected to the business: thirdly, that where the
minister is not well affected, the ruling elder be chosen by the commissioners
of the shire, and spoken to particularly for that effect: fourthly, that they
be careful that no chappelmen, chaptermen, or a minister justice of peace, be
chosen, although covenanters, except they have publicly renounced, or declared
the unlawfulness of their places: fifthly, that the ruling elders come from
every church, in equal number with the ministers; and if the minister oppose,
to put themselves in possession, notwithstanding of any opposition: sixthly,
that the commissioner of the shire cause conveen before him the ruling elder of
every kirk chosen before the day of the election, and enjoin them upon their
oath, that they give vote to none but to those who are named already at the
meeting at Edinburgh: seventhly, that where there is a nobleman in the bounds
of the presbytery, he be chosen, and where there is none, there be chosen a
barron, or one of the best quality, and he only a covenanter: eighthly, that
the ablest man in every presbytery be provided to dispute de potestate supremi
magistratus in Ecclesiasticis presertim in convocandis consiliis, etc. Whereby
it is most evident what prelimitations, indirect and partial courses, and
dangerous propositions have been used in the preparations and elections to this
pretended assembly. By which unlawful doings, although we had sufficient
reason to have discharged the meeting of the said assembly, yet we were pleased
patiently to attend the same, still hoping that when they were met together by
the presence of our Commissioner, and assistance of some well affected
subjects, who were to be there, and by their own seeing the real performance
of what was promised by our proclamation, they should have been induced to
return to the due obedience of subjects. But when we perceived that their
turbulent dispositions did increase, as was manifest by their repairing to the
said pretended assembly with great troops and bands of men, all boddin in fear
of war, with guns, and pistolets, contrary to the laws of this kingdom, and in
high contempt of our proclamation at Edinburgh the 16. day of November last:
And also by the peremptory refusing to the assessors, authorized by us
(although fewer in number then our dearest father was in use to have) the power
of voting in this assembly, as formerly they had done in all others, openly
averring that we, nor our Commissioner, had no further power there then the
meanest commissioner of their number: and by their partial and unjust
refusing, and not suffering to be read the reasons and arguments given in by
the bishops, and their adherents to our Commissioner, why they ought not to
proceed to the election of a moderator, neither yet to the trying and admitting
of the commissioners, before they were heard, though in our name they were
earnestly required thereto by our Commissioner: and notwithstanding that our
Commissioner by warrant from us, gave in under his hand a sufficient
declaration of all that was contained in our late proclamation, bearing
likewayes our pleasure of the registration of the same in the books of
assembly, for full assurance of the truth and purity of religion to all our good
subjects, as does clearly appear by the declaration it self; whereof the tenor
follows. The kings Majesty being informed that many of his good subjects have
apprehended that by the introducing of the service book, and book of canons,
the inbringing of superstition has been intended, has been graciously pleased
to discharge, like as by these he does discharge the service book, and book of
canons, and the practice of them, and either of them, and annulls and rescinds
all acts of council, proclamations, and other acts and deeds whatsoever, that
have been made or published for establishing them, or either of them, and
declares the same to be null, and to have no force nor effect in time coming.
The kings Majesty, as he conceived, for the ease and benefit of the subject,
established the high commision, that thereby justice might be administrate, and
the faults and errors of such persons as are made liable thereto, taken order
with, and punished with the more conveniencie, and less trouble to the people.
But finding his gracious intention therein to be mistaken, has been pleased to
discharge, like as by these he does discharge the same, and all acts and deeds
whatsoever made for establishing thereof. And the kings Majesty being
informed, that the urging of the five articles of Pearth assembly has bred
distraction in the church and estate, has been graciously pleased to take the
same into his royal consideration, and for the quiet and p^^^^ of this
country has not only dispensed with the practice of the said articles, but
also discharged all and whatsoever persons from urging the practice thereof,
upon either laick or ecclesiastical person whatsoever, and has freed all his
subjects from all censure and pains, whether ecclesiastical or secular, for
not urging, practicing, or obeying them, or any of them, notwithstanding of any
thing contained in the acts of parliament, or general assembly in the
contrary. And his Majesty is further contented, that the assembly take the
same so far to their consideration, as to represent it to the next parliament,
there to be ratified as the estates shall find fitting. And because it has
been pretended that oaths have been administrate different from that which is
set down in the acts of parliament, his Majesty is pleased to declare by me,
that no other oath shall be required of any minister at his entry, nor that
which is set down in the act of parliament. And that it may appear how careful
his Majesty is that no corruption nor innovation shall creep into this church,
neither yet any scandal, vice, or fault of any person whatsoever, censurable
or punishable by the assembly, go along unpunished, his Majesty is content to
declare by me, and assure all his good people, that general assemblies shall
be kept so often, and als often as the affairs of this church shall require. And
that none of his good subjects may have cause of grievances against the
proceedings of the prelates, his Majesty is content that all and every one of
the present bishops, and their successors, shall be answerable, and accordingly
from time to time censurable, according to their merits by the general
assembly. And to give all his Majesty's good people full assurance, that he
never intended to admit any alteration or change in the true religion professed
within this kingdom, and that they may be truly and fully satisfied of the
reality of his intentions and integrity of the same, his Majesty has been
pleased to require and command all his good subjects to subscribe the
confession of faith, and band for maintenance thereof, and of his Majesty's
person and authority, formerly signed by his dear father, in anno 1580. and now
also requires all these of this present assembly to subscribe the same. And it
is his Majesty's will, that this be insert and registrate in the books of
assembly, as a testimony to posterity, not only of the sincerity of his
intentions to the said true religion, but also of his resolutions to maintain
and defend the same, and his subjects in the profession thereof.

Which declaration was by our special command and direction given in, and
subscribed by our Commissioner, upon protestation made by him that his
assenting to the registration hereof, should be no approbation of the
lawfulness of this assembly; nor of any of the acts or deeds done, or to be
done therein. And finding them in like sort no ways to be satisfied therewith,
and that nothing else was able to give them contentment, except at their own
pleasure they were permitted to overthrow all episcopal government in the
church, and thereby to abrogate our public laws, standing in vigor by the
space of many years bygone, and to alter the fundamental government of this
kingdom, in taking away one of the three estates, contrary to express acts of
Parliament. And lest the continuance of their meetings might have produced
other the like dangerous acts so derogatorie to royal authority, we were
forced for preveening thereof, and for the reasons and causes abovementioned,
and diverse others importing true monarchical government, to dissolve and break
up the said pretended assembly, and to discharge them of all farther meeting,
treating, and concluding any thing therein: And yet in that calm and peaceable
way, as our Commissioner before his removing desired their pretended moderator
for that time to have said prayer, and so concluded that days session, that so
they might have had time to think upon the just reasons of his refusing to
assist, or be any longer present at the said pretended assembly, and of the
causes moving us to the dissolving thereof: and notwithstanding his earnest
urging the same, and being willing to return the next morning to hear their
answer; in place of all other satisfaction to his so reasonable and moderate
desires, it was refused and met with a protestation of an high and
extraordinary strain, thereby presuming to cite and call our Council in
question, for their dutiful assistance and obedience to us and our
Commissioner. And finding their disobedience thus to increase, we were
constrained to discharge them of new again the next day thereafter by public
proclamation, under the pain of treason. And albeit that their contumacie is
such as has not been heard of in former times, yet they shall never move us to
alter the least point or article of that we have already declared by
proclamation, or declaration under our Commissioners hand: All which was
publicly read, and by our Commissioner required to be insert and registrate in
the books of assembly, therein to remain as a testimony to posterity, not
only of the sincerity of our intentions to the true religion, but also of our
resolution to maintain and defend the same, and our subjects in the profession
thereof: And perceiving likewaies that in contempt of our proclamation at
Glasgow the 29. of November, they go still on to conveen, meet, and to make
illegal and unwarrantable acts, we have conceived it fitting to forewarn all
our good subjects of the danger that they may incur by being ensnared by
these their unlawful procedures. And to this purpose do not only liberate and
free them from all obedience to any of the pretended acts, made, or to be made
at the said pretended assembly, or comittees direct therefrom, but also do free
them from all pain and censure which the said pretended assembly shall inflict
upon them, or any of them. And therefore do discharge and prohibit all our
subjects, that they nor none of them acknowledge nor give obedience to any
pretended acts nor constitutions made or to be made at the said pretended
meetings, under all highest pains. And we command, charge, and inhibite all
presbyteries, sessions of kirks, ministers within this realm, that none of
them presume nor take upon hand privately nor publicly in their sessions and
meetings, nor in their conferences, sermons, nor no other manner of way, to
authorize, approve, justify, or allow the said unlawful meeting, or assembly
at Glasgow: neither yet to make any act thereupon, nor to do any other thing
private or public, which may seem to countenance the said unlawful assembly,
under the pain to be repute, holden and esteemed and pursued as guilty of their
unlawful meeting, and to be punished therefore with all rigor: And siclike we
command all and sundry Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Magistrates, and all other
our lieges who shall happen to be present and hear any ministers either in
public or private conferences and speeches, or in their sermons, to approve
and allow the said unlawful assembly, rail and utter any speeches against our
royal commandments or proceedings of us, or our Council, for punishing or
suppressing such enormities, that they make relation and report thereof to our
Council, and furnish probation, to the effect the same may be accordingly
punished, as they will answer to us thereupon: Certifying them who shall hear
and conceal the said speeches, that they shall be esteemed as allowers of the
same, and shall accordingly be taken order with, and punished therefore without
favor. And to this effect we likewaies straightly charge and command all Judges
whatsoever within this realm, Clerks and Writers, not to grant or pass any
bill, summons, or letters, orany other execution whatsoever, upon any act or
deed proceeding from the said pretended assembly, and all keepers of the signet
from signetting thereof, and that under all highest pains. And because we gave
order and warrant to our Commissioner to make open declaration, not only of our
sense, but even of the true meaning of the confession of faith, in anno 1580.
by which it may clearly appear, that as we never intended thereby to exclude
episcopacie, so by no right construction can it be other ways interpreted, as
is more nor evident by the reasons contained in the said declaration, and many
more, which for brevity (the thing in it self being so clear) are omitted.
Herefore we do not only prohibit and discharge all our subjects from
subscribing any band, or giving any writ, subscription, or oath to, or upon any
act, or deed that proceeds from the foresaid pretended assembly, but also do
require them not to subscribe, nor swear the said confession in no other sense
then that which is contained in the said declaration, and manifestly emitted by
our Commissioner, under all highest pains. And that none of our good subjects,
who in their duty and bound obedience to us, shall refuse to acknowledge the
said pretended assembly, or any of the pretended acts, constitutions, warrants,
or directions proceeding therefrom, may have just ground of fear of danger or
harm by doing thereof, we do by these promise, and upon the word of a King
oblige our selves by all the royal authority and power wherewith God has
endowed us, to protect and defend them, and every one of them in their persons,
fortunes, and goods, against all and whatsoever person or persons who shall dare
or presume to call in question, trouble, or any ways molest them, or any of
them therefore. And our will is, and we charge you straightly and command, that
incontinent these our letters seen, you pass, and make publication hereof by
open proclamation at the market cross of Edinburgh, and other places needful,
wherethrough none pretend ignorance of the same.

Given from our Court at Whitehall the eighth day of December, and of our
Reign the fourteenth year, 1638. Per Regem.
