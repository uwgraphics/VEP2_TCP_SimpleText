A preface of the Author to the reader
GRACE MERCY and peace from God the father and from our Lord Jesus Christ / be
unto al them that loves / favors / and promotethe the truth of Gods
word. Amen.

Many and diverse causes moved me to write this Commentary in English / O
gentyle reader for their sakes which do not understand Latin but only read
English / to help the rude and ignorance people to more knowledge of God and
of his holy word. Because I perceive few or none to go about to open by
commentaries or exposicions in English to the unlearned to declare the holy
Scriptures now suffered to all people of this realm to read and to study at
their pleasure to their edifyenge and comfort in god by the kings gracyous
license / for the which thing bye thanks is to be given to God and laud and
praise to ye kings highness yt so te^dereth the health and salvation of hes
subjects that wylleth they shall lack nothing that may be to their comfort
and souls health and specially that they shall not lack the word of God /
which is the food of the soul. Math. 4. that saves the soul. Iacobi. 1.
the armor only whereby the devil and all his temtacyons is withstand /
resysted and ouercommen. Ephesyans.6. the mean whereby God does save them that
believe. 1. Corin. 1. ye the spyryte and the life.1. that brings the spyryte
of God and life everlasting. Because I could percayue few or none to go
about to open and declare this word of life to the English people unlearned
in tongues that it might be life in deed / which now vndeclared to them but
only had in the bare Lettre do appear to many rather death then life /
rather to bring men in to errors and heresies / then into the truethe and
veryte of Gods word / which now vndeclared brings not so much the
simple / rude / and ignoraunte people from their ignoraunte / blyndnes /
corrupt and backewarde judgments / false trustes / evil beleues / vain
superstycyousnes and feigned holiness / in the which the people have been in
blyndnes long time for lack of knowledge of holy Scripture. which the man of
Rome kept under the hatche and would not suffer to com to light to deliver the
servants of God from ignorance and blyndnes / but would have kept them
always in darkness / that his usurped power should not have been espied / his
worldely glory menysshed and his profit decayed Because I did se none go
about to deliver the rude people from their blyndnes ignorance or errors by
any exposicion in English upon the Scriptures but many to study rather to
continewe them still in errors and in blind ignorance therefore I as one of
the least learned of al has set forth and expocision to this Epystel of Saint
Paul to the Ephesyans as before this in the Epystel of Jude the Apostle of
Chrest yt the people yt can but only read English may ye better know part of
the wholesome doctrine of saint Paul may be delivered from their ignorance and
blindenes / corrupt and backewarde judgments / evil oppynions / rooted in
their hearts / false trustes and vain supersticyousnes / which the holy
Ghost here speaking in Saint Paul reproves and condemns / and teaches
nessysarye things for man's salvation as you may here se and read in this
exposicyon wherein I have as it has pleased God to give his grace opened the
holy scriptures showing the true use of them / and wherefore they serve. And in
this thing to be done I have used the help of tongues as of the Greek /
Hebrewe and the Latyne tongues / and the help of the old Catholyke Doctors
approved by the Church and also of the best authors that in these days now
do write / and of them al gathered out that after my judgment should declare
the Scripture best and most for the glory of God and / and for the edyfyenge
of the chrystians unlearned in tongues / as may be seen throughout all this
Exposycyon.

The second cause that moved me to this was to dyscharge my conscience
knowing the gifts of God given to be diverse / given to every man not to be
idle / but to exercise him self in his talentes given / to the glory of God
and to the profit of other. In this my talente given of God / al thought I
know it is the least of all it is my deutye not to be idle / but to exercise
my talente in all manner of ways to promote and set forth Gods word to
edify other / to do this thing I thought no way more to Gods glory and to
the edyfyenge of other / then to set fourth an exposycyon of some part of
holy Scripture to bring men unlearned to the love and desire of holy
Scripture which is the true word of the spyryte of God to the which thing
the unlearned shall be brought to when they shall se and clearly perceive so
much wholesome doctrine / so many godly virtues showed in one little Epistle of
Saint Paul / what godly lessons and Spyrytuall teachynges should they have in
the hole Bible. if it were in like manner declared unto them? sith there is so
much heavenly teachynges in one little Epistle of Saint Paul.

The third cause was to exhort other that be much better learned than I that
can do much better to set fourth some part of the holy Scripture in English
or in Latyne to show the goodness of God to us Englyshemen / to show that God
is the God of England as well as of France / Italye / Germanye / or other
countrees. And that he has showed his truethe as well in England as in these
countries. For God is not the acceptor of persons or of countres. In England
be men of no less wit / wisdom / learning / eloquence / then be in
France / Italye / Germanye / or other countres. ye I will not speak of more
wisdom and learning / least I should be counted percy all to my country. Ye
I doubt not but English men should give as great light to the word of God
as ever did these countres / if they would apply their study wits and
minds to write upon the holy Scripture and in writing declare it. Which
thing many learned men would do / if hye rulers whom God has set in
authoryte to be defenders and promoters of his word / would excyte and provoke
learned men there unto. And when a Commentary of the holy scripture were written
approved of learned men worthy pryntynge / it might be prynted and set fourth
with pryuylege. So God should be more gloryfyed / his word better known and
believed / great glory and commendation come to England / which should give
great light in the true understanding of the scriptures to all the world.

These and many other causes moved me to write this plain Exposycyon in this
Epistle of Sayncte Paul to the Ephesians. Wherefore gentle reader I pray the
accept in good worth this my rude dylygence and labors / which was to set
fourth openly before every man's eyes the mind of the Apostle Saint Paul in
this Epistle / to show what thing he would have us to know and to do / and
what thing not to do / and how he seeks always Gods glory and the
salvation of other to teach us to do such like. if this Epistle be declared
according to the mind of Sayncte Paul give all thanks and praise to God
only of whom it commethe / and none to the writer whose mind is to teach or
defend no error nor heresye / but to teach the truethe of Gods word
symply and plainly / more regarding the truethe / then the eloquence of
words / and by the truethe of the Gospel to profit every man if he can. If
this Exposycyon do agree with the holy Scryptures / as I trust it does /
take it / if it do not / refuse it / I would not have my wrytynges or sayenges
no farther to be taken then they do agree with the holy Scryptures of God and
by them may be prouyd / and by the holy Scriptures only to be judged. I am a
man and may err as well as other has done / but I will not be obstynat / if
I shall be gently admonyshed and instructed better by the holy Scriptures of
god to whom be all honor and glory / world without end. Amen.

Here ends the preface of the author.
THE ARGUMENT OF the Epistle of Sayncte PAVLE to the Ephesyans.
IN THIS EPYstel the Apostle Sayncte Paul shows the aboundaunt goodness of
God the Father to all men / how he has created and made all men and all
things necessary for them / chosen and elected them to etarnall life and
glory / and to be heirs of the celestyall kyngedome / only of his mere mercy
and grace / and not of the works merits or deservings of any man or of any
saint in Heaven / or in earth / but by Jesus Christ only by whom he has
restored man again to life / which by the sin of Adam lost the favor of
almightye God life and the celesteal kyngedome to the which he was created and
made / but by Christ was restored again to the favor of God / to life and
to heaven all men both Jews / and Gentyles their sins clearly forgyuen for
Christ's sake alone / and be made dear beloved and holy in the sight of the
father and right heirs of the Heavenly inheritance through faith in christ
Jesus which faith is received by the word of God preched unto them.

: Secondely the Apostle teaches what all men be of them sealues of their own
nature / myghtes and powers / surely nothing else but the children of the Ire /
wrath and indygnacyon of god / children of darkness / of sin / death and of
hell. And what they are made by Christ again / that is that they be made dear
beloved to god / children of love / of life / of justice and of eternal
salvation / and that only by the mercy and grace of god and not of the merytes
of man / but by the merytes of christ alone.

Thyrdly here is showed how both the Jews and the Gentyles be made at one
with God the father and among them selves by Christ that suffered death to
make them at one. Also what is there office now justified through grace by
faith in Christ Jesus / that is to forsake their old life / and to walk in a
new life not to be idle / but to do good / to do good works / not such as
man thinks godd / but such as god has appointed to be done in holy
scripture that men should walk in / and to go from one good work to another /
to fle al manner of vice and sin / if not for the love of God / yet for fear
of the plage of God.

Fourthly here is declared the offices and deuties of diverse states of me^ / as
of these that be married / of Children to their parents of servants to their
Masters / of every ones deutie to another in their states of leuynge / as you
may read in the v. and.vi. chapiters of this Epistle / where it is showed
plainly the office of the wife to the husband / and of the husband to the
wife / let the wife look on her deutye to her husband / learn yt / know and
do it. Also let the man look on his deuty and how he should order him self
toward his wife / and how he should intrate her that both of them knowing
their deuty according to Gods law / may more wyllyngely and gladly do that
thing that God requires of them / and they to please God better and live i^
more peace / unite / concord and / quietness.

Also the children may here learn their deutye / and wherefore that it
becomes them to be obedyent to their parents / because it is Gods
commandment and the will of God that Children should obey their parents. And
also what is the deutye of servants to their masters / and of masters to
their servants / every one look on his deutye / and do it gladly and
wyllyngely / for in so doing they do serve God.

Finally here is showed the armoure of christen men to fight against the devil
and his temtacyons / Last of all the Apostle desires these Ephesians to pray
for him / co^mendynge to them Tychicum by whom he sense this Epistle to these
Ephesyans

The first chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians.
PAVLE an Apostle of JESUS CHRIST by the will of God to the saints which are
at Ephesus / and to them that believe on Jesus Christ. Grace be with you and
peace from god our father and trom the lord Jesus Christ.

Saint Paul out of prison wrote this Epistle to these Ephesians / whom he
first saluteth with a christian salutacyon / and after the salutacyo^ he
shows the causes wherefore he wrote this Epistle Saint Paul in his Epystles
uses one christian salutacyon of the which we christians may learn how we
should one salute and great another / And what things we ought one to desire
and wyshe to another. In this salutacion is written the name of him that writes
the Epistle / and the name of them to whom it was wryte^. In the beginning
saint Paul sets his own name that they might know this Epistle to be
written of Paul / that this Epistle might be better loved and more esteemed
among the Ephesyans / when they should know the apostle Paul to have written
this Epistle to the^. Whom they knew surely would write no thing to them but
that should be both for their comfort and profit of their souls / and also
to the glory of god. What man was saint Paul before he was converted and
turned to the faith of Christ Jesus / it is written in the Acts of the
apostles.9. 22. and Philip. 3. Where it is evident that he was a persecuter of
Christ's church / but of a persecutour god made him to be a defe^der and a
sure pyller of Christ's gospel. Which thing god wrought not for the merytes of
Paul / but of his mere mercy and goodness / that we should despair of no man /
as long as he lives / but god may call him again to his grace and favor and
of an evil man may make him a good man / as he made Paul of a persecutour of
Christ's church a faithful preacher and a defender of the gospel of Christ
that we should gloryfy god. Which makes good men of the evil / and faithful
preachers of Christ's gospel of persecuters. Example in Paul. But if sinners
will be made good men of evil men they must follow Paul / they may not tarry
nor co^tynue in their noughty life / but leave it / be sorry for it / desire
mercy and pardon of god / follow god when he calls to amendment of life to
trust in the mercy of god / that god will be merciful to all penitent sinners
that will trust in his mercy that do believe faithfully that Christ came to
save sinners of the which I am one. And to be ready to do the will of god / what
his pleasure is / without al fear of loss of goods of the world / of honors
or dignities / or of this present life / after the example of Paul acts.9.
And so to walk al our life time to gods pleasure in our calling.2. An
apostle of Jesus Christ. Paul was an Apostle not of men: but of Christ Jesus
/ he was sent not to be a man pleaser but to please god / of whom he was sent
not to please me^ / but god / to preach the will and pleasure of god and not
of man / except the will of man be according to the will of god. And as he was
sent of god to preach his will and pleasure and not the pleasure of man / nor
to sing to men Placebo and co^mendacion so he did / he preached gods will
boldly without all fear with much hatred and envy of men of this world and
with much persecucyon and affliction / as it appears thoroughout the acts of
the apostles.3. in that Paul was an apostle. Apostolus is a Greek word and
betokenyth one that is sent forth of another to do a message. So Paul did not
send him self to preach the gospel of Christ / but he was sent of god and
appointed to that office by Ananias / as is written in the acts.9. so it be
co^myth other to be called of god and by man that shall be preachers. There
is.iiii. manners of apostles as saint Hierome shows Gala.1. First be they
which be send of god only / as the prophets were. Secondly be they which be
called of god and send also by man. As Paul / Titus / and Timotheus was.
Thirdly be they which be not called of god but send by man by favor / love /
money / service / flatery and such like. Fourthly be they which be another
called of god nor of man / but they thruste them selves in that common office
sekyng their own auantage / lucre / profit / glory / ease / rest / and such
like.

In this place saint Paul reproves all them that will take on hand this
common office as to be the minister of god / and to be his legate / which be
not called of god to that office which seek rather the glory of men and their
own lucre the^ the glory of god or the profit of their neighbor, what manner
of men they should be / and what qualites they should have that should be
bishops saint Paul declares. 1. Timo. 3. ad Titu^. 1. men well learned in
the scriptures of god / able for to teach wholesome doctrine / and by the same
to overcome all them that will speak against the truth. Titu^. 1. men that
be sober / sad / and descrete that seek only the glory of god / and the
salvation of other. Therefore it becomes every man to tarry his vocacion be he
never so well learned / least he for his hastynes run into dampnacyon /
taking upon him and vsurpyng a comen power before he be called to it by the
superior power to whom the vocacion as touching the outward vocacyon
belongs. And if it be so that the hye powers i^ this behalf be necligente to
seek for true ministers of gods word / and would not have faithful
preachers of the gospel / or care not for the^ or care n t whether the people
be fed with gods word or no. Which thing principally they should look for /
and provide that the people be fed with the word of life. That then he that is
called of god / being well learned in the holy scriptures / intendyng nothing
else but gods glory and the peoples salvation / may and ought to offer him
self to the hye powers and desire their authorite and license to preach the
gospel / as saint Paul says.1. Timo. 3. He that desires ye office of a
bishop he desires an honest labor. If the superior powers will not give him
license in whom they find no fault / then may he which is called of god /
walk in his calling / and do the office that he is called to of god / for a
man is more bound to obey god then man. Act. 4. wherefore I would no man of his
private authorite should take upon him this hye office of god / as to preach
his word openly before he be called of god and by man / or at the least of
god / and attempted by lawful means the vocacio^ of man / showing him self
always obediente to the laufull cyuill ordinances. 4. The Apostle of Jesus
Christ / Paul was the apostle not of man but of Jesus Christ to preach
Christ's will and pleasure / and not to please him self or to be a man pleaser
/ nor to preach men's fantasies and dreams / man's inuencion or man's
doctrines. And here in these words he reproves all pseudo apostles which
study more to please men then God / which preach not Gods word puerly and
sincerly / but myxyng it with man's fantasies and dreams seking lucre /
honor / and profit of men / all such S. Paul in these words reproves and
wylleth them only to be the messengers of Christ Jesus and to seek his will
and pleasure only. 5. By the will of god / here he shows how he was made the
apostle of Christ / not by his will nor yet by the will of men / or for favor
of any man / but by the will of god only. Of these words two things we may
learn. First that sinners do repent and leave their synful life / not of
them self by their free will / but by the grace and will of god / example here
in Paul / that sinners should give al laud and praise to God only / for the
retourninge from sin / to virtue / and nothing to them selves. The second
that we should know true and faithful preachers / as Paul was to come to us
only by the will of God / and not of man / or by the prouisyon of man /
although man's dilygence as much as may be in this behalf is to be required
/ which thing if some men would consider / and with them self deapely way
the matter / that true preachers come by the will of God / and not of man /
and when it pleases god / and not when man wylleth / they would not merueyle
why God sendes now in our time more trewer preachers of the gospel than in
our fathers time / to whom the truth was not so puerly and syncerly showed as
now to us in our days by the goodness of god of whom it comes and not of
our merytes or deservings / or at the will of man / to god we should give
thanks for his truth showed to us more plainly then it was to our fathers /
and to except it with all gladness / and to follow the true doctrine of Christ /
and express it in our living nothing meruaylynge that gods will showed.6.
To Saynctes at Ephesus that believe in Christ Jesus. These words shows to
whom this Epistle was written to the saynctes that were at Ephesus / and to
the faithful in Christ the words that follow expound them that go before /
that is to say / saints be the faithful in Christ that live at Ephesus / so
the scryptures oftymes expound them self / of this place we may learn that
saints in the scripture be not always taken for saints departid that be dead
/ for saint Paul wrote not this Epistle to dead men but to men that be living
who^e he calls saints / which were faithful men beleuyng in Christ Jesus /
to whom he dedicated this Epistle of the which we may learn saints in ye
scripture oftimes to be taken for the faithful living Christianes / as here in
this place. Also me think this place makes against them / yt would not have
the scripture to be given to ye lay people in their common tongue / for S. Paul
wrote this Epistle to the faithful christyans at Ephesus / as well to ye lay
people as to the priests and bishops / and would this Epistle to be red equally
to them all / that every one might have profit of it red / heard or showed / if
it should be red only in laten to them / what profit should the simple
ignorant people have had by it that does not understand laten / saint Paul
would it should be red and shewid to al in that langage / that every one might
know what he wrote to them / and have profit by his writing / and God the
more gloryfyed. 7. Grace be with you / and peace from god our father / and from
the lord Jesus Christ Now he shows what things he desires and wyssheth to
these Ephesyans / he desires and wyssheth them not honors / not hye dygnities
in this world / nor yet plesures / or wordly riches / no benefice / no
bysshopryke / no impyre / no kyngedome / no corruptible goods / as carnal men
does wysshe to their children and friends / but he wishes the grace of god and
peace of conscience with god / which peace only have they that be justified by
faith. To. v. And this grace / favor / and peace with god / it comes not
of our self / of our mightes powers / or of free will / but it is of god the
father and of our lord Jesus Christ. This place checketh all them that
desires evil to other / as the pestylence falling syckenesse / french pockes
/ palseye / phranseye / soden death / or any such like mysfortune it checketh
also all them that wyssheth to them selves / their children / or their friends
worldely things rather than heavenly things. Also he reproves them that
thinks the grace of god to come to them (ex merito congruo vel condigno) that
is to say of their just or deseruyd merytes / and not of god the father freely
by Christ Jesus.

Blessed be God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ which has blessed us
/ with all manner of spiritual blessyng in heavenly things by Christ according
as he had chosen us in him or ever the foundacyon of the world was laid /
that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. Now begins he
the narracion and shows the cause of this Epistle / and begins of thanks
and praise of god for his benefytes specially for his spyrytuall benefytes
given to us for Jesus Christ's sake. In this he teaches us in every beginning
to laud god / and give him thanks for his spirytuall benefytes / as for our
creacyon / and for the creacyon of all creatours in heaven and in earth
necessary or profitable for man. And also that we should give God thanks for
our redempcyon from syn / death / hell / and the devil / and delyuerance from
al thraldom of the deuyles power / which benefytes we have not of our
deseruinges / which deserved eternal dampnacyon / nor yet of the merytes of
angels / archangels / patryarkes / or prophets / or by ye merytes of any man
/ but only by the merytes of Christ and for Christ's sake. This place
commands us to keep always in memory ye benefytes of god / not to forget
them / to laud and thank god for them. This place checketh those that forget
god and his benefytes / or think they have of them self of their labors /
pains / merytes / these gooddes they have / or think they have some things
of God / and other part of saints / of all Images / and so deuyde gods
glory / part to God / and part to an Image of wode or of stone made by man's
hand / as some ignorant persons has done in times paste / thanked god for
their health and the blessed Lady of walsynggame / of Ippyswiche / saint
Edmonde of Bury / Etheldrede of Ely / the lady of Red bowne / the holy blood
of hayles / the holy Roode of Begles / of Chester / and so of other Images in
this Realm / to the which has been much pilgrimage / and much Idolatrye /
supposyng the dead Images could have healed them / or have done so^ethyng for
them to god / for the which the ignorant has crowched / kneled / kyssed /
bobbed / and lycked the Images / gyuynge them cotes of clothe of gold / silver
/ and of tysshu / velvet / damask / and saten / and suffered the lively membre
of Christ to be without a russet cote / or a sack cloth to keep him warm /
from the cold / lest for could he should perysshe / so we have clothed
stocks and stones / and suffered Christ to perysshe for cold and dye without
the house: and buyldeth goodly houses for an old Idolle / a stock or a stone
/ carved / and painted for lucre sake.2. we may learn that we have received
not one spirytuall blessing / but all spyrytuall blessings: as our creacion /
redemption: iustifycacion / forgyuenes of syn / life everlasting of no other
but of Christ Jesus / and by no other means but for Christ's sake through
faith / that we should give all praise and thank only to god / and offer up
our selves thankful sacryfyce / ready to obey gods will above all things /
ready to suffer with patience all iniuryes / wrongs and affliccyons for god and
his word.

And this is the true sacrifyce of christians daily and hourly to be offered
up to god for his benefytes of all christyanes. 3. As he has chosen us before
the foundation of the world was laid / so he has blessed us with all
spiritual blessings before the fou^dacyon of ye world laid. And as this
eleccyon of God was only of the mere grace / will / and pleasure of god / so
was all his blessings toward us intended of his only goodness / and not of
our merytes or deservings / what thing could we deserve before we were borne
that provoked God to love us / or was the cause why that god loved us:
nothing. 4. That we should be holy and without blame before him in love. Now
he shewith the cause why god elected us in him before the beginning of the
world / that we should be holy: and without fault or blame before him in love
We thinks the Apostle does speak these words to stop the ungodly mouths
of carnal men / which say if we be elected and chosen of god to immortal
glory / what makes maier what we do / do what we will we shall at the last
come to that glory / and bliss / if we be not chosen and predestinat to be
saved what skylleth of our works / they shall not profit us to obtain life
everlasting in joy / if we do all the commandments that god has commanded
to be done / at the end we shall be rejected and dampened if we be not
predestynate of god to be saved by Christ Jesus through faith / that no man
should speak so ungodly / or reason with himself on this manner / and condemn
Good works / despise to live holyly / care not how he live / whether he keep
gods commandments or no / saint Paul says that god has elected and
chosen us to be holy before him in love / that is to say who so ever will be
holy / and give themselves to serve god / to keep his commandments / to live
a life puer and clean from all vice and sin / to believe in god / to trust
Christ only to be his savior / redemer / iustifyer / delyuerer from sin /
death / hell / and eternal dampnacion / and give him self to love god above
al things in this world / preferryng gods glory above all earthely things
/ and to deserve good to every man / studyinge always to seek the glory of god
and the profit of other men / according to the will and pleasure of god for
whose sake only good works that God commands in scripture are to be done /
which works they do that be chosen and elected of god to eternal salvation /
who be elected of god to salvation / who be not / we can not tell by the
outward works that they do. Signs of gods predestinacyon is these. First
god of his goodness elected / electeth and choseth whom he will only of his mere
mercy and goodness without all the deservings of man / whom he has elected
he calls them for the most part by preaching of the gospel / and by the
hearing of the word of god to faith in Christ Jesus / and through faith he
iustifyeth them / forgyueth sins / and makes them obedyent to hear his
word with gladness / to do that thing that Gods word commands them to do
in their state and calling / wherefore to hear the word of God with gladness /
to believe it / to know that it is the mean by ye which god has ordained to
bring to salvation them that believes to order their lives according to the
commandment of the word of god to do all good works commanded in the
scryptures to the vttermoste of your pour these be the signs of Salvation /
of the contrary part who so ever be not glad to hear the word of God / but
despise it / condemn it / regard it no more than Esopes fabules: or think
the word of God to be folysshenes: a vain thing / of no profit ne pleasure /
a thing to be hated and set at naught / and so give no credence to it / care
not for it: care not to keep Gods commandments: al set to seek the
pleasures and the glory of this world: who so ever is so affected / it is a
token that they be not the children of salvation but of perdition and eternal
dampnacyon: of these works that follow we may have a conjecture who be
ordained of God to be saved and who to be damned.

And ordynated us before to receive us as children through Jesus Christ /
according to the pleasure of his will / unto the promise of the glory of his
grace / whereby he has made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have
redemcyon / through his blood / forgyuenes of sins according to the riches
of his grace / which he has showed upon us abondantly in all wisdom and
prudence / and has opened unto us the mystery of his will according to his
pleasure / which he had purposed in him self / that it should be preached /
when the time was full come / that all things should be gathered together by
Christ both the things which are in heaven / and also ye things that are upon
earth by him. Saint Paul repeteth here with many plain words the things he
had spoken before / that is to say that we were elected of god in him to be
saved before the beginning of the world / that we should be holy and without
blame before god by love / the same thing is repeted again in other words:
which thing the Apostle does because he would have this thing surely known
and roted in every man's heart and mind: of the which preachers may learn
to repete one sentence ones or twyse / which they would have known most
chefely and most suerly prynted in heart. 2. God has ordained us that we
should be his chyldrenne by adopcyon and that not of our deseruynge or merytes
but only by his mercy and grace / and by the merytes of Christ's passion /
that all the praise and thank should be given only to God for it / and
nothing to our self he has made us his chyldrenne by adopcyon / that we
should sue our father in all holiness of life / that we should follow his
fotesteppes in our life. 3. according to the pleasure of his will / these he
adds lest any should say that we be made ye children of God by adopcyon for
our merytes / or for the merits of our Lady / Peter / or Paul or of some
other man / and not only for the pleasure of god of whom we have al things
that be good / and his will only alone is the cause of them and no other cause
is to be asked why god has elected and chosen us to be his children by
adopcyon and heirs of ye kingdom of heaven but only his will / marcye / and
pleasure / that all praise and thank might alone be given to him and to none
other creature / work deed nor man. 4. Unto the praise of the glory of his
grace / here he declares for what end he has elected us to be his children
by adopcyon / that he might be praised / glorified of all men / which has
made us sinners his well-beloved children / and that by Jesus Christ alone /
which has pacifyed the ire of the father and reconcyled us to his favor to
whom we be made well-beloved through the death of Christ. 5. In whom we have
redempcyon thoroughe his blood: forgyuenes of sins. Two things is here
declared. One is that by Cyryste we are redeemed from the malediccyon of the
law: from syn: death hell / eternal dampnacyon: and from all captivity and
thraldom of the devil: and by Christ be restored to the lyberte of the
spirit of god. The other that we have forgyuenes of our sins only be
Christ's blood shed for us upon the Cross.

Mark the remissyon of sins is given to us by the blood of Christ: and not
by the popes pardons / masses and Scala celi: by pylgrymages to Paul / Peter:
Johan / or James / in the year of Iubilei: by the brothered or fraternity of
Chrystoffor of york / or of our Lady of Boston: nor yet by saint Fraunces
coule: Benedictes habyt: cope or cote: by monks boots: or by the caruing of
friar obseruates shoyes or knotted gyrdles: nor by Syon beads: by holy water:
ringynge of the great holy belle / or by any such like outward ceremony or
sacrifyce: who so by these things thinks to obtain forgyuenes of their
sins before god: they decieue them self: they blaspheme Christ: they be
iniuryous to his bloudeshed upon the Cross to take away our sins to obtain
pardon of God for our sins: and to wasshe us clear from syn: as saint Johan
says. Apocalyp. 1. The blood of Christ has washed us from our sins: and
Johan 1. Ioh. 1. The blood of Christ has pourged us from al iniquyte: if
forgyuenes of sin be by the blood of Christ: then it is not by the Popes
bulls / or pardons: masses: and Scala celi: and such like of man's
inuencyons and dreams invented by man: if by such works sins might have
been taken away then dyed Christ in vain. Gaia. 1 If sins might have been
pourged by such means or works of man: than was Christ a fool that suffered
so sharp a death to save us / and to take away our sins. I suppose Christ's
blessing to have been as good as the bishop of Romes blessing / or any
other bishops blessyng / but Christ taught us not to believe by such means
our sins to be purged / wherefore they be stark lies ye blaspheme to Christ
and his holy blod to believe our sins to be taken away by any other way or
mean then by Christ and his holy blood / wherefore they are from the true way
that think by their works / merits of saints or of men alive or departed /
by the virtue of the mass heard or said thynkyng the mass to be a sacrifyce
to god to take away the sin of the people / for there is none other
sacrifyce to take away sin but Christ which has satisfied for our sin:
and is a full satysfaccyon for the sins of the hole world. Iohannis. 2. and
by one oblacyon ones offered up for us upon the Cross he has made all them
perfyte that shall be sanctified for evermore. Hebre. 10.

4. According to the riches of his grace Redemption and remissyon of sin
has come unto us al by the rich grace of god and not by our merytes / deeds /
or works or for any saint sake living or departed but alone for Christ's sake
freely / without our merytes or any deservings of our part that all laud and
praise with thanks might only be given to God as the auctor of al goodness. 7.
which has shed upon us abundantly in all wisdom / also we have received of
gods goodness all spirytuall wisdom / as touching the knowledge of godly
things and all other knowledge necessary for the health of our foul. This
place somthynge reproves them that say there is many things necessary for
the salvation of man that be not written in holy scripture / nor yet can be
gathered out of the holy scripture. S. Paul. To. 1. says that the gospel is
the power of god that works all health to al them that believes. This place
shewith all learning knowledge and godly wisdom to come of god and not of our
study diligence and labor / although our study and labor is required as
lawful means necessary by the which god gives knowledge / learning / and
wisdom / to them that with a pure heart requires of him. This reproves all
them that thinks they get the learning they have by their own labor study
and pains / and think not that it comes of god / which gives these gifts
to them that seek and labor in faith desiring to have learning to glorifye
god to profit them and other according to their talentes.8. which has
opened unto us the mystery of his well according to his will and pleasure. The
time he shows when god gave to us this knowledge / and wisdom / by his grace
/ he did give it when it pleased him to show the misterye of his will hyd
long from the world / but at the last showed by his word declared plainly to
the world when he pleased / and not at the pleasure of man / of the which we
may learn that the word of god comes to us and is clerly showed at the will
of God / and not at the will of man / or at man's pleasure / although god use
man as an Instrumente to show his will for our health and profit. But
paraduenture some will ask / what was this mysterye that god had hyd so long
from the world in him self / and now had showed it when the fulness of time
was come. In the which he sends his son Jesus Christ to this world to be
incarnate / by whom he has restored all things in heaven and in earth / and
made them perfyte / to this saint Paul makes answer here saying this
mystery was the misterye of the Gospel preached now openly to the Gentiles:
as it was to the Jews / that ye Gentyles should be saved by Christ as the Jews
/ and that the life and the inherytaunce of Heaven parteyned / as well to the
Gentyles / as to the Jews / which mystery was hid from a great part of the
Gentyles to Christ's coming / to the preaching of the Apostles after
Christ's ascencion to heaven / of this we may learn that God does not give all
knowledge of his divine will at one time: or all together / but one thing
after an other after long contynuaunce of time / as here you may se that the
gospel was long hyd fro the gentyles by long time and many years / that we
should nothing marvel at gods will and pleasure / if god do show now in
our time his gospel more clearly and open it more plainly to us: than it was
in our fathers time and days of this we should not muse or maruayle / but
rather glorifye god that gives this knowledge thank him heartily for it
accept the gospel with gladness / give credence to it / leave our old blyndnes
/ superstityousnes: false trustes / backwarde Iugementes: and other like / by
the which we have been deceived for lack of true knowledge of the word of god
now showed / thanked be god But if any will be more curyouse than needs to
ask / why god has hyd this mystery of his will so long from the world and
now shows it in these last days? surely I have not to answer: but that it
is the will and pleasure of God so to do: which has always seen what thing
was most profitable for the Gentyles / or else that he has seen that the
gentyles before this time would not have believed the gospel preached: that
they should be less punysshed not knowing the gospel than if they should
have known it / and not followed it / or else that he knew they would have
persecuted the preachers of the Gospel: and so should have deserved more
greuouse punyshmente: or else that it was decreed of God that all things
should be showed of god by Christ and al things restored and made perfect by
Christ.

By whom also we are come to the inheritance / we that were thereto
predestynate before according to the purpose of him which works all things
after the council of his own will / that we might be to the praise of his
glory / even we yt there before believed on Christ on whom also ye believed /
after that ye heard the word of truth namely the gospel of your saluatyon /
wherein when ye believed / ye were sealed with the holy spirit of promise /
which is the earneste of our inherytaunce to our redemcyon / that we might be
his own to the praise of his glory. Saint Paul here repeteth these things
that he has showed before gathering a sum of them all: that is to say /
that we are appointed of God to eternal life: thoroughe Jesus Christ / and he
made the children of God by adopcyon: not by our strength or merytes: or by
the merytes of any man / but only by the grace of god and the merytes of
Christ. And that by the deliberate will of God / by whose might and power all
things are done / that be good / just / and laufull / for God wylleth none
iniquytie / or sin / but is holy and just in all his works / and he wylleth
all good things.2. That none should think our heavenly inheritance to come to
us by lote or by chance as God had not prepared yt for us before the beginning
of the world / he says this heavenly inherytaunce to have been ordained for
us by the forewyll of god always intended of the father toward us of his
goodness / by whose will and power all good things are done / whose will no man
can resyste or stope his works / that they be not done / as he has ordained
them to be done / whose will we can not attain unto / and what shall be the
effects of things till they be done.3. And although al things are done by
the power of god / yet god is not ye auctor of evil. Ia. 1. god wylleth no syn
but he is just in all his ways and holy in all his works / he will that all men
shall be saved / and to come to the knowledge of the truth therefore they that
peryshe and shall be dampened / by their own fault / they perysshe and be
dampened / and not by any fault in God / which wylleth every man to be saved /
and for that end be commands the Gospel to be preached unto al creatures /
that they should believe / and follow the Gospel in life and be saved / therefore
they that do not believe it: but contempne and despise it and think it a
folyshe and a vain thing they be the cause of their own death.4. that we
might be to the praise of his glory / we be predestynate of god made adn
created not for our self: but for the laud and praise of God / that we should
give all glory to god for all goodness and provoke all other to glorifye god and
worship him in spirit and truth as it is our office and duty to do.5. even we
that before believed after that we heard the word of truth the gospel of
health: as who should say / we yt believed in Christ before the word was
preached to the Gentyles our office is not only to glorify god in our selves /
but to bring all other to glorifye god with us as much as shall lie in our
power. This place reproves them that dyswadeth men from the word of god from
learning of it / from reading of it / from sermondes by the which means god
has ordained men to be brought to glorify god in spirit and in merit / as he
would be gloryfyed of all men: also he says we believed after that we heard
the word of truth. In these words he shows how faith comes / that is to
say by hearing of the word of truth according to saint Paul's saying. To.
10. Faith is of hearing / and hearing by the word of god also he shewith here
what is the word of truth: it is the gospel of health and so it is called:
because it brings everlasting health to all them that faithfully believes
showing their faith in good works.4. in whom when ye believed / ye were sealed
with the holy spirit of promise here is showed what fruit does come of hearing
of the word of truth that by it is gotten faith / without the which no man
can please God / and having it all things pleases God / and these that
believe receive the spirit of God / as an earnest to put them in suretye that
they shall receive and have all things that be promised them to have by gods
word / that is to say that they shall have life everlasting and the
inherytaunce of heaven / and for a suretye of that promise the beleuers receive
the holy ghost as an oblygacyon for the perfourmaunce of that promise: by the
which they be made as sure to have the promise of god as if they had received
it all ready. This place makes again them that say no man can know whether
he is in the favor of God or no / or whether they be worthy hatred or love of
god alledginge for them the saying of Ecclesyastes.9. to whom this answer I
make that men can not know of them self whether they be in the favor of god
or no / but that they may know by the holy spirit whom they have that
believe faithfully / if a man may know whether he has faith or no / he may
know whether he be in the favor of god or no? If he have true faith God
fauoryth him / if he lack faith god favors him not / so a man may know
by faith the spirit of god given to glorifye us of gods favor and love
toward us / and that god favors us as long as we shall have faith and the
spirit of god which faithful beleuers have and possess / so a man may know
whether he is now at this present time in the favor of god or no: hated or
beloved / but what he shall be to morrow / the next day or in time to come no man
can tell Therefore he that stands in ye favor of god by faith / by the holy
ghost / let him look that he fall not from god by unfaithfulness and incrudelite
and by unkindness / contempnyng of gods word / and disobedient to gods
co^mandementes / and so fall from the favor of god / lose faith and the holy
spirit of god / lose life eternal. As for the words of Ecclesiastes.9. where
it is written that no man can know whether he is worthy hatred or love / the
words are to be understand thus that of good or evil yt chance to men in this
world / no man can know whether he is worthy hatred or love / for goods and
euyls / prosperyte and aduersyte chance equal to good men and evil men and
oftymes it chances that evil men have more prosperity then good men / evil
have riches / wealth / and pleasure / good men have pouertye need / pain / and
punysshmente / wherefore of prosperytie or aduersytie in this world is no man
to be esteemed more or less in the favor of God / seeing these things chance
equally to the good and the evil / in this world / I would that every man
should not only think him self yt he is in the favor of god / but also know
it surely yt god favors him: except he think so how can he favor god for
love if he dout whether god love him or no / or in this thing be waueryng /
think some time god love him sometime he loves hi^ not. The spirit of god is
given us to put us in a suretye that God favors us / and if we lack this
spirit / we be not of Christ. To. 8. we have also received the spirit of
adopcyon: by whom we call father father / and this spirit shows to our
spirit that we are the chylde^ of god. To. 8 therefore I would that every man
should certainly think and persuade with him self that he is in the favor of
God / and that god will give him everlasting life joy and bliss in the
world to come / which they that believe now have by faith / and in the world
to come shall possess in deed / then I suppose they would contynewe in faith
and show their faith by all good works commanded in the Scripture. Some
also here will ask how shall we know whether we have faith and the spirit
of god or no / this thing may be known by the fruits / and by the words:
mocyons that they shall perceive in their hearts / if they perceive that they be
glad to hear gods word / to read it / study it / be glad it goth forward
for Gods glory only / do believe it to be true / and that God will perform
and bring to pass all things promised or thretened in his word / that he
will reward good men / and punysshe evil men in the world to come / if they
shall perceive a redynes a towardnes to be obedyente to do Gods commandment
/ ye to do it in deed for god only to the uttermost of their power / if these
things they perceive in them selves / they be sure signs that they be in the
favor of god / have faith and the spyrite of god / and shall have life
everlasting / of ye contrary part if you perceive in your self no desire /
lust / or will to hear the word of god / to read it / to study it / ye
think it is but folysshenes a vain thing / an unprofitable thing or that you
care nothing for it / or that you hate it and envy it and the professors of it
persecute them as auctors of deuyles doctrine / you feel your self nothing
ready to obey the commandments of god but ready to all pleasure of the
flesh and of the world / to do sin and noughtines these be sure tokens
that you be out of the favor of god / lack faith and the spirit of god / and
in the hie displeasure with god of these things and tokens showed / you shall
know whether you be in the favor of god / more sure than by the fight of the
holy blood of hayles / or by the going thoroughe saint wylfredes nedle / and
also if you be out of Gods favor / you lack faith and the spirit of god
that moves and stereth men always to all good works for god only / alone
regarding his will and pleasure. 7. That we might be his own to the praise of
his glory / for what end god has chosen us and made the word of god to be
preached to us / surely for this end / that we should have faith / receive ye
holy spirit / and be made sure of gods favor toward us and that he loves
us / and that we should glorify him again / by faith / by love to him and to
our neighbor to do the works of god commanded us to do in the holy scripture
in our vocacyon and calling and that only for god / and have no respect to
our self. Thus we may hear / know what fruit comes of the word of god
preached / yt is to say / through the holy spirit is given / certantye of
gods favor / knowledge of gods will / and of our office and duty both to
god and also to our neighbor and life everlasting.

Wherefore also in so much as I have heard of the faith which ye have in the
lord Jesus and of your love unto the saints / I cease not to give thanks for
you / and make mentyon of you in my prayers / yt ye god of our lord Jesus
Christ and the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom / and
open unto you yt knowledge of him self and lyghten the eyes of your
understanding that ye may know what is the hope of your calling and what the
riches of his glorious inheritance is upon ye saints. Saint Paul here shows
ye office of one christen man toward an other / that it is to give thanks to
god for faith / hope / charity / other gifts spirytuall given to other of god.
And in this he teaches christen men what they should do when they hear that
ye word of god is puerly and truly preached without all dregs of man's
inuentyon dreams / or phantasyes / and that other receive faith and exercise
the works of charity to the pore people / that they should give laud praise
and thanks to ye lord for it / to desire of god that they may continue in the
truth and go forward in it / and increase every day more and more in all godly
knowledge and spirytual wisdom that they may know what is the hope / that is
to say the thing that they hoped for / which is the heavenly inherytaunce
which they hope and look for, to ye which god has called them / these be the
duties of a christen man one to an other to wysshe and desire of god / and not
to be sorry that so much spirytuall knowledge of God be showed to the rude and
ignorant people as is now showed in our time.

And here Saint Paul reproves those that be sorry that there is so much
knowledge of gods word showed and opened to the simple people as is / it
checketh also all them that dysswadeth the lay people unlearned / from the
hearing of the word of god from the readyng of it / from the study of it. 22.
Virtue can not be bid where someuer it is but it will be known although they
would it should not be known that do virtuously to avoid praise of men / as
the faith and charity of these Ephesians came to Paul in prison / for the
which Saint Paul praised them / and virtue shall not lack his praise or
reward in this world / or at the less in the world to come. 23. Saint Paul
commends these Ephesians / not for their goodly temple / nor yet for their
noble worshyppinge of Diane / nor yet for their religyouse men called of diverse
sects / and of diverse habytes / for their goodly singing in the queare / or
their orgaynes and playeng in their churches / or for other goodly ceremonies /
nor for their tapers / torches / carved painted / or gylded Images / or for
their goodly great belles or multitude of masses or such like / but for their
faith in Jesus Christ / and their charity to the poor people that has need
of help and socour. And Paul commends them not because he would make them
proud / but because he would provoke them to go forward and continue in
faith and charity / and increase them every day more and more / and that they
should know good works not to lack his reward with god in the world to come.
4. In this prayer he teaches us what things we should desire of god in our
prayers / that it would please God to give us the spirit of spirytuall wisdom
and knowledge / that we might be lyghtened with all godly knowledge / that we
might know how rich is our hope in the thing we hope for / the heavenly
inherytaunce / unto the which Christ has bought us with his preciouse blood
shed for us / of this place we may learn that we can not know what is our
hope / glory / and inheritance which we look for after this present life /
except that God show it to us by his spirit of wisdom and knowledge / and
open our eyes that we may see and perceive it. And to obtain this spirit of
God / and that we may every day increase more and more in this divine
knowledge / saint Paul month us to pray to god which alone does give this
spirit. This place makes against them that would the ignorant simple people
should have no further knowledge of god then be contained in the pater noster /
and to be contented wtih that knowledge / and desire no further / but to leave to
hie dyuynes the further knowledge in the scriptures of god / but let such
blind gydes and ignorant teachers put away their blyndnes and ignorance / and
learn better knowledge of god / desire it in faith by prayer / by study / by
hearing and reading of holy scriptures / that they may increase in more
knowledge and teach other better to seek to more knowledge / that they may
come to the more knowledge of god / and of the celestyall kingdom / which
things they know better the more knowledge they have in the holy scryptures of
god. Also saint Paul shows here that faith / charity / knowledge of godly
wisdom may be increased in saints living here in his world / and therefore he
exorteth every man to increase their faith / their charity / their knowledge /
in the which he shows that there is no man so good but that he may be better
and increase in goodness / in the which he exorteth every one to increase / and
every day be better and better.

And what is the excedyng gretnes of his power toward us which believe
according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when
he raised him up from the dead and set him on his right hand in heavenly
things above al rule / power / and might and domynatio^ and above all that may
be named / not only in this world / but also in ye world to come And has
put all things under his fete / and has made him above al things / ye head
of the congregacyon which is his body and the fulness of him that fylleth all
in all. The Apostle goes forth with his prayer for these Ephesyans and
desires God that they might know by the spirit of wisdom and knowledge of
god that they might know the excellent power of god which god has declared
myghtely in the raisynge up his son Jesus Christ from death to life / and
made him to sit on his right hand above all heavenly powers In Christ was
showed the excellent power of god / above all things / which power god will
show to them that believes.

2. He shows here the glory of Christ to be above all the powers / domynyons
/ or potestates in heaven that we should put our trust in Christ / which will
exalte to that place where he is al them that believe in him and thinks to
come there where Christ is on the right hand of the father only by Christ /
and not by their own merytes or deseruinges and to put men in a suretye of
that thing Christ him self was exalted from death to life eternal.

3. The power and the glory of Christ is showed in that he sytteth on ye right
hand of the father in heaven above all powers rule / dominyon / potestates /
and virtues / and above all names that is in this world or in the world to
come / and all things are subjected to him and under his domynion and power /
and he is the head of the congregatyon which is his body. Christ is the head
/ in whom consists the perfeccyon of the hole body and he that makes in
the body all things parfyte.

4. This place reproves the Bishop of Rome and all his decrees that makes
him head of the Church of Christ / for the head of the church of Christ is
not the bishop of Rome / but Christ which makes all things vnparfyte
parfite / and princes and Kings in their kingdoms worldely / be as heads of
their subjects under Christ to se every one be in right order / to gods will
and pleasure / and that every man in every state and degree do his duty after
his calling / for to the Kings / Princes / and other superior power / it
becomes every man to be obedyent / and from their power can no man exempte
any of these subjects by any profession of man / wherefore bishops of Rome
exemptyng religyouse men from due obedience to their kings and Princes have
done against gods law and saint Paul's doctrine. To. 13. 1. Pe. 2. Hebre.
13. which places commands all subjects to be obedient unto the hye powers
/ for they that resyste powers / they resyst the ordinance of God and these
that resyste the ordinance of God they take to them self Judgment and
dampnacyon. To. 13.

The second Chapyter to the Ephesyans.
ANd quickened you also when ye were dead through trespaces and sins / in
the which in time past ye walked according to the course of this world / and
after the Prince that rules in the air / namely / after the spirit which
now works in ye children of unbelieve among whom we also had our
conuersacyon in time paste in the lusts of our flesh and of the mind and
more naturally the childrenne of wrath even as well as other. The Apostell
compares the state of these Ephesyans that they were in now when he wrote
this Epistle to them / with the state and condition of life that they were in
before Christ had called them to faith by his word preached among them / that
by the remembrance of it / they might be provoked with more gladness and
hearty love to praise and laud God / and give him hearty thanks that it has
pleased him to call them from darkness to light from ignorance to knowledge /
from syn to justice from death to life / he says when you knew not Christ
/ you were dead by trespaces and sins / behold in what case they be in ye
know not Christ and his holy word / by trespaces and sins he understands
all manner of vices and sins / whether they be in thought will / act / or in
outward deed / when they knew not Christ they were dead by sins / now
they knowing Christ do live / and be called from death to the life of grace
and of glory eternal / before they walked in vice and in sin / now they
walk in grace and in virtue / before they walked after the manners / lusts and
pleasures of this world / that is to say / after the lusts of the flesh /
the lusts of the eyes / and proudnes of life. 1. Ioh. 2. Now they walk after
the good will of god and after gods pleasure / before they followed the prince
of the air and was obedyente to his will (this Prince of the air is that
evil spirit that works in sturdy / froward / and disobedyent persons to
gods will and that does not believe God) but now they walk after the will of
god the father of our Lord Jesus Christ lord of heaven and earth whose
spirit brings and leads to all good works of God who is he that knows
he is called from sin / death / hell / and eternal dampnacion / to justice /
life / heaven / and eternal joy and bliss / and will not give thanks laud
and praise to him that brought him to this joy and felicyte? Truly I think
no man / but he would give great thanks when he remembers the benefytes of
his calling / and for that cause saint Paul here compares these two states
to gether that every one of us may remember in what case we were in before
Christ called us to his knowledge by his word / for as these Ephesyans were /
so were we / and the same thing he writes to them he writes to us / it
agreith as well to us as to them / and all one thing / as touching our state.

2. This place shows that al men that came of Adam to be subject to sin /
and for sin worthy eternal death / none able to deliver them self from
death and dampnacion / of the which we may learn that no man by his own
nature / might / power / or fre will / can save him self from death and hell /
but who someuer be saved that they be saved by the only grace of god and not by
their own merytes / or by the merytes of saints departed.

3. You see what follows syn / death / and punishment follows syn / as the
reward for sin / and that these that want the grace of god can not but fall
to sin / and go from one sin to an other / and walk after the lusts of
the flesh / and apply them selves to the will of ye devil which works in
evil men and provoke to al unhappiness vice / and syn / as these Ephesyans did
before they were called by the word of god to faith and to know Christ.

4. In evil men works the prince of the air which is the devil that
entyseth always to evil / and to do she works of the devil. The devil is
called the prince of the air / not because he has dominyon and power to rule
the air at his pleasure or will / for that to god does pertayne / but that he
has power only of evil men that lives here in the air and give them self
to serve the devil rather then God / and many mo there is that serve the devil
then god / for there is many mo unfaithful then faithful / mo sinners then
good lyuers / mo that follow the honors of the world / the pleasures of the
flesh / then that truly serves god by true faith and faithful works of
charity commanded in the scripture / mo that abuse the gooddes of the world
then that use them as they should do / of all abusers of goods of the world
the devil is the Prince and captain / for they do the will of the devil so we
may learn of whom the devil is prince / and what he makes his servants
to do / works of darcknes / and death / and where he uses his power / here
in the air where as evil men lives following the lusts of the flesh /
worldely honors / and pleasures of men / sekinge their own pleasure more then
gods glory / or the profit of their neighbor.

5. Among whom we also had our conversation / as he should say / not only you
Gentiles were dead by syn / going from one sin to an other doing the will
of the prince of ye air / but also all we Jews were dead by sin / and had
deserved everlasting death for our syn and worthy to have been for evermore
excluded ye kingdom of heaven / wherefore insomuch ye we with you be delivered
from syn / death / hell / and eternal dampnacyon / it is is not to be imputed to
our merytes or deseruinges but only to ye goodness of God / to whom we Jews
give thanks and glorifye god for it / as you Gentyles / for God by his son
Jesus Christ has delivered us all from death.

6. Men that be out of the favor of god walk from one sin to an other / do
the lusts of their flesh / and of their own will contrary to the will of
god / here we may learn what we can do of our self / lest to our own
myghtes and powers if we lack the grace of God / surely we can do nothing
else but sin / and follow the desires of our corrupt flesh / as adultery
glotony / drunkenness / Envy / malice / tancor hatred / pride / couitousnes /
error heresy Idolatry / and other such like of the which comes death and
eternal dampnacion.

7. And were naturally the children of wrath as well as other. Saint Paul
extolethe the Jews nothing above the Gentyls as touching health iustifycacyon
and life everlasting / but makes the Jews and the Gentyles equal showing
them does by their own nature to be children of wrath and of dampnacyon that
al praise and glory might be given only to God for our iustifycacyon /
forgyuenes of sin / and the gift of life everlasting in joy and bliss: and
no part ascrybed to man to man's might or power merits or deservings.

But god which is rich in mercy through his great love wherewith he loved us
/ even when we were dead in sins has quyckened us with Christ (and for by
grace are ye saved) and has raised us up with him / and set us up with him in
heavenly things through Christ Jesus that in times to come he might show the
exceeding riches of his grace in kyndenes to us ward in Christ Jesus. The
Apostle now shows how that both the Jews and the Gentyles dead by sins
have opteyned life not by their own merits / but only by the grace of god /
and that when all hope of life was paste after man's judgment or by the
myghtes of man's nature: for how could there be any hope of life of them
which were by nature the children of the wrath of god / and condemned to
death. But then god which is by nature good / gentyl and merciful / and
rich in mercy. Of his great charity and love toward us has restored us
dead by sin to life again by Jesus Christ / and that not of our good
works / but freely and for Christ's sake only / by whom is our life. The
goodness of god in this point is more to be noted toward us. That he has loved
us when we were his enemies evil and wicked sinners that then he would not
suffer us to perysshe in our sins / but has delivered us from death to
life to be heirs of his kingdom. 2. And that he would make us sure of
perpetual health and life.

He says that god has quyckened us and raised us again with Christ and
made us to sit among the heavenly company with Christ / and that by the only
mercy and grace of god by the which we are saved. Here the Apostle speaks in
the time past for the time to come / for the certayntie of the thing to come
by Christ. And least any should be wauerynge in hope or doubtefull of the
promysses of God to be fulfilled as at man's promysses. God wylleth that men
should be as sure of his promises (as if they were received in deed) by faith
and hope of them / which hope is never disceyued.

3. The raysyng up of Christ from death to life makes us sure that we shall
arise fromde death to life. Ye we which are in this last times in the which
thing is showed the rich grace of god / and his mighty power to all the
world and for all times.

: FOR by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of your selves, for it
is the gift of god, not of works, lest any man should boste him sealfe. For
we are his workmanshype created in Christ Jesus unto good works, to the which
god ordained us before that we should walk in them.: Here we may learn of
Paul oftymes if need be to repete one thing which we would have surely
known / and prynted in men's hertes / specially this thing / that our
salvation comes not of our self / of our works or merits of man / but
only of the grace of god through faith. In the which words saint Paul
reproves all the^ that think our justification does come by other things
then by the grace of god and by Christ: as by prayers / beads hallowed at Syon
/ by masses of Scala celi / by rosaryes of our Lady / by saint Francis gyrdle /
cote / coule or habit / hose / shoes or botes / gyrdeles / purse or knyfe /
matyns masses or even song / or any other such like without the grace of god
and without faith: of ye which comes life everlasting. 2. To faith in the
scripture is attributed our justification / not because faith is the author of
our justification. For the author of our justification is Christ / but
justification is attributed to faith because faith receives the mercy of god
and believes the promysses of god made to just men and beleuers to be
fulfilled. So faith is the organe and the mean by the which we perceive our
justification to come of the only mercy of god / and it makes us to believe the
scriptures that shows that we are justified by grace through faith without
all works. Good works go not before faith / but they follow faith and our
justification by the faith and makes us certain that we be justified as
shall be (god willing) more plainly here after declared.

3. Al be it that we be justified by faith and know we have our sins
forgyuen of gods goodness through faith / yet we have no cause why we should
glory in our self. For faith is not of us / but it is the gift of god and
not the work of our power as says saint Paul. 2. Corin. 3. we are not able
of our sealfe to think any good thought / as of our self: but all our
habilite is of the lord. Also saint Paul to the Rom^. 2. says. If by grace
we be saved now it is not of works / for grace is then no grace: but if it be
of works now it is no grace.::

4. Not of works least any man should boste him sealfe. Our health and
justice is not of any works. For if it were of works / then might men boste
them sealfe in their works: but man has not where in he may boste him sealfe.
For what haste thou o man that thou haste not received? and if thou have
received / why doste thou glory / as though thou had not received it
Therefore he that will glory let him glory in god / of whom comes redemption
justification / health / salvation and life everlasting in bliss.:

5. But some paraue^ture will say. If our works do not iustifye us / we will
do no good works / or what should it profit us to do good works if by works
we be not justified? To this saint Paul here makes answer saying / that we
are the creatures of god made to do good works / which god has prepared that
we should walk i^ them. So we may not cease from doing of good works /
although good works do not iustifye us. For good works are to be done to the
glory of god / and without blasphemye of god. It is blasphemye to god to
attribute to works that is to be attributed and given only to god. It is to
be ascribed only to god our justification / our salvation / forgyuenes of
sins ad life everlasting. Wherefore good works are not to be done for this
intent that they should iustifye us / deserve the grace of god / take aware
sins and bring life everlasting by reason of the work in it self. But good
works are to be done of christen men to show and declare our faith to us and
to all the world. To declare our love and kyndenes of our heart toward god
for hes benefits given to us. To make our calling certain and sure so that
we might do the will of god / and avoid his displeasure both in this world
and also in the world to come. 1. Corin. 2. That we might show our redynesse
to do the will of god that we might provoke other men to glorifye god with us.
Math. 5. That we might agree to our creacyon / and profit other men in goods
and gifts given us of god for that end. And that we should be always to the
glory of god with out fault before him by love. Ephe. 1. For these causes and
diverse other / good works are to be done.::

6. Some parauenture will say. If good works do not iustifye us / take not away
sin and give everlasting life. Wherefore in the scriptures is justification /
forgiveness of sin and life eternal attributed to good works so often? To
this I answer that scripture oftymes speaks after the manner of men. The
father oftymes entyseth his son to do his will by promise of a reward. So the
scripture speaks after the manner of fathers or of men where as it promises
justification / forgeuenes of sin / and life everlasting to them that keep
the co^mandementes of god that be faithful: as Christ says Math. 18. If
thou will enter in to life keep the commau^deme^tes of god. Here the scripture
speaks after the manner of men entisynge every man to keep gods
commandments / promisyng them a reward / if they keep gods
commandments. He means not here that the keeping of the commandments
deserves life everlasting: but rather that life everlasting is freely given to
the^ that keep the commandments of god / and they may be sure of life in
joy and bliss to come that keep the commau^deme^tes. And they that keep not
gods commandments may be sure they shall have no life in the world to come
/ but shall be dampened perpetually in hell. Furthermore where as the scriptures do
apere to give to works forgeuenes of sins. The scriptures speaks of such
works that be done in faith / which has always annexed forgeuenes of sins /
not for the works sake / but rather for the faith that they were done in /
because they that work these works were justified before god through faith
before they did work Finally sometime in the scripture iustificacyon is
attributed to works / because works declares men to them selves and to other
that they have a true and lively says by the which they be justified before
god. And so justification of works is the declaracyon of a true faith / and
so is justification taken some times in the scripture as in James. 2. and Luce.
16. where Christ says to the Phariseis. You are they which justify your
selves before men / god knows your hertes.

7. We be the creatures of god ordinated to do good works. Here in these
words two things we be taught. First is that we be the creatures of god and
his workemanshyp made of him. Of the which we may fully persuade to us the
love of god / for no man hates his own work but loves it and will not
suffer it to peryshe / and if we be the work of god (as we be i^ deed) We may
not be proud against our maker or be displeased with him saying why haste thou
made me after this fashyon or that fashyo^ it is not mete that the pot should
say to the potter / why have thou made me to this use or that fylthy use / and
another that deserves no better then I to be had in honor and glory / of this
thing there is none other cause to be given but the will of the potter / and it
is convenient that every pot should be content with the will of the potter / and
not that he should murmr against the potter that has prefarred another
before him sithe the pote is in nothers det / and both pottes have that that
they have only of the will of the potter. The second thing is that we should
learn to know for what end we were created of god / that is to say / not
that we should be idle or live evil and follow the pleasures of our flesh or
of the world / but that we be created to do good works and such works not
as we think good to us but such as god has ordynated that we should walk
in them. And here he exorteth men to good works least any should think
faith sufficient and condemn good works / good works I mean such as god
has appointed us to do by his holy word and not such work as men leuynge
gods word has appointed to serve and please god with all. And here in this
place may fall away pylgrymages / offerynges of ca^dels / gyldyng of images /
and religions of me^ / which be works not instituted of god but of man and
invented of man without gods word / for the which voluntary works many
have contempned and left on done the works commanded of god / and preferred
will works above them.

8. He moves us here not to stand still when we have done one good work /
but to go forward from one good work to another appointed of god and not of
our self of our good inte^te thought of us to honor and please god with all /
when we can not tell whether god will be honored after that way which we have
ymagined to honor him. For his honor do the not consyst in works found out
by men / but in the works appointed in the scripture. For if all our new
found works were taken away no part of the works assygned by God in the
scriptures should be taken away. I mean if al pylgrimages to painted stocks /
or stones / all gyltyng of images / all offering up of candels / al monks and
freers / al masses of Scala cesi / al trental masses were taken away / no part
of the works commanded by god should be taken away / no part of gods glory
should be mynyshed / but rather promoted and set forward. For these works
found by man has hyndered much the true honor of god that god has not
been truly honored as he should be in spirit and in trewthe / these will
works has let many to do their charity where they should have done to the
pore people (bought by the precious blood of Christ) which has had need of
the help of man. Also in that saint Paul exhorts men only to do the works
that god has commanded in the scriptures and wylleth that we shall walk in
them and go forward in them and increase more and more / me think in these
words he teaches works commanded of god to be sufficient to opteyne life
everlasting if none of our new found holy days or our will works invented
of our good zeales only without gods word be put to the works of god / we
add to the works of god many works of man's inue^cion / as who should say
gods works were not perfeit except man should put to some thing to make
the^ perfeyt / as god could not give us health and life everlasting /
except that we of our blind zeales should put to some thing of our addicio^.
I do not speak here against any godly civil ordinance or any godly ceremony
yet used or may be used in time to come that be made to set furthe gods glory
/ or for any descent or comely order to be had among men in the world / or
for any polytyke end to be used among christen men as charity requires the
glory of god better promoted and his word more regarded and set by / and the
charity of the christians more increased to the co^modyte of all good men.

Wherefore remember that ye (which before time were Gentyles after the flesh
and were called vncyrcumcision of them that are called circumcision after the
flesh which circumcision is made with hand) that ye at the same time were with
out Christ and reputed aliau^tes from the common welthe of Israel, and were
strangers from the testament of promise, therefore had ye no hope, and were
without god in this world. To this place saint Paul has spoken generally of
the grace given to al me^ now begins he to speak of the grace of god given
more specially to the gentyles when it pleased god only of his goodness and not
of the merits of the Gentyles to call them to grace and to faith which
iustifyeth them / and here the apostle teachithe all preachers after that they
have showed the general grace of god given freely to al men to apply the grace
or the benefits of god more specially to particular men / as to them to whom
it is spoken ti bring the^ to the remembrance of the benefits of god toward
the^ to give god thanks for the^ by the knowledge of whom came al goodness /
after the example of S. Paul here in these place which applies the grace of
god given to the Ge^tyles / to these Ephesia^s. 2. He moves these Ephesians to
call to their remembrance the state of living they were in before the grace of
god / and the state they be in now after the grace of god given them / which
thing if they do they will with gladness give hearty thanks to god and gloryfy
him for his goodness and show them self thankful to god by all redynes to obey
and do gods commandments.

3. He shows what they were before the gospel was preached to them / and
before they had received faith in Jesus Christ First he says that they had
an odious name hated of al good men / that is to say / they were called
Preputians which was amongst the Iues as opprobrius a name as is amongst us
christen men / a Turk or a Sarazyn or un christeined. And the Iues eschewed
the company of the Preputians and would neither eat drink nor speak with
the Preputians and abhorred their company as we do the other people or Pagans /
and he that would use the company of the Preputians was abhorred of the Iues /
as they were angry with Peter that had preched at the commandment of god to
the Gentyles. Acts. 1. and.2. but now you have an holy name landed and
magnified of all good men / and also of god the father. Also before you were
without Christ / that is not that Christ was not your sayuour and redemer
promised / but that you knew not Christ to be your savior and redemer
promised as well to the Gentyles as to the Iues / as apereth in the promise
made to Abraham / that in his sede should all the Gentyles be blessed / and that
Christ was the expectation of the Gentyles / but this mystery was hyd from the
world unto Christ's incarnation that Christ should be a savior to all men
both to the Iues and to the Gentyles. This mystery was known to some both of
the Jews and Ge^tyles / but they were very few in comparyson to them that
were ignorant or else it may be said that the Iues and the ge^tyles that were
faythefull and believed in Christ to come the only savior of the world / by
the which faith they were saved that they knew not when Christ should come
/ after what manner / how / and by what means he should redeem and save the
world from everlasting death / so the Gentyles was counted without Christ
that amongst the Gentyles the knoweledge of Christ was not so common before
Christ's incarnation as it was after. Wha^ the gospel was preached equally to
the Gentyles as to the Iues. Also the Gentyles was counted aliantes from the
common wealth of Israel / that is to say they were as foryners having no claim
ne title to any prophet or co^modyte given or promised of god to the Israeletes
that they had or professed. Here he takes his similitude of auncetry that
has privileges and great commodities granted to them which the Cytizens
have enjoy and possess / strangers and foreners have no part of these
commodities that the cytizens have / this privilege of the which is spoken here
is the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven which was promised to the
faithful that kept gods commandments as well of the Gentyles as of the
Iues / although the Gentyles could not challenge it by no title given to them
as yet wha^ the gospel was hyd from the^. 4. And were strangers from the
testament of promise / as who should say / the promyses of life everlasting
was strange to you / you knew not yt they perteyned to you / you could clame
nothing of the life nor inheritance in heaven. Also you were without hope of
life to come and wa^tyng god in the world / not that they wanted God / or
though there was no God / but that they believed not in the true god / and
thought the god of heaven not to be their god / a gentle / meke good / and a
merciful god / their savior and redemer without al hope of life to come in
the other world This was the state of these Ephesyans before the gospel was
preached to the^ by the apostles and by other after Christ's incarnation.

5. In the apostle speaks of the cyrcumcision of the flesh to whom the name
of prepution was odiouse / the apostle shows two manner of cyrcumcisions / one
is in the flesh another is in the spirit or in the heart / all the Jews was
cyrcumcised in the flesh / but not cyrcumcised in the heart / for there was
many unfaithful Iues rebels to god murmuring against him disobedient to his
commandments which although they were cyrcu^cised in the flesh yet in the
spirit and in the heart they were not cyrcumcised. Among the Ge^tyles that
never hard of Christ none was cyrcumcised in the flesh / but diverse was
circumcised in spirit and in heart / as all they of the Gentyles that believed
in god and was obedient to his word as was Naaman / Cyrus / Abimelech / Ietro
father in law to Moses / and other mo of the Gentyles / That some of the
Ge^tyles uncircumcised in the flesh but cyrcumcised in spirit and in heart /
and was of the elect people of god to saluacyo^ / we may gather that there
may be of the elect of god amongst the Turks and Pagans although they have
not our outward christian profession as was amongst these Gentyles some bette
christians then was many amongst the Jews. Also me think the apostle in
these words that he says some were cyrcu^cised i^ the flesh checketh some
of the Jews cyrcumcised in the flesh but not in the spirit. Which was not
to be preferred before the Ge^tyles / and in these words he checketh some
amongst us that be worse in living then the Turks or Pagans / which thing
is a great shame to all such evil and unfaithful christians.

BUT now ye that be in Christ Jesus, and a fore time were far of are now
made nigh by the blood of Christ. Before these the apostle has showed the
state of thesed Ephesians and of all Gentyles before they received faith / that
they had an odiouse name that was in hatred / they were called vncyrcumcised
Preputians / without Christ / aleauntes from the common wealth of Israel /
strangers from the promyses of god that promised life / without hope of life /
wantyng god in the world / people given to ydolatry / following al pleasures of
the flesh / ygnorant of god. Now he shows that they be delivered from that
ungodly state and be received amongst the people of god as of the^ by the
grace of god only / through faith i^ Christ. 2. By Christ you be received
which were before aleau^tes / be made of the household and cytezins by the
blood of Christ shed on the cross to save all the^ that were lost by sin /
and that will believe truly in Christ and know him to be an hole savior / and
no botcher / or a part savior / but an hole sauyor / as I have said before

FOR he is our peace, which of both has made one, and has broken down the
wall that was a stop by twexte us, and has also thorough his flesh put away
the cause of hatred (namely the law of the commandments contained in the
law written) that of twain he might create one new man in him self, and
make peace, and to reconcyle both unto God in one body thorough the cross,
and so he slew ye hatred thorough his own self, and came and preached peace
in the gospel unto you which were a far of, and to them yt were nigh. Christ
is our peace and our peace maker with the father / and how he was our peace
here he shows. First in that he made of two people the Iues and the Ge^tyles
one people to him agreynge in one thing.s. in the true worhsyp of god and
health by Christ. Secondely in that he took away the wall of debate / that is
to say the causes and the occasions of all strife and controversy by twene the
Jews and the Gentyles / which was the law as cyrcumcision / ceremonies and
other sacrifices commanded in the law to be kept for a time to Christ's
coming / which the Iues styfly defended and would have them kept after
Christ as they were before / or else they said no man could be saved / for
without cyrcumcision they thought no man could be saved / and therefore they
condemned the Gentyles vncyrcumcised / and thought they could not be saved by
cause they were not cyrcu^cised / but Christ took away this conte^cion and
showed that cyrcumcision was not of necessite to salvation of the soul.

2. Christ has taken away the law as touching the ceremonials and
judicial laws. Ye and the moral law also that it shall be done no more for
fear seruyll and bound fear as in time paste / but that it shall be kept for
love only to god. Christ has taken away the law as touching the
ceremonials and judicials that it is not now necessary to keep them / but that
health may be without them / nor yet they are not to be kept under the pain
of da^nacyon of the soul. For life everlasting may be without cyrcumcision
and other such like ceremonial and judicial laws which be abrogate and taken
away / that it is in a man's liberty to keep them or not keep them. It is no
virtue to keep the^ nor sin to omytte them. And contrary it is no sin to do
the^ except any should have like opynion in them as the Jews had / that they
think they must needs keep them orels they can not be saved / to think they
be justified by the keypynge of such ceremonial and judicial laws and shall
obtain by the means of them forgyuenes of sin and eternal life / in that
opinion to keep these laws is sin after the gospel preached by Christ and
his apostles / as touching moral precepts Christ has not taken them away
/ but that they shall not be done for fear of the law / for fear of hell /
and the punyshme^t thereof / but for the love of god / with all gladness of heart.

3. That of twain he might create one new man in him self. For what end and
purpose Christ abrogated the ceremonials and judicial laws he shows / that
is that he should make of two people one people eternal to him / that the one
should not contemn the other / as the Iues contemned the Gentyles before / and
the Gentyles the Iues but that they should agree in one god Christ Jesus the
savior of all / and in the true worship and faith by the which both the
Iues and the Gentyles should be saved and justified before God and not thorogh
any obseruances of the law that all men should know the life and health of
man not to be in cyrcumcision outward / in ceremonies / in sacrifices in
inuencion and religyon or merits of men nor in the worship of ydoles / nor in
supersticiousnes of man's religion / but alone in Christ that no man should
rejoice in any other but in the lord and in the cross of Jesus Christ. Gala.
6. So Christ has reconcyled the Iues and the Ge^tyles taking from them both
/ part of their pleasure / from the Iues cyrcumcision / ceremonial and
judicial laws / from the Gentyles idolatry and lechery. In the which things
both parts had great pleasure in / so Christ has reconcyled the Jews and
the Gentyles in that he took away the hatred and the cause of their hatred. So
I think among us now shall hatred cease and we shall all be made one /
sithe the cause of our hatred is now taken away by the kings magestyes
commandment. The hatred that was among us for the most part was for the
worshyppynge of stocks / stones / blocks painted and gylted / now these be
taken away I soppose a great part of our hatred to cease and charity to
increase to the glory of god and the profit of many.

4. How Christ has reconciled us sinners to the favor of the father again
here is showed that was by the cross / that is to say by Christ a full
sacrifice and a sufficient oblacion for all the sins of the world / by the
which oblation of Christ's body ones offered up for all sinners / al were made
parfit reconciled / had forgiveness of sins and made beloved to god the
father and heirs of his kyndome by Christ that dyed on the cross for our
redemption slauation / justification and life eternal.

5. And came and preached peace in the gospel to you that were far of / that
is Christ preached peace and quietness in the hertes of the Gentiles which
was counted far from the peace / favor and love of god. And this peace was
wroghte by three outward preaching of the gospel and the inwardes workynge of
the holy ghost. So was peace brought both to the Jews and the Gentiles
throught Christ and by no other means tha^ by his death of the cross.

6. If Christ has take away these things that was of a necessite commanded
of god to be kept because they were no more profitable for the people. How
much more should no man merueyle now if some institutions and religions of men
be now taken away by gods word / which be not profitable to man / nor yet
to the glory of god / which do cause much false trustes superstitiousnes /
erroneous opynions / false judgments / backwarde judgments / ydolatry / and
hyndereth the true honor of god and faith in Christ Jesus / and has made
men to put their trust of health and salvation in other then in Christ / and
so brought men to death and damnation / from the which da^natio^ to deliver us
/ Christ suffered death on the cross / and brought to all beleuers and kepers
of gods commandments life everlasting in all joy and bliss.

For by him we both have entrance in one spirit unto the father Of these
things that go before saint Paul now shows plainly that by Christ only
the way to the father of heaven is made open to all men / both to the Iues and
Gentyles / and that the Gentyles be as well of the household of god as the Iues
/ and made heirs of the kyngedome of god by Christ / and the way to the
father open to the Gentyles as to the Jews and that by Christ. 2. In that the
way is made open to all men by Christ and by none other / saint Paul
reproves those that would men should go and desire saints departed to pray
for them that by the intercession of saints departed men might come to the
father without Christ. We think it is folyshnes to leave the way to the
father of heaven appointed and assygned us in the scripture and to seek another
way not spoken of in the scripture / sithe it is so that we be uncertain
whether that saints departed be in that state that they will or be mean for
us to the father or no? Whether they here us calling to them or no? Whether
they know our necessite or no? whether they be hard of the father and obtain
their purpose or no? Of these things we have no certaynty by the scriptures /
wherefore I think it mete in this behalf to be content with teachynges of the
holy scripture which teaches al necessary truths for man's salvation / and
not to seek another way to the father then the scripture teaches. Saint
Paul says here that the way to the father is made open to all men not by
Petre / Paul / Johan / or James / Mary / or Magdelene but by Christ which is
the mediator between god and man. 1. Timo. 2. Saint Paul says there is but
one mediator between us and the father. we make many without the scriptures
how do we and S. Paul agree? How do light and darcknes agree? Forthermore I
se as yet no cause nor necessyte that should make us to go to the saints
departed and desire them to be mediators and means to the father for us sithe
there is no commandment in the scripture / no example of holy men left us to
follow / no promise made to us that we shall be hard of these saints / or that
we shall obtain our request the sooner by the intercession of these saints
departed who^ we call on and desire to pray for us. why should we leave Christ
the only son of the father of heaven our daily advocate and mediator which
only opteyneth that is necessary for us and go to other whom we know not
whether they ge in that state of living that they may hear us calling to the^
or no / or whether they will here us. Folyshnes it is to leave the certain for
the uncertain. Certain it is that Christ prays contynually to the father
for us / and Christ is the full satisfaction for our sins. 1. Ioh. 1. and
for the sins of the whole world. If Christ be our advocate as he is in deed
and obtain of the father that is necessary for us / what need have we of the
prayer of saints not commanded in the scripture / that were as who should say
/ that god would not here Christ prayeng for us / or that he would sooner here
the saints departed prayeng for us the^ Christ his son / or that the prayer
of Christ were not suffycie^t to opteyne of the father / that is necessary for
our salvation / then it were need for us to desire the prayer of saints
departed / but seeing God the father will here Christ his son before all
saints / and Christ's prayer is sufficient to opteyne all that we have need of
for our salvation. I think we have no need that saints departed should pray
for us. But peradventure some will here obiecte and say that this reason makes
against the prayer of the^ that be alive / to this I make answer that it is
the will of god that these that be alive should one pray for another. Iaco. 5
and Romans 15. but so it is not certain by the scriptures / that these yt be
departed should pray for us / or that they may or will pray for us. Also some
will say that they dare not be so bold as to go to Christ at the first.
Therefore they say they will go to the saints that be in favor with Christ
that by their intercission they may come the sooner to Christ / but I pray you
/ what opinion have these men that so says and thinks of Christ / do these
think that Christ is more merciful / more gentle / more ready / more glad to
hear the^ when they call then the saints be. Is there any of the saints
departed more merciful then Christ? more loving then Christ? is there any of
the saints that will here us before Christ? that love us better the^ Christ?
that caryth more for us the^ Christ If Christ love us better then saints for
he has bought us more deter then saints / he has bought us by no
corruptyble things as gold or silver but by his precious blood / we may be
sure that he loves that thing that he bought so dear / better than saints
that know not the price / and that he has more care for us then saints have
/ therefore let us not be afraid to go with faith and mekenes to Christ so
kind / so loving / so gentle / so glad / so ready to receive us / ye more
ready to receive us / then we be to come to him. A pray you what thing make
they of Christ / that will go to saints departed that they may come to
Christ and so by Christ to the father / but Christ to be as a hard man that
will not suffer peticioners to come to him without means / to be as a cruel
man un mercyful and un ge^tyll. And that none should think so of Christ / he
calls saying come unto me all you that labor and bear heavy burde^s and I
will refreshe you. Math. 2. He calls all men to him / as well the pore as the
rich / the subject as the king / the layma^ as the priest. Saint Paul
oftymes exhorts men to come to Christ with great boldness. Hebre. 4. If
Christ do call us and bid us come to him / why should we be affrayde to come
to Christ? me think it is against good manner not to come when we be called /
ye me think it is folyshenes to deny to come to him whom we desire to speak
with when he calls us and say we are not worthy to come to his presence but
we will desire some of his beloved servants that we may come to his speech
seeing the lord does call us and wylleth we shall come to him without
spechemen. Seeing that Christ is the way to the father and that there is none
other way nor means to the father without Christ. Io. 14. They labor in vain
that seek another way to come to the father of heaven then by Christ / nor yet
can obtain of the father that that is necessary for us so sone as Christ to
whom god the father has promised that he will deny us nothing that we shall
ask of him worthily in faith for Christ's sake. Johan. 14. Therefore let us
perferre no saint before Christ but ask of the father things mete to be
asked for Christ's sake and we shall obtain our desire according to the promise
of god. Io. 14. God does not promise to grant our petition if we desire of
him in the name of any saint departed / therefore me think it is folyshenes to
forsake that is certain and follow that is uncertain / certain it is that we
shall be hard of the father if we ask for Christ's sake and in Christ's name.
but whether we shall be hard if we ask in the name of any other saint departed
/ it is uncertain by the scriptures / ye it is unknown whether the saints
here us calyng to the^ or no? whether they know our necessite or no? whether
they be in ye state that they do pray for us or no? or can or may by their
prayer obtain any thing of the father for us. The scripture will that we
should pray to god. Math. 6. and Iaco. 1. in the name of Christ. Scripture
wylleth that we shall pray to them in whom we should put out trust. Roma.
10. and have hope to obtain our peticion of / no trust nor hope is to be put
in saints / wherefore me think prayer is not to be made to saints departed /
me think that prayer to saints be a sign of diffidence of Christ and of his
goodness / and therefore men run to saints to obtain their favor and help /
and yet all goodness comes of god Iaco. 1. and not of saints departed / of an
evil parsuasion of Christ I think men leave Christ and run to saints
parsuadyng with them self that Christ will hear no sinners / therefore they
run to the saints desyryng their healpe as who should say there were more
mercyfulnes / more gentylnes and love in saints then in Christ / which
opinion to have in Christ is evil and damnable. Some there be defenders of
prayeng to saints moved by diverse reasons / one reason is this / they say
that saints departed be members of the same body of Christ that we be of /
and al members are profitable one to another. Saints departed can not profit
us living me^bres now but by their prayers / wherefore they think that
saints departed pray for us / and that we be helped by their prayer / to this
reason may be answered thus first to the mayor / that saints departed are
members of the same body that we be of to obtain life and glory everlasting in
heaven with Christ / but whether they be members to profit other me^bres by
works of charity as living members should profit one another I am uncertain
by the holy scriptures. I suppose they have done their work appointed the^ to
do of god / and this saying me think S. Paul does confyrme. To. 12. and
Ephe. 4. Where he shows the works of the members / and also Gala. 6. saying.
While we have time let us work good to all men / chefly to the^ that be of the
household of faith / also if al members be profitable one to another. I would
gladly know how profitable be the living members to the holy saints in
heaven that needs not our help / seeing we be me^bres of the same body of
Christ that they be of / or how profitable be one saint to another. To the
minor / they say that saints departed can not profit us but by their prayer /
this reason may be denied / for saints departed other way profit and do
profit us / they confyrme our faith to trust surely in god / and that our
trust shall not be deceived / but that we shall have the reward that we trust
for they certifye us of the goodness of god / of the life and glory to come
after this life. They show us the merit of gods promysses. They teach us
to follow their footsteps to have faith as they had / hope and charity /
patience / nickenes / mercifulnes and other virtues / in the which they give
us example to follow them and make us sure of life and glory after this life /
as they be in. After these facion I think the saints departed profit us / and
this profit may be gathered oftymes in the scriptures / but that they profit
us now by their prayer I have not read in the scriptures: I know not by the
scriptures that they pray for me no more then they do almosse deeds for me /
seeing both he works of charity. Also they have an other reason that moves
them to think that saints departed pray for them / which is this. They say
saints departed has lost none of their charity that they had in this world /
but rather has their charity increase more and more they of their charity
prayed for us being on live. Much more they say now they pray for us. To
this I answer that their love be increased toward god more and more / but
as toward man I am in doubt. I would gladly of it be made certain. And where
as they say that they living of their charity prayed for us / much more now
they pray for us. So I may say that they living of their charity preached to us
the word of god / a work of charity as necessary as prayer / ergo they
preach to us now. Hear is to be proved what works of charity saints
departed now in their state may do or do The holy scriptures says that works
must be done in faith that please god / sai^tes have not faith / wherefore it
seems to follow that saints do not work after this present life / or else
their work should be done in faith that they might please god. Also scripture
promyseth a reward for every good work / prayer is a good work / prayer
therefore does not want his reward before god. But for the prayer of saints
departed I read no reward promised of god / but every man shall have his
reward for works done in this present life and in the body. Gal. 6. and 2.
Cor. 5. says saint Paul. All we shall stand before the justice of god / and
shall every one receive according to his doings the time he was in his body
/ shall receive good or evil. Finably as thuchinge prayer to saints departed I
think it no damnable thing to pray to them / nor yet no neceessary thing to
pray to them. I think it should be more for the glory of god to keep sure
trust and true confidence in god: and to know that all goodness / health /
life / salvation / glory eternal comes only of god and of his mere mercy
toward us. If no prayer at al were made to saints departed. For by prayer
made to saints gods honor has been take away and his power mynyshed. Honor
due for god given to saints / trust and confidence taken from god and put in
saints / and the blind ignorant people more ready to go to saints / ye to
the Images of saints then to god and desire health and socoure of them such
has been our blind ignorance.

This prayenge to saints has been the cause of much Idolatry / of much false
trust and confidence in saints and in Images / and that so many has desired
health of saints rather then of god for their dyseases / as of saint Loy for
our horse / of saint Anthony for our pyge / of Roch for the pestilence / of
Appoline for the tothache of Johan Shorn for the axes: and in a manner for
every sycknes one saint or other was the helper / so god was set a side / of
whom all health does come / and saints called on in whom is no health nor
no help can grant without god. Therefore if all prayer to saints departed
were set a side: I think god should be better honored / more trust and
confidence put in him / al help / socour / confort / and all goodness to come
of god and of none other better known and belyued of the onlerned people /
that have been long in blyndnes for lack of true teachers of the word of god.
One thing in this matter I would gladly know what hurt should it be to
christen men / if men should not call and desire saints departed to pray for
them: But of saints should learn to follow their fotestepes in faith / hope /
charity / patience / mekenes / co^temnyng of honor / riches / worldly plesures
and in other such like virtues / for the which things scripture puts us
in remembrance of holy men departed. I pray you what necessary thing did
Christen people want before Popes ordained the Letanye to be song and said
in the Churches / but as for prayenge to saints departed / I will not much
contend in this matter. I will not condemn them that do desire their prayers
/ nor yet commend them. I think it an indifferente thing / that may be done
well and omyttyd / and not as a thing necessaryly to be done / or that he
should be counted as an heretyke that should not pray to saints / or he a good
christenman for that work that should desire the prayers of saints departed.
I think it should be more for the honor of god / and for ye true faith to be
had among christen men / to withstand the opinion of Saints now had / that
no prayers should be made to saints departed. Then if any should desire
Saints to pray with them / and for them. If this my mind do agree with the
scriptures take it / If not refuse it. I will not be obstinate in this matter /
I would be glad to learn the veryte by the holy scriptures. Which in all doutes
is able to try out the truth. if we will be delygent to search / and leave
man's fantasyes and dreams / which has blinded us long that we could not
se the truth. But now let us return again to saint Paul.

Now therefore ye are no more gestes and strangers / but citesyns with the
saints and of the householde of god, builded upon the fu^dacion of the
Apostles and prophets, where Jesus Christ is the head corner stone in whom
every buyldyng coupled together grows to an holy temple in the Lord in whom
ye are builded also together to be an habytacion of god in the spyryte. Before
saint Paul fayde they were gestes and strangers to the householde of God /
now he says they be no more strangers but of the householde of god and
cytesyns of saints made by Christ / before they were far from the
householde of Israel / now they be received to be of the householde of Israel
/ that is to say they be made fellows of saints (that is of the Jews which
count them selfs saints in comparyson to the Gentyles) and part takers of
the heavenly inherytaunce and of everlasting health by Christ builded upon the
fundation of the Apostles and prophets / that is to say upon Christ upon whom
the Apostles and prophets did build and made Christ to be their fundacion
for as Saint Paul says. 1. Corin. 3. No man can set an other fundacion
beside that fundacyon set which is Christ Jesus / and not the Bishop of
Rome. For Christ is the head of the Church and of all them that believes /
and not the bishop of Rome / and Christ is the corner stone that kepethe and
joins the buyldynges together that couples the Jews and the Gentyles
together / and by his spyryte keeps them both in unite and concord / faith /
hope / and charity / and in all goodness.

Saint Paul saying the Gentyles beleuynge to be builded upon Christ the
fundation of the Apostles and prophets / reproves al them that says or
thinks the bishop of Rome to be the fundacion upon whom Christ has
builded his Church / for that fundacion is Christ and none other. Neither the
bishop of Rome nor yet no other man / creature / nor Angel. But Christ is the
fundacyon of all faithful byleuers and the corner stone that will not be
remouid with no blast of wind 3 Every building upon Christ does grow and
increase in an holy temple to the Lord. Here he shows the difference between
the buyldyng builded upon christ and upon other things or creatures / if it be
builded upon Christ / it will stand and increase. if it be builded upon man /
or upon man's inventions / dreams and phantices it will fall and decay at
every blaste of wind or tempest which thing does agree with Christ's saying.
Ma. 15. Every grafte that my father of heaven has not grafted shall be plucked up
by the rotes Here we may learn / pylgrimage / pardon / payntyng of Images to be
honored / not to have been of god. Monks / Freers Chanons and such like
religion of men inverted / not to have been of god / for they decay and fall
away / and their feigned religion little set by. Also all these that go not
forward from virtue to virtue and increase daily in virtue / not to be builded
of god. For the buyldyng of Christ increases daily and be made more and more
the habitacle. 1. dwelling place of God by the holy Ghost by whom they
increase / which will not suffer them to be idle / unprofitable to other / or
evil occupied / but moves and styrryth always to do the will and pleasure of
god / and suffers not his to be idle or evil occupied.

The third chapter to the Ephesyans.
FOR this cause I Paul am a prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you hethen
according as you have hard of the office of the grace of god which is given me
to you ward. For by reuelacion was these mystery showed unto me, as I wrote
above in few words, whereby when ye read yt / ye may perceive mine
understanding in the mystery of Christ which (mysterye) in times paste was
not opened unto the children of men, as it is now declared to his holy
Apostles and Prophets by the spyrite, namely that the hethen should be
inheritours also. And of the same body and pertakers of his promise in Christ
by the Gospel whereof I am made a mynister according to the gift of the grace
of god, which is given me according to the workyng of his power. Saint Paul
here merueylously does bring and get to him the favor and the benevolence of
these Ephesyans / in that he says and truly says that he suffered
prisonment / and was in stocks and in fetters for their sakes and for their
health and salvation / that is to say because he preached to the Ephesians and
to other Gentyles the Gospel of Jesus Christ / of the which Gospel preached
the Ephesyans and the other Gentyles received faith in Christ Jesus / and so
through faith came to life and eternal salvation. For this cause and for none
other Paul was cast in prison in cheynes and in fetters at Rome by Nero the
Emperor where he was when he wrote this Epistle / and in prison / and therefore
he says. I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ bound fast inprisone not for
mine own sake or for my cause / but for Christ sake and for his Gospel /
which was the health of the Ge^tyles. When these Ephesyans should here these
things / how could it be but they must needs favor and love Paul and
embrase his doctrine which for Christ's sake and for their health and
salvation was in prison and suffered pains for their cause. Kind men can not
but they must love them again that suffers for their sakes and for their
health. Thus saint Paul opteyned the favor of these Ephesyans and of the
gentyles.

2 Paul cast in prison not for his sins or any notable fautes or crimes /
but because he preached to the Gentyles the Gospel of Christ by the which
the Ge^tyles were delivered from sin / death / hell and eternal damnation
and made good / just / and opteyned eternal life and partakers of the heavenly
inheritance / this Saint Paul shows that it is no new thing that true
preachers of gods word to be cast in prisone and suffer pains for the
Gospels sake of evil men and he moves the^ to take pacie^tly their patnes in
prysone and afflyccyons that they may be with Paul the prisoner of Christ
suffrynge only for the Gospels sake and not for their own fautes crimes / or
deservings.

3 Learn here that a good and an holy man saint Paul. ye an apostle of Christ
was cast in prisone / not for no evil / but for good for preaching of the
Gospel to the salvation of the people. He was cast in prisone of an evil man
and of a cruel tyrante called Nero an Emperor of Rome. At whose commandment
saint Paul was cast in prison and leyd in fetters / so the good Apostle of God
was in prison / and the evil tyrante Nero at liberty / so god suffers in
this world the evil man to have the upper hand of the good man ye god
suffers that the good is punyshed in this world / and the evil escapes
punyshemente / but in the world to come the good shall be in joy / and the
evil in pain This place shows plainly that saint Paul was in prison when
he wrote this Epistle to these Ephesyans / whose health he more regarded then
his delyueraunce out of prisone.

4 These that put saint Paul in prison / peradventure they thought they did
an acceptable work or sacrifice to god so doing / thinking Paul a great
malefactor and a breker of ye ^aw they thought it was not laweful that the
Gospel should be preached to the Gentyles / ye and again the law of god /
that forbad the Jews to have company with the Gentyles / or to make marriages
with the Gentiles / much more they thought it was not lawful to preach the
Gospel to the Gentyles / which was a thing hyd from the world / and never
herd leson before / therefore they casting Saint Paul in prison thought they
did an hye sacrifice to god / such me^ full of their good zeales but without
gods word has been among us that has cast men in prison for preaching
that it was lawful for lay men or lay women to have the new Testamente in
English / we may se what blind zeales without gods word does / and how
it has ever cast the true servants of God in prison and brought to trouble
/ pain / punyshement and infamy in the world / although they were the new
and faithful servants of god. But at the last god delivered his servants /
and punyshed these blind ^eales and so he will do now / if they will not
repent and amend.

5 According as you have herd of the office of the grace of God given to me
toward you. Here the Apostle shows the disposition of the Gospel was
committed to him / not of him self / nor yet of his will mind / merits / or
deservings but alone of the mere mercy and grace of god / and that when it
pleased god to call him by reuelacion from his inquite and sin as is written
Acts.9. and.22. that the hole praise and lawde may be given not to man / but
to god alone / of the which we may learn that true preachers of gods word
be sent of God / for the salvation of men to whom the Gospel is purely
preached and it is a sure token that god will save those to whom he sendes
true preachers of his word / of the herers part is required that they should
dylygently hear the word of God / give credence to it / and live according
to gods doctrine / or else it profits them nothing / the Gospel truly
preached of faithful men send of god.

6 When ye read it ye may perceive mine understand in the mystery of Christ /
as he should say. I have showed you before ^ I was called to be ye minister of
god / and received the knowledge of the Gospel by reuelacion / and that office
committed to me of God to preach the Gospel of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles
/ which thing you may konwe if you will read that I have written before in
these words he gives them liberty to read this Epistle / and wyllyth that
they should perfectly know what things he had written to them / this place
makes against them that would not the lay people should read the scriptures
in there vulgar tongue. Saint Paul would have had his wrytinges known of
every one / both pressed lay man and lay woman / that every one might have
profit by his writing / what profit I pray you should the lay man have of it
if it were not lawefull for him to read it in the language he understands.

7 In times paste this mystery was not opened to the children of men. What was
this mystery that was hyd from the children of men in times paste? It was the
open preaching of Christ's gospel as well to the Ge^tyles as to the Jews and
that the Gentyles should be saved by / Christ as the Jews / and that the
gentyles perteyned to the heavenly inheritance as the Jews / this mystery was
not known to the world to Christ's incarnacion / and to after his death
chefely / it was known to a few that believed both of the Jews and also of
the Gentyles which was saved by faith in Christ to come before christ's
incarnacion / but they were seen in comparison to them that did not know it /
and therefore it was counted to be hyd from the world / and also these that
believed and did know that the gospel should come to the Gentyles and by it
there salvation / yet they knew it not so clearly how it should come / and by
what means / as these that were after Christ's incarnacion and believed in
Christ / nor yet there was not so many before Christ's incarnacion that
believed in Christ as was after / for this mystery was showed much more
plainly / and more clearly and to mo after Christ's passion then before his
passion / for as Saint Hierome says / that it is another thing in the
spirit to know things to come / and rose them fulfilled in deed. This
mystery of the gospel to be preached to the gentiles was so hyd from men /
that the Apostles of Christ did not know it at the beginning / and did doubt
whether it were lawful for them to preach the gospel to the Gentyles or no /
and to call Gentyles to salvation by the gospel without circumsion and other
ceremonies necessary to be observed / to instruct ye Apostles of Christ in
this matter was the holy Ghost sent to them and given in Pentecost / and also
this mysserye was opened to them by vysions / as to Peter Acts. 10. and that
by the will of God / and of gods goodness / of the which we may learn to
glorify god now as the Apostles did when they saw the mystery opened that
was hyd from the beginning of the world to their time. So let us now glorify
god that has now in our time opened and showed more plainly and more clearly
the truth of his word long hyd / observed and darkened by man's traditions
and inuentyons / then it was in our fathers time / and nothing marvel at the
goodness of God / but show our selves more thankful to god gyuynge him
thanks for his benefits and praise to him as the author of all goodness / and
know surely that the truth comes not to light / not for our merits or
deservings / but of the goodness of god as after Christ's passion came to the
Ge^ntyles the gospel and the truth of it by the Apostles. if me^ would
consydre this place well / and deply wey it / they should se clearly how little
effect and strength be reasons made of carnal men by the which some as yet
can not think or be persuaded in their hertes that this is the truth that is
now adays preached by true and faithful preachers in this realm. They
ground their reasons often times / of men / and of customs / saying how ca^
it be thought that god would suffer the truth so long to be hyd from his
people / and suffer men so long to be deceived with falsed. To this I answer
and say / the Gentyles might so have said to god. But none said so but those
that would not receive the gospel / believe it and be saved. The faithful
asks no cause of the will of god / but study to know gods will and to do
it. Also they say / was their not as holy men in times paste as is now /
as well learned as is now / as wise men as now be / why would not god show to
them his truth / as now. Of the will of god I will not dispute / I can give no
cause of his will / why he will this thing / and why that thing he wylleth all
things to the best / to his glory and to our profit. It is enough for me to
konwe that god wylleth this thing and that he gives his gifts of his mercy
and goodness / and not for the merytes of men. The knowledge of the truth / it
is the gift of god given at the will of god and not of man / and given when it
please the god to give it / and when god seyth it most for his glory and for
the profit of man / So the w^ of god is the cause of the truth now showed to
the world and not the holiness of fathers the lerninge or wisdom of men / and
of our party is received that we should take the truth now showed with gladness
gyuynge to god herty thanks and to live after ye truth / as these Ephesyans
that was faithful did.

Unto me the least of all saints / is these grace given that I should preach
among the hethen the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to make all men se
what is the felowshyppe of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world
has been hyd in god. Which made al things through Jesus Christ to the
entente, that now unto rulers and powers in heaven might be known by the
congregation the manyfolde wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose,
which he has showed in Christ Jesus our lord, by who^ we have boldness and
entrance in all confidence through faith on him. The Apostle repeteth the
same thing he has spoken before / but in other words / of the which he
teaches that one sentence may be spoken of the precher diverse times without a
fault / specially if it be such a sentence as is mete to be surely fixed and
rooted in the hertes of the hearers and be for their profit to be known
surely.

2 Learn here mekenes and lowlynes of heart of this Apostle saint Paul. Which
so did humble him self and set him under other / that he called him self
least of all saites or Apostles / not worthy be to called an Apostle of Jesus
Christ / because he did persecute the Church of Christ / as he says. 1.
Cori^. 15. But yet he was made the Apostle of Christ / although he sumtyme
before his conversion did persecute Christis church. Of the which we may
learn what a Lord is god / which of his goodness does make a faithful
preacher and defender of his word / of a persecuter / A sure pyller of his
Church / of a plucker down of it. Of the which we may learn the goodness of
god toward sinners / his power / not to dyspayre of no man as long as he
shall live here in this world. But God may by his grace turn him from his
sins and noughtynes / and bring him to goodness / and make of an evil man a
good man / and the true servant of god and to condemn the old saying /
ones evil always evil / which is an evil saying and worthy to be condemned
/ and abolyshed.

3 The Apostle says / it was given to him of the grace of god that he should
preach the unsearchable riches of Christ amongeste the hethen. And these
unsearchable riches was the mystery of the gospel that Saint Paul preached
to the Gentyles by whose preachinge the Gentyles received faith / and was
brought to eternal salvation. Behold what the Apostle calls the mystery that
was hid from the world so long in god / he calls it ye unsearchable riches of
Christ. They be called unsearchable riches because no man can come to the
true knowledge of them of his own myghtes / powers / works / merits / or
deseruinges without the grace of God. Or else they be unsearchable because no
man opteineth them al / but every one that believes opteyne one part or an
other of the riches of god / yt is sufficient for his salvation. For if one
mortal man should possess all the riches of God / he would be to proud / he
would condemn every other man and think him self to have need of no man /
but every man to have need of his help / and he: of no man / nor yet of gods
help / and would make him self equal with Christ and with God the father.
Which things god would not / therefore he gives to no mortal man all his
riches as he did to Christ Jesus. After this way the riches of god be called
unsearchable / for no man can have all gods riches / or se all his glory /
ye no man can perceive the glory that god has ordained for them that love
him. 1. Corin. 2.

4 Here also the Apostle teaches al prechers to humylyate them selves and to
exalte the word of god / to gloryfie and magfye it above al things in this
world / above al riches / honors / pleasures / profytes / or other goods
mortal in this world. For there is no riches worldly / worthy to be compared
with the word of God / and be they reprouyd that prefers wordely goods
riches / honors / before gods word / and in this many be offenders / as
appears by outward tokens and signs that give more delygence / labor and
pain / and more applies the^ selfs to the study of such sciences that may
bring worldly riches and honors / then to the konwledge of gods word.
which is tokens that men more regards worldly riches then gods word. This
place checketh gentylmen rich men in the world / that put their children to
the temporal law that they may get worldly riches rather then to the study of
gods word to get heavenly riches / their factes do show how unkind they be
to God of whom they have their worldly riches / and also it pertayneth to
gentilmen to know gods law / that they might rule according to gods will.
Iosue. 1. I will not speak of them which openly condemn and be mockers of
gods word / thinking no thing profitable but that / that brings worldly
honors and riches.

5 The mystery of god that was hyd from the world / ye and from the powers in
heaven / now God has made it open to all men / and Angels in heaven / which
other did not know this mystery / or if they did know it / they knew it not
so perfectely before as they did after it was preched by ye Apostles called and
send of god to do that message as by Paul / Peter / and other which here be
called the Church because they were as the chief mynysters in the Church.

6 In that he says this mysterye was opened to the heavenly powers / as to the
angels archangels and other in heaven / by the Apostles of Chrste / I think the
Apostle means not that ye Apostles taught the Angels this mystery of the
calling of the Gentyles to the faith by the Gospel preached / but rather the
contrary / that ye Angels taught the Apostles / and brought it from god to the
Apostles / for the angels be as serving spirits. Hebre. 1. And so when the
Apostles did preach the gospel and by their preaching the Ge^tyles were
converted from their infidelyte to the faith of Christ they did se the
conversion of the Gentyles that they did not se before so clearly and by what
means / so by the Apostles this mysterye was made open to the heavenly powers
/ or else this speaking that the Apostle here uses / is a manner of speaking
by the which he means that this mystery was showed and declared openly and
plainly to all the world by the Apostles / to whom god showed this iuystery
when hes pleasure was it should be showed and this mystery he also calls the
many fold wisdom of god / which god has determined to be showed by Christ
Jesus by whom he made al things / and restored to their perfytnes when it was
the will of the father they should be made perfyte and restored to their
perfitnesse.

7 He shows also that by Christ we have boldenes and sure trust with al
confidence to come to the father and to be partakers of his kyngedome and
glory / and that not by Peter / Paul / Johan / James or by our works / deeds
or merytes / but only by Christ Jesus / and for his sake alone.

Wherefore I desire that ye faynte not because of my tribulacio^s that I suffer
for you / which is your praise, The Apostle seems in these words to make
answer to his adversaries which spoke evil of him / and slaundered him / and
by their slanders and evil speaking did pluck many from his doctrine / that
they did not give credence to him saying / if Paul were the minyster of god
and preached purely his Gospel / he should not have been cast in prison and in
bonds / his bonds and prysonmente does prove him to be evil / and a
deceyuer of the people / and that god is angry with him / or else who would
have cast hi^ in prison? for who would cast a good man in prison? as who should
say / no man. To these or such like evil speakynges the Apostle makes
answer exortyng these Ephesyans not to shrynke from him or forsake his
doctrine for his emprisonment / in fetters bonds or other affliccions which
he suffered / not for his fautes / but for these Ephesians and for their sakes
/ and for their health and salvation that he preached the gospel of god to
the^ of the which they received faith and health wherefore he says that they
should not be asshamed of him for his affliccions / but rather they should
rejoice for his afflicio^s which he suffered for their sakes / and for their
profit. Of these we may se yt these that purely preach the word of god that
they suffer oftimes imprisonment / bonds fetters and the other affliccions /
not for none other cause / but that they preach the word of god purely and
sincerely.

2 Men should not shrynke from the word of god or esteem it the worse or to be
false doctrine because they that have preached it have been persecuted /
punyshed / cast in prison and put to death of the world as malefactors
deceyuours of the people and false preachers. For other felycite / let not true
preachers look for in this world of carnal men / then persecution and
afflyccion this is the reward that they shall have here where as carnal men
do rule / but in the world to come / let them look for an other reward in joy
and bliss / and in hope of it may be their comfort which hope does take away
the greuousnes of their myseries and paynfulnes of affliccions here.

3 Affliccion or persecution prouyth whether me^ trust surely in god and stycke
to his word or no / for many there be that for fear of punyshemente and
affliccyons do shrynke from god and his word and bids them farewell / which
believed as long as there was no persecution like to follow as Christ says
Math. 13. Many does believe for a time / but in time of tribulacyon they shrynke
fearyng more man then god / and the loss of goods of this world then the
loss of heavenly riches / fearinge more the loss of this present life then
the loss of the life to come / but let all such repent and amend / for he
that leseth his life in this world for me and my Gospel faith Christ. Math.
16. in the world to come he shall find everlasting life in joy and bliss.

For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Which is the true father over all, that is called Father in heaven and in
earth, that he grant you (according to the riches of his glory) to be
strengthed with power by his spirit in the inward men, that Christ may
dwell in your hertes by faith, that ye being rooted and grounded in love /
may be able to comprehend with all Saints / what is the breadth and length
and the depth, and the heyght, and to know the love of Christ, which love
yet passes al knowledge that ye may befylled with all manner of fulness of God.
Saint Paul moves and gives example to al Bishops / Pastoures / Curates /
and to all whom cure of other is committed / that they should pray for their
flock committed to their spiritual charge / and desire of god that they
shrynk not from faith and from gods word for fear of persecution and
affliction / or for love of worldly goods / pleasures or riches / which
oftymes plucketh men from god and from his word / and that they may have true
faith and continue in it / loving God above al things in this world /
preferring his word above all worldely riches / honors / or pleasures. In
this prayer he shows that Bishops and Pastoures / have need to pray thus
for there flock / ye every one of us to pray for an other yt we shrynke not
from God and his word by infidelite / unkindness or by other sins. Also in
this prayer he shows that one of us should desire an other to pray for us /
and to whom our prayer should be made / not to Peter or Paul John^ or James /
but to god which is the gyuer of all goodness / and for what thing prayers at
to be made for some certain thing that we have need of / and that is
profitable to the health of the soul / as here it was necessary / that Paul
should pray that they might continue in faith / and in the love of god and not
shrynke from faith for fear of affliccions / or for love of worldly riches or
pleasures. And this is to be desired of god always / and every one should desire
these of God for an other as a thing very necessary for every one. So was the
common prayers made to god / for necessities to be opteyned by prayer of god /
to put away euyls that appeared to approach to men at the will of god / and
when such necessity was: the people gathered together and desired the help
of god fasting that there prayers should be with more devotion and more fervent
/ that they might escape the evil that was like to come and fall among them.
They fasted without mete or drink that their prayer might be more devout /
but now is true prayers and true fastings almost all put away / and our
prayer and fasting at full of superstition and feigned holiness / for what an
holy fast is it to absteyne from flesh / and fill their belly with fysshe for
flesh / is fysshe more holyer then flesh? who made that holiness? if
fysshe be more wholesome for man's body then flesh / every man can judge / I
think that there be few phesycyo^s that will so say. Therefore let us fast a
true fast from al sin and pray in faith askyng things mete to be asked for
Christ's sake / and without doubt we shall obtain our desire of god / for so
he has promised the performaunce of our desire and he will perform his
promise.

2 In that Saint Paul did bow his knees to God / he shows the feruentnes
of his mind and of his prayer to God / which was showed ever by this exterior
gestour / of the which we may learn that it is lawefull to show our inward
hertes and mind by exterior gesture and signs which of times shows the
good devotion of the heart / but in these exterior signs in prayenge
hipocrites do pass much the^ yt truly pray in faith / in spirit / and in
truth Therefore of these exterior signs is not al ways the heart to be Judged.

3 Here we may learn / that we have need of feruente prayer to God in faith
that we may continue in faith in charity in the favor of god / and in the
truth of his word and increase i^ it every day more and more which thing we
can not of our self with out the grace of God of whom we have that we
contynewe in faith / in charity / in the favor of god / which things god
gives for the most part by faithful prayer. Therefore let us faithfully pray
and oftymes / that we may contynewe and increase in all goodness / but we be
slack and dull to pray faithfully to god / therefore it is no marvel if God
take his grace from and leave us to our selfs and suffer us to follow our own
carnal and sensual lusts and desires and so to fall to all noughtynes and
sin / it is a token that our faith is faint and scarce luke warm / ye I
fear me it is cold and almost frosen up hole / that it brynketh fourth no mo
good works / specially now when it is showed so plainly what manner of works
pleases god best / and how they should be done / for god only.

4 In that he mouyth us to pray to him of whom all things was made and are
ruled and governed / which is our father he gives us boldenes and makes us
bold to pray to him trustyng our father will not deny to us that is
profitable for us / but will be much more gladder to grant our lawefull
petition / then we be to pray and desire of him that is for our health and
salvation.

5 What charity saint Paul had / is here plainly showed in that he desired yt
these Ephesians might be increased in the riches of god that is to say in
faith / hope / charity / patience / mekenes in the truth in the spirit of God
/ by whom they should be made strong in faith / that they refuse no
persecution no affliccyon so that they might promote gods glory and the truth
of his gospel / to the salvation of me^ he desires also yt they might be made
so strong by the spirit i^ the inward man / that Christ might dwell in their
inward heart by faith roted in charity that brings forth good works of the
spirit of god at all occasion given / he desires that they might know the
length the breadth / ye heygth / the deapnes of god / that is to say that they
might know god perfytely / as men knows a thing perfetly when they know
the length / the breadth / the heyth / and the deapnes / and that they might
have the love of god / which passes al knowledge and that they might be
fulfilled with all goodness of God. Such things charity wishes to other /
rather then any worldly goods / and they be written to teach us what things
we should desire in our faith full and feruente prayers one to an other as long
as we be in this present life / and if we do not so as Paul here did / we
lack faith and charity / and be out of the favor of god / and to monyshe us
to do our duetye

Unto him that is able to do exceeding abundatly above all that we axe or
understand according to the power that works in us be praise in the
congregation which is in Christ Jesus at all times for ever and ever. Amen,
Least any man should think god not able to grant these things that we
desire of him in our faithful prayers. He says that God does give to us
above all things that we ask of him / and mo things he gives to us then we
ask of him / or yet can think to be desired of hi^ / for his might is
omnipotent / and his riches can not be wasted or spente / for they be infinite
and ever does flow and abunde with plentye to all men.

2 He shows also that god works in all good men by his might and power
mouynge them to good works always / as in evil men the devil is not idle /
but moves and styrreth them to evil deeds and deadly works that brings
death.

3 The Apostle gives God thanks for his gifts given to him and to all other
faithful christianes. In the which he moves us al to give god thanks for
his benefits that he gives to us and to all men every day / and that we
should not be unthankful or forgetful of the goodness of god to whom be glory
praise and comme^dacion for ever. Amen.

The fourth chapter to the Ephesyans.
THEREFORE I which am prisoner in the Lord, exhort you that ye walk as it
becomes your calling where in ye are called with all humblenes of mind and
mekenes and long sufferynge, forbearynge one another in love, and be dilygente
to keep the unity of the spyryte through the bound of peace, one body and
one spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling, one lord / one
faith one baptyme, one God, and father of us al Which is above all and through
all and in you all. IN Chapiters before this chapter the Apostle has
exhorted men to faith. Now he desires them to garnysshe their faith with good
works / and first of al he exhorts the^ to unite and co^corde for by
co^corde small things do increase / and by discord great things are scatered
abroad and do peryshe / for in the congregation of christianes nothing is
better the^ unity and concord / nor nothing worse then discord or debaite /
strife or contention. Therefore it becomes every man to eschew discord and
debate / and all vices that styrreth up contention / and to seek for unity if
it be by loss of temporal profits / and to get all virtues that bring
unity / concord / peace / and quietness / and all such be blessed / and
shall be called the children of god. Math. 5. Says Christ Blessed be you peace
makers for you shall be called the children of god / and shall have peace with
god.

2 The manner of desyryng helps much to persuade men / as here Paul in prison
for their sake and their health by his prayer did pearce their hertes and mouyd
them much to grant his peticion / and he speaks to them after this manner.
If I do suffer prisonment and greuouse affliccion for your sake and your health.
I ca^ not think no other but you will do some thing at my request / and
specially sith that thing I require of you / is not for may profit / but for
your profit / advantage / glory / and health and for the glory of god / and
that thing you be called to of god / and is your office to do withal
diligence. Which is that you should walk as it becomes christianes to walk
/ yt is not to be idle but to go forth wards from one virtue to another / in
all mekenes of heart and mind / no man thinking of him self more then
becomes him to think / far from pride and hye mind / for what should make
us proud or hye minded / thinking our selfs better then other / and extolle
our selfs above other / or think no man to be compared with us / what have we
/ that we have not received? And if we have received? why do we glory and be
proud as we had not received it? it is in his will and pleasure how long we
shall have it / of whom we received that we have / and when he pleases he may
take it away from us again. He wylleth also that we shall walk in mekenes /
which is a virtue by the which / ire angry / fury / malice / envy / and
other like passion or affection of the minds is quenched and put away from the
heart we must have also patience by the which all adversity / tribulation /
affliccyon how some ever they come they be patientely suffered / without
murmr or grudge against god or man / without all desire to be avenged for
injuries done / but remlite the matter to god that will avenge injuries and pray
for them that has done injuries that they might amend and so quench the ire
of god toward them which god will power upon sinners that will not repent
and amend and refourme their noughty living / make amends for their injuries
3 The Apostle shows wherefore he exhorts them to unite of the spirit / for
of unite comes many virtues / as mekenes patience / sobernes* long
sufferaunce with other many mo / which be knyt together with charity the
bound of peace that coupleth and knytteth all virtues together and keeps them
that one shrynke not from another. Of discord comes many great vices and
sins / that brings to death as ire / hatred / envy / malice / furye /
madhastynes / cauelnes / pride / dyspysynge of other / strife / contencyon and
/ debate and many other vices mo that brings death Gal. 5. Therefore fle
discord / seek for unite and peace / if it be to loss of your temporal goods
or pleasures. So doing you shall win more heavenly riches then you lose
temporal goods / seeking for unity and peace / and if you will have peace and
other virtues / se that you study first to get charity and have her favor
/ whose favor if you lack / you shall lack peace / unite / and all other
virtues and having her favor / you shall have all virtues / and the spirit
of god that moves always to al goodness to works of charity and mercy. 4. He
shows the reasons why he has exhorts the^ to concord / and untie of the
spirit / and to keep that unite by charity the bond of peace. One reason is
this. It becomes them not to be at discord to whom so many things be common
/ yt becomes them not to be of diverse minds and affections / at debarte and
strife that be of one body / one spyryte one calling / one hope / one lord /
one faith / one baptyme / one God and father / which makes al / in all / as
who should say / it is not mete that there should be variaunce amongeste them
that be members of one body / al we be members of Christ's body. Wherefore it is
not mete that amongeste christen men should be discord and debate / but unity
and concord and every one to seek as well for the profit of another as
members in the body speaks and labors one for another how deadly war
amongst christen me^ for worldly honors and pleasures / does agree with
saint Paul here in this place I would learn of other. Also if we have the
spirit of god / as I trust we have / or else we be not of Christ. Roma. 8.
There should be no debate amongst us / for thal spirit is not the spirit of
contencion / but of peace / we be called in one hope of ye heavenly
inheritance / where as there shall be no discord nor contention. For
contentiouse men opteyne not the kyngedome of god / we be servants to one
Lord / it becomes not servants to be at contention amongst them selfs /
there is one profession of al christians by the which they profess to be
servants of god alone / to believe and trust in him to be obedient to his will
always / to look for all necessary things / life and salvation of him alone /
and one baptyme by the which we be made his servants / receive name and
lyueray by the which we be known to be servants only to god / which is our
Lord god / and father it becomes not servants nor brethren to strife / but
to have all love / peace unity / and concord and every one for his part to
endeuer hi^ self with all his power might and diligence to do the will and
pleasure of his lord and father / that he may receive the heavenly inheritance
promised to obediente children.

Unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of
Christ. Therefore says he / he is gone up an hye and has led away captyuite
capptiue, and has given gifts unto men, that he went up, what is it, but he
first came down in to the loweste parts of the earth? he that came down is
even the same which is gone up above all heavens to fulfill all. Least any
man should think or say that the diverse gifts of the spirit should hurt or
hinder the unite of the spirit and be cause of debate / and sterre up strife
or contencion for the diversity of the gifts of god / the Apostle says that
these gifts given freely should rather be cause of concord / then of discord
/ seeing not al gifts be given to one / but to every one after such a fashyon
and measure that every one has need of the help of another. Therefore it
becomes every man to be content with his gift and not to contemn another
that has not so much given to him he that has much / much shall be
required of him / and he that has less / less shall be required of him / and
he that has most / he has not so much but he has need in some things the
help of other / that none should contemn another.

2 The distribution of the gifts of God is not at man's will / but at the will
and pleasure of God / which gives them as he pleases / to some more and some
less as he seyth it expedient for his glory and our salvation therefore let
none be despised because he has little / nor no man proud because he has much
or more then other / let every one exercise and use there gifts given them /
to the glory of god and to the profit of other and so be thankful to god the
gyuer of all goodness / which gyuethe his gifts not al to one man least he
should contemn all other men / and abuse the gifts of god to lucre / to vain
glory to pride and arrogancy.

3 The Apostle proves by the testymonye and record of Dauyd the prophet in
the Psalm 67. That Christ has ouercommen his enemies. s. sin / death /
hell and the devil / and has ascended to heaven and has given gifts to men
/ as appears more plainly. Roma. 12.1. Cor^ 12. Here he alludeth and follows
the manner of conquerours which conquer and overcome their enemy and get
spoils and riches of their enymies / which they show and blase the^ abroad
that every man may se them / and then dystrybute them to the people in a
triumph and praise of victory. So Christ having victory over his enemies /
sin / death / hell and the devil and robbed them of their captyues / he
triumphs over them and has ascended to heaven and given many gifts of the
holy ghost to men / in laud and praise of his victory over his enemies.

4 In that he asks / what is that ascended and descended in to low parts of
the earth / he expounds it him self saying it is he which descended
before and ascended above all to fulfill all / that is to say it is Christ
which came from heaven in to the earth and took the nature of man upon him /
and was be come as man and as an abiecte person and suffered death / and
ascended to heaven and fulfilled all things / restored al things / and made
al things perfyte / by whom we have free passage to the father and be made
heirs of the celestial inheritance.

And the same has set some to be Apostles, some to be Prohetes / some to be
Euangelystes, some to be Shepherdes and teachers / whereby the Saints might be
coupled together through common service to the edefyenge of the body of
Christ till we all come unto one manner of faith and knoweledge of the son
of God, and become a perfyte man in to the measure of the perfect age of
Christ. Of this place we may learn how god has distributed his gifts and
set in his church diverse ministers for diverse offices and wylleth that every
one should use him self in his office according to his office / calling and
gift. Some he calls Apostles / some Prohetes / some Euangelystes some
Doctoures / some teachers. Apostles they were called which were not fixed to
one place to one people / but went from place to place preaching the Gospel
both to the Jews and the Gentyles. Prophets were they that opened the
mysteries of the scriptures and sometime showed thi^nges to come. Eua^gelystes
were they that were deputed to teach the people the gospel symply and and
plainly. Doctors they taught the people the word of God and did drive a way
the wolf from the flock of Christ / and so did Pastures / but these offices
be not so divided but one man may be an Apostle / a Pprophete / an Eua^gelyste
/ a Pastoure / a Doctor / they have diverse names for the diversity of there
offices and of their gifts.

2 In that God has in his Church so many ministers / he would have some to be
heaters and not all to be Pastoures. And in this he reproves them that would
have every man to be preachers. Some must be preachers and some hearers in the
congregation. The ministers in the Church they should either be Apostles /
Prophets or Doctors / or else Levites decaynes to provide for the pore / for
Purgatory prestes or popish prestes that can do nothing else but momble or
patter over a pair of popyshe Mattyns or Mass. I find no place in the
scripture / ignorant prestes not learned in the scriptures / not able to teach
and to edyfye other by holy doctrine ar not allowed of saint Paul to be
counted as prestes or Bishops / as appears. 1. Timo. 3. and. Titum. 1.

3 For what end was these ministers in the Church ordained is here showed /
that it was to instruct other in the truth / and to edyfye other by wholesome
doctrine / and not that they should deceive any be errors / heryses /
superstitions / feigned holiness / false trustes / backwarde or perverse
iudgme^tes / the Church is edifyed when it is instructed in treu faith and
good works approved by god / al erroneous opinions / superstitions errors and
heryses put away / it is distroyed by false opynyons / superstitiousnes / evil
judgments errors and heresies of minysters in the Church that serve not for
the edyfycatyon of the body of Christ I can not tell for what purpose they
serve / as many Purgatory popyshe priests that know not Gods word nor will
not learn it to edifye them self and other in the truth / but will hinder and
let is as much as they can / and speak evil of Gods word as far as they
dare.

4. Here he shows how long it is necessary to have Apostles preachers and
teachers of gods word in the Church of god / they be necessary till we
come all to the unity of faith and full knoweledge of god / and till we come to
be perfect men in Christ which is not in this world / but in the world to
come / for now we have imperfect knoweledge / then we shall have perfyte
knowledge / now we know by faith / then we shall know face to face. He
wills that we shall increase daily more and more in the knowledge of god /
which knowledge increases as our faith increases as there is encreasynge in
age / so there is encreasynge in faith / of the which encresynge is here a
similitude taken. And he wylleth that men should increase in faith and in
knoweledge of gods word / and go forward in good works / as men do
increase in age / and this encreasynge in faith is by the preaching of the
word of God which may not cease as long as we shall live in this world.

That we be no more children, wauerynge and carried about with every wind of
Doctrine through the wyckednes of men / and craftynes / whereby they lay wait
for us to deceive us, but let us follow the truth in love and in all things
grow in him, which is the head, even Christ / in whom all the body is
coupled together / and one membre hangs by an other through out all the
joints / whereby one mynystereth unto an other according to the operacyon as
every membre has his measure / and makethe that the body grows to the
edyfyeng of it self in love. The Apostle declares him self and shows when
they shall be made perfyte men and how / that is / when they shall not be
children and wauerynge with every blaste of doctrine and be drawyng this way
and that way he would not have the^ children that be unconstant / folyshe /
mutable and wauerynge hither and thither / but he would have them children in
malice and in knowledge men constante in the doctrine of truth and in faith /
and that they would not suffer them selfs to be deceived by any doctrine of
me^ which should come in shepes clothing and under pretense of holiness and
virtue / which should be inwardly gredy wolfes. Here the Apostle reproves
these that be vnconstance in doctrine and in faith / and light of credence to
every doctrine now following this way / now that way. New rather the^ true
doctrine pleases better for a time and such there is many / which be better
pleased with the doctrine of falsed / then with the old doctrine of truth /
and therefore they get them new masters of error and believes them and
contemns the old truth. Masters of error be they that has preached
pylgrimage / painting of blocks and stocks offering up of candels to images
/ perdons / and other will works neither commanded of God nor of man /
leuynge the works of God commanded in holy scripture. And also these
anabaptists be masters of error and have deceived some by their new
doctrine of falsed error and heresye.

2 He shows how these masters of error have deceived men and brought from
the reueth of holy scripture / by falsed craft and pretense of virtue and
holiness / and of the worship of God, but these by there pretensed holiness have
deceived many and brought from the truth to error and heresy. Such was the
doctrine of them that would have the Bishop of Rome to be the head corner of
the Church of Christ in earth making al holiness in fasting prayeng /
halowynge / ryngynge / fyngynge / relygiousnes / rites / ceremonies / customs
/ or otherways brought in by the bishop of Rome / and not spokyng of in
scripture. Such deceyuable doctrine was the doctrine of them that moved men to
put their trust and confidence in creatures / in their own works deeds
merits / in saints. ye incarued and graven images / in pardons / to
pylgrimages in masses ad Scala celi / in cotes / coulles / habytes / voyse /
shows / boutes / gyrldelles purses / knyfes / and in other such like bag gashe
and inventions of man invented for lucre sake. Which inventions has been
profitable so Bishops of Rome / inuentours and makers of this holiness from al
such deceyuable doctrine the Apostle mouethe men to be waere / and take heed
of their wylye craftynes and sleeth ^^glynge / by the which they have deceived
simple men that trusted / no evil nor falsed and wylleth that men shall take
that truth and follow the truth by charity / and do forwards by faith and
good works approved and appointed of god in holy scripture and not to leave
these works and to follow our own dreams or fantases invention of man
without gods word.

3 The Apostle here goes forth in his metaphore of building / by the which
he wylleth no other thing but that he would me^ buyldyng upon Christ the sure
fundacion should go forth in true faith in true knowledge of Christ and in all
good works in charity by the which al virtues be coupled and knyte together /
that they might be a perfyte building in Christ and come to his glory / of
the which also we may learn that it is the office of a preacher not only to
reprove vice and sin / but also to show the remedy for the^ / how men shall
get true virtue to move to go forwards in virtue and in all good works and
deeds commanded in scripture / after the example of saint Paul.

This I say therefore and testify in the Lord that ye walk no more as the other
heythen walk in the vanyte of their mind, blinded in their own
understanding, being strangers from the life which is in god through the
ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart, which
being past repentance have given them selfs over to wantonness to work all
manner of uncleanness even with gredynesse. That the Apostle may more move us to
holy life / holy manners and conditions / he sets before our eyes the filthy
and abominable life of gentyles that know not Christ nor his doctrine / and
wylleth that we should walk no more after the ways of gentyls which walk in
vanite of their minds following their own imaginacio^s phantises and dreams
the lusts and pleasures of their own minds / which be blinded with
ignorance of the truth / full of superstitiousnes / vain holiness false
trustes and vain hopes corrupt judgments / so blinded that they can not or
will not se the truth / but continewe still in blyndnes / in ignorance / in
supersticion and in all vices used before and condemned by the holy scripture
of God / and will not admytte the truth to enter their hearts / nor walk in
the truth of gods word. They be also far from god / from eternal life with
god for ignorance that is in them / and blyndnes of heart by the which they
know not God nor yet will or desire to know him / which is most blyndnes of
al / and a great toke^ that god has utterly reyected them and forsaken them
/ from the which ignorance I pray god save us / and from their ignorance and
blyndnes they come to that point that they will not repent of their sins not
leave them / but contynewe still in all unhappiness and myschefe / gyuynge the^
selfs to all uncleanness pollutynge them selves with all fylthynes / with
insatiable gredines with such degrees and steps goes evil men to all
wyckednes / impiete and vngracyousnes / by the which we may know in what state
they be in that know not god nor his word / nor will not follow gods word but
them selfs in vanite of mind ignorance of God and blyndnes of heart without
repentance give them selfs to all uncleanness.

2 The Apostle here uses great wisdom in that he sets the fautes of other
before their face and make them abhomynable in their fight and worthy to be
reproved and conde^mned / although he might have laid to their charge and have
reproved these Ephesyans for the^ that they seeing their fautes condemned in
other much more should think them worthy condempnatyon in them self that
they condemn in other.

3 Mark the gentylnes of saint Paul in that he desired them when he might
have commanded the^ / and his wisdom in that he affraeth them from sin used
among them by the example of other / and wylleth they shall not follow the
vanite of their own mind / least they run in darkness and in obstinate
blyndes ever desiring to sin and contynewe in sieve and never to forsake
fynne and uncleanness which is the most perilous vice that can be and a sure
sign that all such be utterly rejected of god and from his favor for
evermore of this place we may learn that these that give the^ self to vanity
of their mind and carnal pleasure and will do what fomeauer carnal lust
month them does go from one sin to another and heap up sin upon sin /
and at the lastes they come to this point that they would not forsake sin /
nor be sorry for it / nor repent / but ever contynewe with insatiable lust and
desire to sin. Therefore follow not the vanity of your own mind / but gods
word. Walk not in ignorance but in the light of the gospel that so clearly
shyneth that you may walk surely / and in the truth.

But ye have not so learned Christ. if so be it ye have herd of him, and are
taught of him, even as the truth is in Jesus. So then as concerning the
conversation in time paste lay from you that old man, which marreth hi^
self through deceyuable lusts, but be ye renewed in the spirit of your
mind, and put on that new man which is shapen after God in true ryghtuousnes
and holiness. Before he shows in what vices evil men did walk in / as in
vanite of their minds in ignorance and darkness in blyndnes of heart without
al fear of god / without sorry for sin or any repentance / but in lust and
pleasure ever to contynewe in sin. Now he shows that they have not learned
Christ so / that they should walk in si^ne but that they should forsake si^ne
repent and sin no more / nor follow no more their vanites of mind or lusts
or uncleanness of body / nor other unlawful desires of the old man / but that
they should put of the old man and put on the new man / and be renewed with
the spirit of god which moves to all virtue / as to faith hope / charity /
patience / mekenes / long sufferynge / unite / concord / peace / righteousness
/ equite / justice / cleanes / and to all holy conversation of life in all
truth.

2 This place shows / who has truly learned Christ / surely all they which
be taught of Christ to forsake sin / to mortyfye their carnal affections /
and do put away sin and the old man with all his carnal lusts and affections
/ and mortifye the^ by the truth / and walk in the truth according to the
truth / these that do so it is a sign that they have learned Christ and put
away the old man with all his concupiscence and put on the new man which is
made after god by justice and holiness of the which we may learn that it is of
God that sinners repent them of their old evil and now take a new life and
lead an holy conversation.

3 The true knowledge of Christ / which is the truth / moves us to forsake
sin in the which we have walked in times paste for lack of knowledge and in
that we have obeyed our old man and his concupiscence to much / which
brings to death. Gala. 5. and. Roma. 8. The affeccion of the flesh is
death. Therefore let us put away the old man with all his carnal desires or
lusts always ready to sin and to swarne from the truth of gods word / and
bring to death / and let us be renewed in the spyryte and put on a new man
made after God in all justice and virtue that moves us al always to virtue and
goodness. By the putting away of the old man he understands the putting away
of al sin / as to put away vanite of mind darkness / ignorance of god /
blind obstynacye of heart vnsorowfulnes for sin / uncleanness and al other
vices / and in their places to put on virtues / and desire to follow gods
word / knowledge of it / redynesse to apply hi^ self to do gods will and
pleasure in all truth and justice justice / and such does appear to be renewed
by the spirit of god / whose old life in sin does displease and a new life
in virtue does please / whose mind is willing and glad to know the truth
and to live after the truth of gods word in all virtue and goodness.

Wherefore put away lyenge and speak every man the truth with his neighbor for
as much as we are members one of another. Be angrye, but sin not, let not the
son go down upon your wrath / neither give place to the backebyter / he
that has stolen / let him steal no more / but let him labor rather and do
some good with his hands that he may have to give to him that needs. The
Apostle here exhortethe men to to put away certain vices and to take in their
places virtue. First he exhorts men to put away lyenge / by lyeng he
understands all craft / sotteltye / falsed / deceyte / in word or in deed /
by the which crafty men deceyueth other that be simple or osuche as fear no
craft / gyle or falsed / in bargaynynge / as in seilynge byenge or in other
busynes of the world necessarely to be used amongeste men in this world / and
vnderlyenge may be contained delayenge of matters to deceive men / and to make
them spend more monye for the expedytion of their matters. And in this is
reproved lawers and all other that delay matters for lucre sake. Here is also
reproved all them that falslye accuse and sclaunder other / that go about to
deceive another by fair speaking / goodly words or promyses when they
intend to do nothing Here is also reproved all manner of flattery or
dissembling. ye all perjury in selli^ge of their wayre / which vice is so
commonly used vnponyshed of god or of man / that in a manner it is counted a
virtue / and he to be best servant that can with most periurye and greateste
swerynge deceive his chapman. But let such repent and amend them selves / for
god will not suffer vnponyshed his holy name so to be taken in vain / so
irreverently to be brought for a testimony in a false matter and a dissembled
purpose / God will not suffer periurye vnponished / but he will either punysh it
here in this world / or else in the world to come or in both / in this world /
and also in the world to come. And in this world such perjured persons god
punysheth often with corporal punyshementes / as with pouertye sickness /
diseases / and with unfaithfulness that they be least believed / that be most
swerers / men were wont to cry out of them that did eat eggs butter / mylk
chese / and other like white meat in lent seson / and held their peace at
periurye / vnreuerente taking the name of God in vain / and bringing in it
to be witness or record in a false matter / for the which god threateneth
punyshemente Deulero. 5. Saying he that takes the nayme of God in vain shall
not be unpunished / at the breaking of Gods law / we hold our peace / at
the breaken of man's law we cry out / and call them loosers and heretykes
that eat white meat in lent season / which is a laweful thing by gods law
/ and may lawfully be done / so it be not done with contempt of the authoryte
and with offendicle of wayke persons / and against their conscience /
thinking that thing unlawful / and yet eat it against conscience / to take
the name of god in vain is always unlawful / and forbidden by goods law.

2 Also the Apostle not only forbyddeth lyenge / but he commands that men
shall speak the truth / and that symply and plainly without all dissemblyng
in words and in deeds / and to keep the profitable truth toward all men
always as well in bargaynes as without byenge and selling choppynge or
chanynge. And here the Apostle reachethe that it is the office of a faithful
preachers not only to reprove vice used amongst men / but also to show a
medsyne for every vice / and to heal the vice with his propre medsyne and to
set virtue in the place of sin / sin clearly put away.

3 This place reproves them that go about to deceive their neighbor by
craft / falsed surelty or by any crafty means / and specially these that be
simple / and trusts no falsed, beleuynge that no man would deceive them / if
they might / but alack for petie / that craft / falsed / and perjury / is
suffered of rulers and Magistrates unpunished / as they were not forbid of God
/ but at man's pleasure and will / so sin unpunished / is counted oftymes to
be no sin / or small sin / ye peradventure a virtue a worldely wisdom /
and a good wordly polycye / and a sign of a wise fellow that wylt thryue so to
use craft / and falsed is reckened to be thristey but how someuer such
shryue before the world / they thryue not before God almyghtye that forbyddeth
such thryfte / and co^dempneth all such thryuers / ye ieyrers and brekers of
his law.

4 He shows the cause why we should not use craft or falsed one to deceive
another / the cause is that we be members of one body / one membre does not
decyue another / nor will not hurt another / but labors for another / as
the hand does not hurt the head the leg or the foot but will labor for
them and provide that they want nothing or that they be not hurt / or any
other ways nooed / and will in no wise deceive them / so should we all do one
to another / seeing we be members of Cstristes body / and one labor in truth
for another without deceyte / craft or falsed as members does.

6 Be angry but sin not. The Apostle would we should not be angrye at all /
but if to be it that we be angry / as we be men obiecte to the infirmities of
the flesh / he moves us to pacyfie and put away this angrye / least it
brust out in chidynges / hraulynges / contenciousnes / fyghtynges in hat
bytynge / or detraction of other / or lest by angry not pacyfyed / it bring to
words / and from words multiplied to fighting / and so to murdre as oftymes
we do se to come to pass. Therefore the Apostle would that we should pacify the
ire / and put away anger sterred up by occasion or infirmite of the flesh:
clear away from our minds / that no part of ire or wrath should remain in
heart or mind or at the least it should not remain till son set / or go
down. Therefore he says / let not the son go down upon your wrath / that
is pacyfy and put away anger and wrath as soon as ca^ be / by the help of God.
and be reconcyled in love with him / with whom you were angry / and desire of
him no vengeance but leave all vengeance to God that will punyshe al
malefactors that will not repent s. give no place to the backebyter. He
shows why we should pacify yt ire and anger of mind / least the devil seeing
ire and anger remaynge in mind or heart / should styrte up men to avenge them
felfes or move men to chydyng / brawlyng fighting and so to murdre / for the
devil does not cease / but he goes besylye about as a rampyng lion searchynge
whom he may devour and kill / he ceasseth not / but he diligently labors to
bring men to eternal death / and to death both of body and soul / therefore
pacifye ire or wrath / least yt bruste up and bring mo euyls. To be angry
some times it is lawful / as with sin and evil doers that they may resyst
from evil doing / repent and amend ye not to be anry with sin is
unlawful / and oftymes cheresheth evil doers in their noughty doing and
makes them more bold to contynewe in euilnesse / and so wynkyng at me^nes
fautes is as it were approuynge of evil doing.

7 He that has stolen / let him steal no more. He mouyth men to fle theft or
taken away other men's goods against the will of the master. Thieves be they
not only that steal / and rob openly by hye ways / or other where taken
away other men's goods / but also al they which by craft / falsed / usury /
might / power maystershyppe take away other men's goods / the masters of
these goods not knowing or else / not willing / and although all these be
not counted for thieves before the world / nor be not punyshed of the world
for thieves / yet before god they be thieves / and shall be punysshed and hanged in
hell if they do not repent and amend. There be other that be thieves before god
all they that be idle and will not labor in their calling / but take the
profit and pleasure in idylnes fyllynge their belyes / which god will punyshe
as thieves if they do not repent and amend / for they be thieves before god /
although they be counted not thieves of the world but honest men or Gods
feruantes always occupied in gods service / when god peraue^ture neither
knows them to be his servants / nor yet their service / to be his service /
to his honor and glory. Many such belly beasts has this realm found and
cherysshed / and yet does. And thieves of this sort be in every country / in
every state of men which take the profit dew to them and do not their deutye
again to them to whom they should. Therefore let every one amend / and be no
more thieves before god / that they may escape punishment due for thieves / and
the wrath of god.

8 Let every man labor in his calling that he may have to give to them that
needs. Here is showed one cause why we should labor / that we might have so
help them that have need. But he shows not how we should labor / in what
works after what facion / he wylleth every one to work in his calling
according to his gifts given him of god. Some to labor with hand / some
with mind and study or counsel or any other way occupy them selfs to the
glory of God and to the profit of their negyhbours / all such do labor.
There is some that think no man does labor but they that do occupy
ha^dycraftes or works / but these do not think well of workers / for they be
called laborers that do work to the glory of God / to the profit of other
whether it be by hand foot / tongue / mind / study / counsel / or any other
ways in their calling / for their is diverse members in the body / and to
every one is given his gift of god to the / profit of other / and to Gods
glory. wherefore me think it is not against gods law that prestes should
labor with hand / specially such as ca^ not preche gods word or if they
could preach / it is not against gods commandment to labor with hand
after the example of Paul which labored with his hands to get necessaries
for him self and for other / least he should be paynful to other / or be
slander to the gospel lest any should think be preached for lucre sake / or
for to get him a living rather then to win and bring men to Christ / and
also that he would give other example to labor and not to be idle / for these
causes and other Paul labored with his hand and did get his living for hi^
self and for other / when he might justly have taken it of them to whom he
preached / but of his gentylnes and for other causes above showed he remytted
his deutye due to him / although a priest / ye a precher of gods word may
labor with his hand and remytte his deuty dew to him / yet ye specialll
labor of priests should be to be exercised in the study of the scripture of
god / which requires al a man's labor and diligence that they may have
lernyng / whereby they may profit other and show to the people on the sabbath
day. The study of the scripture is requered of prestes. 1. Timo. 4. rather then
saying or mu^blynge up of a popyshe pair of Mattyns or Euynsonge without
edyfyeng.

9 We must labor that we may have to give to them that have need / and not
only to get necessaries for our selfs / or to get us a quiet or a pleasante
life. This place makes against them that say they would never labor if they
might get their living other ways / and against all the^ that forsake labor
and give them self to ydlenes / and will not labor when they may labor to the
glory of god and to the profit of other. For what purpose and end good works
are to be done it is showed Ephe. 2 Where the Apostle says. We are not
justified of works / least any should rejoice but by grace through faith.
There if you please you may se my mind.

Let no fylthy communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is
good to edifye with all / when need is / that it be gracious to hear / and
grieve not the holy spirit of God / wherewith ye are sealed unto the day of
redemptyon let al bitterness and fearfulnes and wrath / and roryng and cursed
speaking be far from you with all malyciousnes / but be ye courteous one to
another, merciful and forgive one another even as god has forgyuynge you in
Christ. The Apostle exhorts men to flee al unclean speaking and all fylthy
communication / and wylleth the^ to speak clenly and honest words to the
edyfyenge of other in Christ / and not to make sad the holy gooste which is
grieved at fylthy communication and unclean words / which be signs of a
fylthy and vnlceane heart / for of abundaunce of heart the tongue speaks. The
Apostle forbyddeth all fylthy communication or unclean words in all companyes
of men / as t dinner or souper or any other bankettes / and in these words he
reproves mynstrels / gesters or raylers / that use fylthy or unclean words /
songs / raylynge or gestynge to delight the ears of the heaters / with baudye
songs or rebaldry words / ye the Apostle reproves all them that have
pleasure in such unclean words or songs / in the which many have pleasure
and can not be merry without they have a gester that can make him and al gestes
merye with fylthy words / and unclean communycation / with the which great
men's rables be furnyshed / and their gestes made merye and glad at the which
great men do laughe. So the breaking of gods commandment is counted a
pastyme and a pleasure. But let all such take heed / for it will be no pastyme
at the last day / when we shall make answer for every idle word. Math. 12.
Much more we shall make answer for every noosome word / and unprofitable /
therefore let every man refrain his long from speaking of fylthy words / and
his ears from hearing of unclean commucacion / and from pleasure in the same
/ and in this point we shall not provoke God to power his vengeance upon us /
nor yet fear the reckeynynge at the last day for nosome and unclean words
/ but let our communication be to the glory of god / and to the edyfyeng of
another.

2 Fylthy communycatyon greueth the holy ghost given to us to be as surenes of
the heavenly inheritance promised to us of god. If we faithfully believe and
walk in gods commandments / according to his pleasure.

3 He exhorts men also to put away al bytternes / ire / wrath / malice /
envy / hatred / raylyng / and cursed speaking one of another and al blasphemy
against god and al other vices with the affections and concupyscence of the
flesh / and wylleth that we should put virtue in their places as ge^tylnes /
mekenes / mercifulnes and redynes one to forgive another / yt they might
opteyne of god mutual mercy and forgyuenes of their sins.

The fyfthe Chapter to the Ephesyans.
BE YE the folowers therefore of God as dear children and / walk in love even
as Christ loved us / and gave him self for us an offering and sacryfyce of a
sweet sauoure unto God. IN the end of the Chapter that goes before he
exhorts us to mutual forgyuenes by the example of god the father. Now goes
he forwards with the same exhortacion mouyng us to be folowers / not of this
world / the flesh or ye devil not of saints departed but in these things
that they were folowers of God / but that we should be folowers of God and to
follow his footsteps. This place reproves al them that will not be folowers
of god / but of them self / of their own mind will and pleasure / folowers of
the world of worldly honors and pleasures / and give them self holy to the
world and to worldely facions and manners / or will follow their sensual
pleasures of their flesh and the lusts or desires of it. This place
reproves all them that will not follow God / nor his holy word / but will follow
them selfs / there will works / there own good zeales / or intentes / or
works inverted of them self or of men / and leave the works commanded of God
undone / as many has done prefertynge pardons / pylgrimage / payntynge of
stocks or stones / above works commanded of God to be done. This place also
reproves all them that will not be folowers of God / but they will go before
god or else will be fellows or rhecinat with god. Some their is that go before
god / that prefers men before God / or men's law men's decrees traditions
/ statutes / religiousnes / ceremonies or other like ordinances invented by
man preferrynge these things above gods law / or gods commandment /
and will punysshe much more grievously the breakyng of man's law / man's
tradition / a dum ceremonye brokyng or omitted / the^ the breakyng of gods
cammaundement / all such do not follow god / but go before god. There be some
also that will go equal with god and be checkmate with him / which he they
that make man's traditions / laws or ceremonies invented of man equal with
gods law / and think them self as well bound to keep man's traditions or
ceremonies as gods law / such there has been many in religion / and I fear
there is as yet that so think / that thynk it is deadly sine to omytte any
part of man's traditions ceremonies / or customs used / this thing makes me
so to believe / because their is more punyshement for a tradition of man omytted
then for breaking of gods commandments / and more cryeng out of a man's
law broken: then for the breking of Gods law / and many that think man's
law byndeth as well the conscience / as Gods law / and all one thing to
omytte the one as the other. All such follow not god / but go cheke by cheke
with god and make man equal with god. Al such the Apostle here reproves / and
al the^ that will twyne to much on the right hand or left hand and not follow
Christ straight forth declynynge to another hand.

2 He wylleth that we should walk in love as dear beloved children / yt
behooves children to follow their father and to show their father in manners /
conditions and in all goodness / and it is a shame for the son to shrynke from
the virtue of his father / in love therefore it behooves us to follow our father
of heaven / which of his great love to us / did give his only son for us /
to bring us to everlasting salvation. And also his son Christ Jesus did
show the love of his father toward us which was obedyent to the will of his
father and wyllyngly did suffer death to deliver us from death / hell / and
eternal dampnacion / and brought life to us. And this same Christ did give
him self an oblation and a thankful sacrifice for us to the Lord / by the
which one sacrifice he reconciled us to the father and made us well beloved to
him. Here is allusio^ to the sacrifices of the old law which pacefied the
ire or wrath of god as Noe pacyfied the wrath of a god by an oblation or
sacrifyce offered up to god Gene. 8. And this sacrifice that Christ offered up
to god was a full and a suffycians sacrifice to pacyfie the wrath of God and to
take away all the sins of the world ones for ever / as saint Paul shows.

Hebre. 10. By one ablation he has made them perfyte for ever that are
sanctified. Therefore they offend that by other sacrifyces then by Christ Jesus
/ go about to pacify the wrath of god / and to take away sins as by Masses
and Scala celt / of the holy ghost / of the five wounds / of requie^ or other
like ways or means / or by any works of man to be done to swage the wrath of
god to deserve the grace of God forgyuenes of sin and life everlasting by
the virtue of the work in it self / for the which end good works are not to
be done / as I have showed before.

: As for whordome and all uncleanness or covetousness / let it not be named
amongst you, as it becomes Saints. Neither fylthynes / nor folyshe talking
/ neither jesting (which are not comely) but rather gyuynge of thanks for be
ye sure that no whore monger or unclean person or covetous person (which is a
worshypper of Images) has inheritance in the kyngedome of Christ and of
God. (Let no man deceive you with many words) for because of these comes the
wrath of god upon the children of unbelieve, be not ye therefore companyons with
the^. The Apostle shows here certain vices that christian men should flee
and eschew. As whoredom / uncleanness / and covetousness / which be vices not
to be named / much less to be done amongst christianes / that should be
saints and al holy in conversation and living. The Apostle would have both
the names of these vices and the vices them self clearly abolyshed and put
away / that no man should do them / nor yet so much as name them ones for the
vengeance of god does come upon all fornicatours / vnlcennes / and
covetousness. Example in them that perysshed in Noes floude / and at Sodom and
Gomorrhe / and of other many of the Israelytes that perysshed in the wyldernes
for these sins. Nume. 25. The punyshement of them may affraye all other from
these vices / lest they be ponyshed as these were with the plage of god.

2 He requires of us an holy conversation of life / as it becomes Saints.
1. faithful men in Christ Jesus / whom it becomes to be far from al
whoredom / fornication / auoutrye or uncleanness in word or in deed. And here
the Apostle reproves all them that has great pleasure to talk and speak
them selfs of whoredom / fornycation / baundrye / or that delyteth to here
other speak / talk or raise vnclensy and so to make the^ merry and there
gestes to laugh at fylthy and unclean words or songs / and it is greatly to
be lamented amongst christen men / that such sause displeasyng god / should
please christen me^ and that the displeasure of god / should be a laughter
amongst christyans. But these that have pleasure in fylthy communycacion and
delireth therein and will use it or suffer it to be used where they may set it /
that they be whoremongers and unclean in their hearts before God. Therefore if
they will not so be coo^ted before me^ / whoremongers or unclean / and laughers
at gods displeasure / ye and avoid the plage and punyshement of god / let
the^ leave al fylthy communication and filthy deyng / amend and do no more so /
have pleasure therein no more / suffer these vices in no other / reprove them /
study to amend your self and other / that you may avoid the plage of god
for these vices.

3 The Apostle would christianes should avoid al uncomely behauer both in word
and in gesture that none should be prouo / ked to unclean doings by unclean
words or gestures by the which he reprouith many unclean songs / lovers
songs called / that sound and provoke to unclean love or fylthy pleasure of
the body he reproves also uncomely daunces used of women / and al there
indissolute gestures that becommyth not. He reproves all folysshe speaking /
idle talking / and feigned fables of the which commyth no profit / nor
edifyeng to ye auditors. Also he reproves all knavery in all scolding all
raylynge / al uncomely gestynge and al uncomely behauoure / that be not to the
glory of god / nor yet to the edyfyenge of the hearers nor to help to amend
evil doers and make them better to seek gods glory / and the profit of
other.

4 He dissuadeth christians from whoredom uncleanness / covetousness / and frome^
al vice that follow of these / if not for love of god / yet for fear of
punyshementes that follow these vices / that they should abstain from them /
He says that no whoremonger / no fornicatours no unclean persons / no
covetous men shall have the kingdom of heaven. This pain thretened which
without doubt will fall upon the^ if they do not amend this pain showed how
great sins before god be fornicacion / whoredom uncleanness / covetousness
uncomely raylynge or gestynge for the which sins men be excluded from the
kyngedume of Christ and of god / they must needs be great sins / that shit
out from the kingdom of heaven / how some ever they be esteemed of men in the
world / great or small.

5 The covetous man is called a worshypper of Images or Idolles / for as the
ydolater do whorshyppe ydolles for God / and put hope and trust in ydoles so
does the couetousma^ worship riches for his God / making more of riches / then
of God loving riches better then god / setting his heart and mind more upon
riches then upon god / putting trust and confidence in riches more then in
the prouydence of of god / extollyng him self above other by reason of his
riches / substance / or goods he has above other.

6 After that he had monyshed them to flee vices / he byddeth them beware that
they be not deceived by vain words / of the which it aperethe that there was
amongst the Ephesya^s some me^ of corrupt minds and judgments blinded with
sin and obdurated in the same. As perauenture some desperate noughtye fellows
be among us) that thought whoredom / fornycation / adultery / filthy
speaking and uncomely raylynge / uncomely gesture covetousness / to be no sins
/ nor no displeasure to god / but fornication or lechery to be man head or
propre to man / fylthy raylynge or gestyng to be good pastyme / and that God
would not be greatly displeased with such lytyl fautes / so they did extenuat
and make little or no fautes these crimes and sins that God called great
fautes and obomynable sins before him / and so cared nothing for gods
inhibition of these sins / but played it away / laughing / mocking and
scornynge at gods commandment / that no man should do so / or think
fornication adulterye whoredom / couytousnes / to be no sins before god but
to know them for great sins for the which God threateneth so greuouse
punyshemente as expulsion from heaven and that none should think these vices
/ to be no sin before God. The Apostle says that the vengeance of god to
come for fornication adulterye / whoredom / covetousness / and such like vices
above rehearsed / he threateneth pain and punishment that none should have
pleasure any more in the^ / that none should commyt them for fear of
punyshement / and that none should commyt these sins / and think to escape
unpunished / or that God will wynke at these fautes and suffer them
unpunished. And not only the vengeance of god will com upon all them that
commyt these fautes and vices / but also upon all them / that do consent or
approve them any ways / for lucre vantage / profit / pleasure / or for fear
of man / or that do know them to be used / and will not correct and reprove /
and study to amend them that in these damnable sins offend god / and
punyshemente upon these sinners and conse^ters to them for doers and consenters
are worthy like pain. Roma. 1.

7 Let us learn here for what things comes the wrath of god upon
disobedient children. Not for eggs eating upon the friday / for eating of
flesh upon same Laurence even / for breakyng of Thomas Beckectes day in
Christenmasse / not for eating white meat in lent / but for fornication
adulterye / whoredom / uncleanness / covetousness fylthy speaking / and folyshe
speaking which often times be cause of noughtye manners / for by evil
speaking the good is corrupted and made evil by evil company or communication
of evil.

For some time ye were darkness / but now are ye light in the Lord, walk as
the Children of light, for the fruit of the spirit is all manner of goodness and
ryghtuousnes and truth, and prove what is pleasynge unto the Lord / and have
no felowshyppe with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather rebuke them,
for it is shame even to name those things, which are done of the^ in secret.
But all things are manyfeste, when they are rebuked of the light, for what
soever is manifest, that same is light. Therefore says he. Awake thou that
slepest and stand up from the dead and Christ shall give the light. Of the
vocation of men / now he exhorts them to holiness of life / saying you were
some time darkness / now you belyght in the lord / and delivered from
darkness and from sin. Walk therefore as it becomes children of light to
walk in all goodness / justice / equite / and truth / which be fruits of the
spirit of god / the Apostle wills always that we should have before our eyes /
what we were / and what we are our self without the grace of God / that we
are darkness of the which no light does come but by the grace of God / we be
made light in the Lord and not by our own merytes or deservings that we
should bring furthe works of light to the glory of god / and to the profit
of other. Math. 5.

2. He shows how we should walk as children of light / that is to bring
forth fruits of the spirit / in all goodness / justice and truth / seeking
always these things that may please god / having no company with works of
darkness / but reprouyng them and the doers of evil that they may repent and
amend.

3 He shows that he is ashamed to tell all there fautes that they secretly do
thinking the^ to be no sin / but after ward they be examined by the light
/ they be known to be sin / and these that has done them are ashamed and
repent and study to refourme and amend themselfes.

4 He moves men to arise from sleep and from sin and from deadly works by
repentance and amendment of life and he promyseth that God will be merciful
to all penytente persons and that will amend their life and live a new life.

Take heed therefore how you walk circumspectely / not as the unwise / but as
the wise / and redeem the time / for it is a miserable time / wherefore be not
ye unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is. The Apostle monisheth
me^ to take heed with whom hey walk / with whom they use company or be
conuersaunt / and that the walk circumspectely not as unwise men, but as
wysemen / and as it becomes wise men to do / if they will reprove men / look
that they reprove things worthy to be reproved / and that in time and place /
as becomes wysemen to do / and as for there works / look they be such as
please God / not of man's invention / but ordinated of god for us to walk in.

2 Redemyng the time / that is watchi^g all oportunite of time to do good / to
reprove sin in time and place convenient / or else amendynge time paste /
evil spente in idleness / in will works omyttynge gods works / or in sins
and pleasures of the flesh or in other evil works to the which moves /
the world / the flesh / and the noughtye time / which moves men to evil.

3 For the days be evil / the days be called evil / because of the malice of
man which is done upon days / for the days are good for they are the
creatures of god / and so are good.

4 Therefore be not unwise / but understand what the will of the lord is. They
are unwise that do not seek time and place to speak well and to do good / that
seek more the glory of man then of God / that desire to know the will of man
more the^ of god. This place shows many to be foles that think them self
wise men / that be more diligent to know the law of man then of God / that be
well learned in man's law / and ignorant in gods law / that be wysemen in
man's law / and ideote fools in gods law. This place reproves all them
that be very diligente in the study and knowledge of man's law to know the
will of man and how they should come to riches and goods in the world / but
to know the will of god / and his law they be nothing diligent / ye nor
desirous of yt / it is well if they be not adversaries to Gods word / but
all such show them selves what they be / perauenture wise men to the world
but fools before god / men that love more this present life the^ the life to
come. This place should move al lawyers and judges to be delige^t to know
gods law / least in there judgments they do judge other ways then gods
law will / by the which al man's law should be ruled / and if gods law
should be the rule of man's law (as it is in deed) how shall they rule well
man's law that be ignorance in Gods law. Surely after my mind there is
nothing more to the hynderaunce of Gods word or more to the destructyon of
men souls in this realm the^ that the nobilite and lawers and other that have
rule over the people both in the spiritualtye and in the temporalty be
ignoraunte in gods law / in the which it becomes the^ most cheifely to be
learned / that they might order all causes and matters according to Gods law
/ geltylmen and a great part of lawyers be ignorant in Gods law. And
therefore seldom they do love gods word / or the true teachers of yt / and
the lay people follow the gentylmen or rulers. As touching the spyrytualtye
under the Bishops / rulers be lawyers brought up in the Bishop of Romes law
and for the most part such men that be ignorant in gods word be
Chauncellours / Comysaries / Officials / which oftymes do hate Gods word and
the true preachers of it / and favors as much as they darre the bishop of
Romes laws and his ways. It is a very seldom thing to have a lawyer a
Chancellor / a Commyssary / a Preacher of Gods word / a setter forth of it
/ how by the^ that be ignoraunte it has been hyndered and let we have
experience enoughe. I pray God that all Bishops with all there officers under
them may be true favorers of gods word / and ernestly set forwards and
move and exhort al men to gods word and to live after yt that God may more
and more be glorified of al men. Amen.

: AND be not dronken with wine wherein is excess, but be full of the spyryte /
and talk among your selfs of Psalms and Himnes and spyrytuall songs /
singing and making melodye unto the Lord in your hearts / gyuynge thanks
always / for all things / unto God the father in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ submyttynge your selfs one to another in the fear of god. The Apostle
here forbids dronke^nes as a cause of fornication or adultry / he monysheth
to ware of drinkyng wine which provoke to adultery or fornication. In these
words he forbyddeth also al excess and riot in eating and drynkyng or other
bankettynge of the which comes many incoueniences and great diseases both
to the body and soul / of unreasonable drinking or riotynge we se daily
great syckenes to come to the body / as the gout / dropsy / palsy / and
other diseases many of the body. Also dronkennes / adultry / fornication /
chiding / fyghtyng man slaughter does come of great drynkyn-whiche be
destructyon and death of the soul. The Apostle here not only forbyddeth
sin and vice / but also he forbyddeth the occasion and causes of them.

2 Dronkennes ought to be eschewed for many causes that comes of it / that
brings men to death oftymes both of the body and of the soul it depriueth
men of wit wisdom and reason and makes them worse then a brute beast / ye
then aswyne that walters over and over in the mire. Drokennes it causes many
deseases in the body / it brings with it idelnes chiding / braulynge /
fyghtyng / murder / ye what myscheife does it not bring with it / death both to
body and soul. It is therefore to be aborred of all men.

3 He not only reproves vice but he shows virtue to be taken in the place
of vice / as here he reproves dronkennes / and wylleth me not be fulfilled
with the holy ghost and to sing in their hertes spiritual Psalms and Hymns
/ gyuyng thanks to god always for his benefytes / these spiritual Psalms
and Hymns he sets for the fruytes of dronkennes. And in this me think the
Apostle wills that lay men and lay women should sing spyritual Pslames and
Hymns as priests and spiritual men / and give thanks to god for all his
benefits given to the^ and and in this he shows plainly that it is lawefull
for lay men and lay women to read the holy scriptures / to have them by
heart / that they may talk of them / speak of them to their edyfieng / and
sing spyrituall Psalms and Hymns gyuynge thanks to the Lord / how should
they sing spiritual Psalms and Hympnes except that they knew them before /
and had read them or learned them. This place evidently shows that it is
lawful for laymen and lay women to read the scriptures of god / to talk of
them to gods glory and to their edyfienge. The Apostle does not hear
speak only to mynysters in the Church / but to all men / to whom he
forbyddeth dronkennes and hes fruits / and for them the holy gooste and his
fruytes to be received with spiritual thanks Psalms and Hymns gloryfyenge
god always.

4. He wylleth that every man shall be obedient one to another in his state and
degree and that in the fear of God / that none should contemn another
thynkyng him self better then other / but every one humyle him under other /
and think him self worse in his own sight / and in this he reproves proud
hearts and stomakes and moves every one to mekenes and lowlynes in them self.

Let the women submytte them selfs unto their husbands as unto the Lord /
for the husband is the wives head, even as Christ also is the head of the
congregation / and he is the sauyoure of his body. Therefore as the
congregation is in subjection to Christ / likewise let the wives be in
subieccion to they husbands in all things. Before the Apostle has
universally taught every man. Now he comes to particular persons as to the
wife and the husband he shows there duetye on to ye other. But before I will
show of their duties. I think it expedient some thing so entreat of
matrymonye by the which the man and the wife be joined together and the one
bound to the other by the law of god / and that with such knottes as ca^ not
be lowsed with out the breaking of gods law and displeasure of god / except
it be for such causes as by the scriptures may lowse the bound of matrymony /
as adultery which be a cause of deuource / as says Christ. Math. 5. First
it is to be showed for what causes Matrimony was i^stituted and ordinated of
god. One cause was that mankind should be multiplied to the honor and glory
of god by a lawefull means between man and woman / these mean was by matrimony
ordinated of god / as appears. Gene. 1. where it is written / that after god
made man to his symylitude / he created ye male and the female and blessed them
and said / grow and be multiplied and fill the earth / and this was one of
the chief causes of matrymonye. Another cause wsa to avoid adulterye and
fornication / and that matrymonye should be a lawefull remedy against
adultery forbodden in the general commandment Thou shalt not commit
aduoutry. Exo. 20 This cause saint Paul shows. 1. Corin 7. Saying let every
man have his wife to avoid fornication / and every woman have her husband.
Aduoutery of the heart is as well forbodde^ / as adultery in outward deed or
act / to avoid all manner of adultery both of the heart and of outward act /
and for a remedy lawful for the same it is commanded that they shall marye
and take a wife / that have not the gift of chastyte and of continence. The
third cause of matrimony is the charity might more be enlarged and among
strangers more dilated and scatered / and that these that were strangers
should be more couple together by charity / as the friends of the wife and the
husband by affinite more joined together in love and charity / and for that
cause it does appear that certain degrees of kindred was forbodden to mary
together amongst whom was love all ready opteyned and commandment that
marriage should be out of certain degrees of kynne / to make more love and to
dylate charity as appears. Leut. 18. and.10. And also this thing appears in
that / that there is more love commanded to be between the man and the wife /
then between the children and the father. As it is written. Gene. 2. and Nume.
18. For this (says god) let the man forsake his father and mother / and
cleave to his wife / and they shall be two in one flesh To these may be added
many other causes of matrymony / that the wife should be as an helper to the
husband / and the husband to the wife / that they should lobour together to
provide necessaries for them / and their household / to bring up their
children virtuously in love and dread of god / and in other wholesome doctrene
or craft for these and diverse other causes that may be gathered of scriptures
was Matrymony ordinated of god / and not of man. Therefore he that speaks
against Matrymony / or condemns it as an evil thing / he speaks against
gods ordinance / and condemns that / that God him self ordynated.

2 Now I will speak sumthinge of the duty between the man and the wife /
whose duties Sayncte Paul here declares. First the duty of the wife
toward her husband he shows. He says it is the deutye of the wife to be
obedient to her husband in all lawful and honest things / and to be ready and
diligent at his lawful commandment / and in no wise disobedient to him and
his lawful commandments / neither in word nor yet in deed / nor in any
behauour / neither in mind nor thought disobedient to her husband. And here
he ryproueth all women that be disobedient to their husbands / and will not
obey the^ but will have their husbands obediente to them / either for the
nobylyte of their stock they come of / or else for their riches or for proudnes
of heart and mind that they will (...) the rule and domynyon over their
husbands / contrary to gods ordinance ^^d here peradventure some (...) ask
/ why should the woman (...) obedient to the man / then the man (...)? To this
I make answer and say that the wife should be obedient to her husband for
many causes / and not the husband to the wife. The first and chief cause is /
for the ordinance of god which has ordinated that the wife should be
obedye^t to her husband in all things lawefull. Ephesians. 5. And they that resyst
the ordinance of God / they bring judgment to them self. Roma. 13. Wherefore
it is no little taut the wife to be disobedient to her husband us to desire the
rule / domynio^ / or maistery over her husband / although her husband would
suffer it / for she that so does / she does resyste the ordinance of god / and
takes to her self dampnation. Therefore let women beware they be not
disobedient to their husbands / nor desire to be master over them / for in so
doyenge they bring judgment and damnation to them self / although that fault
is counted but a little fault / before men / yet before god it is a great fault
and it must needs be a great fault / for the which judgment and damnation
does follow. The second cause why that women should be obeidiente to men / is
for the transgressyon of Eve / which was punyshed and al her posteryte after
her / that is to say all women / that they should be in subjection to men and
the wife in obedience to the husband / for Eues thransgression / which pain
remains still in women and shall do for ever / in a sign of Eues
transgressyon as a pain for sin.

The third cause is / for the infyrmite of women / which for the most part
be not so wise / wyttye / constante / sobre / dyscrete / patient / sad / well
reasoned / strong in body and for other such like infirmities of women /
which be foolyshe / light / unconstant / hasty / angry / babbling / full or
words light / of conditions / mutable / unlearned and other such like
infirmities which for the most part be more in women then in men. Therefore it
becomes the women to be obedient to men and be ruled by me^ / as of more
wit wisdom learning / judgment / sadness sobernes / and other good
qualities / which for the most part be more in men then i^ weme^ / for
these and other causes it becomes the wife to be obedient to her husband /
and for a decente order to be had amongst men.

3 He shows how the wife should be obediente to her husband / even as to
the lord for the wyfes serving their husbands in all hearty obedience with
reverence / do serve the lord god / and do gods service / gods
commandment / and they please god so doing / and no service of the wife to
god ca^ please god better / then when she obeyth her husband lowely in heart /
will mind / word and in deed / in all lawful things. Therefore let the wife
be obedyent to her husband not only in outward things / but also in all
inward things as in will / in mind / in heart / in thought and without al
murmr / show her willing and glad obedience to her husband / as the will
and commandment of god is.

4 For the man is the head of the woman. Here he shows a cause why the woman
should obey the man / for the man is the head of the woman / it becomes
every one to be obedient to his head / seeing the man is the head of the woman
/ it becomes the woman to be obedient to the man as to her head / the man is
called the head of the woman / for as out of the head does come all necessary
things to feade and cherysshe other parts of the body whereby they live / so
it perteyneth to the man to provide all necessaryes for the woman that show
may live / the head has not rule over the other parts that it should use
any tyranny or cruelnes over the other protes. So the man is the head over the
woman / not that he should use tyranny or cruelnes over the woman or use the
woman as they list / other ways then becomes or after an ungodly facyon or
manner / but that he should provide all necessaries for the woman / defend her
/ keep her / and save her.

5 As the congregation is in subiectyon to Christ / likewise le the wives be
in subjection to their husbands in all things. The wives must be obedient to
their husbands as the congregation is to Christ The congregation only cleave
to Christ and to none other / only loves Christ / hears Christ and
seruyth Christ / and studyeth to please Chrise. So must the wife only cleave
to her husband / be obedyent to her husband / serve her husband please her
husband / and keep her self to her husband and to no mo. This place
reproves all those that be disobedient / to their husbands / do not serve
their husbands wyllyngely and gladly / do not love their husbands / but other
better then them / or as well as them / that be complayners of their husbands
/ nor keep them only to their husbands / but will have other besides their
husbands. All such the Apostle here reproves and wills they should amend.

Ye husbands love your wives / even as Christ loved the congregation / and
gave him self for yt / to sanctyfye it, and cleansed it in the fontayne of
water by the word to make it unto him self a gloryeous congregation, having no
spot nor wrynkle, nor any such thing but that it should be holy, and without
blame.: Now he shows the duetye of the husband to his wife / whose deuty is
not to hapte to contemn or despise his wife / but to love her as his own
flesh and as his self to make of her / and cheryshe her / keep her honestly
and se that she want no thing necessary. The Apostle prescribes a faction or
a form how the man should love his wife / even as Christ has loved his
Church / for the which wyllyngely he did dye / that he might pourge / make
clean / and sanctyfie it to him self / and make it a glorious and an holy
Church / without all spot or wrykle / and without all fault or blame. So ought
the man to love his wife even as him self / and so with love to embrase her
that he would gladly dye / if necessite so should constrayne him for her sake
rather then he would suffer her to peryshe / he would put his life in all
ieoperdie and peril. And if he shall at any tyume perceive his wife wrynkled /
spotted / or with any vices poluted with syckenes diseases or any other ways
troubled with vice / sin / or syckenes. That then he should not set at little
or contemn his wife / seek to be ryd of her / and dyuorsed from her / but he
should then seek all ways and means for remedy for her / if she be diseased
with syckenesse / se that she lack nothing necessary for her / that hs is
able either by labor or goods to get for her. Provide remedies that may be
gotten by man's help / conforte her in words and deeds / and say she shall
lack nothing that may do her good as long as you have one penny / or may get
by your labor / if she be aged / wrinkled or not fair / she is not to be
despised for her age wrinckle or foulnes / but to be made of and cherysshed /
because she is your wife given to you of God / to be loved eue^ as you do love
your own body / be she young or aged / wrynkled for vnwrynkled / fair or
full / good or badde. No man despises his own body / be yt never So desformed
/ aged / wrynkled / foul / fat / wayke syckly or any other ways deseased so
man may not dispyse his wife for her infirmities or diseases / but study to
remedy them if it be possible. if thy wife be evil / evil tonged / spotted
with sin and noughty living other ways then gods law will / it is the
deutye of the husband to correct refourme and amend his wife by always and
means that is possible / and not to conte^ne her for her noughtines / to
forsake her and leave her and take another / to vpbrad her of her noughtines to
blase abroad her sins and vices / to her and his rebuke and shame / but to
cover and hyde her sins and fautes as much as shall lie in him / to study
how and by what means he may amend her and make of on evil woman a good
woman / which thing may be by gentle exhortation / counsel and dissuasion
from sin if not for love of god / yet for shame rebuke and confusion of the
world / for fear of punyshemente of God either in this world or at least in
the world to come / or else in both So it is the office of the husband if he
have an evil wife / to study by his wisdom to make her good / to correct
her fautes to remedy them / and to make her holy and virtuous as Christ
pourgeth his church spotted and polluted with sin, and made it holy and
fautles in his sight 2 Here is showed how Christ has purged his Church /
truly in the fountain of water by his word / although God of his mere mercy
and goodness / without al man's deserts or merits / only for Christ's sake
has washed and pourged man from sin / yet he uses a mean by the which
he cleanses men from sine which is by baptyme in water by the word of god /
and so in baptyme is our sins take away / and we from sins purged /
cleansed and regenerated in a new man / to live an holy life according to the
spirit and will of god / it is not ye water that wasshe us from out sins /
but Christ by his word and his spirit given to us in baptyme that washes
away our sins that we have of Adam by carnal nature.

3 In that the Apostle says that Christ has cleanses his Church in the
fountain of water by the word / he shows plainly that baptyme is a mean
whereby Christ takes away origynall sin and makes al them that be baptized
in the name of the father / the son / and the holy ghost / according to
christ's institution. Math. 28. to be cleansed from al sin of Adam and if
they be of age or they be baptized through faith in the promise of God by his
word taking upon them baptyme as was many in the Apostles time / at the
preaching of the Apostles were converted from their sins believed in Christ
and were christened / and so delivered from their sins and were saved.

This place of sante Paul makes against the Anabaptystes that would not have
children to be christened / which is a deuyllysshe and a damnable heresye
worthy great punyshement. if we ve christen men our office is to bring every
man as much as in us is to Christ / and that sinners may be cleansed from their
sin and be saved. Children be borne in sin and shall be damned if they be
not cleansed from their sin / although god do pourge us from sin only /
yet he uses means whereby he takes and wassheth away our sins that means
says saint Paul here is by the fountain of water in the word of God / by
the which means Christ purges his Church and his Congregation. Children are
of the Church or Congregation of God. Wherefore children must needs be
christened / or else they are not purged of their sins / nor shall not be
saved without baptyme / which is the mean to purge and wasshe them from
their sins. And therefore baptyme is counted of saint Paul to Tyt. 3. the
fountain of regeneration and renuynge of the holy ghost which god has
powered upon us abundantly by Jesus Christ our savior. This saying of saint
Paul proves that children of necessytie must be christened or else they can
not be pourged of their sins / nor yet saved by Christ and come to life
everlasting. Wherefore the Anabaptists that would not have children to be
christened / they show them selfs that they would not have children to be
purged from their sin and be saved / if they would have children saved / they
would not deny to them the means whereby Christ purges his Church from
sins and saves it / which is by baptyme as here appears.

Secondly / yt may be prouid by many places of the holy scripture that children
must needs be chrystened / or else they can not be saved / except god of this
absolute power do save them. Besides these places of Paul all ready brought
which has euydentely proved that children must needs be christened / it also
proves sayncte Johan. 3. saying. Except a man be borne again of the holy
ghost and of water / he can not enter into the kingdom of heaven. To be borne
again of the holy ghost and of water / it is to be christened / as Paul
shows to Titu^. 3. where as baptyme is called the fountain of regeneration
and of renuyng of the holy ghost. Chryldren therefore must be christened / if
they shall enter in to the kyngedome of heaven / and be partakers of life
celestial. The third reason to prove this same thing as there was none saved
in the time of Noes flode / that was out of the ship of Noe / but only those
that w^^ within the ship / so in our time none is sauyd with out baptyme / this
symilitude uses S. Peter. 1. Pe. 3. Therefore children if they shall be sauyd
must be baptized.

The fourth reason / what was the sea and the cloud to the israelites when
Moses was their captain and passed through the read see / the same thing
to us now is baptyme / as says Paul. 1. Corin. 10. these was a figure of
our baptysme / but none of the isriaelites was saved that did not goo through
the read se and entered the cloud with Moses / so shall none be saved now
that have not ben christened / it pertayneth therefore to the salvation of
children that they shall be christened.

The fyfte reason he that has not the spirit of god he is not of god / nor of
Christ Roman^. 3. Children have the spirit of Christ / if they be of Christ
and shall be saved / the spirit of Christ / and Christ him self they receive
by baptyme / wytnessing saint Paul. Gala. 3. where he sayethe. Who soever are
chrystened they have put on Christ first he says ye that are christened /
and then ye have put on Christ so that christening goes before the putting on
of Christ / children therefore before they receive Christ they must be
christened.

The syxt reason. They that will not be obedient to the ordinance of God shall be
damned. Roma. 13. Christ has ordinated that all people and reasonable
creatures shall be christened. Math. 28. Marc. 16 children are people and
reasonable creatures. Wherefore it follows that children must be christened or
else they shall be damned i^ hell for evermore. But that children shall not
damned / it appears. Mat 19. where Christ reproves his disciples that would
not suffer children to come to him / where he says to his dysciples / let not
these children to come to me / he took these children in his arms and laid
his hand upon their heads and blessed the^ and said / of such is the
kyngedome of god. Here is tokens that god loved these children / that they
please him / and that they had faith / for with out faith no man can please
god. Hebru. 11.

The seventh reason. Circumcision in the old law as a necessary ordinance with
out ye which no man masculine was saved Gene. 17. baptyme for us in the new
law is counted in the stead of circumcision / and as no man child was saved
without circumcision / so none amongst us shall be saved without baptyme.
Children therefore must of necessity be christened / that baptysme to us in the
law is in the stead of circumcision / it appears in many places of
scripture / as Philippe^. 3. where S. Paul says: that we are circumcision /
which worship god in the sprete. This circumcision is that outward sign /
whereby we show our selves to all the world that we be servants of god /
and that we will serve none other but god and Christ Jesus / whose bag and
name we have / and promised in baptysme only to serve him.

The eight reason. No man can be partaker of Christ resurreccion / ascension /
and glory / except he dye with Christ and be buried with him / and rise with
Christ. We can not dye with Christ / except we be first christened in Christ /
as says Saint Paul. Roma. 6. Do you not know that all we that are christened
in Christ Jesus / that in his death we are christened / buried with Christ
by baptysme in to death / that we might arise with Christ / and be partakers of
his glory. Mark the order of Saint Paul / and then se how it follows
consequently / that we must be christened of necessity / if we will be
partakers of his glory and kingdom.

The nynth reason. The Apostles christened hole householdes / as Paul
christened Lydia^ a seller of purple and her hole householde. Actu. 18. He
christened Chripum an hye ruler of the Synagoge / with his hole householde.
Actu. 19. and Stephe householde. 1. Cor. 1. It is very like that among these
hole householdes he christened children / seeing children be of the
householdes. The Apostles with all inwardes instructions and outward signs did
bring men to Christ / as much as lay in them / and would that every man
should know them that were the servants of God / and that servants should
be made certain / that they were the servants of Christ by some outward
token which was by baptysme. And therefore the Apostles baptized all them that
would become the servants of Christ / and believe in Christ / and take
Christ for their Lord and Master / whose outward bag was baptysme / as
appears by Saint Paul. Ephe. 4. where he moves men to unity by reason of
baptysme / saying: One god / one faith / one baptyme / one Lord god and father
of all that works all in all.

The tenth reason. The troth of gods words / and the true use of them has been always in his church / and in the congregation of god / that children
should be christened has ever ben used in Christ's church sense Christ's time
/ till these Anabaptists did come / wherefore these Anabaptists denyenge
baptysme to children / greatly are to be blamed / seeing there be so many
scriptures that proves euydentely that children must be christened / as I have
here showed by some scripture / and (...) places may be brought for the
purpose to prove the baptyme of children.

Now I will bring in the reasons of the Anabaptists / that they bring for
their purpose / and show how weak and slender reasons they be / and how
far disagreynge from the scriptures / that no man should be over come and
brought i^ an error or heresy by such reasons / that be of no weghtynes and
without scripture / ye contrary to holy scripture. They say that these that
shall be christened must first believe / and then be christened. Children they
say can not believe / for faith is gotten by hearing / and hearing by the
word of god. So children can not have faith / says these Anabaptists /
wherefore they say that children should not be christened. To this reason I
answer and say / that children may have faith / although they have it not
by hearing / yet they have faith by infusion of the holy ghost as the holy
prophets had / and many holy men in the old law had. Also says is the
gift of God and the work of the holy ghost. Who should let God to give his
gifts where he will / seeing faith is the gift of God. Ephe. 2. Philip. 1. He
may give faith as well to children as to old men. Faith also is the work of
God. Ihon. 6. and not of man of man's will or reason. Who shall let god to
work where he ^yst / therefore it is not impossible for children to have faith
as these anabaptists falsely suppose. Also god regards no persons / but
gives his gifts without all regard of perosonnes / to be a child or old
man be counted as persons in scriptures / wherefore it follows plainly that
god gives not faith to an old man / or denies faith to a child / because he
is a child / for then god should regard perso^nes / which he does not. And
where they say that they must express their faith before they be christened
what will they do with deie and do^me me^ that get not faith by hearing? nor
ca^ not express their faith by words? will they exclude the^ from baptysme /
and condemn the^ to hell pyt? And also su^ aged peradventure will disse^ble and
say they have faith / when they have not faith / and if they will christen none
without they be certain of there faith / then shall they chryste^ none / neither
young nor old / seeing that old may disse^ble / and say they have faith
when they have not faith. And where they say there is no example in scripture
by expressed words that children should be christenned. To this I answer that
it is enough that it may be justly gathered of the holy scriptures truly
understood / as of the scriptures I have showed before / and of many mo / as
of that the Apostles christened hole housoldes that they chrystened some
children I suppose the Scripture does not bring forth example of children
chrystened / not because there was no children chrystened of the Apostles / but
because the scripture does not much speak of women nor of children but
understand them in the man For I suppose there was many mo women christened of
the Apostles then is mention made of in the scripture. Women and children are
understand in men of the masculyne ki^de / as Roma. 5. He says si^ne came
upon all men by Adam / and by christ were all men justified / that is all men /
all women al children / were dead by the sin of Adam / And all men / all
women / all children made ryghtuous and justified by Christ although it is
spoken after the Greek tongue in the masculyne gender and no mention made of the
femynyne gender / nor of children / but they be both understand in the
masculyne gender / even as well as mention were made of them both / and women
/ and children be as well redeemed by Christ and washed from sins by Christ as
me^ So I think that scripture does not speak of children / when it commands
baptyme but includes all men of the masculyne gendre al women / and children
to be christened / when it commands that al creatures should be christened /
children are to be counted amongst creatures / and people of God. These
things I have spoken as touching the baptyme of young children / whose
baptyme the scriptures does approve and allow and codempneth the deuyllyshe
and erroneous opinion of the Anabaptists which be fallen into an error and
an heresy / and has brought other to their error be reasons of no strength
nor weight / folyshe and contrary to the scripture / which at the first has
peradventure seemed apparentet to the ignoraunte in the Scripture / but to them
that be learned in the scripture they be of no pythe nor effect nor prove the
thing they go about / therefore let every man bewarre of these Anabaptists and
flee their errors / heresies / and deceyuable doctrine / that bri^geth to
death and receive the true doctrine of Christ that bri^geth to life. Now I will
return again to saint Paul.

: So ought men also to love thyre wives, even as their own bodies he that
loves his wife, loves him self. For no man yet ever hated his own flesh,
but norissheth and cherisseth it even as the Lord does also the Congregation,
for we are members of his body / of his flesh, and of his bones.: The
Apostles here shows how the man should love his wife eue^ as his own body /
for the man and the wife be one body coupled together by matrymony a knot not
to be lowsed at man's pleasure / who has ever ben so mad / of so little with
that has hated his own body / were it never so deforme or out of facyon / so
wayke / so lene / so syckely / so fylthy / and so full of noughtynes / but has
ever cherished and norished his own body and hyd the fautes of it / and ready
to amend it / so should a man be affected toward his wife / as toward his
own body / ye even as Christ has loved his Church / which has not put
it away when it was a brodel and polluted with fylthynes and sins / but has
taken it to him and has purged it and made it clean holy and gay / and has
dissembled many things in it / and at the last healed all her sores and
diseases and washed clear away her spots and sins. After the example of
Christ toward his church let the husband do to the wife / and ever have
before his eyes what thing he would should be done to hes own body / and the
same thing let him do to his wife. This place reproves those husbands that
love not their wifes / that conte^ne and despise their wyfes / when they are
sick / not prouyding for them necessaries / not comfortynge the^ with all
comfort they can / ye this place checketh all them that will not cover and hyde
the fautes of their wives if they be no table crimes and do not study to
refourme and amend their wives / and to make them good / virtuous and holy.

2 For we are members of one body / he shows why he called the wife the
flesh of the man / it was because the woman was made of the man / of a rybbe
taken out of the side of Adam / and the womannes bone was made of a bone of
Adam as it is written. Gene. 2. to the which place saint Paul does allude
here. For this cause that the man should not conte^ne the woman as a creature
made of a vyler matter then he was of and to certify the man that he should
not contemn his wife except he should contemn him self and his own flesh
this thing he shows that there should be more love between the man and the
wife / no strife / no contention / no debate / no contemnynge one another.

: For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and cleave unto his wife,
and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great secret, I speak of
Christ and the Congregacyon. Nevertheless do ye so, that every one of you
love hes wife / even as him self / but let the wife fear her husband. Here
the Apostle wylleth that there should be more love between the husband and the
wife / then between the children and the parents he wylleth the son shall
prefer the love to his wife above the love to father or mother.

2 The Apostle speaks here only of the love that should be between the man
and the wife / of the other deuties of the man to the wife it is spoken in
other place of scripture / as Peter. 1. Pe. 3. shows that it is the office of
the man to dwell with his wife / to entreat her after knowledge and to live
together as perpetual fellows of good and evil / for all their life time / in
peace / concord / unite / love / and dew obedience according to gods law
/ prouydynge together necessaryes / that they might live holyly and godly and
bring up their children virtuously in the knowledge of god in love and fear
of god / to order and rule their famylye according to gods will gyuynge them
example of al goodness to follow. Peter adds after knowledge / that is that
the man should order his wife after knowledge and wisdom which be more in
men then in women / for men must bear the infirmity of women / and many
things to pardone i^ them and over se and wynke at / and dyssemble as they had
not known or else there shall be little agremente between the man and the wife
/ and some time to exhort gentylly / to rebuke sharply and some time clearly
to remyt the matter as he for his wisdom shall se mo he expedient to entreat
her always endeuerynge him to make his wife gentle / lowly / obedient / loving
/ honest / good / holy / and virtuous. In man it is to supply that lacks in
women / to have more wit / wisdom / reason / prudence / counsel / lernyng
ways to provide necessaries for their lyuynges / and to order every thing
well. Also it pertayneth to men says Peter there / to give to weme^ deu
honor / that is that the man should not contemn or despyce his wife / or use
her as his hand maid or servant / but to take her as fellow of his
perpetual life and as ioynte heirs of God. This place of Peter reproves those
men that conte^ne and despise there wyfes / will not use their company at bed
or at board and other conversation of living / but leave the^ forsake them /
put them away from them / Also if reproves all them that use their wife as
their hand maid or servant / that use much chiding or brawling or
fighting with their wives / or use do bounch beat read under their foot their
wives as dogs or swyne / or any other ungodly ways do entreat are their
wyfes / they be reproved of the Apostle. Therefore let all such froward
husbands amend least the plage of god fall on the^ for their ungodly
entreatinge of their wives / who^ they should know to be fellows with the^ and
boughte with the precious blood of Christ / and called to be partakers of the
heavenly kyngedome asswell as they that be men. Finally it is the office of
husbands to use the company of their wives and to pay deuty as saint Paul
calls it. 1. Corin. 7. saying. Let the man give deuty to his wife for the man
has not power of his body / but the wife / likewise the wife has not power
of her body / but the husband / Sayncte Paul reproves all these married men /
that do not their deutye to their wyfes / but will take hoores / harlottes /
and drabbes / and keep besides their wives / but let all such aduiterers take heed / for the sword of the vengeance of god hangs over their heads / and
god will smite peradventure sooner then they suppose or believe.

3 This is a great secret or mystery as he should say this thing that I have
here spoken of / is a great mystery / and more the^ can be showed / by words /
that is that the love of Christ toward his Church can no tongue express / ne
heart think it / it passes far al eloquence of tongue or thought or man's
heart / even so should the love between man and wife be more then any tongue by
eloquence were able to express.

4 The Apostle to make an end of the deuties between the man and the wife / he
says it is the deutye of the wife to be obedient to her husband / to fear
him / to have him in honor and reverence / and esteem him as her lord and
master / as Saray called Abraham her husband lord. 1. Pe 3. And this
subiectyon of the wife to the husband must be with out murmr or grudge /
but wyllyngly and with gladness for it is inflicted to women of god / for the
transgression of Eve as a pain for sin Therefore let not the woman look at
the husband or at his deuties to her or whether he be good or evil / a Jew
or a Gentyle / a Scot or an Englysheman / a French man or Ducheman / a fre man
/ a bondema^ rich or pore / a gentylman borne or yoma^ gentle or ungentle /
meke or froward / but do her deuty to her husband that god requires of her
hands / let her be obedient to him in all lawefull things / love him / fear
him / have him in honor and reverence / be he never so evil vnki^de / noughty
and pore / let the wife be of honest conversation and living / that the
husband may espy in her nothing but that is chaste / womanly / good / just
/ virtuous / holy and godly / no finders of fautes with their husbands manners
and conditions / but if they find any thing to be reproved with their
husbands / to monyshe them of it secretly between them alone / bearing with
patience the infyrmities of their husbands / not wanton or light in words or
conditions / no bablers or strayers abroad / but of few words / kepers of
their houses at home / sobre / sad / and constant lovers of their husbands
studyeng always to please their husbands and none other / that by this holy and
chaste co^uersacion / they might bring their husbands that were heythen to the
faith of Christ / and by their goodness refourme and amend the euylnes of
evil husbands. And so give no place to the devil yt moves them meruaylously
that be married / to contention strife and debate / the one to contemn /
despise and abhor the other and can not bear the manners of the other / ne
love the other / nor do their deuties one to another / and so the wife desires
another husband / and the husband another wife / for the man in his own wife
he seyth nothing that pleases him. So yt the devil blyndeth his eyes and
sets before the eyes of the man all the spots and fautes of his wife (as
their is no man / ne woman without all fautes) and at his wives virtue /
goodness and good proptetes worthy commendation he never reme^bres / this thing
works the devil in the state of marriage oftymes both in the man and in the
woman / and happy are they that do not obey to the devil, nor give no place to
these the deuyls work / which thing the devil works to make the^ that be
married to break gods commandment and so to offend and displease God Also
to this helps the nature of man which is never consent with his state or
lotte / which sets little by the thing it has at pleasure and desires ever
the thing it has not / or is not lawful to have. Therefore it oftymes
chances / that in the eye of the man every woman is more fayrer / better /
more pleasant then his own wife. And oftymes it chances that the man is so
blinded / that he forsakes his own lawefull wife given hi^ of god / for whom
he should forsake al other / and despyseth her / and loves an harlot a drabe
that is foul and evil favored and huglye / so the noughty nature of man
despises that it has and desires that it has not / which to have is
unlawful / and against gods law / so labors the devil to kill men in
every state / and no man or woman is sure from the temptation of the devil /
but give no place nor consent to the deuyls temtation and the^ his temtacion
shall not noy or hurt you. if the devil shall tempte any man or woman as I have
said before / let hi^ give no consent to the devil / let the man have ever
before his eyes not the fautes but the virtues of his wife / and her goodness /
what he is bound to her by the law of god by reason of matrymony / let him
think every thing in his wife worthy to be commended Let him think his wife
above all other both better / fayrer / for so she is to him / by the ordinance
of god. Which has bound hi^ to his wife alone / that for her he should
forsake al other as long as she lives / yt he should love none above her / or
so well / and put her away from hi^ for none / or should keep non other besides
her / ye same thing the wife must think and do. The husband may use ves
laufull wife with a clear conscience as a lawful remedy against adulterye
and fornycation / to use other women then his own wife he can not with a
clean and a clear conscience / for it is against Gods law and he that does
so offends God / displeases God / his conscience is spotted / for he
commyt^eth deadely sin.

Therefore let the man think of his wife thus. This woman is she which God
has given to me / that I should embrase alone / that I should love her as
long as we shall live together / that I should think her to me most fairest
of all women / better and alone mete for me / given of God to bring forth
children to contynewe the world to Gods honor and glory / for a lawefull
remedy against adulterye and all kind of adultery / to dylate charytie
between her and me / her friends and my friends / her consanquinitye and mind.
And likewise the wife should think of her husband / that he is given to her
of God that she should have an eye not to his fautes / but to his virtues / to
her deutye toward him / that she should love him above all other / only
should to please him / to make her body free to none other / but to her
husband alone / to be obedyente to him with all lowelynes and gentylnes to
have him in fear / honor / and reverence Thus I have showed according to the
doctrine of S. Paul part of the deuty of the man toward his wife / and of
the wife toward her husband.

The syxte Chapyter to the Ephesyans.
YE CHILDREN Obey your elders in the Lord for that is right, honor thy
father and the mother that is the first commandment that has any
promyses, that thou may prospere and live long upon earth. And ye fathers
provoke not your children unto wrath, but bring them up in nurtour and
informacion of the Lord. Now the Apostle shows of the deutye of children to
their father and mother / it helps much to obtain godly virtues / that
children from their cradel and from their young age be virtuously brought up in
nortoure in good / virtues and godly learning / in love and fear of god / in
deu obedience to their parents in gentil and lowly manners / for as the old
saying is. The botell will keep ye smell or savor / of that liquore yt it
first received. So men for the most part smell ever of that facyon and manners
/ and love way that they have been brought up in their young age. Therefore it
is necessary that children in their young age should be put to good scole
masters that may and will bring them up in good holy and virtuous doctrine /
and godly manners that children may learn to know God their creature and maker
/ of whom al goodness does come / to know the goodness and benefits of god
toward them to laud and praise God / to give him thanks for his benefits
to be obedient to father and mother / to give to them al honor / not only
with outward gesture as bowynge their knees / putting of their cappe to their
patentes / or asking their blessings or doing their laufull commandments
/ and being obedient with all glad diligence to do their parents
commandments but also that they should honor their parents with all due
honor in gyuynge and prouydyng for them al necessaries if they need / or be
pore / or have need of the help of their children / for so this word honor is
taken in the scripture not only for outward reverence / but also for help or
sufficience of living as Paul shows. 1. Timo 5. where he says. The elders
that rule well are worthy double honor / cheyflye they that labor in the
word of god.

2 In the lord. This word shows how children should be obediente to their
elders and to their fathers and mothers / that is to say in the lord / because
the lord has so commanded / and it is the will of the lord that children
shall obey to their parents / or else in the lord / that is to say i^ all
things that pleseth the lord / that is in all lawful things. So children
obeing their parents gyuyng them deu honor does serve and please the lord /
and these children that be disobedient to their pare^tes do dysplease and
offend god.

3 For this is just / that the children should obey their parents / help
and socour their necessite gyuynge deu honor to them seeing children has
received of their parents their being / fode and cost of bryngyng up when
they were not able to help them self. Therefore it is equite that they should
help there parents 4 This is the first commandment in promise / to the
which promise of reward is made of long life either in this life / or in the
life to come / or in both / as oftymes chances to them that honor their
parents in this world / and the contrary is oftymes showed / that these
children that do not honor their parents in this world but be disobedient
to them conte^ne / despise and will not acknowledge their father and mother /
or kynsfolke / or be so unkind and unnatural children that desire the ^^th of
their parents for their profit / goods / lands / or riches / it is oftymes
seen that these children be of short life in this world / or dye some evil
death by some myschaunce or evil fortune called of man / when it is the
secret will and workynge of God / which will not suffer the contempt of
parents to be unpunished in this world / that al children might learn to be
obedient to their parents / to honor them / and not to contemn or despise
them or to wysshe their death for any lucre sake / for any honor or promotion
or such like thing. The Apostle promyseth two things to these children that
honor their parents / the one is / that all things shall be well to them / and
al things prosperous. The other length of life / and contrary to them that
dishonors there parents thretteth two things / that all things shall be
evil to them / and shortness of life / which things if they chance not always
in this life / yet surely in the life to come they will chance / and god will
perform his promise / for god is true in his promyses and will perform the^
/ either in this world / or in the world to come or else to both. And
although it is red of some children that disobeyed their parents / that had
great riches or felicite in this world and of long life in whom this threte
of god had no place in this world / yet with out doubt it had place after
this life in them / or else such disobedient children to their parents was
without all felicite and of short life before god. Children that do not obey
their parents they offend against the law of nature / of equite and justice
and against gods law written / which all require that children should give
deu honor to their fathers and mothers.

5 And ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath. Now he comes to
pare^rentes and shows what is their deutye toward their children. Fathers
and mothers for the most part either they are to tender / soft / gentle /
or make to much on them / or else they are to hard / fell / cruel sharp / or
froward with them. Few or none of their pare^tes do know how they should
order or bring up their children / but either nature moves them to be to
tender over them / and so they make the children to wantonne / self wylly /
froward, not carynge for father or mother / ye disobedient to father and
mother and so oftymes it is true that Mantuane says. Blanda patrum segnes
facit indulge^tia gnatos. To much pamperynge of rathers makes slow and
disobedient children. Therefore it is true that Solomon says. He yt spares
the rod, he hates the child And of the contrary part there is some pare^tes
that keep their children in to much awe or fear of them / by whose fiersnes
and hastynes / the children be almost marred and brought to such fear that
they be without al sense and for fear they ca^ not tell what they should
answer or do / ye for fear they can not speak one word right this thing
causes the fiersnes or rygorousnes of some to much severe fathers toward
their children whom by awe and fear they think to make wise / and by that
means they make them stark foles / and without senses / as they be that be
angry or in a fury / which be paste them self for ire or fury / that for a
time they can not tell what they say or do / or what is spoken to them / to
whose madness or furye the Apostle does appear to allude here when he says Ye
fathers provoke not your children to wrath / as he would say / Ye fathers by
your hardness or rigorusnes provoke not your children to be without sense or in
such fere that they can not tell what to say or do for fear. Therefore let
parents take heed as they bring up their children / and let the^ not use to
much te^dernes nor yet to much rigorousnes over their children / bring them
up in the knowledge of god / in love and fear of God / in fear to break
Gods commandments / in the love of gods word / of the which the
children may learn what is the true worship of god how they shall truly
honor and worship god / what is true virtue and holiness / what works
please god best and what please him not / it pertayneth to the parents to
teach their children to love virtue / and to hate vice / to walk in virtue and
go forwards and increase in virtue every day also to give to their children
holy examples of living / that the children may se in the parents no
fylthynes / uncleanness / nor euylnes to follow. And also the children may not
all together be without correction / but the rod must be had sometimes to
correct the wantonness of children and there negligence to make them obediente
to wholesome admonitions and teachynges nor yet the rode of correctnon may not be
used to much / least by to much betynge the children be dulled and care not
for betynge. Therefore children must be ordered sometime by fair means / and
sometime by correctyon. And it chances oftymes that a man shall do more
amongst children with an apple then with a rod / so it becomes the parents
to bring up their children in learning and in correction of the lord / if
they can by them self / if they can not or will not take the pain / then let
the^ put their children to good scolemaysters that can and will bring them up
virtuously in good learning and in correction as need shall require to
correct their wa^tonnes or negligence. The cause and the fountain of all evil
is that children and the youth are not well brought up in learning and
sufficient chastmente / children are brought up in to much tenderness / sofnes
/ slouggyshenes / ydlenes / wantonness / pride of mind / and elecion of heart /
and in arroga^cy / they are taught not to know god but them selfs / to know
them selves not evil the children of ire and of darkness by nature / but ot be
gentylme^ and lords to be preferred before other / and to proferre them selves
before other / and to contemn other. Children are not brought up in the
learning of the lord / as in the reading of the holy scripture / and in the
knowledge of god and of our lord Jesus Christ / but if they be brought up in
learning they are for the most part brought up in profane learning and in
the reading of profane authors / of the which they may learn eloquence and
worldely wisdom and for the end profane authors do serve / and not to reach
Christian faith or manners / and as children be brought up in profane learning
and of them lernes profane manners / so they walk in profane manners and
conditions / and so contynewe and show in their leuynge prophan manners and
conditions / and be so affected as the gentyle authors be that they have red /
and form their judgments after the^ examples there be to many. Therefore let
children learn eloquence and worldly wisdom of gentile authors if they will /
and a christian faith and godly manners to order their living according to the
doctrine of Christ and of the holy scripture which alone teaches faith / true
judgments and good manners. I will not speak of them that be so brought up in
learning / that not only they do not read the holy scriptures / but rather
teach other to be ware of holy scriptures / not to look on them / not to
study them / as things unmeet to look on for children. I will not say that to
contemn despise and set holy scripture at naught / or to regard it not so
much as a profane author / ye to have a natural hatred against it / in so
much that they will not ones vouchesafe to read it the^self nor yet suffer
other to read it / and this evil bryngyng up has been the cause / why so many
be so loath to receive holy scripture / and why they be so evil affected in
judgments toward the holy scripture that as yet scarce they can bear one to
have the new Testamente in English to read it / to their comfort and
edyfyeng / and may not here the truth to be preached to them such has been
their evil bringing up and the smell of the liqoure that was first put in
their new Botelles. Therefore look diligentely ye fathers and mothers what
liquor ye put in the new Bottels / that is in your children in their youth
for they will smell of the same liquor in their age Therefore if you will have
them good / holy / virtuous and obediente to you / look they be brought up in
the lernyng of holy scripture which alone teaches all goodness / true holiness /
true virtue / and due obedyence to God and his commandments to father and
mother and to all other according. I will not speak of Gentylmennes children
that be brought up in ydelnes wantonness / in / play / in pastyme / in hunting
and haukyng / riding / in keeping of horses and dogs / in syngyng daunsynge /
lepynge / riottynge and reuellynge / in hearing uncleanly songs or balettes /
other ways called merry so^ges mete for a gentylman: as who should say the
office of Gentylmen or noble men is nothing else but to hunt and hawk / to
be idle / to take pastyme and pleasure: as who should say their lands and
possessions was given for that end. Let the^ read the scriptures and they shall
find that they be appointed to other offices which requires great labous and
pains / and great knoweledge if they shall do their deuties as they should do
/ let them look what things perteyneth to the office of powers and of
magistrates / and the same thing gentylme^ or noble men should think it
pertayneth to them for they be Magistrates or rulers under the King or Prince
/ to se Gods law fulfilled to se peace equite and justice be kept / sin /
and vice clearly put away.

Ye servants obey your body lie masters with fear and trembling in
synglenes of your heart even as to Christ, not with service only in the eye
sight as men pleasers: but as the servants of God doing the will of God from
the heart with good will. Think that ye serve the Lord and not men / and be
sure, that what good so ever a man does, he shall receive it again of the
Lord whether he be bond or fre. Now he teaches the office of servants /
whose office is to be obediente to his master who^ he serves here in the
world to have meat drink / clothe and wages / or whom they serve for to
learn an handye craft to get their living justly and truly after the time
of their prentysshyp he commands all servants to be obediente to their
master in all lawefull things and lawful service / and to do his masters
commandment justly and truly without al murmuring or grudgynge in heart or
mind against god or his master and to refuse no lawful work or labor that
his Master will put him to / if it be such a work as servants has not ben
wont to do / it is no shame for the seruante to do it / but rather dishonesty
to the master to command it / when it may be done by an other servant
accustomed with the same as their is diverse works more accustomed to be done
by men servants / then women servants and some other by women servants
rather then by men servants. The Apostle wylleth also that servants shall have
their master in honor / and reverence / and have a lowely fear toward them
/ by the which fear they should be affrayed to displease their masters not
only to avoid betynge and punysheme^t of their masters / but for love to
their masters whom for love they would not dysplease. Here we may learn that
it is not against the lyberty of the Gospel to serve carnal masters and men
here in the world for his service is the lyberty of the Lord and those that
do serve their masters as they should do / they serving their masters and
doyenge their masters lawful commandment do serve God / and do the
commandment of god / as he shows here after as ye may read.

2 In symplenes of your heart / he commands the servants to serve their
masters in all symplenes of heart / without al craft / falsed / gyle /
desayte / fraud / theft or dissembling in word or in deed / in the which
fautes servants be oftymes gylti This place reproves al those servants that
deceive their masters by any gyle / craft / or false / by dissembling or
theft by brybynge or stealing away pryuely hes masters goods. This place
requires that the servant be faithful and trusty to their masters / and
that in no wise they deceive their masters either in word / work or deed.

3 Even as to Christ not with service only in the eye sight as me^ pleasers /
but as servants of Christ he wylleth that servants serve their masters with
faythfulnes / truth / dylygence / and gladness as they should serve God / and
Jesus Christ / for servants seruyng their masters they serve Jesus Christ and
do the work of god and are occupied in gods service / no less / ye
peradventure better then they that contynually be occupied in gods service as
it is called / for servants obeyng their masters and doing their masters
commandment has for the^ the word of god that they work the work of god /
how someuer it be counted of men / as if they should make clean the kytchyng
or keynel or any other such vile office counted at their masters
commandment they work the work of god. Therefore let not servants consider
the vylnes of the work they be commanded to do / but the commandment of god
that has commanded them to do their masters commandment / and so the
lawful commandment of the masters / is the commandment of god / and
servants that do there commandment do the work of god / and obey god so
doing. If servants knew that they served our lord god and did the work of
god / when they obey their masters and does their masters commandment /
surely with more gladness they would here and sufire pain and wheresomnes of
their great labors and pain-they suffer being servants / and with more
glad heart they would do their masters labors and business were the labors
never so paynful. Also servants may not be as eye pleasers only / that is in
the presence of their masters to be dyligent profitable and do the work of
their masters faithfully and so please their masters well in their presence
and in there absence neither to be faithful profitable ne diligente or care
not how their masters work go forward to their masters profit / but good
servants it becomes to be dyligent faithful and profitable in their masters
absence as presence / and to serve their masters as they should serve Jesus
Christ / which looks upon them always and seith all that they do / by their
gyle / craft / or falsed they go about to deceive their masters / all
unfaithfulness and negligence in servants is here reproved and condemned of
the Apostle.

4 Doing the will of god from the heart with a good will / it becomes servants
wyllyngly and gladly with a free heart and mind to serve their masters and to
do those things that god wylleth. Wherefore servants may not do evil at the
will of their masters for God wylleth no evil. And also servants may not
grudge or murmr against their masters when they command them to do
payneful labors busynes / or to wyshe them evil / to curse them or ba^ne them
/ or to go with a dogs Pater noster humpyng or mumpynge at the matter not
willing to do their masters commandment / or be such yt have need to be
prycked forward with betyng / whyppyng / or other punyshme^t for the servant
should do his masters lawful commandment freely / wyllyngly and with gladness.

5 Thinking that ye serve the Lord and not men. This thing may conforte the
servant and in this servants may conforte them selfs and rejoice / that
they doing the lawful commandments of their masters do serve not man but
God / and this comfort may take away the paynfulnes of their great labors /
which paynefulnes also may swage the reward that god has promised to give
to faithful servants. And fear unfaithful and evil servants the pain
thretned to evil servants / so their is a reward promised to good servants
and a pain to evil servants / which god will give when he seyth his time.

And ye masters do even the same unto them putting away threatenings, and
know that eue^ your master also is in heaven, neyrher is there any respect of
perso^nes with him. Here he shows the office of masters to their servants
/ saying. It is the office of the master to show hi^selffe meke and gentle to
his servants whom they suffer not to want necessaries neither to want meat
ne clothe / not to entreat the^ with great hardness / fearsnes or cruelnes not
to lay great burdi^ges upon their backs / or to put them to i^tollerable
labors and pains / but that the masters should think their servants to be
men made to the symilitude of god / redeemed by the preciouse blood of Christ
to be heirs and inheritoures of the kingdom of heaven as well as they. Finally
let masters so order them selfs toward their servants and be so loving /
so kind / so gentle / that of their servants they may be more loved then dred
/ do more for their love then for fear / or for profit.

2 Putting away threatenings / the lord commands the masters not only
to put away betynges / and punysshementes / but also all cruel threatenings
fears and fell words which makes the servants oftymes to run away and
forsake his master contrary to the law of God This place reproves fears /
fell and cruel masters and froward to their servants / that threate great
and grievous plages / and punysshementes thinking they shall do more with
rhough and rygorouse means the^ with loving words and gentle facyons but
such froward masters deceyueth the^ self / for gentylnes will do more with
an honest servant and with him that fears god then any rough words or
rygorous manners / for there be few servants that be amended by bunchynge
beatyng or other greuouse punyshement. if he need much punysshement it is a
token he is an evil servant and lytyl regards his profyce or his Masters
profit honestye or worship.

3 And know that your Master is in heaven / he shows the cause why masters
should entreat their servants gently and remyt to them plages /
punyshemenentes and threatenings / because god the father which is in heaven is
the Lord of the servants as well as he is of the masters and will make the
servants equal with the masters in Heaven / for God does not regard
persons of men / whether they be masters or servants / but looks at every
man's office and deuty / and whom he fyndeth has done their office and deuty
well he will reward them with a great reward and whom he fyndeth negligent
in his office and not done his deutye / he will punyshe whether they be masters
or serseruauntes.

Finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might / put
on the armoure of God / that ye may stand steadfast against the crafty
assaults of the devil / for we wrestle not against flesh and blood / but
against rule against power, namely against the rulers of the world of the
darkness of this world / against the spyrytes of wyckednes under the Heaven.
The Apostle here before has exhorted men to the unite of the spirit / to
peace to concord and has showed certain degrees how they shall live in
their state and to their deuty / as what is the duty of the wife to the
husband / and of the husband to the wife / of the children to their parents
/ and of the parents to their children of the servants to their masters /
and of masters to their servants. Now he shows that these that will live
after the rule dyscribed to them of Paul / yt sometime they shall have enymies
and temptacions of the devil whom they must resyst and overcome / and here he
shows what armoure they must have to fight against enemies / and by what
weapons they shall over come enemies. Therefore he commands them to be strong
not in them self in their own myghtes or powers / but in the lord and in the
powers of the lord by the which the enemies shall be ouercommed. if we be
strong in the Lord we need not to fear enemies / for the Lord is strong
enough to overcome enemies and all adversaries / and we by him / for he has
cure of us and will defend us from enemies. if we trust in him.

2 Put on the armoure of God / that ye may stand steadfast against the
craftye assaults of the devil. In these words he shows with what weapons we
shall be armed that we may stand steadfast and sure against the assaults and
crafts of the devil and to overcome him and his temtations put away / by the
which he temteth us / as by carnal pleasure of the flesh by covetousness of
riches or of desires of worldly / honors by threatnyng or fear of the world
/ or loss of goods favor or promotyon by the which means the devil uses
to pluck men from god and from his word. This armor by the which we shall
resyste the devil and his temtation / is not by the light of the holy candle
hallowed of candlemesse day / by strynklynge of holy water / by the ryngynge of
the hallowed great bell / by having on their body a cross made on Palsonday ane
Agnus dei called. Etheldrede lace about their neck by going to religion
invented by man / by taking this habyte or that habyte of religion in this
place or in that place / by shiftyng up within walls and never to come out
again as the devil could not come within such walls / or by catyng of
fyshe always and never flesh. These be not the armoure that the Apostle
byddeth to put on to resyste the Devil / but he byddeth put on the armoure of
god / that is ye word of god by the which the devil is resisted and
ouercommed / and al his crafts and te^tacio^s be made vain. By this armor
Christ over came the devil. Math. 4. to teach us with what armor we should
fight against the devil / and how to overcome him and all his temtatyons and
keep us safe from all hurt / or peril of the temptations of the devil.

3 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood / and so forth as he should
say we must not only fight against the temtations of the flasshe and of the
world / but also against more cruel adversaries then these be as against the
devil / wicked spirits adn all other powers. And here the Apostle like a
valyant and a prudent captain of war exhorts his sogers to be of good
chere and to fear nothing their enemies although they be fears / cruel / and
crafty in fyghtyng / have great polycy / in ingynes and experience in fighting
/ he opens all their craft and soteltye / their fears cruelnes / and their
bold assaults / that his sogers might know their adversaries craft / and
kill them in their own turn / and beware of their malice / he incourages them
to fight against the devil and gives them armor to fight against him / and
moves them to fight like valiante sogers / and in no wise to shrynke or give
place / and he shows the^ their enemies against who^ they should fight their
might and power / their fearsnes and cruelnes if they be not resysted manfully
with the word and help of god / by the which all these adversaries be sone
ouercommed.

And he speaks after this manner / strong enemies to man is flesh and
blood / carnal concupiscences and lusts / tyranny of evil men persecution
of the truth / and the malice of men styrred up by the devil to bring men
from god to deny his truth but these enemies be nothing if they be compared
with the devil and his powers / wicked spirits and fyndes which as it
appears has here diverse names of the diversity of their offices that they do
here in the air to hurt men / they be called powers / rulers of darkness / of
this world / spirits of wyckednes / by the which he means nothing else
but that Peter says. 1. Pe. 5. Our adversary the devil goes about as a
rampynge lion sekyng whom he may kill and devour by all means and crafts /
but resyste him with the armoure of god / and he shall be ouercommed.

: For this cause take ye the armoure of god that ye may be able to resyste in
the evil day and stand perfyte in all things. Stand therefore, and your
loins gyrded about with the truth having on the breast plate of ryghteousnes
/ and shode upon your fete with the gospel of peace / that ye may be
prepayred. Above all things take hold of the shield of faith wherewith ye may
quench the fire darts of the wicked, and take ye Helmet of salvation / and
the sword of the spirit / which is the word of God- The Apostle moves
every christian man to take the armor of god upon him and to fight strongly
against the devil or else he shall be killed and devoured of the devil /
which is so cruel a tyrant that he saves none whom he may ouercom / kill /
and devour / there is no mercy at his hand / and he will kill all that do not
resyst him / if helps not to submyt himself to the deuyls gentilnes and he
take prisoner with the deuyls magesty. But all such cowardes he will
boucherlye kill and devour. Therefore the Apostle exhorts every one to fight
manfully against the devil / and give no place to him / and to do as valyante
sogers that think not to be ouercommed but to overcome / they put on their
armor / they are ready to fight / with boldenes they show them selves before
their enemies ready to fight and not to give place to their adversaries / they
will do al things that they may to affray their enemies / and make them to fle
and give back / to overcome them that they may have victory over their enemies
and laud and praise of the victory / and triumph in gladness.

2 Before the Apostle used a metaphore of sogers for to fight / now he goes
for wards in the same similitude and teaches what armor christyan men must
have to resyst the devil and his temptations / carnal concupiscences lusts /
and desires of the world. And first he showed that a christian man may not
be idle / or sure in himself / but to be always as a soger ready to fight
against the devil and carnal lusts / and never to give place to the devil
but resyst him always in the day of evil / that is when the devil moves to
evil by his temtations by carnal lusts and worldly desires / and stand sure
and be not ouercomed by no temtation. They can not stand sure vnouerco^med /
which do not resyst the devil nor fight with him / but will be overthrown at
the first meati^g or temtation / and give place to the devil and obey him /
such the devil kylleth and deuoureth / for he is a rampynge lion and seeks
whom he may devour.

3 He shows how men should stand against the devil without peril / and
how they should arm them self / and what armor is to be put on every part
that the devil may find no part naked or unarmed / where he may pearce with
his dart. These that go to battle they have three manner of weapons / or armor /
some armor they have to cover their body / some to fight with all / and some
to bear of strokes far from the body. Sogers were wo^t in batell to arm them
seses with a gyrdle of mayle about their belly and loins / and a breast plate
an Helmet and armoure on their legs / so that no part was unarmed / no place
could be hurt by weapons So in a christianes war against the devil and his
temptations it becomes a christian man to be armed with like armor / to
keep of strokes and wounds. First it becomes christen men to be gyrded with
the gyrdle of truth / that is to quench the lusts and desires of the flesh
by the truth and to mortify them / as saint Paul does exhort. Collo. 3.
saying. Mortify your earthly members / that is adultery / fornication /
uncleanness / carnal lusts of the flesh / covetousness / and such like that
bring to death. They are called in Scripture to have their loins gyrded by
the truth / that has truly and unfeignedly quenched and mortified the
concupiscence of the flesh which reigns in the loins (as authors do
writ) and not after the manner of hypocrytes / which feign them selfs to be
chaste outwardely / and be in heart and mind fylthy and foul adulterers / only
absteynynge from outward adulterye for fear of punyshement and shame of the
world / and such their is many in the world God knows of the spyrytualtye
which rather for shame of the world and worldly punyshement / then for fear
of displesure of god of eternal pain and damnation does absteyne from the
outward act or deed of adultery which be no less adulterers before god / the^
be these that commit actual adultery. Also here is to be noted ye first he
would we should put away adultery and carnal lusts and desires / and after them
other vices that be not so nigh us. For first is the enemy to be put away and
eschewed that is most nigh to us. Therefore concupiscence of the flesh is to be
put away and mortified before al other vices and sins 4 Take on the breast
plate of ryghteousnes / the breast must be armed with justice / which is the
breast plate of a christian by the which that is right is given to every man /
and to god that is deu to God / true justice gives only to Christ our
reconciliation / redemption / justification / forgyuenes of sin / and our
life everlasting / and all that is good / it gives to God as to the author of
al goodness / and not to us to our works or merits / true justice seeks not
other men's goods / nor keeps things that be not his / but gives to every
one that is just and right. And as a breast plate do cover and defend the
breast so does justice keep and defend the heart from all danger and peril
of the devil and suffers no evil to enter the heart. This justice puts
away all gyle / fraud / theft lyeng / stealyng / craft / deceyte and all
other crafty ways and disse^blynges whereby other be deceived this justice will
not suffer us to ascribe to our self these things that be not ours / or to
attribute to us that pertayneth to Jesus Christ.

5 He would we should be shode with the gospel of peace / he would we should be
ready to receive the gospel that brings peace joy / and quietness to our
conscience / and to have on shoes as armoure for our legs and fete which
signify that we should mortify our carnal affections and desires / and that
we shall not desire carnal things / but heavenly things as the gospel of
peace the kyngedome of heaven and joy everlasting. These be armor to defend
the body / that no darte wound it.

6 Above all things take the shield of faith. Faith is the armor that
defends not only the head / but also it defends the hole body / as a
buckeler defends me^ from darts of their enemies / so faith defends men
from temtations of the devil and his assaults. The devil casts his fire
brandes and darts against us intending to pearce and wound us with the^ /
he throws at us his fyry darts of diffydence / of carnal desires and
pleasures / when he casts before our eyes sin and the pleasure in sin /
and by such pleasing baytes draws us to sin / but all the deuyls fyry
darts / by the which we be moved and set on fire to sin / true faith do
quench and put them clear out / and makes us safe without hurt of them / of
such virtue is faith / which is a sure armoure to bear of strokes and will not
suffer any dart of the devil to wound us.

7 Take the helmet of salvation that is take Jesus Christ your head for your
helmet to defend you / and have true hope in him and put all your care in god
/ for he has care for you / and these that believe in him he will defend and
save them and make them to over come the devil and all his te^tatyons / so by
true faith and sure hope in god / is our enemy the devil put away and his
temptations do not noye or hurt us.

8 Take also the Sword of the spirit / which is the word of god / and the
armor to invade our enemy the devil / by the which the devil is put away
and expelled / wounded and killed. Here we may learn how necessary is the
word of god to fight against the devil to invade him / and to expelle him /
ye the word of god is so necessary to fight against the devil / that the
devil is not ouerco^med nor over thrown but by the word of god / at the
which he is not able to stand / but it over throws him at the first / and
all the temtatyons of the devil is expulsed by the word of god only. if the
word of god be so necessary a thing to expelle the devil and all his
te^tations / and by no other way the devil is expelled / nor his temtations put
away. I pray you what have they done that have dissuaded lay men and lay women
from the word of God / and kept them so long from it / persuading to the
unlearned / that it was not lawful ne expediente for them to read the holy
scripture to have ye word of god to fight against the devil and by it to drive
away the devil / and to resyste utterly the deuylles temtations. I pray you.
Judge you now / of whose partly have these men ben of gods party / or of the
deuyls party? that has depryued christians of their armoure by the which they
should resyste and over come the devil / it was no great meruail if we were
brought in great darkness and blyndnes and the devil to have hade great rule
and power over us and us sure bound in his chynes / when we had no weapons to
fight against him / neither to keep out his fire dattes / nor yet weapons to
smite him again. And yet these that did take away from us out lawful armoure
that is the holy scripture / by the which only the devil is ouercommed /
they did persuade them to be our friends / and to spoil us of our armoure to
be for our profit / as who should say the devil will not tempt laymen or lay
women to sin / and so to bring them to death / but be mercyful lord to the^
/ which is against the nature of the deuyls majesty / but if lay men and lay
weme^ do not fight against the devil and by the word of god do not drive him
away but give place to him they shall be killed and devoured and brought to
eternal death. Therefore le not christians be spoiled of their armor / that is
the holy scripture / that they may resyst / and overcome the devil and all his
temtatyons / it is as necessary for lay men and lay women to have their armor
/ as for spiritual men called / seeing the devil does te^pt to si^ne as well lay
men as spiritual men. Thus the Apostle has given us weapons to fight against
the devil and his temtatio^s and wylleth us to take chastity for a gyrdle /
justice for a breast plate / denyenge of our affection and gladness to receive
the gospel for leg harness / Christ for an helmet / faith for a bucler and
for a sword the word of God / that overcomes and kylleth the devil / and
these be the weapons whereby christenmen should fight against the devil and
overcome him.

These weapons given to christianes to fight against the devil do not take
away from christen princes and rulers the secular or temporal sword as the
Anabaptystes think / and say / which so thinking and saying / do both think
evil and say evil. For christian princes and kings and rulers may use the
temporal sword upon malefactors and evil doers / to correct them / to
punyshe them / yet to punyshe them with temporal death to fear other from
doing evil / if not for love of god and of heavenly reward yet for fear of
punishment / as saint Paul plainly shows to the Romans. 13. saying. The
rulers bear not the sword without a cause and that princes are to be feared
of them that do evil. The Anabaptystes are worthy to be reproved that abuse
this place of Paul to prove their error and herysye / saying that christen
men should use none other sword then the word of God / and that it is not
lawful for christen princes to use a seculer or a temporal sword by the
which error they deny powers and lawful rulers ordinated of God to punyshe
malefactors and evil doers as manyfestly is wryte^. Rom^. 13. 1. Pe. 2. These
Anabaptists in this point show their blindness and ignorance in scripture /
and takes away al order al common wealths and quietness in the world. In that
they deny hye powers / and lawful rulers ordinated of god / for the common
wealth / and take from them authorite to punysshe by the temporal sword
malefactors / and troublers of the common wealth and pace / what mischeife
should not be if there were no rulers none to punyshe malefactors? what peace?
what quietness should be? surely (...) all? who should lie in his house sure
from thieves and murderers? who should keep his goods in sauegard? who should
walk by the way or by the street sure of his life? ye who should not be
killed at his own door / within his own house? if there were no rulers to
punysshe malefactoures with the temporal Sword? surely none should be in
peace / quietness / saffe of his life. Therefore let these Anabaptystes read
the.13. Chapter to the Romans / and they shall clearly se that saint Paul
condemns their heresy as a damnable heresy / and very hurteful for the common
wealth / peace and quietness. And as for this place / of saint Paul makes
nothing for the Anabaptists. For saint Paul here speaks of weapons that
christians should use to fight against the devil / and his temtations and not
of weapons whereby seculer rulers should punyshe malefactors / evil doers or
evil sayers to fear al other from evil doing and evil saying.

And pray always with all manes of prayer and supplycacyon in the spirit, and
watch thereunto (...) instaunce and supply caty^^ for all saints and for me,
that (...) word may be given me, that I may open my mouth boldly to utter
the secrets of the Gospel whereof I am a messenger in bounds, that I may
speak therein freely, as it becomes me to speak. The Apostel has showed
them with what armor they should fight against the devil. Now he shows /
how they should get this spiritual armor / and of whom it must be required
and gotten and by what means / he says it must be desired of god the father
and optayned of hi^ by meke supplycation and prayer for Jesus Christ's sake /
and for none other sake that all praise and thank might be given to god alone
for it / and he shows that we must oftymes pray in the spyryte for this
armor and be diligent and fervent i^ prayer fervently desiring of god this
armoure 2 He desires all saints that is al faithful christen livers to pray
for hi^. In the which he teaches us to desire them that be on live to pray to
god for us / as he desired these Ephesia^s to pray for hi^ to god 3 For what
thing Paul did pray and desired these Ephesyans to pray for him / he shows
that it was / that god would open his mouth that he might speak the word of
god freely with boldenes and with our all fear / and that he might make open
to all men the gospel which he preached for whose sake he was in prison and
in cheynes as apppereth. Finally he desired that he might speak the gospel as
it did be come him to speak / and in this saint Paul gives exsample to all
preachers ernestely and feruentely to desire of god these things / that God
would open their mouth / that they might speak freely the word not of man but
of god / and that they might speak gods word freely fra^kely and without al
fear of man co^temning al effecsyon or persecucyo^ for gods word / that
they might not disse^ble i^ the word of god for pleasure or dyspleasure of man.
Also learn in Paul that he preferred the fre preaching of Gods word above
his deliuerau^ce out of prisone / to teach us to do such like / and not to
care for our self so by us gods word be promoted.

But that ye may also know what case I am in, and what I do Tichicus my dear
brother and faithful mynyster in the Lord shall show you all. Whom I have
sent unto you for ye same cause that ye might know what case I stand in and yt
ye might comfort your heart These things yt was for the eternal salvation of
these Ephesia^s / the Apostle sent the^ by wryti^g. These things that
perteined to him self and his case he was in / he wrote not the^ / but left
the^ to be showed by a faithful messe^ger called Tichicus a faithful ministre
to Paul in person / which should certify these Ephesia^s of al things
co^cerni^g Paul / which should comfort their hearts he ring the lord to be
present with Paul in preson / and glad in the lord / patiently taking his
affection / and also that more glory was given to god and the word of God more
promoted by Paul's prisonme^t / the^ if he should have been out of prison / and
tha, few or none did shrynke from the gospel by reason of his affliction or
imprisonment ye yt many did receive ye gospel unfeignedly sei^g his patience and
co^stancy in his affliccyons / these things with diverse other he left to be
showed by Tichicus a faithful messe^ger who^ he greatly commends / by who^
he sent this Epestle to these Ephesia^s Peace be unto the brethren, and love
with faith from god ye father and from the lord Jesus Christ. Grace be with all
them that love our Lord Jesus Christ unfeignedly. Amen.

Now he makes and end of hes Epestle and desires peace / charity / faith
grace and the fauer of god to al the^ that love our lord Jesus christ
unfeignedly / to god be al honor and glory world without end. Amen.
