TO THE HONORABLE Gentleman, and my very good Master, Sir Henry Fanshawe,
KNIGHT.
WOrthy Sir: among many Patrons of Art, and Musical endeavors, I am emboldened
to rank your Name; who, as I know you not inferior to the best, as well for
a lover of MUSIC, as a competent Judge of that Noble faculty; so I present
you here, with such numbers best fitting your innated Harmony, and (I hope) not
unworthy your Patronage. And though I know the excellent variety of these
Compositions, has fed time with fullness, and bred many Censors, more curious,
then (perhaps) Judicial; and since no Science carries so sufficient authority
in it self, but must needs submit to that Monster OPINION, half truth, half
falsehood; yet these of mine being thus fronted with your Countenance, digested
by your Ear, and allowed in your Knowledge; should they prove distasteful with
the queasie pallated, or surfeited delight, yet with the sound (vnsubiect to
such disease of Humor, and appetite) I presume they will pleasingly relish,
and (with your equal self) maintain me against the corrupted number of
Time-sicke humorists. These (honored SIR) are the primitiae of my Muse,
planted in your pleasure, and cherisht by the gentle calm of your Favor; what
I may produce hereafter is wholly Yours (as who has more right to the Fruit
then he that owneth the Stock?) If then you accept (in stead of real worth)
this my humble Tribute of Affection, I shall study to use that grace, with my
time, to the best advantage, and till I may better deserve you, in my utmost
abilities ever rest

Your Worships in all serviceable endeavor and devotion JOHN WARD.

here, with such numbers best fitting your innated Harmony, and (I hope) not
unworthy your Patronage. And though I know the excellent variety of these

in it self, but must needs submit to that Monster OPINION, half truth, half
falsehood; yet these of mine being thus fronted with your Countenance, digested
by your Ear, and allowed in your Knowledge; should they prove distasteful with
the queasie-pallated, or surfeited delight, yet with the sound (vnsubiect to
such disease of Humor, and appetite) I presume they will pleasingly relish,
and (with your equal self) maintain me against the corrupted number of
Time-sicke humorists. These (honored SIR) are the primitiae of my Muse,
planted in your pleasure, and cherisht by the gentle calm of your Favor; what
I may produce hereafter is wholly Yours (as who has more right to the Fruit
then he that owneth the Stock?) If then you accept (in stead of real worth)
this my humble Tribute of Affection, I shall study to use that grace, with my

a lover of MUSIC, as a competent Judge of that Noble faculty; so I present
you here, with such numbers best fitting your innated Harmony, and (I hope) not
unworthy your Patronage. And though I know the excellent variety of these
Compositions, has fed time with fullness, and bred many Censors, more curious,
then (perhaps) Judicial; and since no Science carries so sufficient authority
in it self, but must needs submit to that Monster OPINION, half truth, half
falsehood; yet these of mine being thus fronted with your Countenance, digested
by your Ear, and allowed in your Knowledge; should they prove distasteful with
the queasie-pallated, or surfeited delight, yet with the sound (vnsubiect to
such disease of Humor, and appetite) I presume they will pleasingly relish,
and (with your equal self) maintain me against the corrupted number of
Time-sicke humorists. These (honored SIR) are the primitiae of my Muse,
planted in your pleasure, and cherisht by the gentle calm of your Favor; what
I may produce hereafter is wholly Yours (as who has more right to the Fruit
then he that owneth the Stock?) If then you accept (in stead of real worth)
this my humble Tribute of Affection, I shall study to use that grace, with my
time, to the best advantage, and till I may better deserve you, in my utmost
abilities ever rest

still increased, still * still * our hopes had still increased, * ^ But he is
