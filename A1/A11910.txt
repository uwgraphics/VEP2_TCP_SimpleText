IMPRINTED AT LONDON in Fletestreat, beneath the Conduit, at the sign of S.

In Agamemnona Senecae Thomae Newcei.
NOn secus a^rostro crudelis vultur, obunco^
Caucaseirodit iecur immortale promethe^,
Inuida men's stolidi, vitio contorta perenni,
Derogat assidue famam nomenque merentis^
Cum legis hanc igitur, si quicqua^ versio ridet,
Non quid verba velint, sed quid ^es ipsa, videto.
Sanguine spumante^ pateras, cum mente reuoluit,
Saeuit in Atridem men's impia saenit adult^i.
Et Deus Atr^^m patris de crimine, prolem
Perdit: et iniustae tollunt Agamemnona, parcae.
Debuit exemplum quosuis terrere superbos:
Et, cuiuis, opus hoc iuuenis, laudare molestum.
Sed siturbaruant in quaeuis aequora praeceps,
Flumine paem^rum iusto, Deus obruet ^llos.
Upon the same, to the same, the verses of the same.
SI^th friends to friends do fre^dly grant
in frednly cases much,
And I perceived that his cause,
and his request was such:
How that, to paynfull labored stuff
my mind I would annex:
And do but as his watched work,
which he does here contex
Deserves: when as the Poets crabbed
style I wayd aryght:
And saw how well, and saw how apt
and feetly he did write:
How hydden stories often he shows,
to make his poet plain:
(So as in double office he
might seem for to remain)
As sometime barely to expound,
to comment sometime eke,
So that to understand this book,
ye need no farther seek:)
This well deserved work of his,
when as I weyed well,
And partly knew his fyled frame,
as other men can tell,
And wholly knew his springing youth,
and years for age yet green,
So that dame Natures grave array,
on face was scarcely seen,
I could not choose, but when I saw
his labor to be sore,
And eke his weary web, then this
for to deserve much more,
Furthwith at his request, both to
refrsh his watchyng eeys,
And praised pains to others praise,
this little work deuyse,
Least happily he should meet with such,
as would scarce speak the best,
Nor half that it deserves, but unto
nippyng words be pressed.
And though I know this painful wight
can not his carpers want,
Which often times discorage men,
and make such studyes skant,
Yet be not thou dismayed, go on,
and bolden well thy self,
The worthyest wight that ever wrote,
did never want his Elfe.
Such Emules, and such fyendly freaks,
if E thou take away,
Plain Mules they be, y^ mump and mow,
and nothing else can say.
Who if in ranckours poisoned sincke,
they lurk and wallow still,
Nor yet with cancred venom bolne,
do leave their waspysh will,
But slothful sluggerds still vpbraid,
that paynfull heads deuyse,
And with their tryple forked tongs,
anoy this enterprise:
Discorage him from other work,
and further fruytes of wit,
And other toward pains dysgrace,
if they such poison spit.
Tak^ heed: if tongs far worse do bite,
then double edged swerd:
If bytyng tongs be stinging ills,
why ma^ger then thy berd,
Thou can not shun Jove's ruddy wrath,
that such deseruers have,
Which willingly, though woefully,
them selves they do it crave.
In whom it is, if that they will,
much better to deserve:
And cease, their wytles^e appetyte
for any more to serve.
This woeful work that Senec here
depayntes before thy face,
The bloody ire of mighty Jove,
propounds in ruthful case.
To such as by their deuilysh deeds,
and hearts with rancour mixed,
Alreddy be, although they live,
in snakysh dongeon fixed.
The crumpled brows of lofty lord,
in cloudy throne that sytts,
His sore dyspleased mind portend
to evil used wytts.
Who in his fomyng wrath, can turn
the worlds well ^etled seat:
And make an indigested thing,
and mingle mangle great^
Beware therefore: of Tantalus
that stem, and lynage vile
May cause the well, with virtues tool,
thy vycious life to fyle.
For deadly deed which Atreus did
unto Thyestes child,
(Although Thyest his brother, then
his spousall bed defyld)
His gryesly ghoast comes back again
from deep infernal pyt,
To make revenge in Aegists heart,
his only son to sit.
That fylthy great adulter, straight
to strife and blood yprest,
Thyestiall tables to reuendg,
does scarcely take his rest.
First Atreus life he seeks, then, while
that Agamemnon lay
In Castrall camp, by Troyan town
for countries cause, straight way
This drousie swynehead fylthy he
in brutysh pleasures wrapped,
Has Agamemnons loving wife,
in Cupid^ snares entrapt.
Whereby, of sacred Hymeneus
the bonds, he makes her flye^
And, Agamemnons pryuate bed,
through pleasure to deny.
And, which is greatter grief then this,
and vyllany most vile,
with deadly thought he makes the wife
upon her husband smyle,
When as tryumphantly he came
a conqueror from Troy:
To thend he, should suspecte the less,
and have the greater joy,
And thinking naught, but mening well:
might take a cursed coat,
Which doing on, they ea^ly might
the sooner cut his throat.
This deed was done: by Talyon law
here blood did blood requyer:
And now Thyest has that revenge,
that he did long desyer.
Whereby thou chiefly may be taught
the prouydence of god:
That so long after, Atreus fact
Thyests revenge abod.
And to thy self take better heed,
least loytryng still in sin,
In pinching slanders, touching talk
(whear greater greefes begin)
Thy self alone thou do not plague,
which of it self is much,
But also make thine after stock
to smarte, and for thy ^uche.
For be thou sure, though god does spare
thee for a season here,
And suffer thee with poisoned tongue
to frump, and carp this gere,
That either thou thy self shall feel
some bitter bytyng greese,
Or else shall thy posterytie
with pain have their relief:
Unluckye children reap, that wicked
parents hands have sown:
A warye wight, by others woes
that knows tauoyde his own.
Learn here to live a right, and know
how that thear is a god,
That well deseruers well rewards,
andd ill, does scurge with rod.
For to this and is this compylde
this play thou have in hand,
In virtues race to make thee run,
and vice for to withstand.
Which well deseruyng work of his,
if thou can well digest,
Then shall thou have his buddyng pen,
to greater matters pre^t.
W. R. to the Reader.
IF troublous toils most tragical,
Or blooddie broils of enuyous i^e,
Discrybde with art poetycall
Can move thye heart or set on fire
Thy wavering mind, then still proceed
With good advise this book to read.
For here in is sent furthe at large,
With sugared sopps of lettered tongue,
Thun stable state of glorious barge,
Which enuyous heart has freshlie stong^
For when that hate increases i^e,
Naught else but death can quench y^ fire.
What did avayle the martial deeds,
Which Agamemnons valyant hand
Did bring to pass? they sow the seeds
Of enuyous hate in Mycene land:
For Aegist, and his cruel wife,
At length do ridd him of his life.
Of fycle fortunes waueryng wyles
This book ensample does declare,
For when most pleasauntlye she smyles,
She does naught else but plant a snare,
To catch at length with woeful channce
The sa^e, whom she aloft did vaunce.
I need not praise this goulden book,
So fullye freyght with lerninges ^ore,
The work enough (if thou do look)
Does praise it self, and neads no more:
For words avails not a rushe,
And good wine neads no tau^rne b^she.
Therefore ear that thou have it redd.
With temerous rancour judge none ill,
For often the churlyshe curyous hedd
Condemns youth as wantyng skyll:
Yet Daniell young sent Iudithe rest,
When horye hedds had her oppressed.
Idem in Zoilum.
ZOile quid friends? quid mandis spumea labra?
Quid vol at horrisono fulmen ab ore tu^?
Euome corrupto tabescens gultu^e virus:
Eructa bullas O furibunde vafras
Faucibus igniuomis minitans et dente lupino:
Proeda tuo denti non opus istud erit.
Non potes istius calami corrumpere fructus^
Conseruat famulos magna Minerua s^os.
Insulsus nitidum reprehendit suitor Apell^m.
Inuidiam virtus clara praeire solet.
Zoile tuque, furis, iuuenis quum musa triumphet,
Iratus turges: verbula vana vomis.
Ipse tamen rigidi peries Acherontis in vrna,
Et Phlegethonteas ante natabis aquas,
Quam tu Studlei dimittes carmen in vmbras,
Quam possis nomen dilacerare suum.
Perpetuo viuet res inuictissima virtus,
Non abolent enses, vnda, necignis eam.
H. C. To the reader.
BE not to rash in iudgyng ought,
but way well in thy mind
The pleasure, and commodity,
that thou herein shall find.
And deem him not presumtious,
whom muses moved right,
The statlye style of Senec. sage
in vulgar verse to wryght,
For though the work of grauer age,
the connyng seem to crave,
Sumtyme we se yet younger years,
a ryper wit to have.
Accept it therefore, as it is,
(of grener years in deed)
And as his pains deserves praise,
So pay him for his meede.
To the Reader. Thomas Delapeend in the Translatours behalf.
IN volume small^ a present great
a worthy gift to thee
Good reader here is offered,
if thou so thankful be.
According to the value full,
the same for to receue:
Uouchsaufyng for the writers pains,
deserved pains to give.
He bouldly has presented here
unto thy gasyng eyes,
The wisdom great, and worthy thinges^
which erst by Tragedyes
Sage Senec showing, so sometime
in latin verse did write.
The same, in perfect englysh ryme
this Author does endyte.
Which, though thy skilful judgment may
dyscerne of praise to be
Well worthy. Yet by this, I do
commend the same to thee,
Because that virtue praised ^tyll,
increases every wheare:
And that, each readers rygour hard,
the learned should not fear.
Sith fame and virtue, evermore
pale Envy does pursue,
Nor Homer great him self could styng^
of slanderous words eschew:
Contented better, men may take
the lot, which unto all
That ever wrote, (till this time) does
a like in commen fall.
Though curious c^rping Zoili,
bread rancour black within
Their poysened breasts, of infamy
the spytefull thread to spyn,
Let folly feed their frensye styll^
unto their own dyspyte:
For men dyscrete and learned will
read things with judgment right.
W. Parkar to the Reader.
TO beat ye brain about such trifling toys
whose vain delights by fickle fa^sie fed,
Enforce ye mind tembrace such fadyng joys,
Does argue plain a fond unsteadfast head,
As to inuey, enraged with rancours bile,
and rail on the^, whose works deserves praise,
Or else to gloss, and paint with colored style
Their cloked craft, when reasons ground decays:
Or as the proud enflamed with desyer
Of praise, and gape for glorious renoume,
Have utter shame (their due reward and hyer)
Whereas they hopte of an immortal crown.
And some there be, that pining pangs of love
Describe at large, and show their frantic fits,
( Cupidoes thrals) whom fond affections move,
plain to bewray their wanto^ wavering wits.
But Studley prict with fervent hearty zeal,
And virtues force prevailing in his mind,
Regarding laud and honor never a deal,
Not raunging wide like harebraynd rouers blid
attempted has, to publish this his book,
This tragedy of worthy Seneca,
whose sawes profou^d (who so thereon do look)
To virtues race do show a ready way.
Persist therefore, thy happy years to train
In science lore, that fame thy brute may blase,
And sound thy praise, that ever shall remain:
No term oftyme thy doings may deface.
T. B. To. the Reader.
WHen Heiwood did in perfect verse,
and dolfull tune set out,
And by his smouth and fyled style
declared had about,
What roughe reproach the Troyans o^
the hardy Greeks received,
When they of town, of goods, and lyue^
together were depryued.
How well did then his freindes requite
his travail and his pain,
When unto him they have (as due)
ten thousand thanks again?
What greater praise might Virgill get^
what more reno^me then this,
Could have been given unto him,
for writing verse of his?
Did Virgill ought re^uest but this,
in labouryng to excel?
Or what did fame give to him more,
then praise to bear the bell?
May Heywood this alone get praise,
and Phaer be clean forgott.
Whose verse and style does far surmoun^
and gotten has the lot?
Or may not Googe have part with him,
whose travail and whose pain,
Whose verse also is full as good,
or better of the twain?
A Neuyle also one there is,
in verse that gyues no place
To Heiwood (though he be full good)
in vsyng of his grace.
Nor Goldinge can have less renome,
which Ovid did translate:
And by the thondryng of his vers^
has set in chair of state.
With him also (as seems me)
our Edwardes may compare,
Who nothing gyuyng place to him
does sit in egall chair.
A great sort more I reckon might,
with Heiwood to compare,
And this our Aucthor one of them
to compte I will not spare.
Whose pains is egall with the re^^
in this he has begun,
And lesser praise deserves not
then Heiwoods work has done.
Gy^e therefore Studley part of prayse^
to recompense his pain:
For egall labor evermore,
deserves egall gain.
Read ear thou judge, then judge thy fill.
But judge the best, and mend the ill
Vale.

To the right honorable sir William Secill, knight. One of the most honorable
privy Counsel, Master of the Wards and Liueries, Secretary to the Queens
hyghnes, and Chancelour of ye University of Cambridge. John Studley, wishes
long life, with increse of honor.
WHen as I had (right honorable Sir) at the request of my friends, both
performed and minded to publysh this my simple translation of so notable a
Tragedy, written by the prudent, and sage S^neca: I thought it good for diverse
consideracions^ to bestow this the first fruits of my good will, and travail,
rather upon your honor, the^ upon any other person: first in y^ I considered
your honors aucthorie, wisdom, and learning, (taking the tuicion of it upon
you) might be a ter^rour, and abashment, to such slanderous tongues, who by my
simple and slender skill, either in this or any other like faculty, might take
courage rather of maliciousnes (then of right) to reprehend my doings,
furthermore having understanding partlye by the report of men, and partly
perceauyng when I was sometime scholar in the Queens maiestties Grammar schole
at Westmins^er, the hartye goodwill, and friendly aff^ction^ that your honor
bare toward all students, I conceived this hope, that you would accept my
good will and doings the better, in that I profess my self to be a student,
and that in the vnyuersytye of Cambrydge, wherein sometime your honor were
trained up in learning, and now being most worthelie Chaunceler there of, do
greatly tender the commo^y^ye of the students in the same, with the
advancement and increase of learny^ge, furtheraunce of v^rtue, and abolyshment
of vice. Thus th^rfore trusty^g y^u^ honors court^sie will have me ^xc^s^d for
my rude boldenes. and except my good will herein sygnyfyed, I leave you to the
turssyon of allmyghtye god, who increase you with honor, grant you long life
with eternal felycytye.

Your honors to command, John Studley.

The Preface to the Reader.
Behold gentle Reader, how SENECA in this present Tragedy has most lively
painted out unto thee, the vnstabilytie of fortune, who when she has advanced
to the highest him, with whom (as the cat with the mouse) it likes her to daly,
sodeinly she t^rning her wheel, does let him fall to greater mysery, then was
his former felicity: whereof AGAMEMNON may be a perfect pattern, as is at large
showed in the Tragedy it self: which although it be but groslye, and after a
rude manner translated, contemn it not for the b^senes of the phrase, but
embrace it for the excellency of the matter therein contained. And although
that the other Tragedies which are set furthe by Jasper Hetwood and Alexander
Neuyle, are so excellently well done (that in reading of them it seems to me
no translation, but even SENECA him self to speak in englysh) take no offense
that I (being one of the most that can do least) have thus rashly attempted
so great an enterprise, to mingle my barbarusnes with others eloquencie: for when
I had at the ernest request of certain my familiar friends, thus rudelye
perfurmed the same, they yet not satysfyed herewith willed me, not to hyde and
keep to my self that small talent which god has lent unto me to serve my
country with all, but rather to apply it to the use of such young Students as
thereby might take some commodity, therewith I consideringe, that keeping it
close it could profit nothing, and again being published it could do no
hurt, trusting of thy gentleness that thou will esteine this my good will, I
have presumed to set it forth thus simply and rudely: submitting it to the
freindly correction of the learned. Thus desiringe thee to bear with my
boldness, and pardon my ignorance, I leave thee to God.

Farewell.

Greeks. Cassandra. Agamemnon. Electra. Str^philus.
The first Act.
Thyestes. SEparting from ye darkened dens
which Ditis low does keep,
Lo here I am sent out again
from Tartar dungeon ^^pe,
Thy^stes I, that whether coast
to shun do stand in doubt,
Thinfernall fe^ndes I fly, the ^oalke
of earth I chase about.
My conscience lo abhors, that I
should heth^r passage make,
Appauled sore with fear and dread
my tremblyng sine w^ shake:
My fathers house, or rather yet
my brothers I espy,
This is the old and antique porch^
of Pelops progenye.
Here first the Greeks on p^^nces hedds
do place the royal crown,
And here in throne aloft they lie,
that lets up and down,
With statelye Scepter in their hand,
eake here their courts do lie,
This is their place of banquetyng,
return therefore will I.
Nay: beter were it not to haunt
the loathsome Limbo lakes,
Where as the stygion porter does
advance with lustye crakes
His tryple gorge be hong with mane
shagg hearye, rustie, black:
Where Ixions carkas linked fa^^,
the whyrlyng whele does rack,
And rowleth still upon him self:
whear as full often in vain
Much toil is lost, (the tottryng stone
down tomblyng back again)
Whear growing guts the gredie gripe
do gnaw with rauenyng bitts.
Where parched up with burning thur^^
amydd the waves he ^ytts,
And gapes to catch the fletyng flood
with hungry chapps beguylde,
That paies his painful punishment,
whose fea^^ the gods defylde:
Yet that old man so step^ in years
at length by tract of time,
How great a part belonges to me
and portion of his crime?
Account we all the grysly ghostes,
whom gyltie found of ill,
The Gnosian judge in plutoes pytts
^oth t^sse in torments still:
Thyestes I in dryrye deeds
will far surmount the rest,
Yet to my brother yield I, (though
I gorged my blooddye breast,
And stuffed have my pawmpred panche
even with my children three,
That crammedly with in my rybbes,
and have their tomb in me,
The bowels of my swalowed babes,
deuowred up I have,
Nor fyckle fortune me alone
the father does deprave,
But enterprysyng greater gylt
then that is put in ure,
To fyle my daughters bawdye bed,
my lust she does alure.
To speak these words I do not spare,
I wrought the heinous deed,
That therefore I through all my stock,
might parent still procead.
My daughter driven by force of ^a^es
and destenyes deuyne,
Does bread young bones, and lades her womb,
w^ sinful ^eede of mine.
Lo nature changed vpsyde down,
and out of order turnde
This myngle mangle has she made,
(O fact to be forlorn^^.)
A father and a grandsyre lo,
confusedlye I am,
My daughters husband both become,
and father to the ^ame.
Those babes yt should my nephews be,
when nature ryghtlye runns,
She being iumbled does confound,
and myngle with my sonns.
The crystal clearenes of the day,
and Phoebus beams so bright,
Ar myxed with the foggye clouds,
and darkness dym of night.
When wyckednes had weryed us,
to late truce taken was,
Even when our detestable deeds
were done and brought to pass.
But valyant Agamem^on he
graund captain of the o^te
Who bare the sway among the kings,
and ruled all the roste,
Whose flanting flagg, and banner bra^^,
displayed in royal sort,
A thousand sail of sowsyng shypps
did guard to Phrygian port,
And with their swelling shatling s^iles:
the surging seas did hyde,
That heateth on the banks of Tr^ye,
and flows ^y her side:
When Phoebus cart the Zodiac
ten times had over run,
And wa^te the battred walls do lie
of Troy destroyde and won,
Retournd he is to yield his throat
unto his traytresse wife,
That shall with force of blooddie blade
beryue him of his life.
The glytering swerd, the hewing axe,
and woundyng weapons mo,
With blood for blood new set a broche
shall make the floor to flow.
With sturdy stroke, and boysteous blow,
of pythye Pollar given
His beaten brains are pasht abroad,
his cracked skull is reuen.
Now myschiefe marches on a pace,
Now falshod does appear,
Now butchers slaughter does approach,
and murder draws near.
In honowr of thye natyue day
Aegisthus they prepare
The sollemne feast with i^n^ketyng,
and dayntie tothsom fare.
Fie, what does shame abashe thee so,
and cause thy courage quayle?
Why doubts thy right hand what to do?
to smite why does it fail?
What he forecastyng might suspect,
why should thou take advise?
Why fret^est thou, demaundyng if
thou may it enterpryse^
Nay: if amother it beseme,
thou rather may surmyse.
What now? how happens it that thus
the smylyng summers night,
When Phoebus from Thantipodes
should render sone the light,
On sudden chau^g their turns with nights
that last and lyng^r long,
When wynters bore as bitter blastes,
does puff the trees among?
Or what does cause the glydyng ^tarrs
to stay still in the sky?
We wayght for Phoebus: to the world
bring day now by and by.

Chorus.
O Fortune, that do fail
the great estate of kings,
on slyppery slydyng seat
thou placest lofty things
And syt^t on tottring sort,
where peryls do abound
yet never kingdom calm,
nor quiet could be found:
No day to scepters sure,
does shine, that they might say,
To morrow shall we rule,
as we have don to day.
One clod of crooked care
another brings in,
One hurlye burlye done,
another does begin:
Not so the ragyng sea
does boil upon the sand,
Whear as the southern wynd
that blows in Affryck land,
One wave upon another
does heap with sturdye blast:
Not so does Euxine sea,
his swellyng waves up cast:
Nor so his belchyng stream
from shallow bottom roll,
That borders hard upon
the ysye frosen poall:
Whear as Boots bright
does twyne his wayne about,
And of the marble seas
does nothing stand in doubt.
O how does fortune toss
and tomble in her whele
The staggring states of kings,
that reddye be to rele?
Fay^e would they dreded be,
and yet not settled so
When as they feared are,
they fear and live in woe.
The sylent Lady night
so sweet to man and beast,
Can not bestow on them
her safe and quiet rest:
Sleep that does ouercom
and break the bond^s of grief,
I cannot ease their har^es,
nor mynister relief:
What castle stronglye buylt,
what Bulwark, tower, or town,
Is not by mischyfes means,
brought topsye tur^ey down?
What ramperd walls are not
made weak by wicked war?
From statelye courts of kings
does justice fly afar:
In pryncelye pallacies,
of honesty the lore,
And wedlock now devout,
is set by little store.
The bloodye Bellon th^se
does ha^nt with gorye hand,
Whose light and vain conceit
in painted pomp does stand.
And those Erinnys wood
turmoyles with frensyes fitts,
That ever more in proud
and hautie howses sitts,
Which fycle fortunes hand
in twynklyng of an eye,
From high and proud degree
dryues down in dust to lie.
Although that skyrmish ^eace,
no banners be displayed
And though no wyles be wrought
and pollecye be stayed,
Down paysed with their wayght
the massy things do synke,
And from her burden does
unstable fortune shrynke.
The swelling Sails pu^t up
with gale of western wind,
Do yet mystrust thereof
a tempest in their mind:
The threatnyng tops (that touch
the clouds) of loftye towers
Be sonest paid and bett
with south wynd raynye showers:
The darksome wood does see
his tough and sturdye Oak,
Well waynd in years to be
clean ouerthrown and broke:
The lyghtnyngs flashyng flame
out breakyng in the sky,
First lyghteth on the mountes,
and hylls that are most hye.
The bodies corpule^t
and of the largest syese
Are ryfest still to catch
deseases when they rise.
When as the flock to g^ase,
in pasture fat is putt,
Whose neck is larded best,
his throat shall first be cut:
What f^rtune does advance,
and hoysteth up on hy^,
She setes it up to fall
again more greuouslye.
The things of myddle sort,
and of a mean degree,
Endure above the rest
and longest days do see:
The man of mean estate
most happy is of all,
Who pleased with the lot
that does to him befall,
Does sail on sylent shore.
with calm and quiet tide,
And dreads with bruised barge
on swellyng seas to ride:
Nor lawncyng to the deep
where bottom none is found,
may with his rudder search,
and reach the shallow grownd.
The second Act.
Clytemnestr^. Nutrix. O Drowsy dreaming dotyng soul,
what comes in thy brain,
To seek about for thy defense
what way thou may attain?
What aiels thy skittish waiward wits,
to waver up and down?
The fyttest shyft prevented is,
the best path ouergrown:
Thou myghtest ons mayntayned have
thy wedl^ck chamber chaste,
And eak have ruled with majesty,
by faith conjoined fast:
Now nurtures lore neglected is,
all right does clean decay,
Relygion and dygnitie
with faith are worn away:
And ruddy sha^e with blushing cheeks
so far god ^ot is past,
That when it would it cannot now
com home again at last.
O let me now at randon run
with bridle at my will:
The safest path to myschyfe is
by myschef open still.
Now put in practyss^, seek about,
search out and learn to find
The wily traynes, and craftye guyles
of wicked woman kind:
What any dyuelysh tray^erous dame
durst do in workyng woe,
Or any wounded in her wits
by shot of Cupids bow:
What ever rygorous stepdame could
committ with desperate hand,
Or as the wenche who flaming fast
by Venus poysonyng brand,
Was dreuen by lewd vncesteous love
in shypp of thessail land,
To flytt away from Cholchos I Will,
where Ph^sis channel deep
With silver stream down from y^ hills
of Armenie does swepe.
Get weapons good, get bylbow blades,
or temper poison strong,
Or with some yonker trudge from Greece
by theft the seas along:
Why do thou faint to talk of theft,
exile, or privy flight?
These came by hap: thou therefore must
on greater myschife light.
Nu. (O worthy queen) among ye Greeks
that bears the swinging ^waye
And borne of Ledas royal blood,
what mut^r^ng do thou say^?
What furye fell enforces the,
bereued of thy wits,
To rage and rave with bedlam brains,
to frett with frantic fitts?
Though madam thou do counsel keep,
and not complain thy case,
Thine anguysh plain appears in
thy pale and wanny face:
Reueal therefore what is thy grefe,
take leisure good and stay,
What reason could not remedy,
often eured has delay.

Cly. So grievous is my careful case
which plun^eth me so sore^
That deal I cannot with delay,
nor linger ^nye more.
The flashing flames, and furyous force
of fyrye fervent heat,
Outragyng in my boylyng breast,
my burning bones does beat:
It suckes the sappye marowe out,
the joyce it does conuaye,
It frets, it tears, it rents, it gnawes,
my guts and gall away.
Now feeble fear still eggs me on
(with dolor being pressed)
And cancred hate with thwacking thumps
does bounce upon my breast:
The blinded boy that lovers hearts
does reave with deadly stroke,
Entangled has my lynked mind
with lewd and wanton yoke:
Refusyng still to take afoyle,
or clean to be confound,
Among these broils, and agonyes
my mind besegyng rownd,
Lo feeble, wery^ battred down,
and under trodden shame,
That wresteth, strives, strugleth hard,
and fyghteth with the same.
Thus am I driven to diverse shores,
and beat from bancke to bank^,
And tossed in the fomye floods,
that strive with courage crancke.
As when here wynd, and there ye stream
when both their force will try,
From sands allow, does hoyst and rear
the seas with surges hye,
The waltryng wave does staggrynge stand,
not wetyng what to do,
But (houeryng) doubts, whose furious force
he best may yield him to.
My kingdom therefore I cast of,
my scepter I ^orsake
As anger, sorrow, hope, me lead,
that way I mean to take.
At all adventure to the seas
I yield my beten Barge,
At randon careless will I ron,
now will I roue at large.
Whear as my mind to fancy fond
does gad, and ron astray,
It is the best to choose that chance,
and follow on that way.

Nu. This desperate dotage does declare,
and rashness rude and blind,
To choose out chance to be the guide
and ruler of thy mind.

Cly. He that is driven to utter pynche,
and furthest shyft of all,
What neade he doubt his doutful lot,
or how his luck be fall?
In sylent shore thou saylest yet,
thy trespass we may hyde,
If thou thy self detect it not,
nor cause it be dyscryde.

Cly. Alas it is more blasd abroad,
and further is it blown,
Then any crime that ever in
this pryncelye court was sown.

Nu Thy former fault with pensive heart
and sorrow thou doste rue,
And fondly yet thou go about,
to set abroche anew,

Cly. It is auery folyshnes
to keep a mean therein,

Nu. The thing he fears he does augme^t,
who heapeth syn to syn.

Cly. But fire and sword to cure the same,
the place of salve supplye.

Nu. There is no man who at the first
extremytie will try.

Cly. In workyng myschyfe men do take
the redyest way they find.

Nu. The sacred name of wedlock once
revoke and have in mind,

Cly. Ten years have I bin desolate,
and led a wydowes life.
Yet shall I enter^ay^e anew
my husband as his wife?

Nu. Consydor yet thy son and ha^^e
whom he of the begot^

Cly. And eke my daughters wedding blase
as yet forget I not.
Achilles eke my son in law
to mind I do not spare,
How well he kept his vow that he
to me his mother swear.

Nu. When as our nauye might not pass
by wynd, nor yet by stream,
Thy daughters blood in sacryfyce
their passage did redeem:
She sturd and brake the sluggysh seas,
whose water still did stand,
Whose feeble force might not hoyse up,
the vessels from the land.

Cly. I am ashamed herewith all,
it makes me repyne,
That Tyndaris (who from the gods
does fetch her noble lygne)
Should give the ghost tasswage ye wrath
of gods and them appeas,
Whereby the grekyshe nauye might
have passage free by seas.
My grudgyng mind still harpes upon
my daughters weddyng day,
Whom he has made for Pelops stock
the blooddye rawnsam pay.
When as with cruel countenance
embrewd with gorye blood,
As at a weddyng alter side
thunpy^yfull parent stood,
It erk^d Calchas woeful heart,
who did abhor the same,
His Oracle he rewd, and eake
the back reflyctyng flame.
O wicked and ungracious stock
that winnest ill with ill,
Tryumphyng in thy fylthy feats,
encreasyng lewdnes still.
By blood we win ye wavering winds,
By death we purchase war.

Nu. But by this means a thousand ships
at once released ar:

Cly. With lucky fate attempt the seas
did not the losed rowt?
For Aulis I Will, thungracious flete,
from port did tumble out:
As with alewd unlucky hand
the war he did begin,
So fortune favored his su^ces
to thryue no more therein.
Her love as capty^e holds him
whom captyue he did take.
Not moved with the ernest suit
that could Achilles make,
Of Phoebus prelat Sminthicall
he did retain the spoil:
When for the sacred virgins love
his furious breast does boil:
Achilles rough and thundering threats
could not him ^ualyfye,
Nor he that does dir^^t the fa^es
above the starrye sky.
To us he is an Augur just,
and kepes his promys dewe^
But while he threats his captive truls
of word he is not tr^w.
The savage people fearce in wrath
once might not move his spright,
Who did purloyne the kyndled tents
with fire blasyng bright:
When slaughter great on Greeks was made
in most extremest fight
Without a foe he conquered.
with leanes pynes away
In lewd and wanton chamber tricks
he spendes the idle day,
And freshly (...) he ^e^des his lust,
least that some other while
His chamber chaste should want a stews,
that might the ^ame defyle.
On Lady Brises love again
his faneye fond does stand,
Whom he has got, tha^ wrested was
out of Achilles hand.
And carnal copulacion
to have he does not shame,,
Though from her husbands bosom he
has snacht the wicked dame,
Tushe, he that does at Paris grudge,
With wound but newly stroke
Eflamd with Phrygian Prophets love,
his boiling breast does smoke.
Now after Troyan boties brave,
and Troy ouerwhelmd he saw,
Retournd he is a prisoners spouse,
and Priams son in law.
Now heart be bold, take courage good,
of stomach now bestowt,
A fyelde that easily is not fought,
to pytche thou go about.
In practys myschife thou must put,
why hopste thou for a day,
While Priams daughter com from Troy
in Greece do bear the swaye?
But as for the poor selye wretch,
a wayteth at thy place
Thye wyddow, virgyns, and Orest
his fatherlyke in face,
Consider their calamytyes,
to com, and eake their cares,
Whom all the peril of the broyle
does threat in thy affairs.
O cursed captyue, woeful wretch,
why do thou loyter so?
Thy little brats a stepdame have,
whose wrath will work their woe.
With gasshing swerd (and if thou can
none other way provide)
Nor thrust it through an others ribs,
then launche thy gory side.
So murder twain with brew^d blood,
let blood immixed be,
And by destroyeng of thye self
destroy thy spouse with thee.
Death is not sawst with sops of sorrow
if some man else I have,
Whose breathl^sse corse I wish to pass
with me to deadlye grave.

Nu. Queen, bridle thine affections,
and wyselye rule ^^y rage,
Thy swellyng mood now myt^igate,
thy chollure eke assuage.
Way well the wayghtye enterprise
that thou do take in hand,
Tryumphant victor be retournes
of mighty Asia land
Auengyng Europs iniurye,
with him he bryngs away
The spoils of sacked Pargamie,
a huge and myghtie pray.
In bondage eake he leads the foalke
of long assaulted Troy^,
Yet dare thou by pollecye
attempt him to annoye?
Whom with the dynt of glittryng swerd
Achilles durst not harm,
Although his rash and desperate dick^
The froward knight did arme^
Nor Ajax yet more hardye man
up yeldyng vital breath,
Whom frantycke iurye fell enforste
to wound him self to death:
Nor Hector, he, whose only life
procuerd the Greeks delay,
And long in war for victory
enforced them to stay
Nor Paris shaft, whose connyng hand
with shot so sure did aim:
Nor mighty Memnon swart and black,
had power to hurt the same:
Nor Xan^hus flood, where to and froe
dead ca^kasis did swyme,
With armor hewd and there with all
some maimed broken lyme:
Nor Simois, that purple wawmes
with slaughter died does steare.
Nor Cygnus Lylly whyght, the sonn^
of fenny god so dear:
Nor yet the mu^teryng Thracian host:
nor warlyke Re^sus king:
Nor Amazons, who to the wars
did painted Quiuers bring,
And bare their har^hets in their hands,
with target, and with sheylde,
Yet had no power with ghastly wound
to foil him in the feylde.
Sith he such scourynges has escapte,
and plunge of peryls paste,
Entendest thou to murder him,
returning home at last?
And sacred alters to profane
with slaughter so v^^ure?
Shall Greece thaduenger, let this wroug
long vnreuengd endure?
The g^ym and fearce coragious horse,
the battails shou^es and cries,
The swelling seas which brus^d barks
do dread, when storms arise,
Behold the feildes with streams of blood
overflowed and depely dro^^d,
And all the Cheualrie of Troy
in servile bondage bound,
Which Greeks have writ in registers.
thy stubburne stomach bind,
Subdue thy ^onde affections,
and pacyfie thy mynd^.

The.ii. Act. The.ii. Scene.
Aegisthus. Clytemnestra. THe curssed time that evermore
my mind did most detest,
The dais that I abhorred have
and hated in my breast,
Are come, are come, that mine estate
will bring to utter wrack:
Alas my heart, why do thou fail,
and fayntyng flyest back?
What do thou mean at first assalt^
from armor thus to fly?
Trust this, the cruel gods intend^
thy dolfull destiny,
To wrap thee in with peryls round,
and catch thee in a band:
Endeuer drudge with all thy power
their plagues for to wythstand:
With stomach stout rebellious,
to fire and swerd appeal.
Cly. It is no plague, if such a death
thy natyue destnies deal.

^eg. (O partners of my peryls all,
begot of Leda thou)
Direct thy doings after mine,
and unto thee I vow,
This drosell, fluggysh ryngleader,
this stout strong har^ed ^yre,
Shall pay the so much blo^d again
as shed he has in fire.
How haps it that his tre^bling cheeks
to be so pale and whyght,
Lyenge aghast, as in a trance,
with fayntyng face vpryght?

Cly. His conscience wedlo^k vow does prick
and brynges him home again.
Let us return the self same ^rade
a new for to retain,
To which at first we should have stuck
and ought not to forsake,
To covenant contynent a new
let us our selves betake:
To take the trade of honesty
at no time is to late:
He purged is from punishment
whose heart the crime does hate.

A^g. Why whether will thou gad (o rash
and unadvised dame?)
What do thou ernestly believe,
and fyrmly trust the same,
That Agamemnons spousall bed
will loyal be to thee,
That naught does underprop thy mind
which might thy terror be?
His proud success pufte up to high
wi^h lucky blast of wind,
Might make so cranke, and set alofte
his hawty swellyng mind:
Among his pears he stately was,
er Trojan turrets torn,
How ^hynk ye then his stomach stout
by nature given to scorn,
In haughtynes agmented is
more in him self to joy,
Through this tryumphant vyctorye
and conquest got of Troy?
Before his voyage miceane king
most myl^ly did he reygne,
But now a Tyrant truculent
returned he is again.
Good luck and proud prosperytie
do make his heart so rise.
With what great preparacion
prepared solemn wise,
A rablement of strumpets come
that clonge about him all?
But yet the prophetess of Phaebe,
(whom god of truth we call)
Appears above the rest: she kepes
the king, she does him guide:
Wyl^ thou in wedlock have a mate
and not for it provide?
So would not she, the great^st grief
this is unto a wit,
Her husbands minion in her house
to lead an open life.
A queens estate can not abide
her pear with her to reygne,
And Ielous wedlock will not her
companyon sustain.

Cly. Aeg^st in desprat mode again
why se^st thou me a flote?
Why kyndlest thou the sparks of ire
in imbers covered hot?
If that the vyctors own free will
releas his captyues care,
Why may not I his lady spouse
have hope as well to fare?
One law does rule in royal throne,
and pompous pryncely towers,
Among the vulgar sort, another
in pryuate simple bowers.
what though my grudgyng fansy force
that at my husbands hand,
Sharp execution of the law
I s^ubbernly withstand?
^ecordyng this that haynous^ye
offended him I have:
^gently will me pardon grant
who need the same to crave?

Aeg. Even so? on this condition
thou may with him compounde,
To pardon him, if he again
to pardon thee be bound.
The subtle science of the law,
The statutes of our land,
(That long ago decreed were)
thou do not understand.
The Judges be malicious men,
they spy^hte and envy us,
But he shall have them parciall
his causes to dyscns.
This is the chiefest pryuiledge
that does to kings belong,
What laws forbyddeth other men
they do, and do no wrong.

Cly. He pardned Helen, she is wedd
to Menela again,
Which Europ all, with Asia
did plonge alyke in pain.

Aeg. No Ladies lust has rauyshte yet
Atrides in his life,
Nor pryuelie purloynd his heart,
betr^thed to his wife.
To pick a quarrel he begyns,
and matter thee to blame,
Suppose thou nothing have co^myt^
that worthy is of shame?
What ^oteth him whom princes hate
an honest life to frame?
He never does complain his wrong,
but ever bears the blame.
Wylt thou repair to Spart, and to
thy country trudge aryght?
Wylt thou become a ronagate,
from such a worthy wight?
Deuorcement made from kings, will not
so let the matter escape,
Thou easest fear, by fyckle hope,
that falsely thou do shape:

Cly. My trespass is dysclosd to none,
but to a trustye wight.

Aeg. At princes gates fydelytye
yet never enter might.

Cly. I will corrupt and fe^de him s^
with silver and with gould,
That I by brybyng bind him shall
no secrets to unfold:

Aeg. The trust that hired is and bought
by brybes and moneys fee,
Thy counsel to bewray a gain
with brybes entyste will be,

Cly. The remnaunt left of shamfa^nes
of those ungracious ^ryckes,
Wherein of late I did delyght,
my concience freshly prycks.
Why kepest thou such a busy stur,
and with thy flattryng speech
Enst ructyng me with lewd advise
do wicked counsel preach?
Shall I forsooth of royal blood
with all the speed I can,
Refuse the king of kings, and wed
an outcast banysht man?

Aeg. Why should you think in that Thyest
was father unto me,
And Agamemnon Atreus son
he should my better be?

Cly. If that be but a tryfle small
Ad Nephew to the same,

Aeg. I am of Phoebus lineage borne,
whereof I do not shame.
Why makste thou Phoebus aucthor of
thy wicked pedagrew,
Whom out of heaven ye forste to fly
when bridle back he drew?
When lady night with mantell black
did spread her sudden shade,
Why make thou the gods til such
reproach fulness to wade?
Whose father has thee conning made
by fleyght and subtle guyle
To make thy kynsman Cockold, while
his wife thou do defyle.
What man is he whom we do know
to be thy fathers mate,
Abusyng lust of lecherye
in such unlawful rate?
Auaunt, go pack the hence in ha^^e,
dispatche, out of my sight
This infamy, whose blemysh staynes
this blood of worthy wight.

Aeg. This is no new exile to me
that wyckednes do haunt,
But if that thou (o worthy queen)
cammaund me to a^aunt
I will not only straight avoid
the house, the town, and field,
My life on swerd at thy request
I ready am to yield.

Cly. This heinous deed permit shall I
(most churlesh cruel drab)
Against my will though I offend,
the fault I should not blab:
Nay, rather come aparte with me,
and let us join our wyts,
To wrap our selves out of this woe,
and parlous threatnyng fyts.

Chorus.
NOw chaunt it lustye laddes.
Apollos praise suborne,
To thee the frolyke flock
their crowned heads adorn.
To thee king Inachs stock
of wedlock chamber void,
Braid out their virgyns locks
and thereon have employed,
Their sauorie garlandes green
It wy^t of Laurel bow.
Draw nere with us o Thebes,
our daunsyng follow thou.
Come also ye, that drink
of Ismen bublyng flood,
Whereas the Laurel tree
full thycke on banks does bood.
Eke ye whom Man do mild,
the Prophetess divine,
(Foreseenge fate) and borne
of high Tiresias lygne,
Has styrd to celebrate
with sacred use and right
Appollo and Dian
borne of Latona bright.
O victor Phaebe unbend
thy nocked ^owe again,
Sith quyetnes and peace
anew we do retain.
And let thy twa^ckling harp
make melody so sh^yll,
While that thy nymble hand
stryke quauers with thy quill.
No curious descant I
nor lus^ie music cr^ue,
No ioly rumbling note,
nor trowlyng tune to have.
But on thy treble Lute
(according to thy use)
St^yke up a plain song note,
as when thy learned Muse
Thy lessons do record,
though yet on baser string
It lyketh thee to play
the song that thou did sing:
As when from fyry heaven
the dynt of lyghtnyng flew,
Sent down by wrath of gods,
the Titans overthrew.
Or else when mou^tains were
on mountains heaped hye
That raise for G^auntes fell
their steps into the sky,
The mountain Ossa stood
on top of Pelion laid,
Olymp (whereon the Pynes
their buddyng branches brayd)
Down paised both: draw nere
o Iun^ noble dame,
Both spouse of mighty Jove
and sister to the same:
Thou that do r^le with him
made ioynter of his mace,
Thy people we of Greece
give honor to thy grace:
Thou only do protect
from peryls Argos land,
That ever careful was
to have thine honor stand,
(Most supplient there unto)
thou also with thy might
Do order joyful peace
and battles fearce of fight,
Accept o conquering queen
these branches of the bays,
That Agamemnon here
does yield unto thy praise:
The holow boxen pype
(that does with holes abound)
In syngyng unto thee
does give a solemn sound:
To thee the damsels ek^
that play upon the strings,
With connyng harmony
m^lodious music synges.
The ma^rons eke of Gr^c^
by ryper years more grave,
To thee the ^aper pay,
that vowed often they have,
The beyferd young and whit^
companyon of the Full
Unskilful, yet by proof
the paynful pl^in to pull,
whose neck was never worn^
nor gald with prynt of yoke,
Is in thy temple slain
receiving deadly stroke.
O laid Pallas thou
of most renoumned hap
Bred of the brain of Jove
that smytes with thonder clap.
Thou lofty Trojan ^owres
of craggy knotty flynt
Have bet with battryng blade,
and struck with iauelyng dyn^^
The elder matrons with
the dames that younger be
Together in myngled heaps
do hono^r due to thee.
when tho^ approaching nighe
thy coming is espyde,
The preiste vnbarrs the gate
and opes the Temple wide:
By clustring thronges the flocks
thine altars haunt apace,
Bedecte with twysted crowns
so trym with comely grace.
The old and ancient men
well stepped and grown in years,
Whose feeble tremblyng age
precureth horye hear^s,
Obteyning their request
craved of thy grace deuyne,
Do offer up to thee
their sacryficed wine,
O bright Dian whose blase
sheds light three sundry ways,
We myn^full are of thee,
and render thankful praise,
Delon thy natyue soil
thou dyddest fyrmly bind,
That to and fro was wont
to wander with the wind:
Which with foundation sure
mayn ground for byd^ to pass:
For Nauies (after which
to swim it wonted was)
It is become a Road
defyenge force of wind,
The mothers funerals
of Tantalus his kind.
The daughters seven by death
thou victresse do account,
Whose mother Niobe
abydes on Sipill mount
A lamentable rock,
and yet unto this hour
Her tears new gusshyng, out
the marble old does power.
The godhead of the twins
in sumpteous solemn wise,
Both man and wife adore
with sauory sacryfyse.
But thee above the rest,
o father great and guide,
Whose mighty force is b^
the burning lightning tryde^
Who when thou gave a beek
and did thy head but shake,
At once the^tremest poales
of heaven and earth did quake.
O Jupiter the rote
that of our lynage art,
Accept these offered gifts
and take them in good part:
And thou o graundsire great
^o thy posterity
Have some remors, that do
not swarne in chyual^ye.
But yonder ^o with stiuing steps
the soldi^r comes a main
In all post have, with token that
good news declares plain
A laurel branch, that hangs on
his spear head he does bring:
Eurybates is come, who has been trustye to the king.
The third Act.
Eurybates. Clytemnestra. SOre tired after many years
with travail and with toil
Scant credityng my self, the Gods
of this my natyue soil,
The temple, and the alters of
the saints that rule the sky,
In humble sort with reverence
devoutly worship I.
Now pay your vows unto the Gods:
returned is again
Unto his countr^y court, where wont
he was to rule, and reygne,
Prince Agamemnon, victor he,
of Greece the great r^n^um^.
Cly. The tidings of a message good
unto mine ears is blown.
Where stays my spouse who^ longing for
ten years I have out scand?
What does he yet sail on the seas,
or is he come a land?
Yet has he fyxt and set his foot
back stepping home again
Upon the sandy shore, that long
he wisshed to artayne?
And does he still enjoy his health
enhaunc^e in glory great,
And painted out in pomp of prays
whose fame the sky does beat?

Eury. Bless we with burning sacryfyce,
at length this luckye day.

Cly. And eke the gods though gracious
Yet dealyng long delay:
Declare if that my brothers wife
enjoy the vital air,
And tell me, to what kind of Coast
my sister does repair.

Eury. God grant and give us better news
then this that thou do crave:
The heavy hap of fyghtyng floods
^orbyddes the truth to have.
Our scat^red fleet the swelling seas
attemptes in such a plyght,
That ship from ship was taken clean
out of each others sight.
Atrides in the waters wide
turmoyld and strayeng far,
More vyolence by seas sustaind
then by the blooddy war.
And as it were a conquered man
escaping home all weete
Now brings in his company
of such a mighty fleet,
A sort of bruised broken barks,
beshaken, torn, and rent.

Cly. Show what unlucky chance it is
that has our Nauye spent,
What storm of seas dispersed has
our Captains hear and theare?

Eury. Thou willest me to make report
of heavy woeful gear.
Thou biddest me most grievous news
with tidings good to part:
For vttryng of this woeful hap
my feeble mind does starte.
And horrybly appauled is
with this so monstrous ill.

Cly. Speak out, and utter it: him self
with terror he does fill,
Whose heart his own calamytie
and carke, does loathe to know:
The heart whom doubted damage duls
with greater grief does glow.

Eury. When Trojan buyldings blasing bright
did burn away, and broyle,
Enkindled first by Grekish brand,
they fall to part the spoil:
Repairing fast unto the seas
again we come a boorde,
And now the soldiers weary loins
were eased of his sword,
Their bucklers cast aside upon
the hatches lie above:
Their warlike hands in practice put,
and Oers learn to move:
Each little hyndraunce semes to much
to them in hasty plyght,
When of recours the Admiral,
gave watchword by his light,
And trumpet blast began to call
our army from delay,
The painted Pup with gilded snowt
did first guide on the way:
And cut the course, which fol^ing on
a thousand ships did ryue,
Then first a wind with p^pling puffes
our launcing ships did drive:
Which glyded down upon our sails:
the water being calm
With breath of western wind so mild
scant moved any walme.
The shynyng seas bespred about
with ships, does glyster bright,
And also couerd with the same,
lay hyd fro Phoebus light:
It does us good, to gase upon
the nak^d shore of Troy:
The desarte Phrygian plots so bar^
to vewe, we hopp for joy:
The youth echone besturrs the^ selves,
and strykyng altogether
They tough their ores, and with their toyl^
they help the wind and weather.
They tug, and chearly row by course,
the spyrtyng seas up dash,
Against the ratlyng rybs of ships
The flapping floods do flash^
The hory froth of wrestlyng waves
which ores alo^t does raise,
Do draw and trace a furrow through
the marble faced seas.
When stronger blast with belly swollen
our hoysted sails did fill,
They row no more, but let the Pup
to go with wind at will,
Their sheryng Ore^ laid aside
our Pilot does espy,
How far from any land aloof
our sails reculyng fly.
Or bloody batells does displaye,
the threats of Hector stout,
Or of his ratlyng Waggins tells,
wherein he rode about:
Or how his gasshed carckas slain
and traynd about the fylde,
To funeral flames, and obit ryghtes
for coin again was yield.
How Jupiter embathed was
all in his royal blood.
The frolyck fyshe desposed was
to mirth in Tyrren flood,
And fetchyng fryskes both in and out
plays on the waters brym,
And on his broad and fynny back^
about the seas does swym,
With gamballs quick in rings arou^d,
and side to side enclynd,
Erwhyle he sportes afront the pup,
and whyps again behynd,
Now fydlyng on the snout before,
the dalyeng wanton rowt
With iocundarye ioly tryckes
does skyp the flete about.
Sometime he stands gasyng on
and eyes the vessels bright,
Now every shore is covered clean,
and land is out of sight,
The parlous poynct of Ida rock
in sight does open lie,
And that alone espy we could
with fyrm^ly fyxed eye,
A dusky clowd of sti^lyng smoke
from Troy did smolter black,
When Titan from the werye necks
the heavy yokes did slack.
The fading light did grouelyng bend,
and down the day did shroud,
Against the stars amountyng up
a little mystie clowd,
Came belchyng out in irksom lompe,
and Phoebus galland beams
He spewd upon, bestayning them
duet down in western streams.
The Sun set swaruyng in such sort
with diverse change of face
Did give us cause, to have mistruste
of Neptunes doubted grace.
The evening first did bun^nish bright,
and paynt with stars the sky,
The wynds were laid, and clean forsook
our sails, that quiet lie.
when cracking, rattling, rumbling noise,
rusht down wi^h thundryng swaye
From top of hyls, which greater stur
does threaten and bewray.
With belowinges, and yellynges loud,
the shores do grunt an^ groan,
The craggye clyues, and roryng rocks,
do howl in hollow stone.
The bublyng wa^ers swelles vpreard
before the wrestling wind,
When suddenlye the lowryng light
of moon is hid and blind.
The glymsyng stars do go to glade,
the surgyng seas are tossed
Even to the skies, among the clowde^
the light of heaven is lost^
More nyghtes in one compacted are,
with shadow dym and black,
One shade upon another does
more darkness heape^ and pack,
And every spark of light consumd
the waves and skies do mete.
The ruflyng wynds range on the seas^
through every coast they ^lytt.
They heave it up with vyolence.
ouerturnd from bottom low,
The western wind flat in the face
of eastern wynd does blow.
With hurley burley Boreas
set open his blastyng mouth,
And gyroeth out his boysteous breath,
against the stormy south,
Each wind with all his might does blow,
and works dangers deep,
They shake the floods, a sturdye blast
along the seas does swepe.
That rowles, and ^u^bles wave on wave,
a northern tempest strong
Abundance great of flackye snow^
does hurl our ships among.
The south wind out of Lybia
does rage upon a should,
And with the puyssaunt force thereof
the quycke sands up be rould,
Nor bydeth in the south, which does
with tempest lump and lower,
And force the flowyng floods to rise
by powryng out a shower.
The stubbern E^r^s erthquakes made,
and shoke the countries eas^,
And E^s cost, where Phoebus first
aryseth from his test.
How violent Corus strecht and tare
his yawnyng mouth ^ull wide?
A man would sure have thought y^ world
did from his center flyde,
And that the frames of heaven broke ^p
the gods adown would fall,
And Chaos dark confused heap
would shade and cover all.
The stream straue with the wind, y^ wynd
did beat it back again,
The springyng sea within his banks
can not it self contain,
The ragyng shower his tryllyng drops
does myngle with the seas,
And yet in all this miserye
they find not so much eas,
To see and know what ill^ it is,
that works their decay.
The darkness dim oppresses still
and kepes the light away:
The black facst night with hellicke hew
was clad of stygian lake
And yet full often with glimsyng beams
the sparklyng fire out brake.
The cloud does crack, and being rent
the lyghtnyng leapeth out,
The wretches like the same so well
it shinyng them about,
That still they wysh such light to hau^.
(although god wo^ but ill)
The navy swaying down it self
does cast away, and spyll.
One side with other side is cracked,
and helm is rent with helm,
The shypp it self the gulpyng seas
do hedlong over whelme.
Erwhyle a grydie gapyng gulphe
does sup it up amayne,
Then by an by tossed up aloft
it spewes it out again,
She with her swaggyng full of sea
to bottom low does sink,
And drencheth deep aside in floodes
her tottryng broken brynke.
That underneath a dosen waves
lay drowned out of sight,
Her broken plankes swym 'vp and down,
spoyld is her tacle quyght,
Both sail and Ores clean are lest,
the mayn mast cake is gone.
That wonted was to bea^e vpryght
the sail yard thereupon,
The timber and the broken bordes
lie on the waters brym,
When cold and shiueryng fear in us
does stryke through every lym^
The wysest wy^ts entocksycate
dare nothing enterprise,
And conning practice naught auayle^,
When fearful storms arise,
The mareners lettyng duty slyppe
stand staryng al aghast,
Their scoopyng ores suddenly
out of their hands are wrast.
To prayer then apace we fall,
when others hope is none,
The Greeks and Troyans to the Gods
alyke do make their moan.
Alack what succor of the fates
may we poor wretches find?
Against his father Pyrrhus bears
a spytefull cancred ^ynde,
At Ajax grudge Ulysses does,
king Menela does hate
Great Hector: Agamemnon is
with Priam at debate.
O happy man is he, that does
lie slain in Troyan ground,
And has deserved by handy stroke,
to take his fatal wound,
Whom fame preserves, taking up
his tomb in conquered land.
Those momes whose melting cowards heart
durst never take in hand,
Or enterprise no noble act,
those force of floods shall drown,
But fate forbearyng long, will take
stout brutes of high renoume,
Full well we may ashamed be,
in such a sort to dye,
If any man his spytefull mind
yet can not satysfie,
with these ou^ragious plu^ging plages
That down from gods are sent,
Appeace at length thy wrathful god
again, and eke relent.
Even Troy for pity would have wept,
to see our woeful case,
But if that in thy boylyng breast
black rancour still have place,
And that the Greeks to ruin run,
it be thy purpose bent,
Why do these Troyans go to wrack?
for whom thus are we spent?
Assuage the rygour of the sea
that threa^nyng hyls up reares:
This drenched fleet the Troyan folk
and Greeks together bears.
Then from their prayers ar they put,
their foultryng tongues do stay,
the roaring seas does drown their voice
and cares their cries away.
Then mighty Pallas armed with
the leppyng lyghtning fire,
That testy Jove does use to hurl
provoked to swellyng ire,
With thretning Iaueling in her hand,
her prowe^ means to try,
And eke her force whoes boiling breast
with Gorgon^ fyts does frye,
Or what with target she can do,
and with her fathers fire.
Then from the skies another storm
begynnes abroad to spyre,
But Ajax nothing yet dysmayd
all force withstandeth stout,
who^ when he spread his swelling sails
with cable stretched out,
She lyghtyng down did wring him hard,
and wrapped him in her ^^ame,
And flange another flasshyng dint
of lyghtnyng on the same,
With all her force and violence
her h^nd brought back again,
She tossed him out, as late that feate
her ^ather tought her plain.
Both over Ajax and his Pup
she slyeth overthwart,
And rentyng man and ship, of both
she bears away a part,
His courage naught abated yet
he al to syngde does ^eme,
Even like a stubberne ragged rock
amid the striving stream,
He traynes along the roaryng seas
and eke the waltryng wave
By shouyng on his bourly breast
in sonder quyte he drove,
The Bark with hand he caught, and on
it self did type it over,
Yet Ajax shyneth in the flood
which darkness blind does cover.
At length attaynyng to a rock
his thundryng crakes were these,
I conquered have the force of fire
and rage of fyghtyng seas,
It does me good, to master thus
the anger of the sky,
with Pallas wrath, the lightnyng flames
and floods tumultyng hye.
The terror of the warlyck god
once could not make me fly,
The force of Mars and Hector both
at once sustaynd have I.
Nor Phoebus darts could me co^strayne,
from him one foot to shoon,
All these beside the Phrygians
subdued we have, and won:
when other Mecocks flings his darts
shall I not them withstand?
Yea, what if Phoebus came him self,
to pytche them with his hand?
When in his melancholy mood
He boasted without mean.
Then father Neptune lift his head
above the waters clean.
The beaten rock with forked mace
he vndermynyng pluckte
From bottom loose, and suncke it down,
when down him self he duckte.
Theare Ajax lay, by land, by sire,
and storm of seas destroyed,
But we by sufferyng shypwrack, are
with greater plagues anoyd.
A subtyle shallow flood thear is
flowne on a stony should,
Where crafty Caphar out of sight
the lurkyng rocks does hold,
Upon whose sharp and ragged top^
the swellyng tide does flow,
The boylyng waves do beat thereon
still sweaing to and fro:
A turret noddyng over it
does hang with falling swaye,
From whence on either side from height
prospect espy we may
Two seas: and on this hand the coast
where P^lops ons did reygne,
And Istmus flood in narrow creek,
reculyng back again,
Does stop Ionian sea, lest in
to Hellespont it run,
On the other part is Lemnon flood
that fame by blodshed won.
On the other side Calcedon town
does stand against this forte,
And Aulis I Will that stayed our shyps
that thither did resort.
This Castle here inhabyte does
our Palimedes sier,
Whose cursed hand held in the top
a brand o^ flaming fire,
That did alure our fleet, to turn
on lurkyng rocks a right,
Entysyng them with wily blase
to come unto the light.
All into fitters shaken are
the ve^sels on the should,
But other some do swym, and some
upon the rocks are roulde.
And other slyppyng back agayn^
so to eschew the rocks,
His bruised rybbes and ratlyng sides
against each other knocks,
Whereby the other he does brea^e,
and broken is him self,
Then would they lance into the deep,
for now they dr^ad the shelfe,
This peck of ^roubles chaun^t to hap
in dawning of the day.
But when the Gods (besought of us)
began the rage to stay,
And Phoebus golden beams began
a fresh to render light,
The dolfull day dys^ryed all
the damage done by night.

Cly. O whether may I now lament,
and weep with waylyng sad,
Or shall I else in that my spous
returned is be glad?
I do rejoice, and yet I am
compelled to bewail
My countries great calamytie
that does the same assail.
O father great whose majesty
does thundryng sep^ers shake,
The lowryng Gods unto the Gr^kes
now favorable make,
With garlands green let every head
reioysyng now be cround.
To to thee the pype in sacryfice
m^lodiously does sound,
And on thine alter lies slain
an Heyferdlyly white,
Before the same do present stand
with hangyng locks vndyght,
A car^full Troyan company
in heavy woeful plyght,
On whom from heygh the Laurel tree
with spredding branche does shine,
Whose virtue has inspired them
with Phoebus grace divine,

Chorus. Cassandra. ALas the cruel stynge of love
how swetely does it taste,
A myserye to mortal man
annexed while life does last?
The path of myscheife for to fly,
now sith there is a gap,
And wretched souls be franckly calde
from every woeful hap
By death, a pleasant port, for aye
in rest them selves to shroude,
Where dreadful tumultes never dwell
nor storms of Fortune proud:
Nor yet the burning fyry flakes
of Jove the same does doubt,
when wrongfully with twacking thu^pes
he rappes his thunder out:
Hear lady peace thinhabitours
does never put in flight,
Nor yet the victors threatny^g wrath
approchyng nyg^ to fight,
No whyrling western wynd does ^rge
the rampyng seas to praunce,
No dustye cloud that raised is
by savage Dimilaunce,
On horseback riding rank by rank,
no ferse and cruel ho^t,
No people slaughtred, with their towns
clean topsie tur^ey tossed:
While that the foe with flaming fire
does spoil and wast the wall,
Untamed and unbridled Mars
destroys and batters all:
That man alone who forces not
the ficle fates a straw,
The vysage grym of Acheront
whose eyes yet never saw,
Who never vewd with heavy chear^
the vgsome Limbo lake,
And putting life in hasarde dare
to death him self betake.
That parson is a princes pear,
and like the gods in might,
Who knows not what death does mean
is in a pitious plight
The ruthful ruin of our natyue
country we beheld:
That woeful night, in which the roofe^
of howses ouerqueld,
In Dardans City blasing bright
with flasshyng fiery flames.
when as the Greeks with burning brands
enkindle did the frames,
That Troy who^ war and deeds of arms
might not subdue and take,
As ons did mighty Hercules,
whose quyuer ca^sde it quake,
Which neither he that Peleus son,
and son to Thetis was,
Nor whom Achilles loved to well,
could ever bring to pass,
When glyteryng bright in filled he ware
false armor on his back,
And counterfayting fearse Achill
the Troyans drove to wrack.
Nor when Achilles he him self
his mind from sorrow wrast,
And Troyan women to the walls
did scuddyng leap in have.
In myserie she lost her proud
estate, and last renoume,
By being stoutly overcome,
and hardly pulled down.
Years five and five did Troy resist,
that yet hereafter must,
In one nights space by destenie
be laid in the dust.
Their fained gifts well have we tri^
that huge and fatal gin:
We light of credit with our own
right hand have haled in,
That fatal gift of Greeks: what time
at entrye of the gap
The ^^gye horse did shyueringe stand,
where in them selves did wrap
The captains close, in holow vautes
with bloody war yfreight.
When lawfully we might have tryde,
and serched their deceight:
So by their own contryned snares
the greeks had been confound:
The braseen buclers being shoke
did gy^e a clattryng sound.
A pryuie whysperyng often times
came tycklyng in our ear.
And Pyrrhus (in a murreynes name
so redye for to heat.
The craftye council picked out
of false Ulysses brain,)
Did iangle in the holow vautes,
that rang thereof again.
But fearyng and suspectyng naught
the heddy youth of Troy
Laid hands upon the sacred ropes,
to hale and pull with joy,
On this side young A^styanax
came guarded with his train,
On the other part Pollixena
disponsed to be slain
Upoon Achilles tomb, she com^
with maids, and he with men,
A ioly flock with equal years
as young as they were then.
Their vowed oblations to the gods
in holyday attire,
The matrons bring and so to church
repayreth every sire.
And all the city did alyke,
yea Hecuba our queen
(That since the woeful Hectors death
or now was never seen)
She merry is: o grefe accursed,
a^ all thy sorrows deep
For which that first, or last befell,
entendest thou to weep?
Our battred walls which heavenly hands
erected have and framd?
Or else the burning temples which
upon their Idols flamd?
Lamentyng these calamyties
we have not time and space,
O mighty parent Priam we
poor Troyans wayle thy case.
The old man's thratlyng throt I saw,
(alas) I saw yborde
With cruel Pirrhus blade, that scante
with any blood was gord.
Cass. Refrain your tears y^ down your chekes
should tricle evermore
With woeful waylynges piteously
your pryuate friends deplore
My myseries refuse a mate,
so much accursed as I:
To rewe my careful case, refrayn
your lamentable cry.
As for mine own distress to murne,
I shall suffyce alone.

Cho. To mingle tears with other tears
it does us good to moan:
In those the burning teary streams
more ardently do boil,
Who^ secret thoughts of lurking ^ares
in pryuy breast ^urmoyle:
Though that thou were a gossop stout,
that brook much sorrow may
I warraunt the, thou myghtest well,
lament this sore decay.
Not sad and solemn A^don
that in the woods does sing
Her sugared ditties fynelye tunde
on sweet and pleasant stryng:
Recordyng ^tys woeful hap
in diverse kind of note,
whom Progne though he were her child
and of her womb begot,
For to revenge his fathers fault,
she did not spare to kill:
And gave his flesh and blood for food
the fathers maw to fill.
Nor Progne who in swallows shape^
upon the rydges hye,
Of houses sitts in Biston town
bewaylyng peteou^lye,
With chatteryng throat, of Tereus
her spouse the cruel act,
(Who did by strength and force of arms
a shamfull brutyshe fact.
Defyle the sister of his wife,
fair Philomel by name,
And ^ake cut out her tongue, least she
should blab it to his shame)
Though Progne this her husbands rape
lamentyng very sore
Do wail, and weep with piteous plaint,
yet can she not deplore
Sufycientlye, though that she would
our contreys petious plyght:
Though he him self among the swans
sir Cygnus lyllye whight.
who dwelles in stream of Ister ^^ood,
and Tanais channel could,
His weping voice most ernestlye
though utter out he would:
Although the morning Halcyons
with doleful syghes do wayle,
At such time as the fyghtyng floodes
their Cyex did assail,
Or rashly weryng bold attempt
the seas now laid at rest,
Or being very fearful feed
their brood in tottryng nest,
Although as sqeimysh hearted men
those preistes in bedlem rage,
Whom mother Cyble being borne
^n high in lofty stage,
Does move, so play on shalmes, Atys
the Phrygian to lament,
Yet can not they this lot bewail,
though brawn from arms they rent.
Cassandra in our tears there is,
no mesure to refrain,
Those miseryes all mesure pa^se,
that plunged us in pain.
The sacred fillets from thy heds,
why do thou hale and pull?
They chyflye ought to worship god,
whose hearts with grefe be dull.

Cass. My fear by this aflyction
is clean abated al,
Nor prayeng to the heavenly ghostes
for mercy will I call.
Although they were disposd to chafe
and fret in fustien fumes:
They nothing have me to displease,
fortune her force consumes.
Her spyte is worn unto the stumpes,
what country have I left?
Where is my sire? am I of all
my systers quyt bereft.
The sacred tombs and alter stones
our blood have drunk and swyld,
Where are my brethren blessed knot?
destroyed in the fylde.
All wyddow wives of Priams sons
may easly now behold,
The palace void and cast of court
of syllye Priam old.
And by so many marriages
so many wyddows ar,
But only Hellen coming from
the coast of Lacon far.
That Hecuba the mother of
so many a pryncelye wight,
whose frutful womb did breed y^ brand,
of fire blasyng bright:
Who also bare the swinge in Troy,
by practis now does learn,
New laws and guyse of destynie
in bondage to discern.
On her she takes heart of grace
with looks so stern and wild,
And barketh as a bedlem bitche
about her strangled child
Dear Polidor, the remnaunt left,
and only hope of Troy,
Hector and Priam to revenge,
and to restore her joy.

Cho. The sacred Phoebus prophet is
with sudden silence hushed:
A quakyng tremblyng shiueryng fear
throughout her lymbs has rusht:
Her face as pale as ashes is,
her fillits stand vpryght,
The soft and gentle goldilocks
starte up of her affrigyt.
Her panting breathing breast stuffed up
within does grunt and groan.
Her glaring bright and steaming eyes
are hither and thither throwne^
Now glau^cyng up and down they roll:
now standing styffe they stare.
she stretches up her head more straight
then commenly she bare,
Bolt up she goes, her wrestling jaws
that fast together clinge,
She does attempt by diverse means,
on sonder how to wringe.
Her mo^bling words in gabling mouth
shut up she does assuage,
As Menas mad that Bacchus ares
does serve in furious rage.

Cass. How does it hap (o sacred tops
of high Parnassus hill)
That me be rapt of sens, with pricks
of fury fresh ye fill?
Why do you me with ghost inspyre,
that am beside my wits?
O Phoebus none of thine I am,
releas me from the fyts:
Infixed in my burning breasts
the flames extinguysh out,
Who forces me with fury fell
to gad and trot about?
Or for whose sake inspird with spryte
mad momblyng make must I?
Why play I now the prophet cold,
sith Troy in dust does lie?
The day does shrink for dread of war,
the night does dym mine eyes.
With mantell black of darkness deep
clean couerd is the skies:
But lo two shynyng Suns at one^
in heaven appears bright,
Two Grecian howses muster do
their armies twain to fight.
Among the mighty Goddesis
in Ida woods I see,
The fatal shepherd in his throne
as vmpier plast to be:
I do advise you to beware,
beware (I say) of kings,
(A kyndred in whose cancred hearts
old pryuy grudges sprynges)
That country clown Aegisthus he
this stock shall overthrow,
What does this folish despret dame
her naked wepons show?
Whose crown entende^h she to crack
in weed of Lacon land,
With hatchet (by the Amazons
invented first) in hand?
What face of mighty majesty
bewitched has mine eyes?
The conqueror of saluage beasts
Marmarick Lion lies,
Whose noble neck is wurried
with currysh fange and tooth
The churlysh snappes of eger Lioness
abide he does.
Alac ye gostes of all my friends
why should ye say that I,
Among the rest am onl^e safe,
from perils far to lie?
Feign father follow thee I would,
Troy being laid in dust.
O brother terror of the Greeks,
O Troyans aid and trust.
Our ancient pomp I do not see,
nor yet thy warmed hands,
(That ferce on grekish flaminge flete
did flyng the fyry brandes)
But ma^gled members, schorched corpse,
and eake thy valyant arms,
Hard piniond and bound in bands
sustaynyng grievous harms:
O Troylus, a match unfit
encounteryng with Achill
(That mighty man of arms) to sone
com unto the I will.
I do delyght, to sail with them
on stynkyng Stygian flood.
To view the churlyshe mastyfe cu^
of hell, it does me good.
And gaping mou^hed kingdom dark
of gredy Ditis raygne.
The barge of fylthy Phlegethon
this day shall entertayne,
Me conqueryng, and conquered,
and princes souls with all.
You flyteryng shades I you beseech,
and eake on the I call,
O Stygian poole (whereon the gods
their solemn oaths do take
Unbolt a while the brazen bars
of darksom lymbo lake.
Whereby the Phrygian folk in hell
may Micean state be hold.
Look up ye sellye wretched souls,
the fates ar backward roulde.
The sqallye sisters do approach,
and deal their bloodye strokes,
Their smultring faggots in their hands
half burnt to ashes smokes.
Their visages so pale do burn,
with fyrye flaming eyes:
A garment black their gnawed gutts
does gyrde in morning guyse.
Dire dred of night begins to howl,
the bones of body vast
With lieng long do rot corrupt
in myrie pudle cast.
Behold, the werye aged man
his burning thurst forgot,
The waters dalyeng at his lypps
to catch endeavors not:
But murneth for the funeral,
that shall ensue anon.
The Troyan prince his royal robes
tryumphant puts on.

Cho. The furious rage clean ouerpast
begyns it self to slake,
And flyps away, even as a Bull
that deadly wound does take
On gasshed neck afront the ares:
come let us ease at last
Her lymbes, that of the spryte of god
has felt the mighty blast.
Returning home again at length
and cround with Laurel bow
(A sign of worthy vyctorye)
is Agamemnon now.
The wit to mete her husband, does
her spedy passage plye,
Returning hand in hand, and foot
by foot most lovingly.

The.iiii. Act.
Agamemnon. Cassandra. AT length I do aryue again
upon my natyue soyle^
God save the o dear loved land,
to thee is huge a spoil
So many barbarous people yeilde:
the flower of Asia Troy
To bear thy yoke submyts her self,
that long did live in joy.
Why does this prophet (on the ground
her sprawling body laid)
Thus rele and stagger on her neck,
all trembling and dismaide?
Sirs, take her up, with lycour warm
let her be cheryshed.
Now peepes she up again, with drouping
eyes sonke in her head:
Pluck up thy spryte, here is the port
wished for in myserye:
This day is festival.
Cass. At Troy
so was it wont to be.

Aga. Let us to Chalters worship gy^e.

Cass. At Chalters dyed my syer:

Aga. Pray we to Jove.

Cass. To Jove whose grace
divine does me inspire?

Aga. Do thou suppose that Troy you seist?

Cass. And Priam eke I see.

Aga. Troy is not here.

Ca. where Helen is
there take I Troy to be.

Aga. Fear not as maid to serve thy dame.

Cass. Nay fredome draws nigh.

Aga. take thou no thought how you shall live:

Cass. All cares for to defye
Death gyues a courage unto me.

Aga. Yet say I once again
There is no danger left, whereby
thou myghtest hurt sustain.

Cass. But yet much troublous danger does
hang over thy head I wot.

Aga. What mischeife may a victor dread?

Cass. Even that he dreadeth not.

Aga. Ye trusty meny of my men
come carry her away,
Till of the spryte she ryd her self,
lest fury force her say
That may be preiudicall,
her tongue she can not frame.
To thee o father flyngyng forth
the lyghtninges flasshing flame,
That do disperse the clouds, and rule
the course of every star,
And guide the Globe of earth, to whom
the booties won by war
With tryumphe victors dedicate:
to thee o Juno hight
The sister dear of doughty Jove,
(thy husband full of myht)
Both I and Greece with flesh and blood
and eke our vowed beast
And gorgyou^^ gifts of Arabie
give worship to thy hest.

Chorus.
O Greece by noble Gentlemen
in honor shyning clear,
O Greece to wrathful Juno thou
that art the darlyng dear,
Some ioly worthy lusty blood
thou fosters evermore,
Thou have made even the gods, yt were
a number od before.
That puyssant myghtie Hercules
a noble impe of thine
Deserved by his travels twelve,
rapt up in heaven to shine.
For whom the heavens did alter course,
and Jupiter with all
Did iterate the hours of night,
when dampish dew does fall.
And charged Phoebus charyot swyfte,
to trot with slower pace,
And leasurely bright lady moon
thy homward wayne to trace,
Bright Lucifer that year by year
his name a new does change,
Came back again, to whom the name
of Hesper seemed strange.
Aurora to her comm^n course
her reared head addressed,
And cowchyng bacward down again
the same she did arest,
Upon the shoulder of her spouse,
whose years with age are worn
The east did feel, so felt the west,
that Hercules was borne.
Dame nature could not clean dispatch,
to utter in one night,
That boystous lad: the whyrling world
did wayght for such awyght.
O babe whose sholders underprop,
the ample spacious sky,
In clasped arms thy prowes did
the crusshed Lion try.
Who from his fyrye yawnyng throat
spewes out his broyling brande,
The nimble hynd in Menall mount
has known thy heavy hand.
The Bore has felt thy fyst, which di^
Arcadia destroy.
The monstrous conquered Bull has rord
that Creta did anoye.
The Dragon dire that bredyng beast
in Lerna poole he slew,
And choppyng of one head forbadd
thereof to rise anewe.
Wtih cloobbed brusyng battring batte
he cranckly did subdew.
(The brethren twins y^ tewd on teat)
whereof.iii. monsters grew.
Of tryple formed Gerion
the spoil into the east,
A drove of cattle Hercules
did fetch out of the west.
Away from tyrant Diomede
the Thracian horse he led
Which nether with the grass that grew
by Styrmon flood he fed,
Nor yet on Heber banks, but them
the vyllayn did refresh
His gredy mounching cramming iades
with aliantes blood and flesh.
Their rawfed jaws imbrewd were with
the carmans blood at last,
The spoils and shaftes Hipolyte
saw from her bosom wrast
As soon as he with clatryng shaft
the duskye cloud did smite,
The Stymphal byrd that shadowed
the sun, did take her flight.
The fertyll tree that aples bears
of gould, did fear him sore,
Which never yet acquayntaunce had
with ^asters toth before.
But whipping up with lively twigs
into the air she flies,
And while the chinking plate does sound
then Argos full of eyes,
The watchman shrinking close for cold
that sleep yet never knew,
Does here the noise while Hercules
with metal of yellow hew
Well laden packs away, and left
the grove befylched clean.
The hound of hell did hold his tongue
drawn up in triple cheane,
Nor barkt with any boughing throat,
nor could abide the hew,
Or color of the heavenly light,
whose beams he never knew.
When thou were captain general,
and did conducte our Host,
(They that) of Dardans lygne, to come
their stock do falsely boast,
Were vanquished by force of arms
and since they felt again
thy gray goose winge, whose bitterness
to fear might them constrain.
The.v. Act.
Cassandra. WIthin a revel rexe is kept,
as sore as ever was
Eue^ at ye.x. years seige of Troy:
What thing is this? (alas)
Get up my soul, and of the rage
auengment worthy crave:
Though Phrygians we be vanquyshed,
the victory we have.
The matter well is brought abought:
up Troy thou rysest now,
Thou flat on floor haste pulde down Greece,
to lie as low as thou.
Thy conqerour does turn his face:
my propheseing spryght
Did never yet disclose to me
so notable a sight:
I see the same, and am thearat,
and busyed in the broyle,
No vision fond fantastical
my senses does beguile:
Such fare as Phrygians feasted with
on last unhappy night
At Agamemnons royal court
full dayntyly they dight:
With purple hangings al adornd
the brodred beds do shine,
In old Assaracks goblets gylt
they swinck and swill the wine.
The king in gorgyous royal robes
on chair of state does sit,
And pranckt with pride of Priams pomp
of whom he conquered it.
Put of this hostile wede, to him
(the queen his wife began say)
And of thy loving lady wrought
wear rather this array,
This garment knit. It makes me loathe,
that shiuering here Island.
O shall a king be murdered, by
a banysht wretches hand?
Out, shall Thadulterer destroy
the husband of the wife?
The dreadful destynies approcht.
the food that last in life
He tast^d of before his death,
their masters blood shall see,
The gubs of blood down dropping on
the wynd shall powered be.
By traytrous tryck of trapping wede
his death is brought about,
Which being put upon his head
his hands could not get out,
The stopped poake with mouth set op^
his muffled head does hyde,
The mankind dame with trembling hand
the sword drew from her side,
Nor to the utmost of her might
it in his f^esh she thrast,
But in the giving of the stroke
she stayed all aghast,
He as it were a brystled Bore
entangled in the net
Among the brears in busshy woods
yet tries out to get.
with struggling much the shrinking bands
more streyghtly he does bynd.
He stryues in vain, and would slip of
the snare that does him blind.
Which catches hold on every side.
but yet then tangled wreatch
Does grope about, his subtle foes
with grypyng hand to catch.
But furious Tyndaris prepared
the pollax in her hand,
And as the preyst to sacryfyce
at Thalter side does stand,
And vewes with eye the bullocks neck,
ear that with axe he smite,
So to and fro she heaues her hand
to stryke and level right.
He has the stroke: dispatched it is:
not quyte chopped of the head
It hangs by a little crop:
here from the carkas ded
The spoutyng blood came gusshing out:
and there the head does lie,
With waloing bobling mu^bling tongue:
nor they do by and bye
Forsake him so: the breathles coors
Aegist does all to coil:
And mangled has the gasshed corpse:
while thus he does him spoil,
She puts to her helpyng hand:
by detestable deed
They both accord unto the kind,
whereof they do proceade.
Dame Helens sister right she is,
and he Thyestes son:
Lo doutfull Titan stands still
the day now being don,
Not knowing whether best to keep
still on his wonted way
Or turn his wheles unto the path
of dyre Thiestes day.

The.v. Act. The.ii. Scene.
Electra O Thou whom of our fathers death
the only help we have,
Fly, fly, from force of furious foes,
make have my self to save:
Our house is topsey turuey tossed,
our stocke^ is cast away,
Our ruthful realms to ruin run,
our kingdoms do decay.
Who comes here in Chariot swyft
this gallopyng a main?
Brother, dysguysed in thy wede
let me thy person feign.
O bussard blind what do thou mean
from foreign folk to fly?
Whom do thou shun? it does behoue
to fear this famylie.
Orestes now be bold, and set
all shiuering fear a side,
The certain succor of a trustye
freinde I have espyde.

The.v. Act. The.iii. Scene.
Strophilus. Electra. WIth solemn pomp I Strophilus
forsakyng Phocis land,
Bearing a brau^che of palm, yt grows
at Elis in my hand,
Returned back I am, the cause
that wyld me hither wend,
Is with these gifts to gratefie
and welcome home my freynd,
Whose valiyent army skalde, and shook
the tattryd Troyan walls,
Who weryed with the ten years war
now flat on floor she falls.
What woeful wight is this that stains
her mourning face with tears,
And drouned deep in drousy dumpes
oppressed is with fears?
I know full well this damsel i^
of princes lynage borne.
What cause Electra has this joyful
family to mourn?
Elec. By treason that mi mother wrought
my father lies slain,
And drinkyng of their fathers cup
the children do complain.
Aegist engroceth Castles got
by fornication.

St^o. Alack that of so long a tyme^
fylicitie is none.

Elec. I thee request even for the love
my father thou do owe,
And for the honor of the crown,
whose brute abroad does grow
In every coast: and by the gods
that dyuersly do ^eal,
Take into thy tuicion,
convey away, and steal,
This poor Orest: such kind of theft
is piety indede.

Stro^ Although that Agamemn^n^ death
does teach me to take heed,
Yet will I vnder^ake the same,
and with all diligence
Orestes shall I go about
with strength to have thee hence.
Prosperytie requires faith,
but troble exacts the same,
Have here a price for those that do
contend and wage in game.
An ornament with comely grace
ordaynd to deck the brow,
And let thy head be ^ouerde with
this green and pleasant bow.
And carry this vyctoryous
triumphant branch in hand.
God grant this palm yt planted was
in fertile Pisa land,
(where solemn games were celebrate
Jove's honor to express)
May both a sauegard be to to thee
and bring thee good success.
Thou that bestryds thy fathers steeds,
as he before has done,
Go stryke a league of amytie
with Pylades my son.
Now nimble nagges let Greece hereof
recordyng testifye,
With headlong scouring course amain
this traytrous country fly.

Elec. He is escapt and gone, and with
unmeasurable might
The Chariot horse with rain at will
do send out of my sight.
Now free from peril on my foes
attendance will I make.
And offer willingly my head
the deadly wound to take.
The cruel conqueress of her spouse
is come, whose spotted wede
With sprynkels (sign of slaughter) do
bear record of her deed.
Her gory hands new bathed in blood
as yet they be not dry,
Her rough and churlish rigorous looks
the fact do notyfye.
Unto the temple will I trudge.
Cassandra suffer me,
Oppressed with egall grief, take part
of sacryfyce with thee.

The.v. Act. The.iiii, Scene.
Clytemnestra. Electra. Aegisthus. Cassandra. O Thou thy mothers enemy,
ungracious saucy face,
After what sort do thou a maid
appear in publyque place?
Elec. I have with my vyrgynitie
the bowres of baudes forsook.

Cly. What man is he, that ever thee
to be a vyrgyn took?

Elect. what your own daughter?

Cl. with thy mother
more modest should you be.

Elec. Do you at length begin to preach,
such godlynes to me.

Cly. A manly stomach stout thou have
with swellyng hawtye heart.
Subdued with sorrow learn thou shall
to play a woman's part.

Elect. A swerd and buckler very well
a woman does beseme
(Except I dote)

Cl^: ^hy self doe^^ you
haylefelow with us esteem?

Elec. What Agamemnon new is this,
whom thou have got ^f late?

Cly. Hereafter shall I tame, and teach
thy gyrlysh tongue to prate.
And make the know, how to a queen
^hy tauntyng ^o for bear.

^ec The whylst (you widdowe) answer me
directly to this gear.
Thy husband is ^ereued quyght
of breath, his life is don.

Cly. Enquier where thy brother is,
So seek about my son.

Elect. He is departed out of Gre^e.

Cly. Go fetch him out of hand.

Elect. Fetch thou my father unto me.

Cly. Give me to understand,
Where does he lurking hyde his head?
where is he shrunk away?

Elect. All plonge of perils past he is,
and at a quiet stay.
And in another kingdom where
no harm he does mistrust,
This answer were sufficient,
to please a parent just.
But one whose breast dothboil in wrath,
it cannot satesfye.

Cly. To day by death thou shall receive
thy fatal destynye.

Elect. On this condition am I pleased,
the Alter to forsake.
If that this hand shall do the dead,
my death when I shall take.
Or else if in my throat to bathe
thy blade, thou do delyght,
Most willynglye I yield my throat,
and give the leave to smy^e.
Or if thou will chop of my head
in brutysh beastly guyse,
My neck a waytyng for the wound
out stretched redye lies.
Thou have committed synfully
a great and grievous guylt.
Go purge thy hardened hands, y^ which
thy husbands blood have spil^.

Cly. O thou that of my perylls all
do suffer part with me,
And in my realm do also rule
with egall dignity,
Aegisthus art thou glad at this?
(as does her not behoue,)
With checks and taunts y^ daughter does
her mothers mallyce move.
She kepes her brothers counsel close
Conveyed out of the way.

Aegist. Thou malipert and wi^les wench
thine eluysh pra^yng stay,
Refrain those words vnfytt thy mothers
glowing ears to vex.

Elect. What shall the breder of this broyle
control me with his checkes,
Whose fathers gilt has caused him
to have a doubtful name,
Who both is to his sister son,
and nephew to the same?

Cly. To snapp her head of with thy swerd
Aegist do thou refrain?
Let her give up the ghost: or bring
Her brother straight again:
Let her be locked in dungeon dark,
and let her spend her days,
In Caves and Rocks, with painful pangs,
torment her every ways.
I hope him whom she hidden has,
she will again discrye,
Through being clapped in prison strong
and suffering pouertye
With earksom and unsavory smells
on every side annoyde,
En^orst to wear a widows wede,
er weddinge day enioyde:
Put in exile and banyshment
when each man does her hate:
So shall she be by myserye
compeld to yield to late,
Prohibyted of holsom air
fruision to have.

Elec. Grant me mi dome by means of death
to pass unto my grave.

Cly. I would have granted it to the,
if thou should it deny.
Unskilful is the tyrant, who
by suffryng wretches dye^
Does end their pains.

Ele. what after death
does any thing remain?

Cly^ And if thou do desire to dye,
the same se you refrain.
Lay hands ^irs on this wo^drous wretch,
whom being carried on,
Even to the furthest corner of
my jurisdiction
Far out beyond Mycenas land
in bonds let her be bound,
With darkness dym in hiddious hold
let her be closed round.
This captive spous and wicked queen,
the trull of princes bed
Shall pay her pains, and suffer death
by losyng of her head.
Com hale her on, that she may follow,
that way my spouse is gone,
Whose love from me entised was.

Cass. Do not thus hale me on.
I will before you take the way,
these tidings first to tell
Unto my country men of Troy
beneath in lowest hell.
How ouerquelmed shypps each whea^
ar spread the sea^ vppon^
And Micoene country conquered is
brought in subjection.
He that of thousand captains was
graund captayn general,
Com to as great calamytie
as Troy it self did fall,
Entrapped was by treaytrus trayn,
and whordom of his wife,
And by a gift received of her
depreued of his life.
Let us not linger: on with me,
and thanks I do you give.
I joy, that it might be my hap,
thus after Troy to live.

Cly. Go to, prepare thy self to dye
thou frantyque ragyng wight.

Cass. The fransy fyts of fury fell
on you shall also light.

Eurybates. Added to the Tragedy by the ^ranslatour.
ALas ye hateful ^ellysh hagges
ye furies foul and fell,
Why cause ye rusty rancours rage
in noble hearts to dwell^
And cancred hate in boylynge breasts
to grow from age to age?
Cold not the grau^dsyres painful pa^ges
the chyldrens wrath assuage?
Nor ^a^yne faint of pynyng paunche,
with burning thirst of hell,
Amid the blackest stream of styckes
where poysnyng breathes do well.
Where vapors vile parbrakyng out
from dam^ysh myry mud,
Increase the pains of Tantalus
deserved by gyltles blood.
Could not thine own offense suffyce
Thyestes in thy life,
To fyle thy brothers spousall bed,
and to abuse his wife?
But after breath from body fled,
and life thy lymbes has left,
Can not remembrance of revenge
out of thy breast be reft?
What, yet have thou not laid thy lyps,
to cast of Lethes flood?
Now after death why do thou come
to move thy son to blood?
Could cruel Ditis grant to thee
thy pasporte back again?
To work this woe upon the world,
and make such rygour reygne,
That Clytemnestr^ is become
the fyfty sister dire
Of Danaus daughters, that did once
their husbands death conspyre.
Lo here how ^icle fortune gyues
but brytle fading joy.
Lo, be who late a Conqueror
tryumphed over Troy.
Enduring many sturdy Forms
with m^ghty toil and pain
To sow the seed of fame, has reant
small fruit thereof again.
When as his honor budding forth
with flower began to bloome,
(Alas) the stock was hewed down
and sent to deadly doom.
And they that of his vyctorie
and coming home were glad,
to sudden murning change their mirth
with heauynes bestad.
The lusty pomp of royal court
is dead: (O dolfull day)
The people moan their princes death
with woe and weal away:
with howling, crieng, wringing hands
with sobs with syghes, and tears,
And with their ^ists they beat their bre^tes
they pull and hale their hears.
And as the sheep amassed run,
and rampe about the fyeld,
When as their shepherd to the wolf
his gory throat does ye^lde:
Even so as mad they rage and rave
throughout Micaenas land,
Deprived of their prince, they fear
the blooddy Tyrants hand.
While thus were woeful wailings hard
in every place about,
The good Cassandra (come from Troy)
to death is haled out.
Like as the Swan, who when the time
of death approaches nigh,
By nature warned is thereof,
and pleased well to dye,
Does celebrate her ^unerall
with dirge and solemn song:
Even so the noble vyrgyn who
in woe has lived long,
Most joyful goes she to her death
with mylde and pleasant face,
Stout boulst ryng out her bourly breast
with pryncely port and grace.
Nothing dysma^de with courage bold,
and cheerful countenance,
On stage ordained for her death
she began her self advance,
As though she had not thither come,
to leave her loathsome life,
As though she had not come, to taste
the stroke of fatal knyfe.
But even as if in brydale bed
her iurney were to meet
Corebus dear, not having mind
of death, nor wyndyng sheet,
When lookyng round on every side
she took her leave of all,
From vapourd eyes of young and ol^
the tryclyng tears do fall.
The Greeks them selves to grief a^^ moved
to see this heavy sight,
So pytie pearest the headmans heart,
that thryse about to ^myte
He staide the smot: with shiuering hand
yet once again he tried.
And from her shoulders stroke her head.
and thus the vyrgyn dyed.
But now the Greeks another cause
of murnyng have in hand:
Orestes Agamemnons son,
is for^st to fly the land.
Among old rotten ragged rocks
^hear lies an ugly place,
A dongeon dep^, as dark as hell,
unknown to Phoebus face.
An holow huge wide gapyng hole,
with way still bendyng down,
whose mouth with venomous withred weeds
is hid and over grown,
where stinking smells com belching out
from filthy durty dyke,
where verment vile do crepe and craule,
in bell is not the like.
Il favored, foul mysshapen ^ugges,
do lurk about this cave,
With dreadful sounds^ and roryng noise
within the pyt they rave.
Even hither is Electra sent,
in darkness deep to lie,
In poverty, and comfortless
without the light of sky,
Fast clogd with iron boultes and chains,
thus by her mother laid
In torments, till by her to death
Orestes be betrayde:
Who (as Cassandra tells) shall
revenge his fathers death,
Depryue with swerd thadulterour,
and mother both of breath.
So after all these bloody broils,
Greece never shall be free:
But blood for blood, and death by turns,
the after age shall see.
