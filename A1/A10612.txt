MIchael Renichon of Templeu, and Parson of Bossier in the County of Namur
aforesaid (dispatched with Letters of the Earl of Barlaymont, in the habit of
a Soldier, from Brussel, the tenth day of March last:) was by Convoy conducted
thence to Louen, Die, Herentals, and Tuernoult: from whence accompanied only
with one of the garrison of the said Town, he was guided to the Town of
Bredau: where being entered, he delivered certain close sealed Letters, unto
the Governor there, which were addressed from the Earl of Barlaymont unto
Captain Larigon Commander of the Castle of Tuernoult, importing, that the
bringer thereof, was sent thither by express commandment of Archduke
Ernestus of Austria, to communicate unto him a certain enterprise, to be done
upon the town of Bredau.

The Governor desirous to be by him further instructed, as well of the cause
of his coming thither, as of the particularities of the said enterprise:
Renichon first humbly besought him, that it would please him to entertain him
into his service, and then, persisting (though differing and dubling in his
assertions, which sauored of manifest untruths) that his matter was just and
perfect: Affirmed, that for certain years, he had been Secretary to the Abbot
of Malonne, and for his knowledge and experience, he was by him advanced to
the same place, with the Earl of Barlaymont: from whom he had after this
manner withdrawn himself, only for the fervent desire he had to do him
service, with such other the like accomplements.

The Governor finding small probability in his filed speeches, feared greatly
some pretense of waightier matter: and for that cause, caused him forthwith to
be conveyed to the Haghe: Where, upon the first of April, (fearing what
would ensue) he attempted to strangle himself with a cord made of points and
stringes of his Arms, fastened to a certain iron in the Jail, under which he
was found all be blouded, and speechless.

Revived now, and come to his speech again, one demanded for what cause he
would have committed this act upon himself: whereunto replying, he confessed
volontarily, without proffer of any torture or constraint, as well by word of
mouth, on the second of April, as also afterward by his own hand writing at
sundry times, as namely on the twentieth day of April, and last of May, the
very absolute truth of his coming thither: affirming the speeches uttered by
him and fathered upon the Abbot of Malonne, and Earl of Barlaymont, to be
false and forged, acknowledging further.

That having had long process in Law against his Parishioners of Bossier,
touching the revenues of his Parsonage: as also endamaged through the daily
incursions of the unbridled soldiers: he was enforced by mere necessity
about some two years sithence, to abandon his Parsonage, and committing the
cure thereof unto a Chaplain, retired himself unto the Town of Namours,
where he supplied the room of a Scholemaster.

The Earl of Barlaymont, having had some intelligence of my being there,
entreated me by some of his gentlemen, on an Evening to suppe with him: supper
being ended, the Earl retired himself into his Chamber, and commanded me to
be brought in to him: where (his people withdrawn) he asked me how I could
with so small allowance content my self, and spend my time, to so little
proffite, adding further, that he knew the means how to advance my estate,
if either I would seek it at his hands, or rouse and pluck up my appaled
spirits, for which his honorable courtesies, humbly thanking him, I presented
him my best service.

The which now presented, he took occasion to send for me in February last
past, by his Chaplain after supper, falling in discourse with me, in the
presence of some other, of an enterprise to be done upon the Town of Bredau.

Likewise at an other time being entered into his Chamber, he sent for me
again, at which time he told me, that he was to communicate unto me a
matter of greater consequence and importance, and that if I would employ my
self in the service of the king, he would richly and royally recompense me.
Upon which promise, I vowed my service to him again.

Not long after this, I was by him commanded to follow him to Brussels, where
the said Earl diverse and sundry times frequenting the Court, at length
commanded me to attend on him thither: with whom passing from chamber to
chamber, at last, the Earl entered the chamber of the Archduke Ernestus: whom I
then beheld, minding to follow after him: at which time I was partly hindered
by the sudden falling too of the door: which not fully shut, (listening what
might pass between the Archduke and the said Earl,) I easily heard them
speak Spanish and Latin: and at sundry times, make repetition of recompense
and reward: The Earl ready to take his leave of the Duke, who brought him to
the chamber door: the Duke at his last farewell, said, Cumulate and largo
foenore satisfaciam. When the Earl returned, he told me, that they had all
that time, conferred about my matters: and that the Archduke had ordained two
hundred Phillips Dollors to be delivered me.

Retired now to his lodging, he gave me further to understand that the
Archdukes pleasure and full intention was, to root out, or by a third hand
violently to murder the Count Maurice of Nassau: and for that end and
purpose, he had already dispatched certain other persons, assuring me, that if
I would likewise undertake the like action, it should be great advancement for
me and all my friends: saying further, that there were already fifteen
thousand crowns gathered together, to be disbursed to him, that first should
bring to pass the foresaid massacre or murder.

Upon this point I aunsweared the Earl, that it was an action merely
impertinent to my profession, who had never borne arms: he replied that it was
the will and pleasure of the king, and the command of the Archduke, and
therewithal, fell to persuading me again with many vehement reasons, in such
sort, as I promised to do my uttermost endeavor to that end.

Therevppon I desired the said Earl, to instruct me. how I might behave my
self in this enterprise: he aunsweared, that the Count Maurice being a young
noble man, very familiar and popular, it were a very easy matter to insinuate
himself in his favor: that it must not be wrought in have or rashly, but with
great advise and leisure, That he was to make his repair into the Haghe, or
such other place where the Count were most restant: that there, he should
under the coullour of teaching a common school, expect and weight for the
coming of such other as were assigned to the like end and purpose (whereof
there were six and he was the seventh, who taking advise and council
together* upon one observation made, might easily work the depth of their
desire: aduising me further, that I was to provide my self of a pair of good
Pistols, with firelockes, the which (biting carefully and clenly kept) I should
charge with two or three bullets, and upon the first occasion proffered, should
shoot through the said Count, or otherwise murder him* by what deuyse or
practice I either best could my self: or the other which yet were to repair
unto me. In conclusion affirming, that he who best and first behaved himself
in this action, should be best and first rewarded.

That there were also other, which were to be made away by like practice,
videlicet, Barneuelt, Longolius, and S. Allegonde: of whom, or any of them, if
he could procure their death and destruction: he should be richly likewise
recompensed, charginge him especially to alter his name, and to apparel
himself souldiorlike for this purpose.

These and such other exhortations ended, the Count Barlaymont caused certain
other persons to be brought into my presence: of whom, he said that one of
them, was of the six above mentioned: to whom he declared that I was lately
adopted into their fellowship: upon which speech, the said party embracing me,
called me his Camerado: assuring me that in short time, he would follow me into
Holland, for and upon the like occasions.

The said County further declared, that the said six persons are, and have
been ever since the death of the Prince of Parma, and before, notorious
murderers, and that they are allowed gentlemen's pay in the Court there, by the
King, and upon any such desperate action, are only and ever employed against
the ennemy.

Thus retyring himself from our company, he dispatched his Secretary
incontinently to Stephen de Narra, of whom he received in sundry kinds of
quoyne, the foresaid sum of two hundred Dollars, the which was presently by
him delivered me.

Being now furnished of all things expedient for my journey, and ready to
depart from Brussels to Andwerpe, I was by one of the six persons above
mentioned, conducted to the Schuite, who at my very departure signified unto
me, that he assuredly hoped to have borne me company to Leiden: of whom
demanding where that was, and to what end: he aunsweared me, that Leiden was
a Town and an University in Holland, where the young Prince of Orange studied,
whether he should likewise be employed, to the intent that insinuating
himself into his favor, he might with better convenience bereave him of his
life.

Thus resolved to obey the Count of Barlaymonts pleasure and command, I first
clothed my self souldierlike, named my self Michil de Triuier, and arrived
at Andwerpe with the forsaid Letters of the County of Barlaymont, addressed to
Largion, where (understanding that he was upon occasions departed from
Tuernault) I was enforced to alter my course, and returned to Brussels again:
where receiving other Letters of the foresaid County, took my way to Louen,
Die, Herentals, and Tuernault, from whence as aforesaid, I came to Bredau.

The general Estates of the united Provinces of the Low Countries, duly
examining the state of this cause, finding it a matter of very evil example,
as also, that in a Country of Justice, where all dangerous and perilous
actions and euentes ought to be prevented, and the peace and tranquillity of
the same highly preferred and advanced, esteemed it in their wisdoms a
matter not only not tolerable, but rather severely to be punished, to the
terror and example of all other: and therevppon have condemned and adjudged,
and do by these presents condemn and judge the Author of this intended
murder, to be presently conveyed from hence to the ordinary place of
execution, and there to be beheaded with the sword: and afterward, his body
to be quartered, his head to be put upon a pole, and the quarters hanged on
the four corners of the Haghe, declaring further his goods to be confiscated.

This was pronounced in the Audience of the Court of Holland, the third of June
1594. And Signed Nieuelt.

Under that was written, The Decree of the foresaid Council. And was
subscribed. I. van zuilon.
