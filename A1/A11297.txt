An answer to a letter.

Cum priuilegio.

Here begins the answer.
I Have received your letter whereby I perceive that sith your returnyng i^ to
your country: Ye have herd that there is yet here in London much
co^munycation and great dyuersytie of opynions upon such articles as were
spoken of wha^ ye were here. And ye have also written to me at a good length
all the articles that be noysed there in your country to go yet abroad here in
the city. And thereupon ye desire me to write unto you my co^ceyt / what I
think is to be holde^ in those articles: and surely that is a right great
request for me to acco^plishe. For though I entende to speak the truth therein
/ and do so in deed: yet paraduenture some men will be offended with it / and
not take it plainly after my meaning: but nevertheless / trustyng that ye most
part of the people be now i^ these days enclyned to take all things to the
best. I will not for the opinion of a few / fully deny your req^st theri^ /
but shall show you with good will my conceyt to all your articles / for I
trust charity has moved you to that desire. And I will not recyte here your
artycles perticulerly together / but will answer to them after the same order
as they stand in your letter. And so / every man that shall happen to read
this answer shall know the order of the articles i^ your letter.

And first ye say / that many in your country report yt there should be a
saying here about London / yt the king has many new authorites given him / by
that he is recognysed to be ye supreme head upon earth under god of ye church of
England / and ye desire me to show you my conceyt what I think therein / and
I will first with good will say so^ what to it to satisfye your desire.

Whether the king by that he is recognysed to be supreme heed under god upon
earth of the church of England / have thereby any new power given hi^ over his
subjects yt he had not before. The first cha.
THe king / by that he is recognysed by the parliamente to be the supreme heed
under god upon earth / of ye church of England / has as I take it no new
power given hi^ in any thing but that like as before that recognisyon made /
he had all such power over his subjects spirytuall and temporal / as to a
king belongs by the law of god: so after the seyde recognisyon / he had the
same power without alteration / and none other but that. And therefore he may
not as I suppose by reason of that recognisyon / take upon hi^ any auctority
that our lord gave only to his apostels or discyples / i^ spirytuall
ministratyon to the people. And though he may not / yet ye recognisyon was not
to al inte^tes void / for by reason thereof the power of the king is more
euyde^tly known than it was before that recognisyon made: for before that
recognisyon / the clergy had greatly defaced the power of kings in this
realm. And for a more plain declaration of this matter / it is to be
considered / that there are some things that are called mere spirytuall / and
that be so in deed. And there be some that have be^ called mere spiritual /
which nevertheless perteygne to the power of kings and princes. The things
mere spiritual be these: The consecration of the sacrament of the auter / the
making of absolucyons / the gyuyng of orders / and the ministratyon that saint
Paul speak of. ad Corin. iiii. When he said of himself and of other Apostels
and discyples of Christ thus / Let every man esteem us as ministers of Christ /
and as dispe^satours of ye misteryes of god / whereby he understood princypally
the ministratyo^ of the sacraments. And such ministration the king may not
take upon him / ne he intends it not. I know well that a king may be a
pressed: yea / and a bishop also / and tha^ might he lawfully minister al such
spu^all things if he list: but I would not think that it were an incresynge
of his honor to do so: for the honor of a king stands specially i^ doing
justice unto his people / as it appears. Ps. xcviii. where it is said: The
honor of a king loves justice. And one poi^t of, justice is / to se the
ministers under hi^ do their duty. And therefore if bysshoppes were neglygente
in doing their ministration to the people / the king might command them to
do it: and that were more honor to him than do it hi^ self. And though as it
appears, ii. Par. xix. King Iosaphat ordained iuges in all the cities of
Judah: and that in Jerusalem he ordained Leuytes and prestes / and princes of
famelyes that they should judge the judgment and cause of our lord. etc. Yet it
appears not that he made them prestes no more than he made Amaryas a priest:
for though he appointed Amaryas to be chief priest / yet it appears that he
was a pressed before And also though king David appointed the prestes and leuytes
to their offices / as appears.i. Par. xxiii. and xxiiii. Yet it appears not
that he made any of them priests. Also troth it is / that every king is
bounden to minister justice unto his people / according to the laws of his
realm. And may therefore to that intent be called a minister: but yet that
ministration is all in a another manner / than is the ministration of the
successors of the apostels: for the ministration of a king / is the
ministration of power / justice and souerayntie: and to it ar necessary great
possessyo^s / honor and riches / to maynteyne his estate. And the ministratyon
of the other stands in spirytuall service to the people / in mekenes /
ghostly counsel / preaching and teaching in all charity: in somoche that
none should be merry in god / but they should be merry with him: none should be
in heaviness / but they should sorrow with him: and to these ministers is
necessary suffysaunce without abundaunce: and honest poverty is not directly
against that ministration: and they ought always to have a contynuall desire
that the people should live in such brotherly love and quyetnes that there
should need no ministration of justice by the high powers to be used amongst
them. And if any such happened to come / they should fear greatly yt it might
happen to come through some defaute in them. And surely wha^ any great variaunce
and trouble rise among ye people / it is not unlike but that some part of the
occasyon thereof rose first through the defautes and negligence of some of the
clergy. Than sith it is right highly expedye^t for the ministration of a price
to have habunda^ce of possessions as is said before / how may he take any
other ministration upon him that agrees not with that habundance. I know no
man that will persuade the king to take those powers upon him: but I have
written to you my conceyte / that in case that any man would persuade him to it
hereafter / that ye shall know before how as me seems his perswacyon ought
to be allowed. The other that have been called in time paste things mere
spirytuall / and be not so in deed / be very many whereof I shall recyte part:
but to recyte all / it would be very tedyouse both to you and to me: but if ye
/ and other that be learned in the kings laws would dilygently enquere for
the^ / ye should find many mo than I will reherce here

First it has been taken in time past as a thing mere spirytuall / that the
bishop of Rome ought as the vycare general of Christ / to give all
spirytuall promocyo^s and benefyces through criste^dom. Also that he and other
bishops under him / ought even by the law of god to visyte all priests /
curates and houses of relygyon through crystendome. Also that no prince /
might task his clergy for any cause without license fro Rome: that the
deuisyon and distinctyon of parysshe fro parysshe / is a thing so mere
spirytuall / that no man may do it but the clergy. That se^tuary in
churcheyardes / is likewise so spirytuall / that the clergy must nedely order
it: and that therefore they be all accursed that watch any man in the
churchyard. That no bishop ought to be made without the popes bulls: and
that he ought to have Annates for them. That the clergy ought to have
correction as of things mere spirytuall / of auoutrye / fornicacyon / symonye
and usury: and to order matrymony / tithes / oblacions / and perjury in some
case. and of diverse other things whereof it is no dout but they have holden
plee in time past / rather by a custone and by a sufferaunce of princes / than
for that they be mere spu^all / or that they had auctorite so to do by any
immedyate power of the law of god. They have claymed also as things mere
spirytuall / the proving of testamentes / making of letters of administrations
/ sequestrations / pluralytes / vnyons / and dispensacyons / and diverse other /
which be nothing mere spirytuall at all.

And such powers kings and prices might take into their hands laufully if
they would / without offendynge the law of god. Nevertheless I speak not this
/ to the intent that ye should take my meaning to be / that I would have it so
done in deed: but that I would have it known under what manner they have their
power in such things to the intent they might the more mekely / and the more
charitably exercise their power herafter among the people / than they have
done in time pass. And it is no doubt but that many of the clergy have set so
great diligence to maynteyne their power and iurysdiction in such mixed things /
that they have the less regarded the ministration in preaching and techynge /
and in the things before rehearsed that be mere spu^all in deed. And that were
much more profitable to the people to be maynteyned / and contynually put in
execucyon than the other be.

Of diverse things concerni^g the power of the bishop of Rome and of ye
statutes made in the.xxv. year and xxvi. year of king Henry the eight / which
treat of the said power. The.ii. chapter.
First such power as the apostels and disciples had of Christ / they used /
and might laufully use in the begynni^g of the church universally i^ all
places where they came / and none had any more power in one place than in
another.

Also after the passion of Christ the successors of the apostles and dyscyples
were appointed to use their power within a certain circuit / but that
appoynteme^t was only by the power and law of man / and not by ye i^mediat
power of god.

Also at the counsel of Nycene / Rome was not taken for the heed of the
church: ne the bysshoppes there had not than any other auctorytie / but as
every other bishop had. And that appears thus: The bishop of Alexandre is
there in the seyde counsel of Nycene first spoken of before the bishop of
Rome: and if the bishop of Rome had been there heed of the church / it should
not have been so. And the bishop of Alexandre was by the said counsel
appointed for his dyocyse to Egypt or Lybia / and Pentapolim. And the bishop
of Rome was appointed to that he was accustomed to have before: and it was
farther decreed / that at Antyoche and other prouynces the honor should be
kept to every church.

Also after the seyde counsel of Nycene / there was great varya^ce betwyxte
diverse bishops / who should be the highest bishop. and the bishop of
Constantinople sometime took him self for highest / and called him self prince
of bishops And after as Platyne / De vitis su^moru^ pontificu^ / writes it
was ordained in the time of Focas the emperor / that Rome where Bonyface the
third was than bishop should be the heed of all churches / whereupon it followed
that the said Bonyface should be taken as heed of all bishops and prestes. And
great varyaunce was after who should be next seat to Ro^e / and who the
third / the fourth / and the fyfth / whereof is mention made Distin^ xxii.
cap. Sacro scta^ / and cap. Constantinopolitane / and ca. Renouantes: by all
which laws it appears euydently that there was none of the seyde bishops
that pretended to be the heed of the universal church of Christ / that is to
say / of the whole congregation of all christen people: but only to be head of
all other bishops and prestes: for if any would have pretended to have been
heed over al christen people he should have pretended to have been heed over the
seyde emperor Focas / and over all other kings and princes also: and it is
not to think that the seyde Focas would have assented thereto. And
nevertheless by occasion thereof / many of the successors of the said bonyface
/ have taken upon them to be the head of ye hole universal church of Christ
whereby they have pretended to be heed over emperors and kings: and that
emperors and kings ought to be obedient unto the^: and with help of
bisshops in countries and realms and of other that have been highly auau^ced in
the clergy / and that more favored ye bisshops of Rome tha^ their own
natural princes / they have put emperors and kings that would any thing
resyst that pretense many times in great danger and sometime utterly distroyed
the^. And yet the very truth was / that they had no power given them but only
that they should be the heed over other bishops which they had as Platyn
says and ought thereby to have only at metynges and congregations some
preemynence of place and power of prechyng / if they list before any there
bishops: and yet nevertheless they made emperors and kings and their people
believe that they had such power / and brought them in belefe also / that they
were bounden to give credence to the clergy in all spirytuall matters / and
that to doubt at the popes power was heresy: and so through pusyllanimitie and
wylful ignorance of princes and their people / and through a confederacy of
Bysshoppes / they were therein right greatly deceived but when the parliament in
ye said xxvi. year etc. recognysed the king to be the supreme heed in earth
under god of the church of England they understood by ye term: church / the
hole congregation of all the people within this realm / as well of the clergy
as of ye lay people: and that the king is the heed of them all / as he is in
deed: for it had been a recognisyon of small effect / to have recognysed hi^
head of the clergy only / that was before heed over his subjects spu^all and
temporal. And so by that recognisyo^ the king has none other auctoritye over
his subjects but as he had before: so that he may not use any power mere
spu^all / that our lord gave only to his apostels and discyples: as to
consecrate or make absolucions / ne any other like / as is said before. And if
percase the parlyamente and conuocacyon also had expressly granted to the
king with the said name of the supreme heed: such spu^al auctorityes / it is no
dout / but that ye grant had be^ void: for they have no auctorite to change
the law of god. And if this be true / it will be very hard to tell what
auctorite or power is taken by the seyde recognisyon fro the bishop of Rome
that he had before the said recognision made: for the extorte powers that he
took upon him by occasyon of that name in this realmees were taken fro him
before by the statutes made in the sessone holden in the said.xxv. year. etc.
But that name of heed of all bishops remains yet unto hi^ not taken away by
any statute / and that may appear in this manner. The seid statute of.xxvi. is
only that ye king shall be supreme head under god upon earth / of ye church of
England / whereby is understand yt he ought to have such power i^ this realm
over his subjects spu^al and temporal / as to a king belongs by ye law of
god / as is said before: and with yt it may well stand / that one may be head
bishop and minister in things mere spu^all over the same people: but than
admyt that he be so / yet what power he ought to have therbi over other
bisshops is to be seen / and to give other occasyon to treat more thoroughly of
that matter. I shall somewhat show my co^ceite theri^: And that is / that it
should seem that he should thereby have this preemynence / to have the highest
seat above all other bysshoppes. And if he would preach / that he ought to
have the place before all other / as is said before / and these preemynences
and other like remains yet unto hi^ / if he came into this realm for ought
that the perliament has don: and if any man will say that he ought thereby to
have and use also ye power of a bishop in mere spu^all things as in gyuyng
ordres / making of prestes / making of excoi^cacio^s and absolutio^s / and
such other in all places where he should come / as well without his own dyocyse as
within: to yt it may be answered / that if ye general counsel whereby Rome
was made head of al other churches / had ente^ded yt the bishop of rome should
have had ye power of a bishop universally in all other bishops diocyses
through criste^dome / yt than the said general counsel would have expressed
openly that power / and would also have revoked the counsel on Nycene / which
appointed the bishop of Rome to his diocise and that in all other prouynces /
ye honor should be kept to every church. But forasmuch as the seid general
counsel did not so / it seems that it intended that the counsel of Nycene
should stand in effect: and that the bishop of Rome should still keep him to
his diocise as he did before / having only by that name such preemynence at
the general metynge of bishops / as before appears in whose diocyse soever
they met: never the less I will nothing speak determynatly in this matter:
but remytte it to them that have auctoritye. And than if it be thought by the
king and his parlyament that no hurt can come hereafter to the comenwelth /
though ye bishop of Rome be suffered to keep still his name of the heed bishop
of crystendome / because the king natwithstandynge that name may enjoy the
name of supreme heed under god upon earth of the church of England: they may
suffer it continue: but if they se lykelyhodes / that if ye name be suffered to
co^tynewe / yt than by color of that name / he will pretend hereafter to have
power above kings and princes / as his predecessors have done in time past:
than may the parlyamente repel that name as to this realm for ever: and it
will be a very good deed to do it for the mayntenance of the whole comen
welthe. But as yet it is not avoided / because both names may stand together
to several intentes as before appears. How may any man than resyst the said
statutes but he resyst god: or how may any man say that if he agreed to the
statute / that he should fall thereby fro the unity of christ's church / sith the
unity thereof stands not in that point / whether Rome be heed church of all
other churches or not: But tha^ some me^ say in this matter / that the
parlyament did not well to recognyse the king to be supreme heed in earth under
god of the church of England: where saint Paul says ad Ephe. v. Man is the
head of the woman / as Christ of the church: and also he says ad Colos. i. He
is the heed of the body of ye church: that is to say Christ. and tha^ it is
said i. Corin. xi. The heed of Christ is god: and so say they / the parlyament
should have holden like order / as s. Paul did and have recognysed yt the king
was supreme heed upon earth under Christ / to whom god was heed / and that the
parlyamente erred in that they kept not ye order that. s. Paul. did. And truly
this is a daungerouse saying: for if the perlyament erred therein / than were no
man bounden to obey the perlyame^t in that behalf: for ye perliament may
nothi^ge do against ye law of god: nevertheless it is apparent that the
perlem^t did well and varyed no thing fro s. Paul: for it says that the king
is the supreme heed upon earth under god / and that is true that he is under
god. And yet in that it says / that the king is supreme heedde under god /
is not Christ excluded: for god is Christ and Christ is god / and the whole
Trinity is in Christ: And so he that is under god / is under christ so
Christ is God / and so God and Christ is all one.

But if the perliame^t had recognized the king to be supreme heed upon earth
under god / of the churchc of England / but not under Christ than had they
erred in deed / and no man had been bounden to have taken the king under that
manner as supreme heed. etc. But here it is nothing so. And I dare well afferme
that it was never the intent of ye perliame^t / to make any distynctyon or
dyuersytie betwyxt god and christ ne to exclude Christ fro the heedshyp of the
church: and if the perliame^t had said expressly that the king was supreme
heed. etc. under god and Christ / than noman would have taken any exception to
it. And statute is now of the same effect: and sith it is now a law of the
realm / it must be judged according to the grounds and rules of the law of
the realm / and undoubtedly they will judge the statute to be of such effect as
I have said before: and that that was the very meaning of the makers thereof /
for the words thereof prove suffycyently that it was so: and though they do so
/ yet is that judgment no thing against saint Paul: for with that it
stands very well / that Christ is the heed of the church / and that god is
also the heed of Christ / as saint Paul says.

Also when Rome was made heed of all other churches / as Platyne says it was:
yet it is uncertain what princes were warned to be at that counsel / and what
not. And if any Prince or Country were not warned to be there / than that
counsel bound not that prince / and no man can judge for certain that the
king of this realm that time being had such warning for it was in the time
when there were many kings in this realm and which of them were warned and
which not / no man can tell. And if this realm were not bound by the seyde
general counsel to accept Rhome as hedde of all churches because it had no
warning: but has by custom assented to it / than is that custom the thing
that should bind this realm to it / and not the general counsel / and than
it is no doubt if the parlyamente see a hurt follow to the comen welthe / by
that custom but that they may: yea / and are bound of justice to redress it.

Also / though it were admytted that this realm had warning and were
therefore bound by the said general counsel as other realms were: yet for
as much as a general council should be holden at certain times appointed by
the law to redress wrongs done to the people. And it is well known through
christendom: that popes in time paste have delayed such general counseyls /
further than the law would this many years. Therefore if the wrongs done by
popes / should not be reformed before a general counsel / the people might
be long grieved / and have no help of long time: and there is no reason why
they should sustain wrong any one day specially by him that dyffereth the
means whereby they might have remedy. And therefore the parlyament has good
auctoritye to remove such wrongs i^ this realm: and so have all other Realms
that be in like manner grieved as this realm was.

Also though it were not the intent of the said Phocas to take any power fro
princes / but only to make Rome the hedde of other churches: yet nevertheless
the popes have by occasyon thereof taken great power fro princes / as when they
pretended to give all spiritual promocyons through all christendom / and to
do diverse other things under the pretense that they were things mere
spiritual as in the first chapter of this answer appears: And when they
pretended to make personal cytacions to whom they would and cause them upon
pain of cursynge / to appear at Rome as well bishops as other / that all
appelles should be made to Rome / fro all bishops of crystendome / and that
all bisshoppes should be sworn to them: And that they might prohybyt what
books: and preachers they would by their own auctorite. And certain it is that
they optayned all these powers more thorough the sufferaunce of princes /
rather than by the law of god.

Also many of the said pretenses made by the bishops of Rome / and diverse
other not here remembered were dyrectly against the power of other bishops /
that they had received of the immedyate gift of god. And bishops could not
have been compelled to have suffered such vyolence if they would have resysted
it: And therefore great defaute and offense of conscience was in them / that
they would wylfully suffer such wrongs not only to their own hurt: but
also in manner to a whole confoundynge of al truth / and of al good commonwealth
in many countries.

Also / for as much as the bishop of Rome / natwithstandyng the seyde
statutes. And also natwithstandynge any other statute made in this present
parlyamente shall have as much auctoritye in this realm as his predecessors
had at the said counsel of Nycene: no man may say that they that observe those
statutes declyne fro the unity of Christ's church or fro the gospel: but he
sey also that the said counsel of Nycene did so like wise: and that no man
will say as I suppose.

Of prayenge to saints and worshyppynge of them. The third cha.
THis is a good prayer: lord I beseech the in the honor of our blessed lady and
of all the graces and virtues that thou gave unto her: for the which gracyous
gifts I and al other ar specially bound to honor and love both the and her /
that thou to thy honor and to hers grant me yt I ask if thou know it
expedient for me and if not thy will by done and not mine: And I suppose verily
yt they that made the Letani intended none other wise but that all the prayers
that be made therein to our lady and to other saints should be taken as prayers
unto our lord: that he for all the graces that he gave to them: give us his
grace and help us in all our necessyties: But no man ought to ask any peticio^
of our lady as thought she of her self has power to grant it and there be
many also that will say ferther that our lady of her own power did never yet
any miracle but yt our lord only of his power to show that he had accepted and
approved her virtue / whereby other might be encouraged to labor to have like
virtues as she had: did it. And they say also that we may not commit our
souls holly to her ne pray her to put away our sins: for none may put
away sin but only god. And furthermore I can right well agree / that saints
of them self / ne by their own power can not here our complayntes / ne know
the honor that we do to them: but sith they be always in the sight and
fruicyon of the Godheed / I suppose that they by the power of god / se them and
know them / as in most clerest glass. And that for this cause the devotion
that the people have to saints / if it be well ordered / sou^deth to the honor
of god: for that such devotion ryseth to them for the graces and virtues that
our lord of his mere goodness gave to the^ here in this world: and therefore
it is very like that the saints know that devotion so done to them to his
honor. Also it is written.i. Corin. xiii. Charitas nunquam excidit. Charity
never falls: that is to say / such charytie as a man has in this world at
his death shall not decay: but shall be much more in heaven than it was here: and
thereupon it seems to follow / that sith they here i^ this world of their
charity had compassyon of all the people: but more specially of the^ that
showed them their greifes / and prayed the^ of their comfort / that they do
likewise now: for else it should seem that their charity were not so great now
as it was than: for no man can have compassyon of any person in especyall /
but he know the thing that greueth hi^ and wherefore he does specially
compain / wherefore as it seems / it must needs follow / that the saints in
heaven / through the goodness and power of god / here and know such
complayntes as be^ made to them: for else their charytie in partyculer
necessyties of men should not be so great as it was when they were here / and
that should be against the words of saint Paul / before rehearsed. And than
whether saints in heaven thereupon pray for us or not: Verily I think there
is no vocal prayer in heaven for if saints by a vocal prayer should show all
our pertyculer peticyo^s and compleyntes to our lord / and pray him to help
us with knelynges and besechi^ges / as is used here in earth / when we would
have our peticyons granted in this world (...) / so that it be only for god
and to his honor / and that god for that love so ordered to his love / will
sometime here our complayntes: yet it is no doubt but that that complaining to
saints is the much lower degree of prayoure than a prayoure and a complaynt
made to our lord for him self: that is to say that he for his own goodness
and for the passion and death that he suffered for us and for all mankind /
will here our petycyons: and why the people should be so delygently called on
to use the lower degree of prayer that is to say to pray to Saints / and
that the excellencye and worthynesse of the higher prayer that is to say to god
for him self is so seldom declared unto the people as it has be^ in time
past: Me thi^keth it is much to be merueyled Nevertheless I can well agree /
that the first complaining / that is to say to saints / is right good: for
our lord wylbe honored and loved in diverse manners / sometime for himself /
sometime for his saints: and also he will sometime show to the world / that he
would his saints should be honored for the graces that he freely gave to them
in this world: to give other courage to endeavor them selves to have like
virtues: but he will not that the thank be holly stolen from him and given to
them: ne yet the saints would in no wise have it so: and therefore it wylbe
very dangerouse to suffer the people to make their complaints to saints or to
say their deuocyons before images after their own devotion and affections /
for undoubtedly many of them but they be often admonyshed how to order
theymselfe therein / will honor the image. And also pray to the saints with a
full trust that they shall obtain of them all that they do ask / and that
should be to the derogation of the honor that ought only to be given to god as
is said before. And than to your other question / whether it be lawful to
honor saints / or to say any prayers to our lord to their honor. It is
as me seems / but a little questyon / for sithe it is lawful to worship a
mortal man for the authority yt our lord has set him in here in this
world: or for that he is our fader or mother / or for the virtue that our
lord of his goodness has given hi^ in this mortal life / which nevertheless
he may lightly lose: much more it is lawful to honor them that be in heaven
/ for the virtue that our lord of his free gift / gave unto them here in earth
/ which they be sure they shall never lose. Nevertheless / me thinks there
may be put some dyuersytie betwixt such saints as be canonysed by scripture /
and the old ancient saints that have always be^ taken for holy by a full comen
and universal assent of all the people through an inward instyncte and
special workynge of the holy ghost in the hertes of the people / and bytwixte
such as have be^ of late time canonysed for saints at Rome for money: and by
the special labor and calling on of other that has been of the same manner of
living as they were. As of bishops for bishops / prestes for prestes /
relygyouse for relygyouse and such other. For it is very like that many have
labored for the canonysatyon of such saints as have been of the same degree of
living as they be: more of a pryuate love to them self / and for a
commendatyon of that way of living that they be of / than for the pure love
of god / or for increase of virtue among the people. And now will I therefore
shortly as I can more plainly show my conceyte / what saints a man may
undoubtedly believe to be in heaven. And first he may believe all them to be in
heaven / that be wytnessed by scripture to be holy and blessed: As it is of
our Lady: saint Johan Baptyst: the.xii. apostles saint Paul / saint
Stephan / and of the thief / to whom our lord hanging on the cross said:

This day thou shalt be with me in Paradyce / and diverse other who^ Scripture
witnesses to be blessed / and also of them that be remembered for holy.
Ecclesi. xliiii. And ad Hebre. xi. he may also take them assuredly as blessed /
that have been accepted as holy and blessed of long time by the whole assent
of the universal christen people through witness of the holy ghost given
them in their hertes that they be holy and blessed / as it is of the ancient
martyrs that in the beginning of the church / suffered death for the faith of
Christ and of other holy men and women / that have been accepted for holy by a
common assent of all the people of crystendome: for the goodness of our lord is
such that he will not suffer his universal people where they intend well run
holly into an opynion that is untrue / and there fore I suppose verily that the
devotion of the people was suffycient canonysacion to many of them that be in
scripture before any Cano^ was made of scripture. And likewise I suppose that
the greatest strength and auctorite of the new testament rose in the
beginning of the church by a full belefe / that daily rose in the hertes of
all the christian people to that that was preched by the apostles / and written
by the Eua^gelystes in the seid testament before any Canon was made of the^.
But of saints that have be^ canonysed at Rome for money / for affection or for
any such other worldly consyderation. Whose virtue and miracles: if they were
bysshoppes or prestes were specially extolled and set forth by bisshops and
prestes: and if they were of any relygyon / their virtues and miracles have be^
mightily extolled by them of the self relygyon: so that tas it seems a
devotion has been brought to them in to the hertes of many persons rather by
man's polycye than by inward instyncte of the holy ghost: of such saints it
is more dowte whether they be holy or not. And therefore to complain to them
affermynge them precysely to be holy and blessed / having none other proof
that they be so. but the witness of man yt may lightly err / seems not so
sure to complain unto as to the other. Howbeit I entende not by this saying
to afferme precysely / that they so canonysed by witness of man be not holy.
But I would avoid the presumptyon of the^ / that in such case take upon them
to judge them for holy that only belongs to god to judge upon. And I somewhat
doubt the more at such new canonysacyons because the famous clerk Johan
Gerson in a treatise that he calls the declaratyon of the defautes of men of
the church / auertyseth the general counseyle / to consider if it were well
done to canonyse

Charles duke of Brytaygne / not withstanding the great multitude of saints
that were canonysed before. And upon the eyghte treatise of Magnificat. he
under this sign. and. says / that there is a legend / which says / that a
deed dog was worshipped in Vie^na for a saint / wherefore it seems right
expedyent that all the people / but most i^ especyall the clergy and relygiouse
pray devoutly to or lord that the rulers may through ye special gift of ye
holy ghost now in this dangerous time / know whose canonysatio^ is pleasant in
his sight / and whose not / and than by a comen assent to co^ferme them / that
they shall after dilygent prayer think to be holy in such manner that they
shall be taken here after by all the people as holy and blessed to the honor of
god and increase of virtue / through ye good example and blessed life that they
shall here and read of the seyde gloriouse saints / and not to be bound to
believe that any other is holy and blessed / but they so auctorysed / as is
before said. And now will I somewhat speak of abusio^s in the mass / for that
follows next after the order of your letter.

Whether there be any opinyon among ye people / yt there be some abusyons
concerning the mass. The fourth Chapter.
WHere ye have written to me / that there is a saying in your country / that
many here about the City should find defaute a^ diverse abusyons that they
pretend to be in diverse ceremonies concerning the mass. I asserteyne you it
is even so as they say / that there be many of that opinion / they stick
fully to the effect of ye mass that is the gloriouse sacrament: But at diverse
things which as they say / be abused in that behalf they find right great
defaute. and they say further also / that if any man find defaute at such
abusio^s that diverse of the clergy will anon do that in them is / to cause it
to be noysed among the people / that he erreth in the sacrament. and they
say also that many ley people have such a pernytie and redynesse to give
credence to such reports / be they true or false / that a man shall be anon
half condemned or that the matter be any thing known as it is: and surely I
think it is true as they say / that there be many great dysorders and abusyons
concerning the mass: How be it / I will not at this time treat pertyculerly
of the^ for diverse causes: but shall beseech our lord to put it in to the
mind of all christen princes to look dilygently upon them and other like / and
se them reformed: for it is not in the power of any other to do it / and
therefore if they ley not to their hands / it is to fear that little good will
be done in such matters: but that the old way and the old abusyons will
contynew as they have done in time paste / which undoubtedly should be to the
high displeasure of god / hurt of the commonwealth / and right great danger to
ye souls of many persons.

Of pardons and absolutions. The.v. chapter.
THe power of granting of pardons and making of absolucyons has been so
far abused in time past diverse ways that it has not ben only executed
against the intent of the grau^tour that is to say of our master christ but
also so great couetyse has been showed thereby / that great grudges and murmures
have risen by occasyon on thereof in many countries and that not without great
cause. And one cause has been this:

Though our master Christ said to Peter in the name of all the appostles. Mat.
xvi. What soever thou losest upon earth shall be losed in heaven: by which words
all the apostels and their successor had auctorite to make absolucio^s / a pena
et culpa / that is to say / for the sin and fro the pain dew for the si^ne:
yet ye successors of Pe. have only taken upon them to execute that power by
way of grauntyng of perdons / as though ye power had be^ granted only to
Peter and his successors And for a further proof that all the appostles had one
like power in making of absolusyons by these words: Quodcu^que solueris. etc.
it is said in the popes own law Distinces. xxi. cap. nono. Thus: The power of
byndynge and losing Peter first took and the other appostels in like feloship
with hi^ / took like honor and power. And.xxiiii. q^. i. loquitur. It is said
that the other Appostles were as Peter was / endewed in one like fellowship both
of honor and power. And sith the power of all the appostles by witness of
the law / that is called the popes own law is like: why should than they that
pretend to be the successors of Peter / usurp that power only to them
selves: And yet that usurpation appears the more plainly by cause that in
the.xviii. chapter of Mat. our lord said to his discyples generally ye same
words before rehearsed / that is to say: what soever ye lose upon earth shall be
losed in heaven: and it must of necessyte be taken / that by that word
discyples / he meant either his apostels which be often called in the gospel
discyples: or else that he meant thereby the.lxxii. discyples: or else that he meant
them both. And if he meant thereby the.xii. apostles only / than every one of
them had yet by those words as high power as any of the other had. And if he
meant thereby the.lxxii. discyples and the.xii. Appostels also: than has every
priest to this day power to grant pardon / because he is the successor of
ye.lxxii. discyples / and if they have so a I think verily it is no doubt but
they have: it is greatly to be merueled / why they or bisshops either would
renounce and forsake that power yt was so plainly given to the^ by Christ.
Howbeit some men wene that it was done to the^tent yt they by that occasyon and
other like might make one bishop so high i^ auctorite above all other bisshops
and prestes / that he should be able to match with kings and princes: and if
bishops and prestes have that power than may kings and princes command
the^ to exercise that power for the renounsynge of their predecessoures in that
behalf byndeth them not. And nevertheless upon that renounsynge / has
followed this inco^uenyence / that none could have such pardon or absolucio^
but fro Rome / and that not freely / but for great sommes of money / except
only that to please Cardynalles / Archebysshoppes and bysshoppes. It was agreed
that Cardynalles and Archebysshoppes / should have power to grant an hundredth
days of pardone: and bysshoppes.xl. days: but as for prestes which were and
be conuersaunt daily among the people in every parysshe / and that might have
done most good therewith to the people: as I shall so^what touch afterward was no
prouysyon: for all the study and dilygence was to exalte busshops. and here it
is to be noted how great dissymulatyon and pride was in this conueyance as well
in the successors of Peter as of the other Appostles in those days: For if
that power had been only granted to Peter and his successors / than might not
he nor his successors have granted his power / nor no part thereof to any
other: for it can not be proved neither by the letter of the text / ne yet /
that it should be the intent of Christ / that he would that Peter should make
such deputyes. And he made not only Cardinals / archbysshops and bishops his
deputies to grant such pardon as he appointed them / as is aforesaid: but
he granted also many times such deputacyon condycyonally to all prestes
seculer and reguler / as though they should have their power only fro him: and
therefore he granted his pardons many times under this manner / that who soever
would give such a sum of money to the reperation of S. Peter's church at Rome
/ or to some other intent expressed in the bulls that they should among other
things have auctorite to take an able ghostly father / seculer or reguler /
that should have power to assoyle them fro all their offenses / and also fro
the pain dew for it / except that comenly in such pardons some thing was
always reserved to Rome / as for a remembrance that me^ should not forget the
way thither. And how could the pope grant power to such confessor to
assoyle any man fro pain / if the confessoures had not had that power before
of god. And if every priest have such power of god / as I think verily he
has as well as any bishop: than it seems that it were good that they should
be commanded to use that power herafter by way of absolucyon freely / to the
ease and conforte of the people / and they not to be driven to go to any
bishop for it. And if that power were so ordered / than all the good deeds that
any man should do after such absolucyons by way of penance or other wise /
should be auaylable to him to increase his joy in heaven / and not only for
puttyng away of pain for their sin passed, And as it seems it is very
conuenyent that there should be such an absolucyon a pena et culpa in christ's
church: for ye law of christ is called the law of grace and mercy. And the
old law was called the law of justice: and always in the old law / by a
full and parfyte contricyon equivalent to the actual sin: the sine / and
also the pain for the si^ne was put away / except only the origynall sin /
and therefore it should seem that the new law should be more favorable tha^ that
was / and that is as I suppose by such absolucyons / whereby all the good deeds
that the penytent shall do after the absolucyon shall be turned holly to his
reward in heaven as is before said. And furthermore if it were admytted that
the successors of Peter should have only the power to grant pardon yet
nevertheless it appears euydently yt they have i^ time past rizt greatly
abused their power therein: for the words that gave the^ power in that behalf /
be the words before rehearsed: Whatsoever thou losest upon earth shall be losed in
heaven: by which words it appears that the meani^g of our lord was / that
Peter should have non authority to lose any man by that grant: but such as
were bounden to some thing before such losing. As if a man had offended / and
were by reason of that offense bounden to a certain pain for it / that tha^
Pet^ and his successors should have power to release it. And that if he
released that pain in earth / that god would release it in heaven. And I can
right well agree that he had that power and diverse other also as I have said
before But how far his successors have abused that power: it may appear
thus: They have granted their pardons not only for releasynge of pain for
such sins as were done before the time of the grant. But they have granted
also / that all they that would give such a sum of money / should have power
to choose them an able ghostly father / that should assoyle them as well of the
offenses done after the pardon granted as before: and also of the pain for
the same. And sometime such perdons have been granted for drinking of such a
cup or such a bolle or for offrynge to such an image / or for some other
like small consyderations / and what abusyons these have been / and how
dyrectly against the intent of the grant it is apparent. And it is appera^t
also that if the successors of Peter should only have power to grant such
pardon / and that only for offenses done before the grant / that than that
grant should deliver but few from pain for their sins: in comparison of
the multitude of christen people: for every penytent may not incontinent after
his repentance go to Rome fro so far countries and ask pardon there for
their offenses passed. And therefore it seems that our lord which is all
goodness / would not make a grant that should serve to so little a purpose as
that should do / but that it should streche more at large among the people /
wherefore as I suppose the said grant shall stretch as well to the successors of
all the apostles and discyples: that is to say as well to all bishops and
prestes as to the bishops of Rome / and that ye shall not take my words in
this behalf / as things clearly vnware^ted by any auctorite or example of the
gospel. I shall show you a plain example of ye gospel / which as it should
seem by ye outward words of the gospel should stretch only to the apostles and
their successors. and that yet all prestes have auctorite thereby. And that is
upon the institucion of ye sacrament of ye altar: for it appears. Mat. xxvi.
that or lord made his mau^dye with his.xii. discyples / whereby as it seems / is
to be understand only his xii. apostles. For Luc. 22. it is said expressly yt he
sat down to supper with his.xii. apostles / whereat he instituted the gloriouse
sacrament / and said to the^: Take ye this and ete it / this is my body that
is given for you / make ye this in remembrance of me / and if by these words:
make ye this in remembrance of me: none should have power to consecrate but only
ye apostels and their successors / which most properly be taken to be bisshopes
than should al inferyor prestes which be comenly taken to be successors to
the.lxxii. discyples have no power to consecrate. and yet the comen experyence
shows yt all prestes do consecrate. And they do well therein / for they be
prestes as well as the apostels were. and so it is co^uenye^tly to be taken / ye
thi^tent of or master christ was yt all prestes should do it. and why tha^
shall it not be taken to be his entente yt he would / that what soever any
priest losed upon earth / should be losed i^ heaven as well as any bishop: rather
than that they should consecrate: for these words seem as well to be spoken to
the discyples as to ye apostles / as apperith Mat. xvi. before rehearsed. And if
any man will pretend that there be other auctorities for grau^tyng of pardons
than these that I have before rehearsed / or that will pretend that bishops
only have that power and noon but they / and yt they may as well grant perdon
before the offense to put away the pain for ye sine that shall be committed
after the grant as well as before: It will be well done that his reasons be herd
in the perlyament. And if his reason and the prouf thereupon seem suffycyent /
than to follow it: And if not I think verily that the perlyament is bound in
conscye^ce to command all priests to erecute that power freely fro henseforth
to the ease and conforte of all the people without taking any thing for it:
and I dare say further in this matter that such preachers as have in time past
instructed the people / that the bishop of Rome should have power to grant
such perdons by the virtue of the superhabundance of the meryttes of Christ's
passion / and of the meryttes of martyrs and saints in heaven / wherefore they
deserved rewards above their offenses / have not instructed the people truly
therein: for there is not a saint in heaven / but that he has through the
mercy of our lord / more reward in heaven / than ever he deserved of
himself: and if percase any such superhabundance of merytes of Saints
remained / yet the bishops of Rome had never power to distribute those merytes
by way of pardon to none other: For our lord never gave such power unto them
/ ne yet to distrybute by way of pardons the merytes of his passion.

Of restitucyon. The.vi. cha.
WHere ye write unto me / that there is a saying in your country / that there
should be some here about the city / that should doubt whether restitucyon be
necessary to saluatyon: wherefore ye desire me to write to you somewhat of my
mind concerning restitucyon. I think verily that as a man is prohybyte that
he shall do no theft wherein is contained that he shall not take his neighbors
goods wrongfully / that by the same commandment he is prohybyte to retaygne
them wrongfully / and that if he have suffycient to restore and knows also
to whom restytucyon should be made / that he is bounden upon pain of brekynge
of the said commandment / to make restitucyon. And furthermore omyttynge the
diffynycyons of doctors upon restitucyons / that is to say: to whom / by whom
what time / and under what manner restitucyons should be made upon the laws
Civil and Canon whereof many doctoures have in time past treated at great
length. I will somewhat speak of restytucyons upon cases concerning the laws
of the realm / to give spirytuall men and other that be not learned in the
laws of the realm / courage to have more knowledge of them hereafter / than
they have had in time paste: for in many cases it can natte be known
without them: where restitucyon ought to be made and where not.

First if a man have issue / two sons one before espousels / and another
after and dyeseased of certain lands in fee: and after his death his son
borne before espouselles / enters as heir / and takes the profytes / he is
bounden in this case to make restitucyo^ to his younger brother of the land and
also of the profytes. For the younger brother after the laws of the realm is
heir. But if ye elder brother in that case dyeseased / and his heir enter:
that heir is not bound to make any restitucyon. For by the old grou^des of
the law / the younger brother in that case by his laches / for that he would not
enter in his brothers life / has lost his land for ever. But that is to be
understand / where the brethren beso^nes to one woman And also where the land is
fee simple / and in both the seyde cases the elder brother after the law canon
is heir / and shall enheryte.

If a man have lands in fee simple by descent fro his father / and dye without
issue of his body / and have no heir on the part of his father / wherefore
the next heir of the part of his mother pretendi^g to be his next heir /
enters and takes the profits / that heir is bounden to make restitucyon to
ye lord of whom the land is holden: for the lord ought to have it by the
law as his eschete. But if a man purchase lands in fee / and dye with out
heir of his body / tha^ for lack of heirs of the part of his father the
heirs of the part of his mother / shall have the land and not the lord by
eschete.

If a man have lands in fee by dyscent tro his mother / and he makes a
feoffament thereof. etc. And feoffe makes a lease for term of life to a
stranger ye remaindre i^ the fee to him again and to his heirs. And after he
dies without heir of his body / in this case the heirs of the part of his
father shall have the land. And if the remayndre in that case were that it
should go to him and to his heirs of the part of his mother / yet the
remayndre should go to his heirs of the part of his father: for those words
of the part of his mother be void in ye law / as they should be if a man
would infeoffe another to have to him and to his heirs of the part of his
mother: for the heirs of the part of his father natwithsta^ding those words
shall have the land / and therefore in both the seyde cases: if the heirs of
the perte of ye mother enter i^to the land / they be bou^de^ to restore it to
the heirs of the perte of the father.

If a man that has lands in fee by dyscent fro his mother / dyeseased / and
the lands discende to his son and heir: and that son and heir dies without
heir of his body in this case / the heirs of the part of his graundmother
shall have the land

And if either ye heirs of the part of the father or ye heirs of the perte of
his mother enter / they be bou^de^ to make restitucyon to the heirs of the
part of his graundmother.

A man has two sons by several wyfes / the one son purchases lands to him
and to his heirs / and dies without heir of his body: if his brother in this
case enter as heir / he is bound to restore it to hi^ or her yt is heir to
his brother on his fathers side: for the ground of the law is / that one of
the half blood shall never be heir to him that he is but of ye half blood
unto.

Also if a man hold.ii. houses of two several lords by heryote custom /
where the custom is that no heryote shall be paid but of quycke catell: and he
has no quycke catell but one horse and dies / one of the lords seaseth the
horse. and after the other Lord fyndeth the same horse / and seaseth him as
his heryote in this case he his bound to restore the horse to the lord that
first seized him: for by that first ceasing he has by the law of the realm
right to the horse / and the other has lost his herriot for that time. And the
same law is / if a man hold.ii. acres of land of.ii. several lords by
knights service / and by owelty of feffeme^t and dies / his heir with in age
in this case that lord that first seaseth the body has rizt to it

If a man hold an acre of land of one man by knights service by prioritye /
and an other acre of land of another man by knights service by posteryoritye
and dies seized his heir being within age / and the lord of whom the land
is holden by posteryoritye / seaseth the body of ye said infaunte as his ward.
In this case he is bounden to restore it to the lord by prioritye: for by the
law the wardship of the body belongs to him / except yt the same auncestre
hold any land of the king by knights seruyces: for if he did the king shall
have the prefermente of the body by his prerogatyue whether the land were
holden of him by prioritye or posteryorite: in cheyfe or as an eschete.

If there be two joint tenau^tes of a wode / and the one of the^ sells all the
wode / and takes ye money to his own use: in this case he is bou^de^ to
restore the half of that money to the other ioynttenau^t: for though the law
give no remedy to ye other ioynttenau^t for it: yet it ware^teth not him yt
has the money / that he may with conscience retain it.

If one ioynttenaunt take all ye gresse and fruits to his own use / where else
they should have been lost for laches of ye other: there he is not bound to
restore any part: but if his fellow would have taken his part / and the other
would not suffer hi^ / than he is bound to restore hi^ his perte. And so it is
/ if one ioynte tenant or tenant in common / sow the one half of the errable
ground and leueth the other half for his fellow / and when the corn is ripe
/ his fellow takes half of the corn / pretendynge that the half is his
through all. In this case he is bound to restore the whole to him that sewe
the ground. etc.

If a woman have goods personal and also real / as a lease for term of
years: a wardship or such other and after she takes a husband / and he dies
after whose death his executours takes all the said chatels / as well real as
parsonall / in this case the executoures be bound to restore ye wife of the
chatels real: but not of the chatels personal / nor no part of them / her
necessary werynge apparel only excepted.

A man has a manner / whereto comen is appe^daunt. And also an aduouson / and
he of his mere motyon makes a feoffame^t of ye said manner / and puts not i^
these words cum perrine^ciis. etc. the feoffe occupies the comen. And also
wha^ the aduouson falls void he prese^teth to the aduouson: in this case he
is bound to restore the feoffer for the aduouson. But the comen he may
lawfully occupye still. etc.

If the son be attaynted of felonye in the life of the father / and after
has the kings chartoure of pardon. etc. and than his father dies / seized of
land in fee simple and the son so attaynted / enters as heir: In this case
he is bound to restore the land to the lord of whom the land is holden:
For though he have his chartoure of pardon / yet his blood is so corrput by ye
attayndour / that he may not be heir to any man: And if the lands be
entayled / he is bound to let the king have them during his own life. And
than after his death / the heirs of his body shall have the lands according
to the first gift. etc.

If an infant make a covenant to give one for his meat and drink for such a
certain time / a horse / and when he has been with him according / he gives
him the horse And also he sells him another horse for a certain some of money
i^ this case he is bou^de^ to restore the last horse to the infant again / but
not the horse that he had for his meat and drink. etc.

An infant of the age of.xx. years having suffycient reason to order him self
and his goods / sells a manner / and with the money thereof bieth another
manner that is of better value and more profitable to him than the first was /
and after he enters into the first manner / because he was within age at the
time of the sale: in that case he is bound to restore the money that he
received for the first manner / except the perfites yt the byer received of ye
sa^e manner in ye mean time / but ye manner he is not bound to restore / for he
has rizt to it by ye law of ye realm.

A man makes a feoffement in fee to another upon condicyon that the feoffe
shall not alyen the land to none other person. And if he do yt it shall be
lauful for ye feoffour and his heirs to reentre / and after the feoffe
alyeneth the land contrary to his condicyon and the feoffoure enters: in this
case the feoffour is bound to restore the land to the alyene. And the reason
is because the said condicyon is void in the law.

A tenant for term of life does waste: in this case he is bound in
conscience to restore him in the reuercyon of the value of the thing wasted /
immedyately after ye wast done. But of ye treble damages n^ of ye lyeu wasted
he is not bound to make restitue. till it be recovered against hi^ by the law
of the realm.

If a man dissease another and dye seized and his heir e^treth / that heir
and all his heirs after hi^ knowi^g the wrong / be bound to restore the land
to the disseysye and his heirs and no prescription ne contynua^ce of long
possession can help in this

If a man dissease another (case, and dye seized and his heir enters as in ye
case before remembered and after ye disseasye dies without heir general or
special: in this case the heirs of the disseasour is discharged of any
restitucio^ as for the rizt of ye land to any person: for there is none that
can claim that right as heir to him that the wrong was done unto: and the
lord of who^ the land was holden can not have it by eschete / for the ground
of the law is / that land shall not eschete where the lord has a tenant /
upon whom he shall be compelled to auowe / and therefore the right in this case
shall extyncte to the tenaunte: and also in some case a man may have right to
land and a title of enter also: and yet if he dye without heir the tenaunte
shall not be bound to make restitucyon to the lord by way of eschete: as if
an infant be disseased / and the disseasour dies seized / so that the land
descends to his heir / and after the infant dies without heir general or
special: in this case the heir of the disseasoure is not bound to restore
the land to the lord by way of eschete: and yet the infant might have
entered. And the dyuersyttes of these cases and of many other like / depend
only upon the grounds and maxismes of the laws of the realm / and therefore
if they be natte known / the right can natte be known. But than in what manner
a man that has gods or lands wrongefully in any manner / and knows not to
who^ he ought to make restitucyon / shall order him self for discharge of his
conscience have been diverse opinyons / some men have thought in time past /
that if the party so bounden to restitucyon / opteyned a dispensacyo^ fro Rome
/ that some porcyon thereof should be dysposed in such wise / as it should be
therein assygned that it should suffyce: and I think that no less porcyon
than the whole could never have suffyced: But if a man according to such
dispensacyon dysposed the whole value in such use as the dispensacyon lymyted:
I think it suffyced if the party that should restore / thought the use
lymited in the dyspensacyon so charytable / that he thought his conscye^ce was
thereby dyscharged. But if he thought a another use more charitable he might /
and yet may dyspose it accordingly if he will / and let the dyspensacyon alone:
And yet the people have been brought in belefe that in such case restitucyon
must of necessytie be made by auctorytye of such a dyspensacyon / orels at the
lest by counsel of his ghostly father. And if it be so done / I will not say
but that it is right well done / so that the counsel satysfye the conscience
of him that shall do it: But if they give counsel that such goods shall be
dysposed in such manner / that after the conscience of him that must restore is
not most charytable / as for singing of trentalles / keeping of obyttes /
fyndyng of scolers / or such other. And he therefore that must restore refuse
that counsel / and dispose it to such use as his conscience serves him best
to: as percase to releue poor men in extreme necessytie: to make high ways /
or such other like. I think he takes the better way / and that he is thereby
clearly dyscharged in conscience. How be it if he take to hi^ some of the
clergy or some lay men in whose conscience he has good trust to give him
counsel therein: I think he does the better / but that he should be enforced
of necessytie either to dyspose it only after as such dyspensacyon fro Rome
have apoi^ted in time past / or else as some spyrituall counsel should
appoynte and in non other manner there is no cause ne assured ground why it
should be so. And I have showed you my conseyte in these matters before rehearsed
/ to none other intent / but that I would give you occasyon to help / if ye
could to have such matters ordered / here after in such manner / as shall be
thought most to ye pleasure of god and to the health of the souls of the people
/ al couetyce and syngularytie laid aparte. For surely right great parcyalytie
has been seen in such matters in time past: but yet there be some cases wherein
many men and that such men as have been notably learned have douted in / whether
restitucyon should be made to the party that ought it or not: as in case that
a man wyn money by usury / or at dyse or cards / or such other unlawful games
/ whether restitucyon ought to be made in such cases to the party self or
not because he was party to the same offense / and many have thought nay but
yt it must be dysposed in some other good charytable use. And I can right well
agree to their opinion therein: But I think verily that if a man wyn money of
another by false dyse or other falshed / that he is bound in that case to
restore it to the party self: for the party shall in that case have an
accyon at the kings laws upon that falshed and recover his damages.

And furthermore I will show some cases where the laws of the realm / and
the laws which the clergy do often follow in restitucyons: do varye / whereby
every man may lyghtely conjecture / that there be many moo that they varye in:
if they were well and dilyge^tly serched.

First if a man bye a thing in open market he is not bounden after the laws of
the realm to restore it again / unless yt he know at ye time of the bargeyne
that he that sold it had no right in the goods. And yet after the seyde other
laws he is bounden to restore it if he come to the knowledge after who is the
very owner. And that he may not without dedly sin hold that is bought. And
that is not so in this realm. Also if a man bye lands with the churches
money in his own name / and to his own use / the lands after the laws of
the realm be his. And he is not bound to restore the lands to the church but
the money only. And yet after the law Canon / the land in that case is the
churches lands because it is boughte with the churches money. and therefore the
laws concerning restytucyons would be seen and be driven for clerenesse of
conscience to a more nerer certayntie than they be yet. And thus I have showed
you somewhat of my conceyte concerning restitucyon to give other that shall se
this letter occasyo^ to treat further of that matter herafter. And now will I
somewhat speak of the declarynge of Scripture.

Who has power to declare and expound scripture / and whose declaracyon we
be bound to follow and whose not. The.vii. chapter.
THis questyon is of so great difficulty that I shall desire you to hold me
excused though I fully satisfy not your mind therein for surely I will protest
that it passes my power to speak in the matter as were necessary to be spoken
/ for there be few matters as I take it that moore requires to be plainly
touched and declared than that does: ne that would do more good now in this
daungerouse time / than that would do / if it were set in a clear and in an
upright way: howbeit I consider with all / that if I said nothing to it / ye
would somewhat merueyl why I did not answer to that questyon / as well as to
the other contained in your letter. Therefore to give you and other that shall
happen to see this letter / occasyon to treat moore grou^dly and more
thoroughly of this matter herafter than I do: I shall with good will say somewhat
to it. First it is to be understand that there be some textes of scripture
that be so open and plain in them selves that every man is bound to give full
credence unto them: for the lytterall sense is the plain exposition in it
self: As when it is said / Mat. primo. This is the book of the generacyon of
Jesus Christ / son of David / son of Abraham: Abraham forsooth begat Isaac.
etc. And who may make any exposition upon these words but that it must needs
be granted that Jesus Christ was the son of Dauyd / son of Abraham. And
that Abraham begat Isaac: But he speak directly against the words of the
gospel: in somoche that if all the clerks of ye world would make any
exposition to the contrary thereof: no man were bounden to believe them. And
they for that exposition were worthy to be disseuered fro the company of al
faith full people: for the lytterall sense is so plain against them / wherein
the holyghost is always the very auctour and speker: that they should be
without all excuses / for he that resysteth Scripture / resysteth the holy
ghost. And so it is upon this gospel: Missus est angelus. etc. An angel was
sent fro god into a city of Galylye that had to name Nazareth / to a vyrgin
espoused to a man called Joseph of the house of Dauyd. And the name of the
vyrgin was Marye. And who may say therefore that the angel was not sent fro
god to the vyrgi^ Mary / or that she was not espoused to Joseph / or that
Joseph was not of the house of Dauyd: but he plainly denied the text: for the
text is so plain in it self that it needs therein no declaracyon.

And so it is in the most part of all the Scripture / both of the old
testament and new. But yet there be some other textes in Scripture which be
not so euydente and plain / as those and many other be / and yet if they be
truly understand / according to the mind of the maker / that is to say / of
our master Christ / the lytterall sense of them is as true as the other that
be most plain / as it is of this text. Mat. vi. Ego dico vobis non iurare
omnino: I say to you swear not for every cause / neither by heaven / for it is
the Throne of god: nor by the earth / for it is the seat for his fete: neither
by Jerusalem / for it is the City of the great king / nor by thy heedde
thou shall not swear: for thou can not make one here white or black Let
these be your words: It is it is / it is natte / it is not. Forsooth
whatsoever is more tha^ this / it is of evil. Thus far goth the said text of
Mat. vi. before rehearsed / and Also of this text that is Mar. xvi

He that believes and is baptized shall be safe. And therefore he that by reason
of the said first text Mat. v. would think it were not lauful to him to swear
in any case / were foul disceiued: for i^ such countries where oaths have be^
used for trial of the troth / every man is bound to swear according to the
laws: for the trial of the troth / for else justice should many times perissh
And in likewise if any man by reason of the said other text. Mat. xvi would say
that if a man byleued and were baptized / that he should be saved though he did
no good works / where he had time conuenye^t after his baptysme to have done
them / he were also far disceyued wherefore it were good for him that were in
dout in those cases or other like / as be concerning scripture to ask
counsel of some of the clergy that as he thinks be suffycyently learned in
scripture / like as it is conuenyent in doutes of Physyke to ask counsel of
doctoures of Phisyke / or in doutes of the te^porall law to ask counsel of
them that be learned in the temporal law And if he in any dout of scripture ask
counsel of such clerks as he thinks be suffycyently learned in scripture /
and they instruct hi^ other wise than the true understanding of the scripture
is / yet that suffyceth for him / so it be not dyrectly against the law of
reason: for that all men are bounden to know.

But sith they of the clergy have auctorite by the gospel to preach the
gospel / they are more bounden to know the gospel tha^ any other But than
there be some other texttes in the scripture that concern the authority /
power / jurisdiction and richesse of bishops and prestes as it is upon these
textes: Quodcu^que liga^eris. etc. Tu es Petrus et super hanc Pet^am. etc. Tibi
dabo claues. etc. Mat. xvi. Quodcu^que ligaueritis. etc. Mat. xviii. Dic
ecctie. Mat. xviii. Ecce duo gladii hic. Luc. xxii. etc. Oraui perte Petre vt
non deficiat fides tua: et in aliqu^ co^uersus. etc. Luc. xxii. Pasce oues
meas. Io. xxi. Predicate eua^gelm oi^ creature. Mar, vltio Nolite possidere
aurum neque arge^tu^. Mat x. etc. Qui no^renu^crauerit possidet oi^aq^ no^
potest meus esse discipulus. luc. 14. sicut misit me pr^ and ego mitto vos Io.
xxi. Quorum remiseritis peta. etc. Io. xx. habe^tes alime^ta and quibus
tegamur. etc. i. Timo. vi. Nolite ta^gere christos meos. ps. 44. And many other
which I here omit. and if a man were in dout upon these textes / what power
jurisdiction possessions or lyberte ye clergy ought to have by the said textes:
or whether such acts and laws as have be^ made bi^ princes and their people
concerning such things were to be obeyed: or such other like, Many men think
that it were natte the most surest way to ask counsel therein of the learned
me^ in the clergi / onles it were of some si^guler elect me^ that through
special grace / have seq^stred their minds fro ye love of all worldly honor
and riches: for the affection to such worldli pleasures have blinded ye
judgment of many of the^ so sorees yt they have thought / ye the mayntenaunce
of the honor of the clergy has been a mayntenaunce of the honor of god. And
so as it were under a pretense to maynteyne the honor of god have dyspleased
god and maynteyned their own honor and richesse / farther than the seyde
textes / or any other part of scripture will warrant them to do. This has been seen in some of the clergy / but I trust it be not so in all /
nevertheless to speak somewhat further of this matter. I think that if any
doubt rise upon any text of scripture / be it plain or not plain concerning
the faith or moral lyui^g of the people or not: orels the honor / lyberty /
and riches of the clergy / or any other thing whatsoever it be. if there fall
any varya^ce or unquietness thereupon among the people: as if one doctoure or
many / and some of the lay people be of one opinyon therein: and other of a
another opinyon / and thereupon dyuersyties of opinyons and unquietness among
the people do rise / that in all these cases / kings and princes shall be
judges / and have power to pacyfye all such unquietness. For it appears
Psalm. ii. that it is said thus to kings and princes O ye kings / understand
ye: be ye learned that judge the world. And if it be said that by those words
/ Judge the world / that kings and princes must judge only upon temporal
things: as upon the bodies / lands and goods. And not upon any thing that
apperteineth to the soul: trewly that is a right great error / for it would
bring the people in belefe / that the successors of the apostles and
discyples of Christ have only cure of souls and not kings and princes. And
that is not so: for it is no dout / but if a prince suffer his people wylfully
break the laws of god / or the laws of his realm and se them not corrected
according to his laws but that he offends god rizt highly thereby as every
man shall do / that willyngly and wylfully suffers his servants break the law
of god without correctyon / when he may well correct them: and over that no
man can deny but that every man is bound to procure the ghostly health of his
neighbor by cou^seylyng and good example gyuynge to his power as it is
written. Eccl. xvii. God has given a commandment to every man upon his
neybour: and sith every man has a charge of his neighbor / it must needs
follow that a king has a more special charge over his subjects: and yt he
is specially bounde^ to prohibyt all things as nigh as he can whereby his
subjects spirytuall or temporal might have occasion to break the laws of
god: and the charge of the clergy is to mynister the sacraments to the people
and to preche and teache them how to please god and keep his commandments:
and if they be neglygent and do not so / kings and princes ar bounden to
command them to do it. And if they give the people evil example / princes ar
bound to make the^ leave it: let every man therefore judge whether any curate may
truly say: the king has only cure of the bodies of my parysshens / but I of
their souls: for it is no dout but that kings and princes have cure and
charge over both / and that not only over ye souls of lay me^: but also of
the souls of bishops and prestes: and therefore such vain sayenges would be
prohibyt / for they nourisshe and engendre great pride / and for a further prouf
that princes may pacify all manner of vnqietnes yt may rise among their people
by any manner of occasion spu^all or temporal. It is said Exo. vi. a wise
king is the stablenesse of his people: whereof it follows / yt if the
unstableness come by occasyon of any exposycion of scripture / be it by
doctors / prechers / or any other / that kings have power to stable the^. And
of that it follows also that if any man will preach in such manner that it is
like to make unquietness among the people that the prince may prohybit him of
that prechyng: for he that has authority to remove an unquietness present:
has auctorite to prevent occasions whereby such unquietness might happen to
follow after among his subjects. Furthermore / all men agree that the
catholyque church may expound scripture: and if the clergy can prove that
they be the catholyke church / than it belongs to them to expound it. But
if the emperors / kings and princes / with their people / as well of the
clergy as of the lay fee make the catholic church and the clergy but a
part of that church: than may the emperor / kings and princes with their
people expound it. But for as much as the universal catholic / people can
not be gathered together to make such exposycion / therefore it seems that
kings and princes who^ the people have chosen and agreed to be their rulers
and governors / and which have the whole voices of ye people / may with
their counsel spirytuall and temporal make exposycyon of such scripture as
is doutfull / so as they shall think to be the true understanding of it / and
none but they / and that their subjects be bounden even by the law of god to
follow their exposycion for the goodness of our lord is such that he will
not leave his people in such doutes but that they may have some means whereby
they may come to the knowledge of the troth so as shall be necessary to their
saluatyon if they will dyspose them to it / and that is by obedyence to their
princes whom god has appointed to have rule over them / as is before said.
And here it is to be noted / that there be two manner of powers that kings and
princes have over their subjects: The one is called / Ius regale / that is to
say a kyngely governance: And he that has that power may with his counsel
make laws to bind his subjects / and also make declaration of Scypture for
the good order of his subjects / as need shall require / for appeasyng of
varyance. The other is called / Ius regale politicum / that is to say a
kynglye and a polytyke governance. And that is the most noble power that any
prince has over his subjects / and he that rules by that power / may make
no Law to bind his subjects without their assent / but by their assent he
may so that the laws that he makes be not against the law of God / nor the
law of reason: And this power has the kings grace in this Realm: where he
by assente of his lords spirytuall and temperall: and of his commons gathered
together by his commandment in his parlyamente may make laws to bind the
people And of those laws there needs no proclamation / because they be made
by all the people / for the perliament so gathered together / the people
represents the estate of all the people within this realm / that is to say of
the whole catholyque church thereof. And why should not the parlyament than
which represents the whole catholyke church of England expound scripture
rather than the conuocacyon which represents only the state of the clergy:
and over that me thi^keth that no man ought to pretend that at a general
counsel any other should be iuges but kings and princes and such as they
will appoynte under them to bear voices therein: seeing that they have the power
and voice of the whole people of christendom / which is the catholyque church
as is said before: and I think verily that general counsels shall do little
good till christian princes will know their own power and the auctorite that
they have received of god over his people / and that they set the clergy in
such power as they ought to have by ye law of god without diminisshi^g of it
in any manner: and to se also that they have no more but as shall be thought
expedyent for the comenwelth / and also for the health of their own souls and
of the people. And surely it is greatly to be douted / that the power that
bysshoppes of Rome have claymed in time past over princes and other bysshoppes
/ have been a great occasyon of the desolacyon of many countries that now be
esteemed among us latyns as scismatykes and desperate persons. And therefore it
is good that the Emperor and all christian kings and princes and the clergy
also look well upon the matter and to se whether the said countries were not
most pri^cypally esteemed as heretykes and scysmatykes because they went fro the
obedience of Rome / tha^ for any other cause: and whether there was such
dilygence charity and meekness showed to have the^ reformed as ought to have been showed: or yt they were extremely or happily / maliciously handled by
excomunycatyons and interdictions as men unworthy the confort of christ's
passion yt so would fall fro ye obedience of the heed of Christ's church: And
yet undoubtedly the saluatyon or dampnatio^ of christian men stands not in that
point / whether Rome be the head of christ's church or not. And I mean all
this that I have said of ye Grecyans / of the Suria^s of the Iacobytes / of the
Nestorians whereof great perte be now in Percye which is heed enemy to the cursed
turks Of ye armins: The georgia^s that be great archers and very apt me^ to
the war: Of the Abasynes otherwise called Indyans: and of ye Maronytes and of
these Maronytes: Bernard deane of ye church of magunce in his book of his
journey to Jerusalem / writes that ye said Maronytes about. v. C. years were
heretykes separated fro the company of faithful people: but at the last he
says / that through the inspiracyo^ of god / they turned to their own hertes:
and confessi^g that they had erred were no^bred again in ye obediens of ye
church of Rome: and returned to ye unite of ye catholyke faith and that
thereupon though all the bishops of ye Est pertes and the chief prelates of
other nations use no ringes miters ne bishops staves: yet says he that these
Maronites use the^ al as we do i^ their divine seruyces and ministration of the
sacraments. And thus were they seyth he reformed: but yet it may be douted
whether they were natte reformed to more pride than they had before: and I
beseech our lord that all christen princes through the inspyration of god may
encourage the^ self to bring all the seyde people and us also to the very
true obedyence of Christ and of his laws / and to a true understanding / and a
devout following of his scripture all worldly pomp: pride / and desire of
worldly honor / specially in the clergy / which ought to be the light and
leders of the lay people / utterly dispysed and set a part asmoch as in them
is: and than I dout not but that great charytie and grace shall shortly after
appear among the people. And than forthermore if a man be in doubt upon any
thing concerning scripture as is said before / and he has no counsel to
instruct him therein / or else if there be counsel / the counsel varyeth
among them self as is said before. And princes have no time yet to determyne
the matter. Tha^ it is good that he so being in dout lift up his heart to god /
and ask counsel of him: and if he do so / undoubtedly our lord will so help
him and assyst him therein / that he shall not err / ne be disceyued: For it is
written. ii. Paralip. xx. Cum ignoremus quid facere / debeamus hoc solu^
residui habemus vt oculi nostri ad te dirigantur.

That is to say / Lord / when we be ignorant and wot not what to do / this
only remains to us for our confort / that we lift our eyes up to the. And if
we do so we may trust verily that his help and counsel will never fail us /
but will bring us to the knowledge of that that is necessary for us.

An answer to diverse short particular questions contained in the letter.
The.viii. chapter.
TO all the short partyculer questions contained in your letter. I will
brefely as I can make answer in this.viii. cha. And as to the first of ye said
particular questyons / I think that kings and princes might have prohybyt the
clergy to have ordained amongst the^ patryarkes / cardnials / or any other
degree i^ the clergy but only bishops / prestes and deako^s.

Also if a man had taken two benefyces with cure i^ this realm / they both
after the old grounds of the law of the realm had been void / and this
voydance was called cessyon but in process of time lycenses were opteyned from
Rome to have two benefices. And those lyce^ses by power of the clergy were
iuged to be good / and so the law and custom of the Realm in that point was
broken. And yet it will be very hard to prove it by the law / that it should
have been so. And nevertheless by reason thereof / the seyde ground was altered
to this effect / that if a man took two benefyces without dyspensacyon fro Rome
/ that both benefyces should be void but if the first ground were clearly
reuyued and none to have but one benefyce / it were well done: for the breking
of that ground has done great hurt / and than it might there upon be provided
that he that is more worthy should have the better benefyce and no union of
benefyces to be made in time to come.

Also though the apostles and discyples of Christ and their successors had
auctorite by the gospel to preche the gospel: yet that any one of them should
have auctorite to prohybyt another of them of prechyng / appears not by the
gospel but in case that any take upon him to preche and teache any thing against
the catholycall faith / to the parell and danger of the kings subjects /
and whereby scysmes and varyaunces be like to follow among his people: such
of the clergy as knows it / ar bound to inform the king of it / and than
he thereupon may prohibyt them of prechyng / and see them corrected as the case
requires. But if the rulers in the clergy / should have full authority to
make such prohibicyons / it might be that abusio^s in the clergy should not be
so well touched as charytie would they should be / and that might be great
hurt and trouble to all the realm / and that the king and his parlyament has
auctorite to make that prohibycyon. The clergy of england knew right well
wha^ they labored in the parlyament / that commyssyons should be granted to ye
sheryffes to arest prechers of heresy. Anno.ii. Rich. ii. stat. ii. Cap. vltimo.

And as to that opinyon that ye write to me of / whether the souls that be
dyscessed in grace be now in heaven / or that they rest for a certain time in
a place to them appointed by god: till that the time of the generail
ressurection shall come / so that the body and the soul may be joined
together / and than they both together to go to heaven and have the fruycyon of
the godheed and not before. Verily I have herd but little speaking thereof
many a day. For scripture is so plain therein / And is now so well known to
many by the reason that it is come in to the English tongue / that diverse that
have douted therein in times past / be now contented and hold their pease.
And part of the textes that have somewhat stablysshed the^ therein / I shall
brefely recyte. One text is Psalm. C.xxvi. where it is said:

Cum dederit dilectis suis somnum ecce hereditas domini: filii merces: fructus
ventris. That is when our lord has given to his beloved / sleep: lo the
inherytance of our lord / the reward of the son / and the fruit of the
womb: which is thus much to say: That when our lord has taken a
ryghtwyse man / not bound to any sin / ne to any pain for sin / by the
sleep of natural death that forthwith comes the enherytaunce of god / the
reward of the son of god: That is to say / the eternal glory of heaven.
And the fruit of the womb / which is christ Another text is this: our lord
said to his discyples. Ioh. xiii. If I go fro you / and prepayre to you a
place / I will come again and take you to my self / That where I am / you
shall be. And so sith he is in heaven / it must needs follow that they be there
with him.

And also he said. Iohannis xvii. Father / those that thou have given to me /
I will / that where I am / that they shall be with me that they shall see my
clerenesse which thou haste given me.

And also it appears Apocalipsis.xiiii. That Saint Johan saw a Lamb
standing on the mount of Syon / and with him a hundredth and.xliiii. M. having
his name and the name of his father / written in their foreheeddes: and they
sang as it had be^ a new song before the sete / and before the.iiii. bestes
and seygnyours / that no man could say but those.C.xliiii. M that were bought
fro the earth. And in that he says yt they were bought fro the earth / it
appears that they were the souls of the^ which had lived before in earth /
which saint Johan saw en vysyon standing before god. And it can not be taken
that they were there in body and soul / but in soul only. It appears also
in the gospel that Lazar was in the bosom of Abraham.

And it is no doubt but that the body of Abraham that time slepte. By these
textes and diverse other not here rehearsed / that matter is well appesed / so
that I would not have written to you any thing therein / but that ye desired
me in your letter so to do.

Also there be some here about the city that think that they that endeavor
them self to withdraw the minds of the people somewhat fro the inordynate
going on pilgrymages / prayeng to saints / and worshippynge of them: And fro
worshippynge of images and relyques: and stir them to set their minds and
their devotion / holly and fully in Christ our savior / of whom all goodness
comes in heaven and in earth / do more to maynteyne the true honor to our lady
and to other saints / tha^ they that endeavor them self to maynteyne such
things after the old fashion all that they can: for saints would have no
honor given to them / ne any trust put in them: but it were princypally for
Christ and to his honor. And they say also that no man may with clear
conscience move the people to continue such things after the old manner. But
they move them likewise to be well ware of such parelles and dangers / as
they may lyghtelye fall in to by occasyon thereof: but they take good head.
And I think verily that it is even true as they say in that behalf.

Also it is true that there be right many here about the City as well of the
clergy / as of the commen people / that think that some doctors that have
written upon Scripture in time past / have in things concerning the honor
power / lybertye / and richesse of the Clergy exte^ded Scripture / very far
i^ favor of the clergy: But upon all places of Scripture that concern the
faith and the moral living of the people: they think the doctoures have
taken the true sense of it / and verily I suppose it is even as they say.

And I think further that it were right expedyent that it should be often
declared and made manifest to the people / that Scripture is the thing that is
of highest auctorytie in the church of god / and that it is always true and
may never be denied / and that the more it is known and loved / the more
goodness shall follow of it: for it is the fou^dacion of the church: the
shield of the world: the subuersio^ of the fend / the ladder to paradise and
the very true fode of the soul and is also of more virtue and ghostly strength
/ than ar the sayenges of all doctors and saints / wherefore blessed be they
that can well follow it: And now have I according to your desire showed you my
conceyte to all the artycles contained in your letter. And thus I commit you to
our lord Jesus. Amen.
