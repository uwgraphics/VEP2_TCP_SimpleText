Cum Priuilegio.

TO THE RIGHT NOble and most worthy, EDWARD Lord, DENNY, Baron of Waltham,
Thomas Weelkes wishes the happiness of both worlds.
RIGHT HONORABLE,
IT were needless to commend the worth of music to a noble and understanding
disposition: for in the natures of Arts and generous spirits, there is a
sympathy, this being only graced by them; and they the only patrones of this
profession: I have presumed, though not worthy your acceptance (as to the
favorer of all virtue) humbly to entreat your Lordship to patronize these my
simple labors, which if your Lordship vouchsafe, they have their hire, and my
self ever bound (as is my duty) to do your Lordship all faithful, dutiful
and acceptable service.

THOMAS VVEELKES.

Then if she chance to glance in,
Give us two room to dance in,
Though my green ierkin bare it

^ Upon a hill, a hill, the bony bony, boy, ^ sweet Thirsis sweetly played, and

his ^ mind, his mind, withdrew his mind, withdrew his mind, his mind ^ from
other things.

2
His pipe and he could not agree,
for Milla was his note,
This silly pipe could never get,

blood, it is very very good, it is very good.

2
Fill the pipe once more,
My brains dance trenchmore,
It is headdy,
I am geeddy,
My head and brains,
Back and raines,
Iointes and veins,
From all pains,
It does well purge and make clean.
Then those that do Condemn it,
Or such as not Commend it,
Never were so wise to learn,
Good Tobacco to discern
Let them go, pluck a crow, and not know as I do
The sweet of Trinidado.

^ COme, come lets begin lets begin to reuel't out, ^ to reuel't out, and tread
the hills and dales a- bout, ^ that hills and dales and woods may sound, an
Echo ^.ii. to this warbling round. ^

Lads merry be with music sweet,
and Faires trip it with your feet,
Pans pipe is dull, a better strain,
does stretch it self to please your vain,
II.
^ IOckey thine horn pipes dull, give wind ^ man at full, fie upon such a sad
gul, like an hoody ^ doody, all to moody, toodle, loodle, pipe it up thicker,
i will tread it ^ the quicker: why then about it roundly,.ii. and I will ^ foot it
foot it.ii..ii. soundly, i will take my steps the shorter, ^ as if I trampled,
trampled trampled mortar.

Darite grows so grave,
I may not her have:
In around when I do crave,
with hoop sir hoy day, O you hurtme
Toodle, Toodle,
set me thy work by
and come to me smurkly.
Then if she chance to glance in,
Give us two room to dance in,
Though my green ierkin bare is
Us two to all the parish,
III.
^ SOme men desire spouses, that come of noble ^ houses, and some would have in
marriage ladies ^ of courtly carriage, fa la fa la la fala la la la, but few ^
desire as I do, the maidenhead, the maidenhead.ii. ^.ii. of a widow, fa la la
la fa la la ^ la la la la la.

2
Some think fair youth will cherish,
Strength that begins to perish,
le have no colts to taming,
Let me be young'st at gaming.
I Will get ore, i will go nigh too,
The maidenhead of a widow.
IIII.
^ TO morrow is the marriage day of Mopsus ^ and fair Phillida, Come
shepherds bring your ^ garlands gay,.ii..ii. ^ your garlands gay.

2
Ifloue lie in so foul a nest,
and fowlenes on so fair a breast,
What lover may not hope the best.
3
O do not weep fair Bellamoure,
though he be gone there is many more,
for love has many loves in store.
V.
^ Upon a hill,.ii. a hill, the bony bony boy, ^ sweet Thirsis sweetly played,
and calde his lambs ^ their maistersioy, and more he would have said, but
love, but love ^ that gives the lovers wings, withdrew his mind, his mind from
other ^ things, from o- there things.

2
His pipe and he could not agree,
for Milla was his note,
This silly pipe could never get,
this lovely name by rote.
With that they both fell in a sound,
he fell a sleep, his pipe to ground.
VI.
^ COme sirrah Jack hoe, fill some Tobacco, bring a wire, ^ and some fire,
have have away, quick I say, do not stay, shun delay, for ^ I drank none good
to day: I swear that this Tobacco it is per ^ fect Trinidado, by the very mas,
never was better gere then is here, for ^ the blood, it is very good.

2
Fill the pipe once more,
My brains dance trenchmore.
It is headdy,
I am geeddy,
My head and brains,
Back and raines,
Iomtes and veins,
From all pains,
It does well purge and make clean.
Then those that do Condenme it,
Or such as not Commend it,
Never were so wise to learn,
Good Tobacco to discern
Let them go, pluck a crow, and not know as I do
The sweet of Trinidado.
VII.
^ TAn ta ra ran tan tant, cries Mars on bloody rampire ^ fa la fa la fa la,
cries Venus in a Chamber toodle loodle ^ loo, cries Pan that Cuckoo, with bells
at his shoo, and a fiddle fiddle ^ too, Aye me, but I alas lie weeping, for
death has slain my ^ sweeting, which has my heart in keeping, my heart in
keeping.

VIII.
^ THe Gods have heard my vows, fond Lyce, ^ whose fair brows wont scorn
with such disdain, my love, ^.ii. my tears my pain.ii. fa la la la la la. ^

2
But now those springtide roses,
are turnde to winter poses,
to Rue, and time, and sage,
fitting that shriuledage,
Falalala. etc.
3
Now youths with hot desire,
See, see that flamelesse fire,
Which erst your hearts so burned,
quick into ashes turned.
Fa la la la etc.
IX.
^ THough my carriage be but careless, though my ^ looks be of the sternest,
yet my passions are compare- less, ^ when I love, when I love, I love, I love,
I love, I love in earnest. ^

2
No my wits are not so wild.
But a gentle soul may yoke me,
Nor my heart so hard compilde,
But it melts, if love provoke me.
X.
^ THe Ape, the Monkey and Babone did meet, and ^ breaking of their fast in
friday street, in their three natures ^ was a simpathie, Nay quoth Baboone I do
deny that strain, I have ^ more knavery in me then you twain.

2
Why quoth the Ape I have a horse at will,
in Parris Garden for to ride on still,
and there show tricks: tush quoth the Monkey I
for better tricks in great men's houses lie.
Tush, quoth Baboone, when men do know I come,
for sport, from City, country, they will run.
XI.

what lovers best know, ^ fa la la liro logh.ii..ii..ii. till then ^ I will be
glad, and then I will be mad, hang up all love that is sad, fa la ^ la liro
logh.ii..ii..ii.

2
What what,
if she feign so,
then I plain go,
in a vain to
overthrow her that is flat, fa la la, etc.
O, but she loved me well,
no but I cannot tell,
who dares trust women or hell.
XII.
^ AYe me alas, hey hoe, hey hoe.ii..ii. ^ thus does Messalina* go up and
down.ii. ^ up and down the house a crying, a crying, for her Monkey lies a ^
dying for.ii. death thou art too cruel, to bereave her ^ Jewel, or to make a
seasure of her only treasure, if her Monkey die ^ she will sit and cry, fie
fie fie fie fie fie fie fie fie.

XIII.
^ LAte in my rash accounting, my Fortune ^ was amounting, fa la fa la la fa la
la fa ^ la la fa la la fa la la fa la la fa la la la la: ^ and now all is
undone, all courses backward run, fa la la fa ^ la la fa la fa la la fa la la
fa la la la.

2
Hearts greedy in desiring,
Are speedy in aspiring, fa la la etc.
But this femall sex,
Make stout hearts break their necks.
3
You Ladies fair and fickle,
Whose climing thoughts do tickle, fa la etc.
Shall most deeply repent,
And find a base descent.

and as I speak it wounds me, fa la la, etc.
It cannot be expressed,
good help me whilst I rest.

Bad stomachs have their loathing,
and O this all is nothing, fa la la, etc.
this no with griefs does prove,
report often turns in love, fa la la.
XV.
^ LOrd when I think what a paltery thing is a ^ glove or a ring, or a top of
a fan to brag of, and ^ how much a Noddy will triumph in a buske point, snatch
with the ^ tagge of, snatch with the tagge of, then I say, well fare him ^ that
has ever used close play.

2
And when I see,
what a pitiful grace,
has a frown in the face,
Or a no in the lips of a Lady,
and when I had wist,
she would be kissed,
When she away did go,
with hey hoe,
I end so,
Never trust any woman more then you know.
XVI.
^ SAy wanton will you love me, I love no long de- laying, ^ delaying, I love no
long delay- ing, ^ whilst that you strive to prove me to prove me, I fear your
^ loves decaying. ^

2
Fear not my loves decaying,
Whilst that you strive to prove me,
I love no long delaying,
Come wanton then and love me.

how now, fie, fie, fie, you dance false.

looks on, and you ^ know I must be gone and you know I must be gone tomorow,
tomorow.

2
Adieu, why did I aspire high,
when I see my ruinous end so nigh,
Yet will I now prolong my last farewell,
else in sudden sort to part,
will go near to break my heart,
that does swell.
XXIII.
^ AS deadly serpents lurking, so envy lies worcester. ^ king, still to disgrace
those men which do strive ^ by virtues fame to augment their height of name, by

what so ere they will report,
I put my self in venture
to judgments learned censure
and men of better sort.
