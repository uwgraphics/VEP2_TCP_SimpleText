here after follows a litel book called Colyn Cloute compyled by master
Skeleton poet Laureate.

Quis co^surgat mecu^ aduersus malignantes. aut quis stabit mecu^ aduersus
operantes iniquitatem. Nemo domine



WHat can it avail
To drive forth a snayle
Or to make a sail
Of an herynges tail
To ryme or to rail
To write or to indyte
Either for delight
Or else for to despyte
Or ^o^es to compyle
Of diverse manner style
Uyce to reuyle
And sin to exyle
To teache or to preche
As reason will reche
Say this and say that
His head is so fat
He wotteth never what
Nor whereof he speaks
He cries and he creketh
He pryeth and he peketh
He chydes and he chatters
He prates and he patters
He clytters and he clatters
He medles and he smatters
He gloses and he smatters
Or if he speak plain
Than he lacks brain
He is but a fool
Let him go to scole
A three foted stole
That he may down sit
For he lacks wit
And if that he hit
The nail on the head
It stands in no stead
The devil they say is deed
The devil is deed
It may well so be
Or else they would se
Other wise and sle
I rom wordly vanyte
And foul covetousness
And other wretchedness
I ^^^ell falsenesse
Uaryablenesse
With unstableness
And if ye stand in doubt
who brought this ryme about
My name is Colyn Cloute
I purpose to shake out
All my connyng bag
Like a clerkely hagge
For though my ryme be ragged
Tattered and tagged
Rudely rain beaten
Rusty and moughte eaten
If ye talk well there with
It has in it some pyth
For as far as I can se
It is wrong with each degree
For the temporalte
Accuses the spiritualte
The spiritual again
Does grudge and complain
Upon the temporal men
Thus each of other bloder
The tone agayng the the other
Alas they make me shoder
For in hoder mother
The church is put in fault
The prelates ben so haut
They say / and look so hy
As though they would fly
Above the sterry sky
Lay men say in head
How they take no ^ede
Sheyr sely sheep to feed
But pluck away and pull
The fleces of their wull
Unethes they leave a lock
Of shull among their floche
And as for their conning
A glommynge and a mummynge
And make there of a iape
They gasp and they gape
All to have promocyon
There is their hole devotion
With money if it will hap
To catch the forked cap
Forsothe they are to lewd
To say so all beshrewd.
What trow ye they say more
Of the bysshoppes lore
How in matters they berawe
They lumber forth the law
To harken Jack and Gyll
When they but up a byll
And judge it as they will
For other men's skyll
Expoundyng out their clauses
And leave their own causes
In their pryncypall cure
They make but little sure
And meddels very light
In the churches right
But Ire and venire
And sol fa / so a lamyre
That the premenyre
Is like to be set a fire
In their jurisdictions
Through temporal afflictions
Men say they have prescriptions
Against ye spu^all contradictions
Accomptynge them as fyctions
And whiles the heedes do this
The remenaunt is amys
Of the clergy all
Both great and small
I wot never how they warke
But thus the people carke
And surely thus they say
Bysshoppes if they may
Small houses would keep
But slombre forth and sleep
And assay to crepe
With in the noble walls
Of the kings halles
To fat their bodies full
Their souls lame and dull
And have full little care
How evil their sheep fare
The temporalyte say plain
How bysshoppes dysdayne
Sermons for to make
Or such labor to take
And for to say troth
A great part is full sloth
But the greattest part
Is for they have but small art
And right sklender connyng
With in their heedes wonnyng
But this reason they take
How they are able to make
With their gold and treasure
Clerks out of measure
And yet that is a pleasure
How be it some there be
Almost two or three
Of that dygnyte
Full worshypfull clerks
As appears by their works
Like Aaron and Ure
The wolf from the door
To wary and to keep
From their goostly sheep
And their spiritual lammes
Sequestered from rams
And from the berded gotes
With their heery cotes
Set naught by goldene grotes
Their names if I durst tell
But they are loath to mell
And loath to hang the bell
About the cattes neck
For dread to have a check
They are feign to play / deuz deck
How be it they are good men
Much herted like an hen
Their lessons forgotten they have
That becket them gave
Thomas manum mittit ad forcia
Spernit da^na spernit opprobria
Nulla Thoman frangit iniuria
But now every spiritual father
Men say they had rather
Spend much of their share
Than to be combred with care
Spend / nay but spare
For let se who that dare
Sho the mockylsoe mare
They make her wynche and keke
But it is not worth a leke
Boldness is to seek
The church for to defend
Take me as I intend
For loathe I am to offend
In this that I have pende
I tell you as men say
Amend when ye may
For vsque ad montem sare
Men say ye cannot appare
For some say ye hunte in parkes
And hawk on hobby larkes
And other wanton warkes
When the night darkes
What has lay men to do
The gray gooes for to sho
Like hounds of hell
They cry and they yell
Now that ye sell
The grace of the holy ghost
Thus they make their bost
Through every cost
How some of you do eat
In lenton season flesh mete
Fesauntes partryche and cranes
Men call you therefore prophanes
Ye pycke no shrympes nor pranes
Saltfysshe, stocfysshe nor heryng
It is not for your werynge
Nor in holy lenton season
Ye will nitheyr benes ne peason
But ye look to be let loss
To a pygge or to a gose
your gorge not endewed
Without a capon stewed
Or a stewed cock
Under her surfled smock
And her wanton wodicocke
And how when ye give orders
In your provincial borders
As at sicientes
Some are insufficientes
Some parum sapientes
Some nichil intelligentes
Some valde negligentes
Some nullum sensum habentes
But bestyali and vntought
But when they have ones caught
Dominus vobiscum by the head
Than run they in every stead
God wot with dronken nolles
yet take thy cure of souls
And woteth never what they read
Pater noster nor Creed
Construe not worth a whystle
Nether gospel nor pystle
Their mattyns madly said
Nothing devoutly prayde
Their learning is so small
Their prymes and hours fall
And lepe out of their lyppes
Like sawdust or dry chyppes
I speak not now of all
But the most part en general
Of such vacabundus
Speaks otus Mundus
How some sing letabundus
At every ale stake
with welcome hake and make
By the bread that god brake
I am sorry for your sake
I speak not of the good wife
But of their apostles life
Cum ipsus vel illis
Qui manent in villis
Est vxor vel ancilla
welcome Jack and Gylla
My pretty Petronylla
And you will be stylla
You shall have your wylla
Of such Pater noster pekes
All the world spekes
In you the fault is supposed
For that they are not apposed
By just examinacyon
In connyng and conuersacyon
They have none instructyon
To make a true constructyon
A priest without a letter
Without his virtue be gretter
Doutlesse where much better
Upon him for to take
A mattocke or a rake
Alas for very shame
Some can not declyne their name
Some can not scarsly read
And yet he will not dread
For to keep a cure
And in nothing is sure
This dominus vobiscum
As wise as Tom a thrum
A chaplayne of trust
Layth all in the dust
Thus I colyn cloute
As I go about
And wandrynge as I walk
There the people talk
Men say for silver and gold
Myters are bought and sold
There shall no clergy appose
A myter nor a crose
But a full purse
A straw for gods curse
What are they the worse
For a symonyake
Is but a hermoniake
And no more ye make
Of symony men say
But a chyldes play
Over this the foresaid lay
Report how the pope may
A holy anchor call
Out of the stony wall
And him a bishop make
It he on him dare take
To keep so hard a rule
To ride upon a mule
With gold all betrapped
In purple and paul be lapped
Some hatted and some capped
Rychely be wrapped
God wot to their great pains
In rotchettes of fine raynes
White as morowes milk
Their tabertes of fine sylke
Their styrops of myxt gold begared
There may no cost be spared
Their moyles gold does eat
Their neighbors dye for meat
What care they though gil sweat
Or Jack of the Noke
The pore people the yoke
With sommons and citacyons
And excommunycacyons
About churches and market
The bishop on his carpet
At home full soft does sit
This is a fearful fyt
To here the people iangle
How warely they wrangle
Alas why do ye not handle
And them all mangle
Full falsely on you they lie
And shamefully you ascrye
And say as untruly
As the butterflye
A man might say in mock
Ware the wether cock
Of the steple of Poules
And thus they hurt their Ioules
In sclaunderyng you for truth
Alas it is great ruthe
Some say ye sit in trones
Like princes aquilonis
And shryne your rotten bones
With perles and precious stones
But how the commons groans
And the people mones
For prestes and for lones
Lent and never paid
But from day to day delayde
The commune wealth decade
Men say ye are tongue tayde
And thereof speak nothing
But dyssymulyng and glosyng
where fore men be supposyng
That ye give shrewd counsel
Against the commune well
By poollynge and pyllage
In cytyes and vyllage
By taryng and tollage
ye make monks to have ye culerage
For covering of and old cottage
That committed is a collage
In the charter of dottage
Tenure par service de sottage
And not par service de socage
After old seygnyours
And ye lernyng of Lytelto^ tenours
Ye have so ouerthwarted
That good laws are subverted
And good reason perverted
Relygous men are feign
For to turn again
In secula seculorum
And to forsake their little
And vacabundare per forum
And take a fine meritorum
Coneca regulam morum
Aut black monacorum
Aut canonicorum
Aut Bernardinorum
Aut crucifixorum
And to sing from place to place
Like apostataas
And the self same game
Be gone and uowe with shame
Amongst the sely nonnes
My lady now she ronnes
Dame Syhly our abbess
Dame Dorothe and lady Besse
Dame Sare our pryoresse
Out of their cloister and quere
with an heavy chere
Must cast up their black vayles
And set up their fucke sails
To catch wind with their ventales
what Colyne there thou shales
yet thus with ill hayles
The lay fee people rayles
And all they lay
In you prelates / and say
ye do them wrong and no right
To put them thus to slyght
No matyns at mydnyght
Book and chalys gone quyte
Pluck away the leedes
Over their heedes
And sell away their belles
And all that they have else
Thus the people tells
Rayles like rebels
Read shrewly and spelles
And with foundacyons melles
And talk like tytyuelles
How ye brake the deeds wylles
Turn monasteris I to mat milles
Of an abbay they make a gran^g
your works they say are stran^g
So that their founders souls
Have lost their beade rolls
The money for their masses
Spent among wanton lasses
The diriges are forgotten
Their founders lie there rotten
But where their souls dwell
There with I will not mell
What could the turk do more
With all his false lore
Turk sarazyn / or jew
I report me to you
O merciful Jesus
You supporte and rescue
My style for to dyrecte
It may take some effect
For I abhor to write
How the lay fee dyspytt
you prelates that of right
Should be lanternes of light
ye live they say in delight
Drowned in deliiis
In gloria et diuiciis
In o admirabile honor
In gloria et splendore
Fulgurantes haste
Uiuentes parum cast
Yet sweet meat has sour sauce
For after glyria laus
Christ by cruelte
Was nailed vpyn a tree
He paid a bitter pencyon
For man's redemcyon
He drank eysell and gall
To redeem us withal
But sweet ypocras ye drink
With let the cat wynke
Iche wot what yche other thynk
How be it per assimule
Some men think that ye
Shall have penalyte
For your inibuyte
Nota what I say
And here it well a way
If it please not theologys
It is good for astrologys
For Ptholome told me
The son somey me to be
In Ariete
Ascendent a degree
When Scorpion descendpnge
Was so then pretendynge
All fatal for one
That shall sit on a trone
And rule all things alone
Your teth whet on this bone
Amongst you euerychone
Fnd let Collyn Cloute have none
Manner of cause to moan
Lay salve to your own sore
For else as I said before
After gloria laus
May come a sour sauce
Sorry therefore am I
But troth can never lie
With language thus poluted
Holy church is brnted
And shamfully confuted
My pen now will I sharp
And wrest up my harp
with sharp twynkyng trebelles
Against all such rebels
That labor to confound
And bring ye church to ye ground
As ye may daily se
How the lay fee
Of one affynyte
Consent and agree
Against the church to be
And the dygnyte
Of the by bysshoppes fee
And either ye be to bad
Or else they are mad
Of this to report
But under your supporte
Till my dyenge day
I shall both write and say
And ye shall do the same
How they are to blame
you thus to dyffame
For it makes me sad
How the the peope are glad
The church to deprave
And some there are that rave
Presumynge on their own wit
When there is never a whyt
To maynteyne arguments
Against the sacraments
Some make epylogacyon
Of hypghe predestynacyon
And of resydenacyon
They make interpretacyon
Of an aquarde facyon
And of the prescience
Of dyuyne assence
And what Ipostacis
Of Christ's manhood is
Such logyke men will chop
And in their fury hop
When the good ale sop
Does dance in their fore top
Both women and men
Such ye may well know and ken
That against preesthode
Their malyee sprede abroad
Raysynge haynously
And dysdaynously
Of prrestly dygnytes
But their malygnytes
And some have a smacek
Of Luthers sack
And a brennyng spark
Of Luthers welke
And are some what suspecte
In Luthers sect
And some of them barek
Clatter and carpe
Of that heresy art
Called wytclyftista
The deuelys the dogmatista
And some be hussyans
And some be arryans
And some be pollegrans
And make much varyans
Between the clergy
And the temporaltye
Now ye church has to mykel
And they have to little
And bring in maierialites
And qualyfyed qualytes
Of pluralytes
Of tryalytes
And of tot quottes
They commune like sottes
As comes to their lottes
Of prebendaries and deanes
How some of them gleanes
And gathers up the store
For to catch more and more
Of persons and vycaryes
They make many out cries
They can not keep their wives
From them for their lives
And thus the ^oselles stryues
And lewdely says by Christ
Against the sely priest
Alas and well away
What ails them thus to csay
They might be better aduysed
Then to be so dysgysed
But they have enterprysed
And shamfully surmysed
How prelacy is sold and bought
And come up of naught
And where the prelates be
Come of low degree
And set in majesty
And spiritual dyngnyte
Farewell benygnyte
Farewell sympliciet
Farewell humylyte
Farewell good charity
Ye are so puffed with pride
That no man may abide
Your high and lordely lokes
Ye cast up then your books
And virtue is forgotten
For then ye will be wroken
Of every light quarrel
And call a lord a iauell
A knight a knave to make
Ye bost / ye face / ye crake
And upon you take
To rule king and kayser
And if ye may have layser
Ye will bring all to noyght
And that is all your thought
For the lords temporal
Their rule is very small
Almost nothing at all
Men say how ye appall
The noble blood royal
In ernest and in game
Ye are the less to blame
For lords of noble blood
If they well vuderstode
How conyng might them auau^ce
They would pype you another dau^ce
But noble men borne
To learn they have scorn
But hunet and blow an horn
Lepe over lakes and dykes
Set nothing by polytykes
There fore ye keep them bace
And mock them to their face
This is a pyteous case
To you that over the whele
Lords must crouche and knele
And break their hose at the kne
As daily men may se
And to remembrance call
Fortune so turns the ball
And rules so over all
That honor has a great fall
Shall I tell you more / ye shall
I am leth to tell all
But the communalte ye call
Ydolles of Babylon
De terra zabulon
De terra Neptalym
For you love to go trym
Brought up of poor estate
With pride inordinate
Suddenly vpstarte
From the donge carte
The mattockes and the shule
To reygne and to rule
And have no grace to think
How they were wont to drink
Of a lether botell
with a knauysshe stoppell
Wha^ mamockes was your meat
with moulde bread to eat
ye would none other get
To chewe and to gnawe
To fill therewith your mawe
Lodged in the straw
Couchyng your drousy heddes
Sometime in lousy beds
Alas this is out of mind
ye grow now out of kind
Many one have but wind
And make the commons blind
But qui se existimat stare
Let him well beware
Lest that his foot slyp
And have such a tryp
And false in such dekay
That all the world might say
Come down on the devil way.
Yet over all that
Of bishops they chat
That though ye round your hear
An ynche above your ear
And aures patentes
And parum intendentes
And your coursers be trapped
your ears they be stopped
For master adulator
And doctor assentator
And blandior blandiris
With mentior mentiris
That ye can not espy
They follow your desires
And so they blere your eye
How the male does write
Alas for gods will
why sit ye prelates still
And suffer all this ill
ye bishops of estates
Should open the broad gates
For your spiritual charge
And conforte at large
Like lanternes of light
In the peoples sight
In pullpettes attentyke
For the well publyke
Of preesthode in this case
And always to chase
Such manner of sysmatykes
And half heretykes
That would intoxicate
That would conquinate
That would contemminate
And that would vyolate
And that would derogate
And that would abrogate
The church high estates
After this manner rates
The which should be
Both frank and free
And have their lyberte
And of antiquyte
It was ratefyed
And also gratifyed
By holy synodalles
And bulls papalles
As it is res certa
Contained in magna Carta
But master Damyan
Or some other man
That clerkely is and can
Well scripture expound
And textes ground
His benefyce worth ten pou(...)
Or skante warth twenty ma
And yet a noble clerk
He must do this work
As I know a part
Some masters of art
Some doctors of law
Some lernde in other saw
As in dyuynyte
That has no dygnyte
But the pore degree
Of the university
Or else Frederyck*
Or else friar Dominike
Or friar Hugulinus
Or friar Agustinus
Or friar Carmelus
that gostly can heal us
(...)ls if we may
(...) friar graye
(...) of the order
(...) Grenewyche border
(...) obseruaunce
(...) friar of france
(...) the poor scot

(...) scripture should be coted
(...) clerkely promoted
(...) the friar ^oted
(...) Men say
(...)ctoryte
And your noble se
And your bygnyte
Should be imprynted better
Then all the freres letter
For if ye would take pain
To preche a word or twain
Though it were never so plain
with clauses two or three
So as they might be
Compendyously conueyde
These word should be more weyd
And better perceived
And thankfully received
And better should remain
Among the people plain
That would your words retain
And reherce them again
Tha^ a thousand thousand other
That blaber bark and bloder
And make a walshmans hose
Of the text and of the gloss
For protestatyon made
That I shyll not wade
Farther in this broke
Nor farther for to look
In deuysyuge of this book
But answer that I may
For my self always
Either analogice
Or else cathagorice
So that in divinity
Doctors that learned be
Nor bachelors of that faculte
That has taken degree
In the university
Shall not be objected for me
But doctor bullatus
Parum littteratus
Domimas doctoratus
At the broad gatus
Doctor daupatus
And bacheler bacheleratus
Dronken as a mouse
At the ale house
Takes his pyllyon and his cap
At the good ale tap
For lack of good wine
As wise as Robyn swyne
Under an notaryes sign
was made a dyuyne
As wise as waltonis calfe
Must preche a gods half
In the pulpyt solempnely
More mete in a pyllory
For by saint Hyllary
He can nothing smatter
Of logyke nor scole matter
Neither sylogy sare
Nor of emptimeniare
Nor knows his eloquens
Nor his predicamens
And yet he will well
To amend the gospel
And will preche and tell
what they do in hell
And he dare not well neuen
will know a Raven from a rail
A quayle, ye rail and the old raven
Sed libera nos a malo Amen.
And by Dudum their clementine
Against curates repyne
And say propreli they are sacerdotes
To shryue assoyle and reles
Dame mergeres soul out of he will
But when ye freare fell in the well
he coud not sing him self therout
But by ye help of christyan clout
Another clementyne also
How friar fabian / with other mo
Exiuit de paradise
Wha^ they again theder shall come
De hoc petimus consilium
And through all ye world they go
Wit Dirige and placebo
But now my mind yt understand
Forth must take in hand
To prech and withstand
All manner of abiections
For bishops have protections
They say to do corrections
But they have no afflictions
To take the said dyrections
In such manner of cases
Men say they here no faces
To occupye such places
To sow the sede of graces
Their hertes are so faynted
And they be so attaynted
With coueytous and ambycyon
And other superstycyon
That they be deef and dum
And, play scylens and glum
Can say nothing but mum
They occupye them so
With syngyng placebo
They will no farther go
They had lever to please
And take their worldly ease
Than to take on hand
Worship to withstand.
Such temporal war and bat(...)
As now is made of late
Against holy church estate
Or to maynteyne good quarelles
The lay men call them barelles
Full of glotony
And of hypocrysy
That counterfaytes and payntes
As they were very saints
In matters that them like
They show them polytyke
Pretending grauyte
And sygnyoryte
With all solempnyte
For their indempnyte
For they will have no loss
Of a penny nor of a cross
Of their predyall lands
Thut comes to their hands
And as far as they dare set
All is fysshe that comes to the net
Buyldyng royally
Their mancyons curyously
With turrettes and with toures
With halles and with boures
Stretchynge to the stars
With glass wyndowes and bars
Hanging about the walls
Clothes of gold and palles
Arras of rich array
Fresshe as flours in May
With dame Dyana naked
How lusty Uenus quaked
And how Cupyde shaked
His darte and bent his bow
For to shote a crow
At her tyrly tyrlowe
And how Paris of Troy
Daunced a lege de moy
Made lusty sport and joy
With dame Helyn the queen
With such stories by dene
Their chambres well be seen
With triumphs of Caesar
And of his Pompeyus war
Of renown and of fame
By them to get a name.
How all the world stares
How they ride in goodly chares
Conveyed by Olyphantes
With lauryat garlantes
And by vnycornes
With their semely horns
Upon these beestes riding
Naked boys strydynge
With wanton wenches winkyng
Now truly to my thinking
That is a speculacyon
And a mete meditacynon
For prelates of estate
Their courage to abate
From worldly wantonness
Their chamber thus todresse
With such parfetnesse
And all such holiness
Howbe it they let down fall
Their churches cathedral.
Squyre / knight and lord
Thus the church remorde
With all temporal people
They rune against the steple
Tus talking and tellyng
How some of you are mellyng
Yet soft and fair for swellyng
Beware of a queen's yellyng
It is a besy thing
For one man to rule a gyng
Alone / and make rekenyng
To govern over all
And rule a realm royal
By one man's Wit
Fortune may chance to flyt
And when he weneth so sit
Yet may he mysse the quysshon
For I read a preposycyon
Sum regibus amicare
Et omnibus dominare
Et supra te prauare
Wherefore he has good ure
That can himself assure
How fortune will endure
Than let reason you supporte
For the communalte
That they have great wonder
That we keep them so under
Yet they marvel so much less
For ye play so at the chesse
As they suppose and guess
That some of you but late
Has played so checkemate
With lords of great steate
After such a cate
That they shall mell nor make
Nor upon them take
For king nor kayser sake
But at the playsure of one
That rules the rest alone
Helas / I say helas
How may this come to pass
That a man shall here a mass
And not so hardy on his head
To look on god in form of bread
But that the parysshe clerk
There upon must herke
And grant him at his askyng
For to se the sacryng
And how may this accord
No man to our sovereign lord
So hardy to make suit
Nor to execute
His commanndement
Without the assent
Of our presydent
Nor to express to his parson
Without your consentatyon
Grant him his license
To preas to his presence
Nor to speak to him secretly
Openly nor preuyly
Without his presydent be by
Or else his substytute
Whom he will depu^e
Neither earl ne duke
Permytted by saint Luke
And by sweet saint Mark
This is a wondrous warke
That the people talk this
Some what there is amysse
Ye devil ca^ not stop their mouths
But they will talk of such vncouthes
All that ever they ken
Against all spiritual men
Whether it be wrong or right
Or else for dyspyght
Or how ever it hap
Their tongues thus do clap
And through such detractyon
They put you to your actyon
And whether they say trewly
As they may abide thereby
Or else that they do lie
ye know better then I
But now / debatis scire
And groundly audire
In your conuenire
Of this premenire
Or else in the mire
They say they will you cast
Therefore stand sure and fast
Stand sure and take good fotyng
And let be all your motyng
Your gasyng and your totyng
And your parcyall promotyng
Of those that stand in your grace
But old servants ye chase
And put them out of their place
Make ye no murmuracyon
Though I write after this facio^
Though I Colyn Cloute
Among the hole route
Of you that clerks be
Take upon me
Thus copyously to write
I do it not for no despyte
Wherefore take no dysdayne
At my style rude and plain
for I rebuke no man
That virtuous is why than
wreke ye your anger on me
for those that veruous be
Have no cause to say
That I speak out of the way
Of no good bishop speak I
Nor good priest I escrye
Good friar / nor good chanon
Good non^e / nor good canon
Good monk, nor good clercke
Nor of no good work
But my recountyng is
Of them that do amys
In spekyng and rebellyng
In hynderyng and dysauaylyng
Hyly church our mother
One against another
To use such desvysyng
Is all my hole writing
To hinder no man
As nere as I can
for no man have I named
wherefore should I be blamed
Ye ought to be ashamed
Against me to be grieved
And can not tell no cause why
But that I write trewly
Then if any there be
Of high or low degree
Of the spiritualte
Or of the temporalte
That does think or wene
That his conscience be not clean
And feleth him self sick
Or touched on the quycke
Such grace god them send
Them self to amend
For I will not pretend
Any man to offend
wherefore as thinks me
Great ydeottes they be
And little grace they have
This treatise to deprave
Nor will here no prechyng
Nor no virtuous techyng
Nor will have no resytyng
Of any virtuous writing
Will know none intellygence
To refourme their negligence
But live still out of facyon
To their own dampnacyon
To do shame they have no shame
But they would no man should the^ blame
They have an evil name
But yet they will occupy ye same
With them the word of god
Is counted for no rod
They count it for a raylyng
That nothing is auaylyng
The prechers with evil hayling
Shall they daunt us prelates
That be their prymates
Not so hardy on their pates
Herke how the losell prates
with a wide wesaunt
Auaunt sir Guy of gaunt
Auaunt lewd priest auaunt
Auaunt sir doctor deuyas
Prate of thy matyns and they mass
And let our matters pass
How dare thou daucocke mell
How dare thou losell
Allygate the gospel
Against us of the counsel
Auaunt to the devil of hell
Take him wadeyne of the flete
Set him fast by the fete
I say lyeutenaunt of the toure
Make this lurdeyne for to loure
Lodge him in little ease
Feed him with beans and pease
The kings benche or marshalsy
Have him thither by and by
The vyllayne precheth openly
And declares our vyllany
And of our fre symplenesse
He says that we are rechelesse
And full of wylfulnesse
Shameless and mercylesse
Incorrigible and mercylesse
And after this rate
Against us does prate
At Poules cross or else where
Openly at westmynstere
And saint Mary spyttell
They set not by us a whystell
At the Austen friars
They count us for liars
And at saint Thomas of akers
They carpe us like crakers
Home we will rule all at will
Without good reason or skyll
And say both that we be
Full or paryalyte
And how at a pronge
We turn right into wrong
Delay causes so long
That right no man can fonge
They say many matters be born
By the right of a rambes horn
Is not this a shamfull scorn
To be teared thus and torn?
Now may we thus endure
wherefore we make you sure
ye prechers shall be rawde
Some shall be sawde
As noble Ezechyas
The holy prophet was
And some of you shall dye
Like holy Jeremy
Some hanged / some slain
Some beaten to the brain
And we will rule and rain
And out matters maintain
who dare say there again
Or who dare dysdayne
At your pleasure and will
For be it good / or be it ill
As it is / it shall be still
For all master doctor of civil
Or of divinity / or doctor deyuyll
Let him cough / rough / or sneuyll
Run god run devil
Run who may run best
And let take all the rest
we set not a nut shell
The way to heaven or to hell
To / this is ye gyse now a days
It is to dread men says
Lest they be seduces
As they be said said
which determyne plain
we should not rise again
At dredefull domis day
And so it seems they play
which hate to be coreected
when they be infected
Nor will suffer this book
By hoke ne by croke
Prynted for to be
For that no man should se
Nor read in any scrolles
Of their dronken nolles
Nor of their noddy polles
Nor of their sely souls
Nor of some wytles pates
Of diverse great estates
As well as other men
Now to withdraw my pen
And now a while to rest
Me seems it for the best
The fore castle of my ship
Shall glyde and smothely slyp
Out of the wawes wod
Of the stormy flod
Shote anchor and lie at rode
And sail not far a broad
Till the cost be clear
That the lode star appear
By ship now will I pere
Toward the port sauel
Of our savior Jesus
Such grace that he us send
To rectyfye and amend
Things that are amys
When that his pleasure is.
amen.
