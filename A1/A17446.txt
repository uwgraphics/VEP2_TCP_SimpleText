A Paumflet compyled by G. C.
To master Smyth and Wyllyam G.
Prayenge them both, for the love of our Lord,
To grow at last to an honest accord.
THe fynest wit that is alive
Cannot deuyse by tunge nor pen
The spytefull malice to descryue
That reygneth now i diverse me^
We may perceive by them that strive
For casting out a card of ten
That charity is set at naught
So reygneth malice in man's thought.
Which thing does force me thus to write
Concerning the vncharyte
Of two that now with hateful spyte
Do blame each other openly
To none of both I owe despyte
Ner this is none Apology
For nether part: but strife to stent
Is ground of all mine argument.
The strife I speak of, is betwyxt
One master Smyth and Wyllyam G.
Their wrytynges are confusely myxt
With bytynge words, and vylany
In each of them, a will is fyxt
To maynteyne still his vanyte
Which has a very feeble ground
Wherewith his enemy to confound.
All this began, first by a knave
I wot not who, that wrote a trolle
Wherein he did but rage and rave
He knew full little of saint Poule
Which writ the love that men should have
And for one did this trolle controlle
Lo master Smyth a book has pende
This tryflynge troller to defend.
Some say, it was for flatterye
And some do say, it was for mede
For to advance him self thereby
Such men (they say) do soonest speed
That least can skyll of modesty
But what he meant, thereby in deed
If I shall judge, as I do take it
Naught but malice, made him make it.
For through out his raylyng book
Of charity no word is spoken
Till all his malice purpose took
For malice, forthwith wylbe wroken
And whosoever list therein to look
May judge him well, by his own token
A raylynge knave, for to defend
Is, in no wise man to commend.
If master Smyth had marked well
The purpose of that foolyshe dawe
Which trolde upon the Lord Crumwell
With ragged ryme, not worth a straw
He might have found that wretch rebel
Both against God, and all good law
And not have blamed Wyllyam G.
For blaming his vncharyte.
But when W. G. did feel the prycke
So threattyng and malycious
I wonder not though he did kycke
For why, it was too sclaunderous
And for the kycke, was somewhat quycke
Lo, he again as enuyous
A testy answer strayte did write
With check for check, and spyte for spyte.
But of this strife, the chief effect
That maynteyned is so knappyshly
Is risen by the great suspect
Of popyshnes and heresye
One says the other is infecte
With such a spyce of knavery
I will not judge, which it should be
But both their wrytynges are to se.
These sorts are both to dyscommende
In any man, where they be found
For papists do naught else pretend
But Christ's glory to confound
And Heretykes, God them amend
Have but a very feeble ground
If that they preach, that is forbod
Or dyffer from the word of God.
For heresye is nothing else
But swaruyng from the true belefe
As holy writ expressly tells
And he is worse then any thief
That thereagaynst in ought rebels
Or he that seeks his relefe
Of false gods, and not of Christ
Is no les* then an Antechrist.
But he that has a popyshe heart
And will not unto Christ be won
He seekyth not, but to subvert
All that the king has well begone
No reason may his will convert
But he will do, as he has done
With tothe and nail, for to uphold
His blind belefe, and errors old.
I write not this, meaning therbye
That master Smyth is of that sort
Ner I judge not that willyam G.
Is soche as Smyth does him report
But write my mind with charity
The parties both for to exhort
That he that fyndes him in the crime
May first recante, his raylynge ryme.
But this is for to dyscommende
In master Smyth above althynge
That he so rashlye would defend
A braynles buz, in his writing
And afterward still forth contend
With malice, and with threatenyng
Against that poor man wylliam G.
Far from all godly charity.
Wrestyng the scriptures as him list
For his own purpose out of frame
But he that strife does so resyst
That perfect word, he does defame
Wherein our health does whole consyst
For that is it, the very same
That teaches us the love and dread
To God and to the King our head.
Perchance yt Smyth will take it ill
That I judge him so openly
No force for that, it shall not skyll
For he is known suffyciently
But I protest, that in my will
I mean nothing malycyously
But yet men must, for all his heat
Repute him hot, that see him sweat.
Likewise the other did offend
With writing so impacientlye
For that is no way to amend
An heart that cankers inwardly
But he his cause, should still defend
With mekenes and with charity
And not with malice nor despyght
But suffer mekely wrong and right
Even as the Gospel does us teach
Which is our chief profession
For Paul him self did always preach
That, for the chief confession
Of christen hearts, to make the^ stretche
Their faith unto Christ's passion
The only entry into health
All other entryes are but stealth.
Lo, thus I find them both to blame
Wyshynge to each with all mine heart
An honest mendement, without shame
And pray to Christ that he convert
Our judgments all into such frame
That they and we, in every part
Wythouten grudge, debate or grefe
May fyrmly stand in one belefe.
Which teaches us to love and dread
Him that has power under God
I mean the king that is our head
That here in earth does bear the rod
Of true justice in Christ's stead*
By precyse words we be forbod
Him to wythstande, or to wythsaye
In every cause we must obaye.
For whom, as for our only guide
Our greatest help and chefest stay
That daily does for us provide
To save us sound without decay
In war and peace on every side
With one accord let us all pray
To send his grace, us here among
Honor, increase, good life and long.
God save the king.
