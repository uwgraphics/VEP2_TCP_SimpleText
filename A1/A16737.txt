AT LONDON, Printed for John Wright, and are to be sold at his Shop without
Newgate, at the sign of the Bible, 1616.

To the Reader.
MEeting with many Crosses in the world, among them all I found some in books,
as Crossing of Proverbs, Cross answers and such other like Cross humors, as
I have collected out of Cross Authors, which I have here put together in this
little book, in which, if you find any thing cross to your liking, cross it
out: and if there be any thing that is better worth then nothing, be not
cross to patience to esteem of a little, though but a little: so loath to
cross mine own Reason, with too much persswasion of your too kind, either
disposition or discretion, I rest as I find cause.

Your well-wisher, B, N.
