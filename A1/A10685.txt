A brief some of the Treason intended against the King and State, when they
should have been assembled in Parliament. Nouemb. 5. 1605. with certain other
English Meeters, which may be called: A dying repentance, or A mournful Song
for Traitors to make use of now begun by one of Babingtons company.
Hear the verse which does rehearse,
briefly this
Traitors plotforme, which should reform
things amiss.
First in England, then in Scotland,
with such praise
As should make them famous State-men,
all their days.
Powder Barrels must end quarrels,
for us all:
King and Subject, Lord and abject,
great and small.
Bands of P P P Popes, Priests and Papists.
of all degrees,
have sought still:
English Britains
utter ruin by their skill.
But since Adam, none could fadom,
plots like this.
Which November, may remember,
to our bliss.
Some good men say, that beyond Sea,
this began:
Fawkes and Winter, first did venture,
to go on.
These came over, and won other,
to this action:
Piercy, With many others afterward.
Catesby, Wrights and Digby,
12. in faction.
Thus did Thewdas, Caine and Judas,
vow and swear: G^n. 4. Not. 26. Act. 5.

Take their Sacrament, and all to work
this gear.
Prince of darkness, and hels blacknes,
was their leader:
Piercy Papist, masked Atheist,
banners spreader.
Iuggling Jesuits, with their false sleights,
many a one:
Like lewd Strumpets, and loud Trumpets,
sets them on.
Thus resolving, and reuoluing,
of their plot:
God and duty, to their Country,
was forgot.
Some resorted, and reported,
to the crew:
Of this wonder, and great thunder,
to ensue.
Some were Py^ners, vnder-mynors,
by consent:
Of the upper house and Romes,
of Parliament.
Some hirde Vault room, and brought in soon,
Coals and Wood:
To lay over, all the powder,
as it stood.
Traynes were all spread, and Pipes of Lead,
laid with match:
Bars and Wedges, Stones and Sledges,
to dispatch.
Traitor Standly, must lead manly,
Rebels Stout:
Owin wyely, must bring slyly,
this about.
Proclamation, for a facion,
they had printed:
That Puritan, the State had slain, and Gods anointed.
This gross slander, as commander,
from the Devil:
Should have passed, and defaced,
good for evil.
But I wish still, even with good will,
Papists were:
So converted, and true hearted,
as these are.
Then no question, but Religion,
still should flourish:
And no perrill, strife or quarrel,
we should nourish.
But these killed, and Streets filled,
with their blood:
Protestants by Papists vants,
should do small good.
Our Kings Daughter shortly after,
she should reign:
And so quiet all this riot
soon again.
But how long, without all wrong,
this young Queen,
Should be suffered and not smothered,
is not seen.
Then believe them, you that shrieue them
for not I:
Will give credit to this edict,
hastily.
For, will Wolf keep, Lamb of that Sheep,
he has eat:
And not rather, soon devour it,
As his meat?
These belooued, this is proved,
every day:
Where the Papist, or the Atheist
do keep sway.
Gods most sweet word should not be sturd,
yet awhile:
Till to Protestants, and all,
they might give foil.
Often returning, and reiourning,
Parliament:
Never moved them, as behou'd them,
to repent.
They were careless bold and fearelesse,
in the act:
Popes great Pardon was their Garden,
for this fact.
But these Zimries, that would surprise,
and spoil all:
God forsakes them, and betakes them,
to their fall.
For when each thing, had settling,
and day came:
God bewrayed them, and dismayed them.
to their shame.
By a Letter, and no better
without doubt:
To preserve one from this plotforme,
all came out.
King and Counsel, noted this well,
and did send:
Twice to search out, things then in doubt
and their end.
Fawkes at midnight, and by torch light,
there was found:
With long matches and devises,
under ground.
Having found him, there they bound him,
and then sought:
For the Powder and provision
in the vault.
This perceived, Fawkes bereued,
of his sense.
Said the Devil, did that evil,
for our defense.
Yea this dreamer, and blasphemer,
Satan's Son:
Often relented, and repented,
deed not done.
To the Court then, go these glad men,
to declare:
All and each thing, to our good King,
they found there.
This laid open, baud was broken,
of this train.
And their gladness, turned to madness,
in the brain.
Some road Northward, some North-westward
there to show:
That their treachery, and their butchery,
State did know.
Then like Wilde-men, and most vilde-men,
in strange fashion:
They got Armor, Shot and Powder,
for commotion.
Horse in Stable, strong and able,
they stole out:
Thus the compn'y, road the country,
all about.
In the mean time, thus their foul crime,
was proclaimed:
And so Papists, with vilde Atheists,
made ashamed.
Thus confounded, some were wounded,
as they fled:
Some are taken, all forsaken,
some are dead.
Musket-Bullet, leaden pellet,
made them stand:
Powder drying, marred their flying,
out of hand.
House end blown out, some eyes burnt out,
they could say:
God offended, was revenged,
there that day.
And thus spoiled, they were foiled,
in that place:
Doors set open, as a token,
of some grace.
Then to prison, as good reason,
did require:
Sheriff conuaide them, and so paid them
part of hire.
And in good time, they for this crime,
were sent up:
To the counsel, for to drink well,
of one cup.
Heads of Catesby, and of Piercy,
they were sent:
And set upon, the upper house,
of Parlyament.
Bravely plodding, yea and nodding,
each to other.
Thanking Pope, for Axe and Rope,
for them and other:
Such a downfall, to the Papal,
none alive:
But these Traitors, and their way^^s,
could contriue.
This foul faction, and vilde action,
will convince:
Pope and Popelings, Friars and Shauelings,
long time hence.
Babes unborn, will hate and scorn,
such as these:
Papists O^spring, will for this thing,
find small ease.
God our keeper, is no sleeper,
this is known:
But attend us, and defend us,
as his own.
Devilish Treason, has no reason,
night or day:
Proud ambition, makes sedition,
every way.
Their aspiring, and their fyring,
comes from hell:
The unkindness, grows of blindenes,
most can tell.
Banckrout fellows, blow the bellows
to Commotion:
And their backeside, must be covered,
with devotion.
Romes Religion, pretty Pigion,
of the Pope:
Some would bring in, by this foul sin,
to have scope.
And the Gospel, which does expel,
all their dross:
With our Preachers, and professors,
they would cross*
These vilde rangers, would bring Strangers,
here to reign:
Or in all things, make themselves Kings,
by their gain.
This performed, men well armed,
then should rise:
And cry kill, kill, all sorts still, still,
in strange wise.
Then to ryfling, without tryfling,
these would run:
Yea to spoiling, and defiling,
this kingdom.
Thus were these bent, with full intent,
treacherously:
To blow up all, and make much thraule,
soddenly.
Popish preesthoode, never yet good,
prate and pray:
That their Popery, and their fopery,
might bear sway.
But their praying, for betraying,
King and State:
God and Angels, Saints and Virgins,
still does hate.
All late Queens time, this their foul crime,
God put by:
And still saved, his anointed,
wonderously.
Yet they seek still, more Kings to kill,
which does grow:
By their writing, and inditing,
which teach so.
In Petitions, great submissions,
they do offer:
And to facion, tolleration,
much they proffer.
But denied, this is spied
sword and fire,
Blood and Murder, they will further,
and require.
Thus their knotting, and their plotting,
God does know:
And this vilde route, he still brings out,
to their woe.
Read each story, to Gods glory,
of these things:
English writings, have indightings,
for our Kings.
In the mean time, let our hearts clime,
to the sky:
With all due praise, to God always,
for safety:
And our trust is, that true justice,
shall take place:
On offenders, and abetters,
in this case.
All our care then, is that good men,
we may prove:
Serving God still, doing his will,
live in Love.
Preach now and pray, teach youth I say,
still to know:
How our good Lord, by his pure word,
keeps from woe.
Eighty eight year, we in Gods fear,
may remember:
Gowries August, Pereyes unjust,
fifth November.
These things require, Bells and bonfires,
on this day:
Music most sweet, now were as meet,
to show joy.
Lovely feasting, without wasting,
once a year:
Alms deeds giving, with good living,
let appear.
And take heed still, that the self will,
of this swarm:
Grow not desperate, to exasperate,
some new harm.
Now for our King, and Queen living,
let us pray:
That Prince and Peers, may Nestors years,
time enjoy.
Two young Babies, Princely Ladies,
of our King:
God that saved them, still preserve them,
in each thing.
All three Kingdoms, with their Earledomes,
and true Pastors:
God stand for us, and defend us,
from all Traitors.
A form of true Repentance, fit for Traitors to Sing and use now, and at all
times while life is in them: made in part by one of Babingtons Conspiracy. And
may be sung to the tune of the 25. Psalm.
MY prime of youthful years,
My croppe of Corn is turned now,
The day is fled and gone,
I seem to live, yea live I do,
The spring for me is past,
My aged days are growing on,
My third is cut in two:
I seem to live, yea live I do,
I sought for mirth and joy,
My tree is dead, though leaves be green,
My glass was set but late,
I seem to live, yea live I do,
If subject I had bin,
Then had I never heard or seen,
But I a kingdom sought,
Wherefore I am most justly brought,
All men be ruled my be, Papistry:
For sure the same can not endure;
Ah woe to all that sleep,
They seem to live, yea live they do,
Lord Jesus save my soul,
Forgive the sin that I am in,
O let me not believe,
For then I shall but seem to live,
The Commons every one,
And with Gunpowder to blow up,
(...) Like Constantine the Emperor,
Whereat his foes are danted much,
Lord make their peace to be in thee,
God save King James, etc.
The Gospel pure he does maintain,
Blind ignorance it shall not reign,
Our Realm God has established,
God save King James, etc.
Lift up your hearts to God on hie,
Laud and praise to the Trinity,
Let us rejoice in God always:
God save King James, etc.
All Countries join with us in Love, Turk and Pope apace:
The King and Counsels acts approve,
Amidst all joys prepare to dye,
God save King James, and still pull down,
All those that would annoy his Crown.
Amen.
Another Song in Commendations of the Kings most excellent Majesty, to be
sung at any time, but chiefly on his Coronation day.
Let men and Angels witness bear,
of our unfeigned joy:
That we express with heart and tongue,
for our good King this day.
The Ditty or Song.
GReat Britain pleasant Paradise,
And thank him for his benefits,
But chiefly for his holy word,
The fame of whom in Europe wide,
Let men and Angels, etc.
In Judah and in Israel,
Who did set up Religion, and nourished the same.
David and Solomon his Son, Josias and the rest:
Like whom our King began his Reign,
Let men and Angels, etc.
In Egypt Saba ruled well, Troy, Casindra sat:
At Athens, did Minerua dwell, Samose was Iunos state.
Sibella lay in Cuma fair, in Greece, Penelope:
And in this Realm King James does Reign,
Let men and Angels, etc.
The Muses nine and Worthies all, Arts and Graces seven:
All these do now agree in one,
Yea heaven and earth, with all good things,
The Lord therefore continue him, Britain long to be.
Let men and Angels, etc.
In these his days when he began,
God by his hand established us:
In these his days all fear, began to fly and fall to ground:
And every way our quiet state,
Let men and Angels, etc.
Wherefore as Jews rejoiced much, Iubylies drew near:
As Moses with the Israelites,
As Hester eke with Mardochai, Purim hold:
So let great Britain keep this day,
Let men and Angels, etc.
Pray for the King and his Offspring,
For in one day both grief and joy,
A Christian Constantine we have,
To all his Kingdoms further bliss,
Let men and Angels witness bear,
of our unfeigned joy:
That we express with heart and tongue,
for our good King this day.
Amen.
An Antheme often Sung in the Royal Chapel of our late Queen Elizabeth, in
any time of danger: Made in Anno. Dom. 1588.
And may serve at all times for us.
Deliver us O Lord,
And eke defend all Christian souls,
Preserve us still good Lord,
From such as long and thirst for blood,
Our enemies be strong,
Without offense on our parts done,
Our selves, our cause, and all,
From traps, from snares, and bloody hands,
Our hope and help O Lord,
And thou according to thy word,
O Christ come end our strife,
Wherefore it shall while I have life,
FINIS.
Some other Monuments and Memorandums of Popery, (which together with the
Precedent Meeters) may well be entitled as follows: The Smoke of Enborne in
Barkeshire. Anno. 1604. The sparks of Allens-more in Herefordshire. 1605. And
the flames intended at the Parliament house. 1605.
All which, brake out of the fierye Coals which burned, and was but as it were
taked up in the breasts, bosoms, and hearts of Papists: till they perceived
that the Kings Majesty would not have, allow of, nor tolerate a Mulish, or
Lincy-Wolsey Religion in England: and then their madness did appear, and this
fire began to kindle. etc.
To the different, and indifferent Readers, I. R. wishes grace and Peace.
Perceiving that these leaves going before, would contain too small a volume:
I thougt it convenient to make some supply, and remembering that I had the
railing Libel that Papists scattered in Enborne Church in Barkshire, together
with a preface and some part of the answer to the same: As also the sum and
effect of the Commotion of Papists in Herefordshire: thought it good to fix
them to these Meeters. I knowing the certainty of the one by the printed Book,
put out thereof in prose by M. Thomas Hamon etc. And of the other mentioned in
part by good M. Powel in his Book to the Puritan Papist, therefore I say, I
have been the more willing to add the same to the rest of my Book, hoping of
good acceptance for the same: seeing that I mean it for the instruction of the
ignorant, and the recreation of others, and not otherwise.

Yours in the Lord. I. Rhodes.

The true Coppye of the railing Libell, left or cast into the Church of Enborne
in Barkshire, as I received the same.
The superscription in Prose. To the Parson of Enborne, give this with speed.

A post Script under the superscription. THe Carryer is paid already, as much
as he looks for, and so it shall cost you nothing but the reading: and would
you have it better cheap?

The Title or Inscription. TO the Heretical Parson of Enborne, due commendation,
Wishing him Catholic mind or else no salvation.


The Lybell it self after his manner of ryming. NOw Master Parson for your
welcome home,
Read these few lines you know not from whom


Of their Popish Cross. Hold Cross for an outward token and sign,
And remembrance only, in Religion thine:
And of the profession the People do make,
For more the^ this comes too, thou do it not take,
Yet holy Church tells us, of holy Cross much more,
Of power and of virtue, to heal sick and sore.
Of holiness to bless us, and keep us from evil.
From foul feend to fend us, and save us from devil,
and of many miracles, which Holy-Crosse has wrought
All which by tradition, to light, Church has brought
Wherefore holy worship, holy-church does it give:
And sure so will we, so long as we live.
Though thou say Idolatry, and vilde superstition,
Yet we know it is Holy Churches Tradition.
Holy-Crosse then disgrace not, but bring in renown,
For up shall the Cross go, and you shall go down.
And now what we are, if any would know,
Catholics we are, and so we will go.
The Service Book here, scattered all,
Is not divine, but Heretical:
So is the Bible of false translation,
To cut it and mangle it, is no damnation.
The Register also, if so we do serve,
We use it no otherwise then it does deserve:
For why should new Heretics, be therein inroulde,
Inrole good Catholics long dead of old,
Out with new Heritickes, hence let them go,
Register Catholics, and Register no more.
For Catholics only, are worthy record,
And into Church Register to be restorde.


Finis.
The Preface of the Answer to the Romish Rhyme and railing Libell.
HOw now my Masters of the Popish crew?
What yet more Rymes, to blaze your arms a new?
We thought that you had left these tryfling toys,
To be performed of Madmen, Girls and Boys,
And not that men of sort, or of ripe age,
Would thus like Players come upon the Stage.
Members of holy Church, as you would be,
Should hate such sports as things of base degree.
But Hogs and Dogs will wallow in the mire,
Eat their own vomit, to fulfill desire:
All carryon Crows, and Kites will stoop to ground,
Yea strike on Dunghils where their pray is found.
But Eagles, they will mount and soar on hie,
Feed on the best things, pleasing taste and eye:
You know the meaning, therefore be ashamed,
In such bad actions to be seen or namde.
Some of your friends and favorites I know,
Abhor this course and would not have it so.
When one like you did write of Popish Cross,
Another on your questions of like dross,
A Papist cursed: and said now fie for shame,
These first rude rimers, are most worthy blame,
And not the answerers prouok'd thereto,
By fools on our side that such things will do.
Unto low ebb your Pop'ry sure is come,
When up and down in Meeters it must run:
Will prose no longer serve your turns indeed?
But that like Fiddlers you must thus proceed?
Or must you wander now like Pedlers poor?
To sell your Romish wares from door to door?
What has our learned men desired you so,
That like to corner Creepers you must go?
Are you become S. Nicholas Clerks at last?
That walks by Owle-light when the day is past?
If Ballad Mungers trade you must profess:
Or like to Tinkers seek for work by guess.
If like to merry Beggars you will sing,
From house to house, then think upon this thing.
The law for Vagrants will light on you,
And so some whipping cheer may well ensue.
If Romish Church do hatch such Birds as these,
Who will believe that she our Christ can please
Some three years since, your questions put in rhyme,
Were answered all, according to the time.
Since then we heard of no reply at all,
Nor ye^ of Popish Poets great or small:
But now of late one stole out of his den,
And shamefully abuz'd both tongue and pen.
That is to say at Enborne in Barkeshire,
They dealt as if they would set all on fire,
The Church door they brake open with strong hand
Which is plain sacrilege in every land.
They cut one Book, and did disprayse the rest,
Scattering the leaves, to show how they detest:
Our books and us, with all the power they have,
Our Ministers and all things they deprave.
We seek to bring them to the faith again,
Which in Saint Paul's time, did in them remain:
But they abuse us for our pains therein,
Accounting all we do that way but sin.
Wherefore we must lose time no longer so,
Nor suffer them that ever seeks our woe:
But even deal roundly both with tongue and pen,
By force of law and what befits such men.
And since Rome is the Seat of Antichrist: viz. in their Mass.

And every day blasphemeth the most highest,
Since she no longer is Christ's spowse and wife,
But Harlot like, in Doctrine and in life.
Why should a Christian rest or stay on them?
But only cleave to Christ like Christian men.
The Protestants they say do hurt them sore,
The Puritanes they think will plague them more:
If these agree, (as by Gods help they shall)
Then reason tells them Popery soon must fall.
But leaving these things to Authority,
Unto the Popish rimers words come I.
Which shall have answer as they do deserve:
And from their own words I mean not to swerve.
Foget I may not yet to tell thee plain,
What lame legged Meeters, here I find amain,
Which like the Author every where does hault,
As Vulcan does, but I will not find fault.
Let this suffice for Preface to this Rhyme,
Which to the wise man's censure I resign.
FINIS.
To the Reader.
Here good Reader, I am driven to leave off for lack of time to finish the
rest, before the first execution of Traitors: but you shall have the rest with
the second part of this Book, which shall shortly be printed. In the mean
time, I pray thee to have patience for this stay, as also for any fault that
escaped the Printing: And when my second part of this book comes forth, thou
shall have my answer to this Railing Libell, and the matter of Herefordshire.
In the mean time I crave both thy prayers for me, and thy patience toward me,
and the Printer, as is above said: for we mean to make amends if God will.

Thine in the Lord Jesus. John Rhodes Minister.
