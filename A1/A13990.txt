Truths Integrity: OR, A curious Northern Ditty, called, Love will find out
the way.
To a pleasant new Tune.


OVer the Mountains
and under the Waves,
Over the Fountains
and under the Graves:
Over Rocks which are the steepest,
which do Neptune obey,
Over floods which are the deepest,
Love will find out the way.
Where there is no place
for the Glow-worme tolye,
Where there is no space
for the receipt of a fiye,
Where the Gnat she dares not venture,
lest her self fast she lay,
But if Love come he will enter,
and will find out the way.
You may esteem him
a child by his force,
Or you may deem him,
a Coward which is worse:
But if he whom Love does honor,
be conceal d from the day,
Set a thousand guards upon him,
Love will find out the way.
Some think to lose him
which is too unkind,
And some do suppose him
poor heart to be blind:
If that he were hidden,
do the best that you may,
Blind Love, if so you call him.
will find out the way.
Well may the Eagle
stoop down to the sist,
Or you may inueagle
the Phoenix of the East,
With fear the Tigers's moved,
to give over his prey,
But never stop a Lover,
he will poast on his way.
From Dover to Bar wicke,
and Nations thoroughout,
Brave Guy of Warwick,
that Champion so stout.
With his Warlike behavior,
Through the world he did stray
To win his Phillis favor,
Love will find out the way.
In order next enters,
Bevis so brave,
After adventures,
and policy grave,
To see whom he desired,
his Iosian so gay,
For whom his heart was fired,
Love found out the way.
The second part. To the same Tune.


THe Gordian knof,
which true lovers knit,
Undo you cannot,
nor yet break it:
Make use of your inventions,
their fancies to betray.
To frustrate your intentions,
Love will find out the way.
From Court to the Cottage,
in Bower and in Hall,
From the King unto the Beggar,
Love conquers all:
Though nere so stout and Lordly,
strive do what you may,
Yet be you nere so hardy,
Love will find out the way.
Love has power over Princes,
and greatest Emperor,
In any Provinces,
such is Loves power,
There is no resisting,
but him to obey,
In spite of all con testing,
Love will find out the way.
If that he were hidden
and all men that are,
Were strictly for bidden,
that place to declare:
Winds that have no abidings,
pitying their delay,
Will come and bring him tidings,
and direct him the way.
If the earth should part him,
he would gallop it ore,
If the Seas should orethwarthim,
he would swim to the shore:
Should his love become a Swallow,
through the air to stray,
Love would lend wings to follow,
and will find out the way.
There is no striving
to cross his intent,
There is no contriuing,
his plots to prevent:
But if once the message greet him,
that his true Love does stay,
If death should come and meet him,
Love will find out the way.
FINIS.
