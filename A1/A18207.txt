Mark 13.12.13. The Brother shall betray the Brother to the death, and the
Father the Son, and Children shall rise up against their Parents, and shall
cause them to be put to death.

And you shall be hated of all men for my names sake, but he that shall endure
unto the end, the same shall be saved.

THE REFORMED CATHOLICQVE, Against the Deformed Jesuit. OR A DISCOVERING Of
the treachery of the Jesuits Against the Reformed Churches of FRANCE, And
other parts.
YOu shall be hated of Kings / and the greatest personages of the World / shall
abhor you. It is a Prophecy that is most true / and what this day we see
and behold to be common amongst us / we are abhorred of the people / as the
most abominable persons in the world / despised both of great and little / and
gennerally exposed unto the opprobries / indignities / and indiscreet
insolences of mutinous Companions / and contemners of the Law of God / only
for our Religion / because we serve God in Spirit and truth and because we
will not submit ourselves under the yoke of the beast. The Jew / the Turk /
the Pagan / and the Moore that know not God / are not hated of the World as we
are / and why? because we art of the Religion because we serve God / and
will not follow the son of perdition.

FRANCE at this time is full fraughted even in the furthest Provinces and
parts thereof with our miseries Shadows deplore and lament our afflictions in
the middle of the Reformed churches that are furthest distant from the realm /
pity has made known the desolation of our holy communetie / throughout all
the World / are the good servants of God in all parts sight / deploring the
pitiefull disorder / and sorrowful abuse that is now practiced in the church
of God profaning his holy House / destroying his Temple / spoiling his
inheritance / exposing the flock of God / to the rage of Wolves / and giveing
them for a pray to hongry Drons / who in dispight of God fell them selves and
their cruel hearts with the substance of his dear flock / and which is more
sensible / and the full accomplishement of our greefes / those that ought to
help us / are they that committ most oppressions and extortions against us /
who most unjustly sustain / maintain / and entertain those / that do all
these mischiefs unto us / inciting them to do it / and under pretense of
doing us Justice / animate them against us / and draw them to a plublicke
rebellion / thereby to wrong and make us the authors of all these seditions.
We are dumb / like sheep led to the slaughter. If we make our complaints /
and implore the support and aid of those that ought to maintain us / we are
accused to be mutinous and seditious / we are committed to prison / and our
innocence / without any justification is condemned criminal / and turbulent
to the common peace. Oh most extreme Tyranie / and incomparable iniquity. But
alas! it is prophesied and forshowne by the Lord.

They are not content to have taken Bearn from no / to have polluted our
Temples / to have forced our consciences / to have prohibited the exercise of
the Religion unto us in those parts / to have taken our goods from us / to have
violated our privileges / to have compelled us to entertain and maintain our
enemies with that small portion that is left us. The Wolf takes the Sheep /
and devoures it / the Thief takes a man's purse and his money from him / and you
take our goods and bodies both / but you can not hurt our souls. We must give
the juice of our travels unto perfidious hipocrytes / to secret Traitors / or
to venomous serpents to nourishe them to make war upon us / what say I? To
nourishe them / when they have as great revenewes as Kings alas! what impiety
is? they rumate us / but not to enriche the Crown of France / but rather to
lay it open to an invasion. These Jesuitical conspirators without foreign
enemies / will rule the regale Scepter / if they attain to the intents of
their subtle and diabolical inventions / which they have allredy begone / and
seeing that they know that they can rule both the hearts and bodies of our Kings.
They doubt not (I fear) to obtain their scepters and crowns. They are for
the foreign ennemy / and not for the upholding of France. Oh most dangerous
Counsel / in so brave a Monarchy.

These good Fathers that outwardly seem to be the true tipe and figure of
Simplicity / are inwardly stuffed with malice / and having enemies hearts /
can by no means procure the advancement of the state / nor the good of the
commonwealth of France: Their pernicious deseigne is bent to the conspiration
of the totale ruin of this happy Monarchy; They seek by the motions and
sterrings up of civil wars / which they go about to make against us / by
their pestilent Preachers / to make a brech for our common ennemy that he may
soddenly enter into the middle of the prease / and desireing nothing but his
own good dispossess our King of his Realm / pull him down from his throane
/ and with us / bring him to the white bague.

This is the end / this is the intent / this is the deseigne and attempt of
these traiterous hipocrytes / of these Divelishe doble hearts / of these
perfidious and disloyal Jesuits / whose intents are not to set upon those of
the religion / to support the Kings authority but to advance them selves /
those parricides / who with murdering arms / bathed their hands in the sacred
blood of our Kings / were they not either pensioners / or scholars of the
triple horns / or were they not solicited and provoaked thereunto by their
internal sophistries / teaching / that it is a goodly action to kill a King
that is an hereticque / or that favoreth heresy.

If we might be permitted to search and look into the registers of the
depositions of the last desperate villaynes / we shall find that the last
words of Ravaillac were these: saing / the Jesuits promised and assured me /
that as soon as I had don the deed / the Angels and the Virgin Marie would
carry me into Parradise / and in truth / those that were present at such a
woofull and lamentable accident / report / that as soon as he has stabd the
King / he sought to run away / thinking that / that which the Treacherous
murderers had said would prove to be true / and we shall not only know them
by the last words of that miserable wretch / nor by the sentence pronounced
against them in their banishement / but by the catastrophall ends of all those
wicked persons / which shows them openly to be infamous to posteretie / and
therefore they are so cruelly animated against us / because we strive against
/ and always accuse them of the death of our Kings; Therefore they seek to
raise war against us / thinking thereby to root us out / but that is the
thing which we least fear / protesting these that first begin may perchance
to repent it.

We were promised that nothing should be innovated in Bearn / to leave that
business in suspense and not to speak of the 7. months / never the less all
those promises were withdrawn / that dew proceedings from such persons might
be broaken / and his Majesty was persuaded / and that by diverse great
personages / that it was a sin / yea and a great sin to hold his word
therein / and to the contrary that it is a work of great piety to violate
his faith.

These whot spirits / these spotted and black consciences / these disguised
Devils / these perfidious infernal Hogs / these Massacrers of Kings /
publickely teach such pernicious precepts / whereof the death of Chastel
serves for a witness / and an authentike seal unto us. They were not content
to have done a thousand injuries unto us in Bearn / but since that time / (oh
unspeakeable cruelty / and furious madness) they have taken our dead bodies
out of the earth / troubled their rest / and used violence unto our carcases:
seeing it is a Huguenot / we must pull him out of his grave / we must tie a
rope obout his neck and draw him through the streets like a dog. Oh most
outrageous beastlynes and Divelishe fury.

These Barbarous cruelties were done unto us in the city of Tours, and worse
then they / they brake down our church yeard / they defaced our Temple and
burnt it / and the Bible / the holy scriptures / the Gospel and Testament of
God. Whether do these cruel vilaynes / suppose to triumph against God / when
they triumph over his holy word? and not content therewith / what have they
not done? The repetition thereof is most lamentable.

They animated sedicious persons in all places against us / they did us a
thousand mischiefs / and yet (alas) we durst not open our mouths to
complain thereof / that by our tears and sightes we might pacify and asswge
our greef. Some of our people were cast in prison / and some were glad to run
away / and to set a fair show upon their cruelty / they put some of their
side likewise into prison / that were shassed away / and the matter winckt at.
If we had done the like / we should have bin imprisoned / hanged / and without
form of process we should have bin punished for an exemple unto others /
(alas) will not a good counsel take order in so pitiful a distress. My heart
bleedes / but I dare not say that which I know. Ne vati noceat esse locutum. A
great tree in the end is pulled down to the grownde / by pulling one piece this
day / an other that day from it.

Why should we be blasmed for assembling in Rochell / by the Kings permission
/ they take this subject to animate themselves against us / to come thither to
over run us / and to put all to fire and sword / we are pressed and persuaded
to separate our selves which we will never do. / that wear a means to begin
again / and to reduce us into the like misery. It must not be so / we must
either know the short or the long / we have bin sufficiently dalied withal /
and in a manner afflicted / since the lamentable death of King Henry the great
of famous memory / the more we stay / the more we are vexed / the more we
remit / the less we are eased.

If they threathen to put us to death / we are accustomed thereunto / if they
threaten to burn us / we have past through that allredy. If they threaten to
cut of our heads / we have tried that also. Is not the river of Seine yet red
all over with the blood of our Fathers? Is not the River of Loire all bloody by
the mesure of our Brethren? Is not the River of Rosne yet purple with the
blood of our graund-Fathers? Are not the ashes of our predicessors that were
burnt / still whot? are not the high ways still full of the bones of our
Kinsmen / that were traitorously murdered? for the profession of the reformed
Religion? and for refuseing to follow the footstepp of Antechrist? All this is
nothing / let us make the rivers show of a ^ermilion color with the abondance
of our blood / let us contemn fire and faggot / swords and shot / gibet and
wheel for Religion sake / for the service of God / and for professing Jesus
Christ / for he himself says: He that acknowledged me before men I will
acknowledge him before my Father which is in Heaven / as to the contrary / he
says to those whom tribulation and fear of death has made to fall from
their profession. He that shall deny me before Men / I will deny him before
my Father which is in Heaven / he that is ashamed to acknowledge me before men
/ I will be ashamed of him before my Father which is in Heaven: And again / he
that loves his life more then me / is not worthy of me.

They think by spoiling one member by destroying one town / by putting a
thousand Millions of people to death / that the whole body of Religion is
thereby exterminated / we spring up again out of our ashes / our blood
hatcheth us again. Those great and cruel Massacres committed upon our Fathers
/ have not deminished us. It is Gods cause / the Lord will undertake our
defense / and withstand the rage of our enemies.

They make war against us / which is manifest and evident / but piety is not
the principal cause of their deseigne / for seeing that Athists and Jews are
suffered to live peaceably / they may well permit us to live in the Realm
indifferently among the common people obediently / as they have hitherto done /
but because we have directly banded our selves against the wicked enterprises
of the satanicall instructions of this sodometicall society / and that we
disclose the subtilties / the craftines / the infernal practices / and the
antitheticque or contrary Doctrynes of this communaltie of mamon / and
publishe and make them known to simple ignorant fellows seducers of the
people / they are stirred up against us feareing that their state will dekie
and wax worse and worse / and that in the end they shall no longer be able to
subsist against the truth / and also having an aprehension / that at the last
they shall see the Romish glory and profit overthrown / which to maintain
they do most audaciously strive against God / and because we uphold his name
and defend the truth / they seek by a Divelishe counsel to destroy us / as
the most strong and most puisant enemies of the apostolic seat.

These Dipers / these Basilickes / these Tigers / these furious Dragons / are
the cause of all the mischief which we see to be prepared generally to afflict
all Frannce / specially aiming at our destruction / like greedy and ravening
Lions. Let us stand firm and fast by the tree of faith / and let us repose all
our confydence and hoape in Gsd / without looking or attending for aid / from
man / for / If God be with us / who shall be against us?

We make profession of the Reformed religion / let not / torments / martiring
/ rackes / nor horror of death make us at any time to waver / nor change our
Religion: let us not fear the World / Emperors / Kings / Monarckes / Princes /
nor whole realms nor Nations sediciously animated against us / let us freely
and boldly confess that we are Christians / and that we will rather endure
the cruelty of death / then deny Jesus Christ. Nevertheless let us fly and
shun the occasion / as much as we can / and if we can by no means avoyde the
peril / and not hinder the blow / let us rather burst then obey Antechrist /
let us rather embrase condemnation then mercy / and show our selves constant in
death / for the Gospel of Christ. God died for us / then are not we bownd to
die for him? Shall we bowing down our heads shamefuly without hoape / retire
/ esteming our selves happy to have that favor and that liberty / after we
have bin proclaimed traitors to his Majesty?

It is a folly / it must not be so / either we will be punished / or we will
be Justified / we will have all or nothing. We have set the crown upon King
Henry the fourth / deceased / of glorious memory: (France knows it well) and
we will give the Scepter to King Lowis the 13. God will give that grace /
being able to do more / and being stronger then we are thought to be: away
with favor / away with the mignions of fortune / and those unmaried courtiers
/ away with those tapucine consciences / they have sufficiently and to much /
to our great greef / troubled the se^ces of our Atlas / by their bewitching
sorceries / possessing the noblest parts of his understanding.

We will not rebel against the King / and much less will we contradict the
will of God / nor endure that men should anihilate our ancient Priveledge /
we will not endure it / and let it not be thought to be strange / if we
oppose the same withal our forces / for we will never endure / that men
should put a knife to our throats / without putting their hands to it.

If we take Arms in hand / it shall be to redstablishe the King upon his
throane / to command absolutely over his people / and to prevent that mischief
/ that is intended toward us / and if we fight / to defend our selves / it
shall be to maintain the faith of the Gospel / and preserve the Kings
authoretie / although they cover themselves with veil of Regal authority /
to assail us / but al proceeds from wicked counsel. We fear God / and honor
the King.

What pity is it? all the World is animatted sore against us / and there are
some amongst us / that would betraie us / patience / let God be praised / and
do all for his glory.

At this day it is a crime to be one of the Reformed Religion / but that crime
is pleasing unto God: There is neither Emperor / King / Monarche / Prince nor
Lord / to be short there is none / that we ought to obaye before God. If they
kill our bodies / they can not kill our sowles. They have a quarrel against us
long since / all that formerly past / was but subtiletyes to entrap us / we
are put from publicque offices we are prohibited common commerce / our
Elections are transported / our Privileges are eclipsed / and if they durst
they would constrain us / to play banckcrupt with God / and religion / but we
will sooner die then to do wrong to our sowles / we will never do it / yea
rather die a thousand deaths / then violate the Faith we have vowed unto God.
The three children conte^ned of Nabuchodonoser and his fire. The Prophet Daniel
did not fear the rage of the Lions / let us rather be killed / then bow our
knies to Baal / let us rather be thrown into the mouths of burning fyrie
furnases then to break our Law / and deny our God / and let us not lose
courage / nor be afraid / for ^^ll the traitors. Luke warn / and wicked men
that m^^ ^e ^^wnd among us / though they he never so great principal persons /
and puisant / yea though they were our Fathers / Brethren / Sisters / or our
nearest kinsmen. Jesus Christ found a Judas among his Apostles let us die / let
us die courageously to maintain Gods quarrel / that at the end of our course
/ after we shall have fought a good fight he may receave / and crown us in
Paradise / with the incorruptible crown of glory / perpetually to sing to his
honor and glory with the Angels and the blessed for ever and ever / Amen.

Veritas odium parit, and Supplicium.
FINIS.
