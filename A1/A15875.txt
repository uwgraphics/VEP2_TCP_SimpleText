Unto the right worshypfull Master Edward Grymesto^ / Richard Argentyne /
wyssheth peace and health in Jesus Christ.
FOr as much as Jesus christ unto whom the children were offered / Math. xix. to
the intent he should lay his hands upon them and pray / with a favorable
countenance receiving the same / declared that he came to be a savior also of
soche / because the very infauntes (as well as other of greater age) through
the sin of Adam / had need of the grace of God / and the same being received
of Christ / are made the Cytezens of the kingdom of heaven. these of just
cause / are most worthy praise / that show the very nere and next way /
how such may be trained unto Christ / that as yet have not the parfect use
of reason / whereby faith may the more surely be graffed in them / without the
which it is impossyble to please God. For like as the shipma^ that apointeth
his journey into foreign countries / though his ship be never so well tackled /
or never so good of sail / being without his compass / whereby (in te^pestuous
and dark storms / and in the long and obscure nyghtes / he may know upon
what coaste to decline) thinks him self naked / eue^ so the young and tender
age / albeit it be never so well natured and endued with godly graces / yet of
it self it is but naked / being without a guide declaring the right way / and
of nature more prone to vice than to virtue. Where therefore God has given unto
you a Child of great towardnes / furnisshed also with the gifts of nature as
much as may be. Unto whom (for your sake) I am bound to owe my service in
all that I am able to do. I have translated this little book / amongst other
for the same most necessary. That by him / the rest of the youth that
customably is very grossly brought up / may the better be brought to the
knowledge of god / and his holy word / and be trained in virtue / to the
comfort of their pare^tes / and to their own great commodite. Fare you well.
From Ippeswich this xxviij of January. An. 1548.

Unto Gerolde Meier a very good youngman / Huldrichus Zuinglius wissheth grace
and peace from God and our lord Jesus Christ.
WHEN of late as thou did return from the baynes / every man received the
with glad heart / (my most dear young friend Gerolde) and diverse willed to
honor the with gifts. I thought I should be utterly void of al ciuilite if
I should not present the with some manner of gift specially seeing this custume
to use to honor those that baine themselves is comonely used amongst friends
/ amongst whom / for two causes I accounte the. The one is / because thou
do fortunately employ thy dyligence to learning / and the other / because
thou art in wages vnd the standard of my friend Glareane. And when I sought
long with my self / what thing might be most acceptable unto the / at
length / I found that it must be / either holy or learned / or both / that
should serve unto thy pleasure. For like as of nature thou apperest to be borne
unto godliness and virtue / so even now of thine own accord thou do show
forth the fruits of ^rbanite and elegantie the which truly are somewhat ripe
before time / and therefore are they the more plesaunt. Wherefore albeit that
searching over with dylyge^ce all my learned stuff / when by no way I could
parforme the thing / it remained / that I should buy your favor / with
certain Godly things / apparteining as well to the health of the body as of
the soul / and co^ducing unto virtue. Where therefore in times past / I had /
upon counsel taken with my self / begone to make a book how the ingenious
youth ought to be instructed / and diverse disturbau^t lettes had delaied my
purpose (as the case and state is of things present now a days) yet as I
thought of the forenamed gift / laying watch carefully to chose a thing
convenient / the memory of my old taken counsel came into my mind. Ande
albeit that I see the most part of men to be careful / how they may
dedicate their labor being finisshed / unto some worthy patron / to me it
fortuned contrary / for he is present and ready / unto whom the thing ought
to be dedicate. But I lack leisure and those ix years until the which time
this work ought to be suppressed. Wherefore betwixt these two incomodities /
that utterly some thing must be sent unto the / and that my busynes does not
permit the same to be done worthelie / I have found how presently / it may
be satisfied unto us both / I my self have stolen so much time / that without
great aduysement I have gathered to gether a few precepts. And truly /
generally they ought to be few / but well bestowed / least ^o much copy should
make lothsomenes. For so almoost it comes to pass / that things that are
with a sparing hand drawn forth are taken in with the more gredy stomach. The
which things thou shall not esteem after the place from whence they have their
first original / but according unto the meaning and intent of him from whence
they proceed. For Godly things / we may without dissimulation promis / if in
our selves we are not void of grace / But to promise learned things / it is
a shame / although thou thy self be never so well learned. The first precepts
conteyne in them / how the tender and young mind of an Ingenious strippling
is to be adorned / in those things that apparteyne unto God. The second /
how in those things that apparteine unto him self. The third / how in
those things that apparteine unto other. And here / it is not our purpose to
begin from the swadlingbanddes / nor yet from the first rudimentes / but from
that age the which begins to have the use of discretion and wit / and
begins to swim (as the proverb says) without a bark / in the which age
even now thou thy self art. These (as I trust) thou will read diligently /
and wilt transform thy self into them / that unto other also / thou may
exhibyt a lively example and token of the same. The which Christ the mighty
lord grant unto the. So be it. At Straesburch the Calendes of Auguste 15. 32.

The Aphorisms (the which are called brefe sentences partetly declaring the
absolute meaning of the thing) of the first Precepts.
BEfore all things / seeing it lies not in the power of man to draw the heart
of any one unto the faith of one god although any man should pass in
persuading Pericies / but it lies only in god the heavenly father / who does
draw us unto him. And yet nothwythstandyng / according unto the saying of the
Apostle / faith is by hearing (so that the hearing be the word of God) not
truly that the preaching of the word is of so great force / except the spirit
working in us / g ue us advertisement unto the same. And therefore faith must be
instilled with most pure words / and most used to proceed from the mouth of
God / And prayers joined unto the same must be made unto him / who only does
make the faithful / that whom we teach with word / he may illuminate the
same with his spirit.

And perchance it shall not be alienate from the purpose of Christ / if we
bring the same into the knowledge of God / yea / by things that are visible.
As if we call before our eyes / the ingent of the universal world /
declari^g or showing with our finger / that all things are subject unto
alteration / but it is necessary that he be immutable / and not moved / the
which has co^ciled all things / (seeing they be so diverse) in so firm ande
marvailous a concord. Ande again it ought not to be suspected that he that
has disposed al things with so great a providence / will he after neglect his
own handy work / for as much as amongst mortal men / it is imputed as a
vice or blame / if any man be not dilligent or careful in the thing that
apparteineth unto his house.

Of this / the same our dearli^g shall learn the pouidence of God / who cares
for all things / disposes all things and preserves all things. For of the
two sparrowes that are bought for a farthi^ge / the one falls not upon the
ground unto us / without his counsel. Who also has no^bred the hears of
our heads / nothing utterly is left out of this care. Whereby it is manifest
that the same does determine^ not only of things whereof the soul has need /
but also the body / seeing we see the Rookes so liberally to be entre^eined by
the same / ande the lilies also so gally to be ^ladde.

Hitherto / the mind being rightly furnisshed or instructed of the providence
of god / it ca^ not be that it may be at any time careful / or out of order
stryken with couetuousnes. The which affect if in our tender age we cut from
us than ^a^e we delivered the mind from a great dangerous and hurtefull plage.

He shall know truly that God is not only a lord / but also a father of all
those that believe in him / that is / of those that trust in him and that he
desires that we shall come with as much haste unto him / to crave for help /
as unto the parent or father that has begotten us / ande with his propre
words has promised help / because certeynly he loves to be prayed.

Wherefore if the sycknes either of mind or of body do vex or grieve the / the
remedy must be obtained from him / if thy ennemy do trouble the / if envy do
oppress the / thou must run unto him. If we covet wisdom or learni^g we
must wowe him for them / yea both wife and children are also to be desired at
his hand.

If the increase of goods and honors come a little to plentyfully unto us /
we must desire of him / that he will not suffer our mind to be made to tender
with them or effemyna^e / ande so to be brought out of the right way.

What need many words? generally / he shall know that all things are to be
asked of him and he shall think it a wrong / to ask any thing of him / that
shall not be condecent for him to parforme / and finally he shall be a shamed
either to covet or to have any thing the which by him is not laufull / and he
shall only get and lay up in treasure those things that makes me^ truly
happy.

He shall understand the mystery of the Gospel this ways / he shall know
before all other things the state of the first manne / that is to say / how
he through death is dead again / how after that he had tra^sgressed the
precept of God / he infected by his transgress all his posterite. For the dead
can not beget the lyuysh / neither have we ever seen a black morian borne
amongst Inglishme^. Whereby / this our friend shall know also his disease.

Also by this he does know / if he do understand how we do all things by the
motions of our affectes / how God truly is far of from them. Whereby it
follows undoubtedly / that we also should be most clear without all affectes
if we shall desire to dwell with God. For like as every innocent / has nothing
to do with those that are most given unto myschefe / and contrary the wicked
can not abide the just. For as those that are of the nature of Nero do bid
and command other like unto Seneca to be handeled / even so of the contrary /
the same tumbe does hyde or cover the Emyans with the S^^pians / so none other
shall inhabit with God / than he that is without spot ande holy / as God him
self is holy / ande endued with the pureness of heart. For blessed are the pure
in heart because they shall see God. But how shall we get so great an
Innocence / the which are nedged round^ about with most impure affectes? we
being here^^ betwixt the hammer and the stithe for so much as God does require
so great an innocence / we being corrupted / can of our selves do nothing but
vice / whether we will or not we are compelled to yield unto God and to permit
all things unto his grace. Here springs the light of the Gospel.

When we are enclosed with these strayghtes / Christ does take us out / the
which has delivered us far better / than any great God of the Gentyles that
was thought to preserve them / above all things / erecting the conscience nere
unto desperation / ande sone after when by most assured hope he has joined
the same unto him / making it fortunate. For seeing he is most clear without all
blotte of all corrupted affectes conceived truly of the holighoost / and borne
of a pure virgin. First to deliver us he did set forth this his innocence for
us. For truly he suffered our labors and pains / ande afterward he makes
those which undoubtedly believe this / blessed.

For he that shall believe this lyberall pardon / granted of God by Christ /
unto the miserable kind of mortal man / he shall be saved / ande being made the
coheyre of Christ / he shall be in joy with the father everlasting. For he will
that where him self is / there also his minister shall be

The innocence of Christ that was put in danger for those that were gylte /
yea for the dampened / has absolved us / and has made us worthy unto God for
this cause specially / because he was able to fulfill the manner and measure of
the dyuine justice. For he was most clear without all corrupted affection. And
where as he is soche and so great of him self / that is to say God / yet was
he made ours. Whereof it follows / that his justice (the which only thing
we ^acke) was also made ours. For he was made unto us from god^ wisdom /
justice / holiness and redemption.

Now / by him we have an entrance unto God. For he is ours the pledge of the
grace of God / our Advocate / our sufere our head / intercessour ande
mediator. He is our whole trust and affiaunce both first and last.

Those that hitherto understand the mystery of the Gospel and trust upon the
same / are borne of God for the capacite of man's weakness can not attain
unto so profounde a counsel of the grace of god.

Out of this it comes / that those that are borne a new of the Gospel / can
not sin. For every soch one as is borne of God does not sin. But he that
believes the Gospel / is borne of God / wherefore they do not sin that are
borne new of the Gospel. That is to say / the sins are not impu^ed unto
them unto da^pna^ion and death because Christ has redeemed them with the price
of his death. For albeyt that we (as long as we are in this body trauaylyng as
it were in pilgrimage from God) cannot be without affectes / and so by that
means also / not without sin. Ye^ Christ notwythstandi^g because he is ours /
does supply or amend all this our impote^cye or weakness. For sei^g he is god
aeternal and a spirit / he is more precious to redeem the sines of all me^ /
than they them selves are able to deserve.

For Ood truly as he is a substanciall form or power that turns and moves
all things in it self / not being moved / will not suffer hi^ also / whose
heart he has drawn unto him / to be slouthful or idle. The which sentence
truly is not known by probacio^s but by use. For only those that are
faithful have in experience how Christ gives no ydlenes at all unto his
servauntes / and with how glad a spirit and with how much joy they
travayle and are exercised in this busynes.

Wherefore / who so ever understands the mystery of the Gospel / he goes
about to live well. Wherefore that must be taught as much as may be very purely
and dilygently.

And this also must as the time requires he taught / by what kind of means
specially we may deserve the favor of God / by those things certeynly /
which he him self uses always toward us / by justice / faith and mercy.
For seeing God is a spirit / he can no otherwise be worshipped rightly with any
other sacrifice / than with the spiritual sacrifice of an humble mind.
Wherefore let our derling or you^gman bend his intent to this end / how with
all maturite he may be a good man; how he may be innocent / and as nere like
unto God as may be.

He does good unto all men / he does hurt no man / except a man first hurt
hi^ self. So he that does study to do good unto all men / and to be every
thing unto all men / and does abstain utterly his hand from all injury / he
is most like unto God. These things are hard / if thou have an eye unto our
own strength / but unto him that believes / all things are possible.

The Aphorisms of the second precepts.
After that the mind / which must be appointed unto substanciall virtue /
shall be rightly instructed by faith / the next thing is / that he deck ande
furnish him self all wholly within purely. For if with him self all things be
in a right order / than shall he very sone give good counsel unto other.

And he can not more lightly set his mi^de in due order / than if he have in
hand / and labor both night ande day in the word of God. The which thing
he shall do very well / if he understand the hebrew and greek tou^gues rightly
/ because without the one of them / the old Testament / and without the other
/ the new can not without difficulte purely be known.

And for as much as we have taken upon us to teach those / that have now
passed over the travail of their first rudime^tes. And the Latin tongue being
had in use amongst all men / yet do we not think it mete utterly to leave it.
For albeit that it do conduce less unto the understanding of holy scriptures /
then either the Greek or Hebrew tongue / yet for the rest use of our life it
proficeth very mothe^ and sometimes it comes to pass / that we have to do in
the busynes of Christ amongst those that are only latin men. But to abuse the
tongues for again / that truly ought to be far of from a Christen man. For
truly the tongues are the gift of the spyryte of God.

The next unto this / unto whom we shall give our diligence / shall be the Greek
tongue / because of the new Testaments as it is said (for speaking the thing
/ that I think offending no man wyllingly) The doctrine of Christ even from
the beginning (not as the thing required) so rightly to have been handled of
the latin men / as of the greeks. Wherefore this our dearling must be sent unto
the first fountaynes.

Albeit this in them both is to be observed / that the same have his heart
strongly walled about with faith ande innocence. For there are many things
that would be learned not without danger / wa^t^nes / the desire of Empire
and to live in contention of battaill / intertaine frowardnes / vain
Philosophy and such like things. All the which things / a mind being
monisshed of them before / may pass over not touchi^g them / like unto
Ulysses. When at the first voice or hearing of the^ / he has thus monisshed
him self / These things thou hear to beware and not to be enta^gled with
them / or to take them. We give the last place to the hebrew tongue for this
cause specially / because as we have said a little before / the latin tongue is
grown in knowledge amongst all men. And the Greek tongue shall most
conveniently follow the same or else would we of just right have given the
first place unto the hebrew tongue / because without the phrase of that tongue
/ yea in the greek tongue he shall sweat who soever will understand or search
out the right sense of the scripture. But to speak of the vtilite of the
tongues to the full / it aparteyneth not to this purpose.

Who soever comes with an humble and thursty mind / with these armours / he
may break into this heavenly wisdom unto whom no wisdom of man may be
compared / nor yet of right matched.

Unto the which / when he has broken in / he shall find all kinds of forms
to live well / that is to wit Christ him self the most absolute exemple of
all virtue / whom / when by word and deed he shall assuredly or plainly know
/ he shall so embrace / that in every act or counsel / he shall endeavor to
express some part of his virtues / as much as by right the tenuyte or
weakness of man will suffer to be done.

He shall learn of him as the oportunite of time shall require both to speak
and to hold his peace. It shall be a shame for him to tymely to speak of those
things which require none but soche as are come to a parfectripenes / because
he may see Christ to have laid up this sca^tly at the length in the thurtieth
year of his age. Albeit that he did give some experiment of him self unto the
doctors of the law also when he was twelve years old. By the which exe^ple
we are not so much taught to come forth in time / as we are to endeavor even
from our tender age things that are great / but worthy unto God.

For like as the greatest ornament or commendacion unto a woman through out
all her life is scylence. So nothing does make a yongman more commendable tha^
the study of scile^ce for a c^r^eine time / until the mind and the tongue as
well a part / as amongst them selves can agree well. And we require not here
the Pythagoricall scylence / but we do only suppress the desire to speak.
Ande except the yongman shall speak tymely / we do forbid him to speak at all.

Whiles he studieth the precepts of eloquence / being under his masters / he
shall not deforme or bring it out of fasshyon / because he will follow their
exemple if it have any fault. Ande let no man think this precept to be of a
light force. For it is to be learned by the old ancient histories / that
certain Auditors or learners have not only followed by imitations the vices
or fautes of their teachers tongue / but also of their bodies.

The fautes of the tongue / may be sone know unto every body. For truly the
form of an Oration besides the worckmanship or ha^oe^ing of it / is corrupted
/ if the same be spoken to fast or to slowly. If the acce^t or pronou^cing of
it / be to base or fair / or to vehement / as if in every cause / and in every
kind of thing there be but one form of countenannce / ande one manner of
gesture / or faming as me^ do call it / that is done with insolency.

It is observed / that Elepha^tes / when they are alone / are careful ande
studious to call to mind those things / for the which they have been beaten.
So a yongma^ shall often study with him self / how to compose his tongue or
countenance / how to use his hands / like unto one that may where need shall
require / with convenient shame fastnes be as a loadesman / shewi^g things
unto other / ande to proceed ande not to row back again. And all these
things he shall so moderate / that they may serve the truth / and not to serve
in flattery unto other. For the co^dicions or manners of some that are like
unto the conditions of an harlot how can they be endured or suffered of a
Christian heart? Wherefore by this exercise that we do here require / we do
inte^d none other thing / tha^ that every man may learn with him self / to
rule the exterior vices / the which are the most certain tokens of a
corrupt mind. Wherefore it is first necessary that the mind of it self be
parfect / the which / if it so be / shall sone moderate the raging tempest of
the exterior members / that we do not frown to much / or alter our mouth or
contenaunce / or shake our head / or cast abroad our hands / but that we
tempre all these things / with a certain modeste / not affected / but plain
and full of symplycite. These things are of the Oration or speaking / and of
scilence.

He shall fly the saturite or fulness of wine / as much as he would homlocke.
Forlike as it does drive this tender body or young Carcas (the which of his
own nature is prone unto vehemence) unto madness / eue^ so does it (without
doubt) corrupt our old age / that as yet tarieth for us / even in the first
springing of us. Whereby it comes to pass / that when by chance we come unto
it / we find infirmite and sickness / and no rest. For it ca^ no otherwise be /
but those that have to busily used to wasshe them selves with wine / but that
they must fall into some grievous and dangerous sickness / as the fallinge
sickness / a palsy / a dropsy / the leprie / ande soch other. Wherefore covet
not to sone to be an old man / if thou will be an old man long.

Let the rest of his diet be soch things as may be sone gotten. For what does
it co^duce to a young man (whose stomach by nature is pro^pte and ready to
parfect disgestio^) to desire to feed upon partrig^s thrusshes deintie birds
/ Capo^s / of Roobuckes and soch other deintie disshes? Let him lay up those
in store / till age come upon him / when his tethe shall be dull or blunte /
ande the palate of his mouth tender or worn / and his throat / with long
continuance of time / grown to a certain hardness / ande his Stomach not
being q^ycke or able to digeste / ande his body half dead. For what hope
shall be to nourish the old age if the wanton youth / by intemperate diet / has
made soch things loathsome / which the old age should most desire?

Hunger in the mean time / is only to be convinced or overcome / ande not to
be put away. For men say that Galen lived hundredth and twenty years / because
he never departed full from the table. And I do not here require / that thou
should punish thy self with famyn / but that thou should not serve the
insatiable voracite or ravening / more than the use of the life does require.
For I am not so ignorant but that I know / that a man may offend in both
parts. If that in rauenyng we make our selves like unto wolves / or by famine
/ make our selves vnproffytable or not able to do any good.

I suppose nothing to be more folysh / than to covet to be taken as a gentelman
/ because of rich and gaye apparel. For by that means / the Bysshoppes Mules
may challenge nobility / and be much bruted. For they / for as much as they be
stronges are able to carry more gold and silver / and more precious stones /
than ever any Milo could. And who can not be ashamed of his proud apparel /
that hears the son of God / borne of a vyrgyne / to ligh crying in an ox
stalle? being wrapped about only with so many bands / as the virgin / not
being prepared to her delivery / bare with her?

Those that daily do find out strange ande new shapes of garments / do
declare / a most certain token of an inconstaunt (or if that be to much) of
an effeminate or tender mind. Those are not of Christ / for they suffer the
poor in the mean while to perish with cold ande hunger. Wherefore a man must
as much abstain from the superfluite of garments or apparel / as of any
other kind of evell.

While the yongman begins to be in love / he must exhibit some beginning of
exercise of his mind. And while other do try their arms / where a tumulte is
/ with strength and armours / this our dearling shall convert all his strength
to this purpose / that he may defend him self from the madness of love. And
when he shall parceaue utterly that he must love in deed / to beware that he
doat not / and to chose soche a one to his love / whose co^dicions he trusts
to be able to endure in perpetual matrymonie / and so vndefyledly or chastely
to keep their congresse or meting to gether / until the time of Marriage / that
besides her / amongst all the number or multitude of women and virgins he
know none.

For what purpose or need / does it serve in this case to forbid the desire
of money and glory / when even amongst the Gentiles / this kind of mischefe /
is evil spoken of? And this our dearling ought not to be taken hereafter as a
Christian / if he shall become servant unto that / the which has trodden
under foot / not one or two / but has subverted the most florysshyng
kingdoms / has destroyed the mighty strong Cities / and what soever publyke
weal it has invaded / it has utterly undone the same. This when it has in
possessyon the pryncypall tower of man's mind or soul / it permytteth
nothing to be well done / ande is the most hurtefull plage of all the woorlde
/ but / alas / it is of a great power / which we shall kill or destroy by
Christ alone / if we shall be the dylygent or busy followers of hi^. For what
other thing did he here else / than to remedy this evell?

We think the Mathematical discyplines / unto the which also / men do number
Music / not lightly to be touched / albeit not dwelling long in them. For
like as they being known are very much fruitful or necessary / ande being
not regarded / are no small impediment / even so if a man shall spend all his
time in them / eve^ to his old age / he shall have none other fruit by it /
then those have / which / because they will not be idle / walkinge up ande
down / change now ande than their place.

The exercise of contencyon or of armours / we do not so much condemn / as
wyllyng notwithstanding to pronounce otherwise in this matter / if we did not
see certain great rich men constauntly to abhor from that labor / which
does help the commone life. Yet shall it be the part of a christian man
utterly to abstain from weapons as much as may be laufull by the state and
tranquillyte of the public weal. For GOD / who brought home David as a
conqurour / being rude in the handelinge of weapons / goying forthwith his
slinge against Coliath / and preserved the Israelites / bring unarmed from
their present ennemy / will preserve us also undoubtedly / ande if it shall
otherwise please him. He shall harnas ande make strong our hands / He truly
does teach our hands unto the conflict or fight. But if it be Utterly
determined / to put in experience / this exercise of weapons / let this only
be the chief intent of it / that we will defend our native country ande those
whom GOD commands to be defended.

I would therefore every man (ande chefely / not withstandinge those that are to
be appointed unto the office of the word of GOD) to think no otherwise than
that how they may attain unto the only City / ad in that alone / of the old
^assylyans the which did account no^e to be in the nombre of their Cytezens,
that knew no craft how to get his living. For by that means / it should
come to pass that ydlenes (the cause or mainteyner of al dissolute behaueour)
or wa^to^nes / should be bannished / and our bodies should much longer be
preserved in health should lyve longer and br of greater strength.

The Aphorysmes of the last Precepts.
First of all this shall the ingenious mi^de think with himself / Christ has
given him self for us ande is made ours and so is it necessary that thou be
given unto a^men not to think thy felt to be thyn^ own man but to be for
other. For truly we are not borne unto our selves / but that we should be all
things unto all men.

Wherefore from his tender age he shall must upon these things alone upon
justice faith and constauntye by the which he may do good unto the chrystyan
publyke weal and unto his native country ande particulerly also unto all men.
For those are speak and feeble minds / that only do regard this thing / how
they may have or come by a quiet living / ande are not so like unto God / as
those are / that even with their own peril do study how to do good unto all
men.

Ande here notwithstanding this must he warelye taken head of least the purpose
that is taken or intended to the glory of God of our native country ande the
proffit of all men / be not defiled or corrupted by the deuell or the love of
our selves / and finally that we take not the thing unto our selves the which
we will appear to have done; for the cause of other men. For why? we may see
many which in the first beginni^g go happily in the right trade / and within a
little after / through vain glory (which is the pestilence of all godly
intentes) they are driven out of the right path.

In the prosperity ande aduersite of other men / he shall even like behave him
self as though they had for^ned unto his own parson. If good fortune shall
come unto an other / he shall think th^^ is has fortuned unto him self as
well a^ it had ^o^e aduersite. For why the shall ^^^t none public weal like
unto one house and familye Yea one body in the with the members are so glad
together and do sorrow ande the one helps the other that what soever shall
fortune to one shall be thought to happen to all.

After this sort / he shall be glad with the joyful and shall wipe with those
that do weep / for why^? he shall think the chu^^ches of every man to be his
own. Add unto this that according unto the saying of Senica / the thing may
happen unto every man that does fortune unto any ^ne. And we do not teach that
these afflictes joy ande sorrow must be so used as the comone custom is.
For we will not that we shall make mirth and joy in prosperit^^ and despayr in
aduersite. But for as much / as we are never without these ^^d other affectes
/ so if wi^^ wise we must tempre them / that in no cas^^^ admit any
inconueniente / or do the thing that is not comely / Wherefore we s^athe as
much of the prosperity as other (...) out (...) other will shall we be sep^^
/ tha^ to say / we shall take al things ^^th ^am^^ra^ion.

From these conuenticles or companyes where as men mete / many together or
commely soche as are the marriages of ki^ds (^a^ditates that are yearly kept
and holidates. I make no great restrainte because (...) christ in times past
has been (...) vnki^dly part of maryages. (...) most allow / that if the
(...) ^^st needs be done be done in so (...) place or openly rather then in
(...) houses / because the multitude of witnesses / does more vehement^^ (...)
tha^ their own propre mi^d. For he shall want all grace / that is not ashamed
(...) openly o^ comunely to do the thing that is dishonest or uncomely.

From the comune conuenticles or ^etynges together of men / he shall always
(...) to thing away some goodness / least ^^ke as Socrates was accustomed to
complain return home alwaes work. He shall mark of any man be have himself
abroad with honest shame fastnes / and shall follow it. And of the contrary
without shame he shall refuse it or despise it.

But for as much as those that are full ripe of one consca^tly do this / mine
advise is that they mete together in publyke conventicles as seldom as may
be. But if of necessite sometimes madness must be had in company sone after
let us come home again to our selves / a sone reason may be pretended why we
have forsaken our selves / unto the which / those must be agreeable that do
know that we are given always unto virtuous or good studyes.

In things that are paynefull / our brydilles must be lowsed for us to run.
For ^n this case it is accounted a noble thing to be first and last. In this
should we streatch our sinnewes forth the evell to be co^sydered / to be
ha^deled to be amoued or put away / and counsel to be geven.

And it is used even amongst the infidelles / that our parents next unto the
immortal God are most to be left by. Wherefore we must gyve place unto them
every where. Ande if at any time they behave not them shoes after the mind of
Christ / the which is also dures / we may not due of season strive against
them / but what soever ought to be said or done / that must be proponed or
purposed with all medenes the which thing if they will not receave / they are
rather to be forsaken than to be handeled contumelyously.

The natural Philosophers do testifie^ / that Ire dranger comes of a hot
cause / wherefore this young age is most h^re^ we must dilygently beware of it
that we do not say any thing by the compulsyon thereof / what soever comes
into the mi^de. When this after it is hoate in the / it ought to be suspected.

Sclau^der / if we cannot utterly / because of the bitterness of it / digest it
down / it must be referred unto some judge or magistrate. For why? to render
again one the eke for a^ other or to fe^d over again the sclaunder or
contumely unto him that gave it / it is no other / tha^ to be like unto him or
such one as he is whom thou do disalowe.

Games with their equalles we do per^^i^^ to have up did (...) ^och (...) of /
learni^g ande profitable (...) the exerr^^ (...) the^ body. The games of
learning (...) contend with aua^^re^ a (...) Ari^h ^h^^tike does reach / or
vyse^tyng of places the which thing the / draught^s and pauses of the chestes
and their stacions als^ and healinges in watch do declare. For that ga^^^ above
all other does teach / that noth^^^e ought to be ^one rashlye or vnaduis^dlye^
And yet in the mean time the (...) be^^ mean kept in it. For them have and
s^^ me / which / setti^g their serious business a part / have give the^ selves
to that only. We permit only these things to be done in / by times / or in
the times of leisure from other things. And the games of dice and cards (as
men call them) we count ande send them back again unto the crows / as the
Proverb says.

The body shall be exercised with run^^ leaping / coyting with the exercise of
weapons / with wrastli^g (the which is (...) seldo^ to be used / because often
times it even ^^h^ed earnest (and with so^^ pastimes ^as a^e almoost generally
in all ^a^^o^ specially (...) as have been used most amongst ^^r forefathers
the Zwytsers being very proffitable for diverse chances. I see that swi^ming
is proffitable to very few albeit sometime it is a pleasure to swi^me in the
water or ryver like unto a fish / a^ it has served so^times for chau^ces not
with out proffit. He came swi^myng out of the Capitolhouse that should declare
unto Camillos the miserable state of Auarous Rome. Ch^^lia ^owi^g with her own
propre ^^^^bres returned again unto hers.

Let all the conversation and talk also / be soche that may delight those with
whom we do live.

And if thou must needs chyde an other man / do it with so good a heart and so
drily / and let it be done so pretily and so aduysedly / that we may put away
the vice ande win the man / and join him with more hart^e or entyre love
unto us.

The study of troth must be so constau^t ande alone that always we must
p^rp^^d and consider so / both our own talk and the tale or co^municatio^ of
other / that no craft or rayning be mixed in it. And a good mind ought to be
with no^ thing more displeased with him self tha^ if he perceive any lie come
from him (...) though it be against his will. I will no^ say here how much he
ought to be a shamed if he make them him self or tell them when they are made
of others. For every man is commanded to speak the truth^^ which his
neighbor. Christ is the (...) the. Wherefore it becomes a Christian man to
^owe and keep most diligently the (...) that (...) in mind or in (...) in all
his ways. Nothing can be assuredly (...) to him that (...) this t^^ue (...) ^o
is the (...) of the (...) wherfor^ if that be vai^^ lying ande inconstant all
is a most certain token that the heart i^ worsse a great deal. Add unto
this that a lie may be for^ time hydden / but (...) for ever. Wherefore it shall
be a very folysh thing / to nourish or comfort the domes^ ^^all noughty
^achte in hope that it shall be hydden / or not known.

Look what I have said of the study of the truth the same must be observed in
all doings / that we do nothing fainedly / that our browe or eyes disse^ble no
other thing / than the heart ^ese^^ means / the which is the fountain of
all doings.

The going also that is made or forged / does give a sufficient argument / what
the man is the which does go otherwise than his nature requires / that is to
say / full of vanite / and an harlot in mind.

But what needs many words? To this purpose all study must be hasted / that
the yongman may with all pureness suck into him Christ / who) when he has
dronken or tasted of him) he shall be a rule unto him. He shall never fall from
well ^^ing^lly^ shall never be proud or extolted / he shall increase daily /
but he shall appear to him self always to decrease. He shall go forward / but
he shall accou^te him self to be lust of all men. He shall do good toward
all men / but he shall embroide nothing. For so truly Christ has done.
Wherefore he shall be absolute that shall pu^pose only to follow Christ.

These ^e the things (most ^le^a^^t Gerolde) which we have thought to be
proffytable or to conduce to bring up ingenious y^ngmen / how be it they be so
confusely taught that of it there sacketh no declaration. For why? the thing is
manyfestly open unto the eyes of all me^. But for thy part remember these
things often with thy self and look what thou sees^ here written with a rude
style / express it in thy manners. And so it shall come to pass tha^ the
things that are poured out here all most without any order / thou thy self
by thy acts / shalt bring them into a very goodly order. Ande shall be of
this form of teaching a brething hoar ^^de lively example. And to speak more
(...) stauntly / it can not other wilt be (...) after thou shall be more
absolute than we are able to express with words of ^nstau^tly thou emploie /
all thy endeavor. The which thing shall be above measure proffitable for the
expelli^g of Idelnes. Whereby some without all shame / of a mischeuous received
custom / are growe^ to such stouth / even in the very first entrau^ce of
their life / that they appear to covet to be (...) thing then dr^nes / ande
the puddles of all vices. But thou truly (as he says) must use discretly thy
ag^. For time o^ age glideth away with a swifte foot. And not so good
follows as the first wa^^. It is the part of a Christian man / not to speak
lordly of opinions / but always to do things that are hard ande great with
God. Proceed therefore (thou Gentle yongman) to increase with the ^ru^
servants of nobilite / thy kynred or stock thy goodly form and thy
patrimo^^e or in heritau^ce / the which all has fortuned honorably unto the
(I have not said well) I should have said to think only these to be the
ornaments / ande to ^nowe the other things to be the gifts of fortune. The
most greatest and mighty lord being thy guide. Who preserve the in
prosperous estate. So be it.
