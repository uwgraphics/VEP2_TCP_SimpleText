To the READER.
AS one desirous of nothing more then the public good, I here most willingly
impart unto thee (Gentle Reader) that which by my own experience I find in
regard of the benefit it affoords, worthy thy pains and observation. It has
pleased his Majesty out of his deep discerning judgment, to give my purpose
a special approbatio^ and withal to express a willingness in himself to
further so good a business as by his gracious Letters hereunto annexed most
manifestly appears. Accept therefore of these my brief directions, and
approve of them as they prove: I could have extended them to a farther
length; but Oratorie needs not where the thing it self persuades: Yet some
peradventure that have labored in the like before, will take occasion to
countenance themselves and make my brevity an argument of insufficiency,
although I hope they will consider that a Kings Picture may be as perfect in a
penny as in the largest coin.

And whatsoever has been by them published, interpreting other men's works,
according to the practice thereof in Foreign parts, where the same as yet is
generally better understood, I doubt not but future trial will verify this my
book to be every way here more correspondent to the creature whereof it
treates: and for such I commend it to each impartial understanding.

Remaining always, Thine for the public Weal: W. S

James Rex.
Right trusty and VVelbelooued we greet you well.
IT is a principal part of that Christian care which appertains to
sovereignty, to endeavor by all means possible, as well to beget as to
increase among their people the knowledge and practice of all Arts and Trades,
whereby they may be both wained from idleness and the enormities thereof, which
are infinite, and exercised in such industries and labors, as are accompained
with evident hopes, not only of preserving people from the shame and grief of
penuire, but also of raising and increasing them in wealth and abundance, The
scope which every freeborne spirit aymeth at, not in regard of himself only
and the ease which a plentiful estate brings to every one in his particular,
but also in regard of the honor of their native country, whose commendations is
no way more set forth then in the peoples actiuenes and industry. The
consideration whereof having of late occupied our mind, who always esteem
our peoples good our necessary contemplations, we have conceived as well by
the discourse of our own reason, as by information, gathered from others, that
the making of silk might as well be effected here as it is in the kingdom of
France, where the same has of late years been put in practice: For neither
is the clymate of this I Will so far distinct or different in condition from that
country, especially from the hither parts thereof, but that it is to be hoped
that those things which by industry prosper there, may by like industry used
here have like success: and many private persons who for their pleasure have
bred of those worms, have found no experience to the contrary, but that they
may be nourished and maintained here if provision were made for planting of
Mulberie trees, whose leaves are the food of the Worms. And therefore we have
thought good hereby to let you understand, that although in suffering this
invention to take place, we do show our selves somewhat an adversary to our
profit, which in the matter of our Customs for silk brought from beyond the
Seas, will receive some deminution: Nevertheless, when there is question of so
great and public utility to come to our kingdom and subjects in general,
and whereby (besides multitudes of people of both sexes and all ages) such as
in regard of impotencie are unfit for other labor, may be set on work,
comforted and relieved; We are content that our private benefit shall give way
to the public, and therefore being persuaded that no well affected Subject
will refuse to put his helping hand to such a work as can have no other private
end in us, but the desire of the welfare of our people, we have thought good
in this form only to require you (as a person of greatest authority within
that County) and from whom the generality may receive notice of our pleasure
(with more conueniencie them otherwise) to take occasion either at the quarter
Sessions, or at some other public place of meeting, to persuade and require
such as are of ability (without discending to trouble the poor, for whom we
seek to provide) to buy and distribute in that County, the number of ten
thousand Mulberie plants, which shall be delivered unto them at our City of
etc, at the rate of three farthinges the Plant; or at six shillings the
hundred, containing fiue-score plants. And because the buying of the said
Plants at this rate, may at first seem chargeable to our said subjects, (whom
we would be loath to burden) we have taken order, that in March or April
next, there shall be delivered at the said place a good quantity of
Mulberie-seedes, there to be sold to such as will buy them, By means whereof
the said plants will be delivered at a smaller rate them they can be afforded
being carried from hence: having resolved also in the mean time that there
shall be published in print a plain Instruction and direction, both for the
increasing of the said Mulberie-trees, the breeding of the Silke-worms, and
all other things needful to be understood, for the perfecting of a work
every way so commendable and profitable as well to the planter as to those that
shall use the trade; Having now made known unto you the motives as they stand,
with the publik good, wherein every man is interessed, because we know how
much the example of our own Deputie-Lieuetenants and Justices, will further
this cause, if you and other your neighbors will be content to take some good
qua^tities hereof, to distribute upon your own lands: we are content to
acknowledge thus much more in this direction of ours, that all things of this
nature tending to plantations, increase of Science, and works of industry, are
things so naturally pleasing to our own disposition, as we shall take it for
an argument of extraordinary affection toward our person, besides, the
judgment we shall make of the good dispositions in all those that shall
express in any kind their ready minds, to further the same, And shall esteem
that in furthering the same, they seek to further our honor and contentment,
who having seen in few years space past, that our Brother the French King
has since his coming to that Crown, both begun and brought to perfection the
making of Silks in his country, whereby he has won to himself honor, and
to his subjects a marvelous increase of wealth, would account it no little
happiness to us, if the same work which we begun among our people with no
less zeal to their good (then any Prince can have to the good of theirs)
might in our time produce the fruits which there it has done; whereof we
nothing doubt if ours will be found as tractable and apt to further their own
good, now the way is showed them by us their Sovereign, As these of France
have been to conform themselves to the directions of their King.

INSTRVCTIONS For the increase and planting of Mulberie Trees.
What ground is fit for the Mulberie seeds, how the same is to be ordered,
and in what sort the seeds are to be sowed therein.
THE ground which ought to be appointed for this purpose, besides the natural
goodness of it, must be reasonably well dunged, and withal so situated, as
that the heat of the sun may cherish it, and the nipping blastes of either
the North wind or the East, may not annoy it: the choice thereof thus made,
that the seeds may the better prosper, and come up after they be sown, you
shall dig it two foot deep, breaking the clods as small as may be, and
afterward you shall divide the same into several Beds of not above five foot
in breadth, so that you shall not need to endanger the plants by treading upon
them, when either you water or weed them.

The Mulberie seeds you shall lay in water for the space of xxii hours, and
after that you shall dry them again half dry, or somewhat more, that when
you sow them they may not cleave together: Thus done, you must cast them upon
the fore said beds, not altogether so thick as you use to do other garden
Seeds, and then cover them with some fine earth (past thorough a Sieve) about
half an inch thick: In dry weather you shall water them every two days at
the farthest, as likewise the Plants that shall come of them; and keep them as
clean from weeds as possibly you can.

The time in which you ought to sow them for your best advantage, is either in
March, April, or May, when frostes are either altogether past, or at the least
not so sharp, or of so long continuance, as to endanger their vpspring.

There is yet another way to sow them, and that is as follows: you shall
(being directed by a strait line) make certain furrows in the beds above
mentioned of some four fingers deep, and about a foot in distance the one
from the other: After this, you shall open the earth with your hands, on either
side of the aforesaid Furrows, some two fingers from the bottom, and where
you have so opened it, shall you sow your seeds; and then cover them half a
finger thick with the earth which before you opened.

When the Plants that are sprung up of the seeds, are to be removed, and how
they are to be planted the first time.
IN the months of September, October, November, December, March or April,
the next year after the seeds are sown, you may remove their plants, (or in
the month of January, if it be not in frostie weather) and set them in the
like beds as before, and about one foot the one from the other, but first you
must cut off their roots about 8. inches in length, and their tops about half
a foot above their roots, more or less, according to the strength of the
said plants, for the weaker they be the less tops you shall leave them. In
this sort you may suffer them to remain (weeding and watering them as need
shall require) till they be grown six foot in length above their roots,
whereunto when once they have attained, you may cut their tops, and suffer them
to spread, always having a care to take away the many branches or succors,
that may any way hinder their growth, until they be come to their full length
of six foot, as a foresaid.

When, and how the Plants are to be removed the second time, and in what
manner they are to be planted where they shall remain.
IN the Months aforesaid, (according as your plants are waxen strong,) you
may remove them either into the hedges of your fields, or into any other
grounds. If in hedges, you must set them sixeteene foot the one from the
other, if in other ground, intending to make a wood of them eighteen foot at
the least. But a month before you do remove them, you must make the holes
(wherein you purpose to set the^) about four foot in breadth, and so deep as
that their roots may be well covered, and some half a foot of loose earth
left under them, having always a special care so to place them, that they may
receive the benefit of the Sun, and not to be shadowed or ouer-spred by any
neighboring trees.

When, and how the eggs of the Silke-wormes are to be hatched, and how to
order the Worms that shall come of them.
WHen the leaves of Mulberie trees begin a little to bud forth, take the Eggs
of your Silke-wormes, and lay them in a piece of Say, or such like stuff, and
in the day time carry them in some warm place about you, in a little safe
Box, but in the night either lay them in your bed or between two warm
pillowes, until such time as the worms begin to come forth: then take a
piece of paper of the widenes of the said box, and having cut it full of small
hoales, lay in within the same upon the Eggs, and upon that again some few
Mulberie leaves, to which the Worms as they are hatched, will continually
come. These leaves with the worms upon them, you must still remove into other
boxes, laying fresh leaves as well on those that are removed as on the paper
where the Eggs are; and this is the course which must be duly kept and
observed, until such times as all the worms be come forth of their shells,
still keeping their boxes warm: as aforesaid, but no longer about you, but
until the worms begin to come forthout of which boxes you may safely take
them, when once they have past their second sickness, and feed them upon
shelues of two foot in breadth, and eighteen inches one above the other, as in
this figure following is expressed.

The said shelues are not to be place in any ground-roome, nor yet next unto
the Tyles, but in some middle room of your house which opens upon the North
and south, that you may the more conveniently give them either heat or air,
according as the time and season shall require. Besides, you must not make them
close unto the Walls but so as you may pass about them, the better to look
unto the Worms, and keep them from Rats and Mice, which otherwise might
devour them. You must observe the times of their coming forth, and keep
every one or two days hatching by themselves, that you may the better
understand their several sicknesses or sleepings, which are four in the time
of their feeding. The first commonly some twelve days after they are hatched,
and from that time at the end of every eight days, according to the weather
and their good or ill usage: during which time of every sickness, which
lasts two or three days, you must feed them but very little, as only to
relieve such of them, as shall have past their sickness before the rest, and
those that shall not fall into their sickness so soon.

The whole time that the worms do feed, is about nine weeks, whereof until
they come unto their first sickness, give them young Mulberie leaves twice
every day, but few at a time; from thence until their second sickness, twice
every day in greater quantity; and so from their second to their third
sickness, increasing the quantity of the leaves, according as you perceive the
worms to grow in strength, and clear of sickness: from the third until
their fourth sickness; you may give them leaves thrice every day and the
fourth being past, you may let them have so many as they will eat, always
having a care that you give them none, but such as are dry, and well ayred
upon a Table or cloth, before they be laid upon them, and withal gathered so
near as may be, at such times as either the sun or wind has cleared them
of the deaw that falls upon them.

For the feeding of Worms you need observe no other order then this, lay the
Mulberie leaves upon them, and every two or three days remove them, and
make clean their boxes, or shelues, unless in times of their sickness, for
then they are not to be touched: the leaves which you take from them when you
give the^ fresh to feed upon, you must lay in some convenient place, and upon
them a few new leaves, to which the worms that lay hidden in the old, will
come, and then you may pass them with the said new leaves to the rest of the
worms: And now least any thing should be omitted, which serves to perfect
the discovery of so excellent a benefit, I will advise you to be very diligent
in keeping clean their Boxes, or Shelues, as being a special means whereby
to preserve them; wherefore when you intend to do it; you shall remove them
together with the vppermoste leaves whereon they lie, unto other boxes or
shelues, for with your hands you may not touch them, till they have thoroughly
vnder-gone their third sickness, and then may you pass them gently with
clean hands, without doing them any harm: provided that the party that
comes near them smell not of garlic, onyons or the like. The first five
weeks of their age you must be very careful to keep them warm, and in time
of rain or could weather, to set in the room where they remain, a pan with
coals burning in it, now and then some Juniper, Benjamin, and such like, that
yields sweet smells. But afterward, unless in time of extraordinary cold,
give them air, and take heed of keeping them to hot, being always mindful
to store the room with herbs and flowers which are delightful and pleasing
to the smell. As the worms increase in bigness, you shall disperse them abroad
upon more boardes, or shelues, and not suffer them to lie too thick rogether,
and if you find any of them broken, or of a yellowe glistering color
inclining to sickness, cast them away least they infect the rest, and sort
such as are not sick, the greatest and strongest by themselves, for so the
lesser will prosper the better.

When, and how to make fit rooms for the Worms to work their bottomes of
silk in, and in what sort the said bottomes are to be used.
AS soon as by the clear amber colored bodies of your worms, you shall
perceive them ready to give their silk, you must (with heath made very clean,
or with the branches of Rosemarie, the stalks of Lauender, or such like) make
Arches between the foresaid shelues, according as this figure following does
direct you.

depiction of shelves on which silk worms are set to spin

Upon the branches and sprigs whereof, the worms will fasten themselves, and
make their bottoms, which in fourteen days after the worm begins to
work them, you may take away; and those which you are minded to use for the
best silk, you must either presently wind or kill the worms which are within
them, by laying the said bottoms two or three days in the Sun, or in some
Oven after the bread baked therein is taken out, and the fierceness of the
heat is alaide. The other bottoms which you intend to keep for seed, you must
lay in some convenient warm place, until the Worms come forth, which is
commonly some sixeteene or twenty days from the beginning of their work: and
as they do come forth you must put them together upon some piece of old Say,
Grogeran, the backside of old Velvet, or the like, made fast against some Wall
or hanginges in your house, according as this figure following over the leaf,
does prescribe.

the life cycle of the silk worm

There they will engender, and the Male having spent himself, falls down,
and in short time after dies, as also does the Female, when she has laid
her Eggs, Which Eggs, when you perceive them upon the Sey or Grogrean, etc.
to be of a grayish color, you may take them off gentlye with a knife, and
having put them in a piece of Sey or such like, keep them in a covered box
amongst your woollen clothes, or the like, till the year following: But not in
any moist room, for it is hurtful for them, neither where there is too much
heat; least the worms should be hatched before you can have any food for
them.

The making of a Wheel, as likewise the way to wind the said Silk from the
bottomes, can hardly be set down so plainly, as to be rightly understood:
Wherefore when time shall serve, there shall be sent into every County of
this kingdom, a Wheel ready made, and a man that shall instruct all such as
are desirous to learn the use thereof: Till when, I will commend these brief
instructions to be carefullye considered of all such as are willing either to
benefit themselves or their country, that being skilful in the Contemplation,
they may the readier, and with less error apply themselves to Action, which
painful industry, with Gods assistance, will quickly perfect.

FINIS.
