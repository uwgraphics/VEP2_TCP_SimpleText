GEORGE, by the divine providence, Bishop of London,
To all and singular Archdeacons, Deanes, and their Officials, Parsons, Vicars,
Curates, Churchwardens; and to all other Ecclesiastical Officers and Ministers
within my Diocese of London, and the several Parishes thereof, Greeting.
Whereas Letters have been lately addressed unto me, from the most Reverend
Father in God, the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury his Grace, recommending,
according unto special directions, by him received from his Majesty and the
Lords of the most Honorable Privy Council, the publication of a Discourse
written by Captain Richard Whitbourne, concerning New Foundland, and a
Collection to be thereupon made in all the several Parishes within this
Kingdom of England: And that by my self and my Officers I would give my best
furtherance thereunto. Now, forasmuch as the publication of the said Discourse
tends principally to the advancement of his Majesty's Plantation already there
begun, by inciting Adventurers thereunto, as well for the propagation of the
Gospel in that Country, as also for many great benefits that may be there
gotten to all such as will be Adventurers therein; and likewise for the
general good and enriching of the whole Kingdom, and not be any way
burdensome, or hurtful to any of his Majesty's subjects, as by the Discourse
it self, herewith sent unto you, does more at large appear; And for that his
Majesty and the Lords of the Council have so well approved the said Captains
good endeavors herein, as to recommend him in an extraordinary manner; That
toward his great travels, charge, and expense of time, with several
Commissions, and otherwise in this business; and toward the Printing and free
distributing his Books, and his several great losses received at Sea by
Pirates and otherwise, in aduenturing to further the said Plantation, and partly
discovering the good which may come thereby unto all his Majesty's subjects;
The voluntary bounties of all his Majesty's subjects should be collected to his
use and behoof, as by their Lordships Letters, and his Majesty's pleasure
thereupon signified, which is Printed in the forepart of the Book, does
appear.

These are therefore to pray and require you my Brethren of the Ministry, in
your several parish Churches and Chapels, thorowout my Diocese of London;
That within one month next after the said Captain Whitbournes Book, with
this my Letter, which I do allow to be Printed, shall be by him, his Assignee
or Assigns brought unto any of you, you signify unto your Parishioners in so
friendly and effectual manner as possibly you can, upon some Sabbath day, in
the time of Divine Service, and when no other Collection is to be made, this my
Letter, and the scope and intent of his Discourse, and seriously stir up and
exhort them to extend their bountiful liberality herein; which you the
Churchwardens are ^o collect, after the due and usual manner from seat to
seat; and such of the Parishioners as shall be then absent, to collect their
gratuities thereunto at their houses, and then jointly with the Minister
endorse the sum and place where it is collected, in letters, and not in
figures, upon these Letters, So as his good endeauours, several great losses
and expense of his time and means therein, may be friendly considered, and
speedily return the same (unto your Archdeacons Register, who is upon receipt
thereof to convey both money and Letters) unto Mr. Robert Christian, Gent. at
his house in Knight-rider*street, near the Cathedral Church of S. Paul in
London: To be redeliuered over to the foresaid Captain Whitbourne or his
lawful Assignee or Assigns.

Given at my Palace at London, the 16. of September. 1622. George London.
Any Parator or other person that shall bring this Letter with the Book unto
any Parish, is agreed withal for his pains therein beforehand, that none such
shall receive any of the money that shall be collected, as abouesaid.
