I PRAY YOU BE NOT Angry, for I will make you Merry.

Highway.

Shop at Holborne-Bridge. 1632.

A merry Dialogue between two Travelers upon the Highway, touching their
Crosses, and of the virtue of Patience.
Fabiano, and Fernunio. Fernunio. FAbian. Good morrow: How d^e you? and how
far walk you this way?


Fab. I do as you see, neither of the best, nor the worst: and am traveling
not very far; and yet some what more then a pretty walk; about some hundredth
miles or two for a breathing, to teach the dancing legs of my youth to plod
for the provision of mine old age: and since it is no better, it is well it i^
no worse: For since I have done my self more wrong, then I can make my self
amends, I must content my self with a pudding, while other may feast, that
have better fare.


Fern. Then I pray you be notangry: for Patience is a plaster for all pain,
it is the very poison of all sorrow, a preparatiue to all comfort, and the
only quieter of a troubled spirit.


Fab. Why how now? Have you been a Scholar since I saw you? Truly I desire
not to trouble your memory, with saying over your lesson without book: all
your Aduerbes and your Proverbs, will not do me a pinnes worth of pleasure.


Fern. Oh Fabian! have patience, be not Angry with your Fortune, there are
Floods as well as Ebbs: Time has his turn, and Fortune may be as great a
friend, as she has been an enemy; the Stars may one day shine as well over
your house, as your neighbors; and therefore stay your hours, you know not
when it will come; and therefore take no thought: I p^ay you be not Angry.


Fab. Well Ferna^o, to your sentences: let me tell you, that you know that I
know, that you know, and when you and I did first know one another, you know
the World was better with me, then to let me plod up and down in this manner,
and with no more company but my Dog, and my plain Cudgel: But it is no
matter, all is one, for having played wily beguily with my self. I can thank
no body for my hard bargain: for in the time of my youth (the most perilous
point of man's age) falling into such acquaintance as were finally to my
commodity, as well of the Masculine, as of the Feminine Gender, who so long
fed mine humor with folly, that I fell almost into a Consumption, before I
found the nature of the disease: at length, (though some what late, yet better
la^te, then never) remembering that my Father left me more Land then Wit, and
Nature being more mistress then Reason over my ill ruled Senses: and seeing the
world at such a pass, that I could have well wished to have been out of it:
finding my Friends scorn of me, my Foes scoff at me, some few pity me, and
few comfort me, I resolved to shakeoff my Shake-ragges, and to retire my self
unto some solitary place; where having left one Fool, to laugh at another; one
Uillaine to cut another throat, and one Honest-man to be example to a whole
Parish, I betook me to a traveling life, rather to hear then to speak how
the world went: and note the courses of the Wise, rather then to enter into the
courses of the Wicked whereof the world is so full, that a man can scarce
escape their infection: Why? If I should tell you how I have been used among
them, you would say, I had good cause to be Angry with my self, or some body
else.


Fern. And yet I say, I pray be not Angry: For if it be with your self,
Fretting will but breed Melancholy, and Melancholy bring you to such a
Sickness, that you may repent it when it is too late. And, to be Angry with
any other, if ye cannot revenge it, it is a folly: if you do, it is
uncharitably; for you must forgive. For, if I should tell you of some tricks
that were put upon me, when I was as wise as my Goose on Bedlame Green, I
should make you believe that, al-though I preach Patience to you, I should have
cause to have little acquaintance with her my self: But spite of the Devil,
I hope to go to Heaven, and though I carry more Crosses in my Heart, then in
my Purse, yet I hope (with my fellow Beggar) to be in Abraham's bosom, when a
rich Churl shall dance with Dives in a worse place: And therefore as a
friend, let me say to you, knowing what is good for you; Whatsoever fortune
befall you, I pray you be not Angry.


Fab. I must confess, it is good counsel to have Patience; for Patience is a
pretty Virtue, but that it waits upon a number of Uillanies: But let me tell
you, if a man spend all the money in his Purse upon a company of unthankful
Uillaines, and when he comes to the bottom of his Purse, and there finding
nothing, entreats with his friends (as he has held them) but for an Ordinary
or two; and scoffingly put off, cannot get a Penny among them: What can ye have
in all the rule of Patience? Only fret at the heart to hear men say, I pray
you be not Angry.


Fern. And yet let me tell you, That when Anger will not avail him, it is
better to be Patient, then Angry: for I have heard it spoken by a Wiseman, That
he who cannot be Angry, is a fool, but he that will be Angry, is more Fool:
For when I was (as you said, and I may say) in the prime of my time, I may say
in the foolish pride of youth, when all the Gold in the Parish, was Copper to
my Silver: and my Wit was beyond Reason, when I was the only Fool of the
World: Oh then (to tell you) I was overtaken in the half turn, would make one
run out of his wits, and into them again if it were possible: For say this, If
a man has a deformity in his proportion, is no Wood-cock for his ordinary
course of Wit, has Wealth enough to live by his Neighbors without borrowing,
is of Parentage with the best of the Parish, is in the way of good speed with a
Match worth the making of: and leaving all honest, wise, and good counsel,
forsakes his Fortune, and binds himself Prentice during life to an ill
favored Baggage, the worst child that her father had, whose beauty is like
the back of a sea-cole chimney, and for proportion, the true proportion of a
sea-crab, as much wit as a gray Goose, and manners as a blind Mare, and no
more wealth then the Wool on a shorn Sheep: besides, the issue of idle
drunkenness, which being grounded in all foolishness, can away with nothing
but worse then nothing: whose tougne can keep no secrets; whose heart can
think no goodness, and whose life is a world of unquietness: and spite of
his heart having taken her for better or worse, (when she cannot well be worse,
and will be no better) must hold out his life worse then ten deaths with her:
Say your self, that when a man thinks of this misery, it would fret him to
the very heart: But where is the remedy.


Fab. Oh! I pray you be not Angry: for, if a man should have a Sister whom he
loves dearly, whose beauty with virtue, were a Dowry for a Prince, her
Lineage Noble, her personage comely, her nature kind, and her government so
discreet, that by the judgment of the wise, she was a match for the worthy: to
see this blessed creature, by the cruelty of the Fates bestowed upon the
bastard son of a Beggar, whose Father was a villain, his Mother a fool, and
he a Changling: whose eyes were three foot out of his head, his nose too long
for his mouth, and his skin too wide for his face, his head like a highway
with a little heath on either side, and his beard bending to the alehouse,
from thence came the original of his little honor: and for his under
proportion, and answering to the upper parts: whose wit was only practiced in
villainy, whose heart studied but Hell, while his soul was sworn servant to
the Devil: and yet this rascal Uiper shall, only with his golden Claws,
creep into the hands (for in the heart he could never) of a pretty Wench and
carry her away into such a world of discontentments, that she could never leave
sorrowing till she had got into her grave: Would it not fret such a Brother as
had such a Sister,: or chase such a Lover as had such a Love, to see such an
overthrow of his comfort, or confusion of his kind hope.


Fern. Oh! I pray you be not Angry: For marriage and hanging some say go by
destiny: and although hanging is but a short pain, and marriage is a lingering
misery, where disagreement is a deadly life: yet since we cannot go against
the will of the higher powers, Patience is a plaster, that will in time draw a
man's heart out of his belly, except He have more wit to govern his passion.
But leaving love toys, let me tell you, that if a man finding by some old
writings in his mothers chest, that his father had title to a piece of Land,
which for want of a good purse, he durst never make challenge to it: and say
that I were the man, and I by the witness of my honest ancient neighbors,
can approve it in good conscience to be mine own in right of law; and
thereupon asking counsel, and paying for words by weight, and by my learned
council persuaded that it is mine past all plea: And thus playing with my
Nose, or rather with my purse, till all be spent: with Demurrs and tricks he
drives me to beggerie, with suing for mine own right, while he goes gay with
my money, and I starve with his words: a vengeance upon his crafty conueyance.
Would not this fret a man's soul to think on it, and cannot help it.


Fab. Now God forbid: I pray you be not Angry: for Law was ordained for the
best; and though in all professions some are to blame, yet no doubt, but some
have such consciences, that they would not be corrupted for a kingdom, but
Courts must have their fees, and Scholars must not study for nothing. But for
that I am not a good Lawyer, nor ever met with any bribes, I have nothing to
say to them, but wish the wicked their reward, while the honest may take heed
by their example: and so leaving them all to the day of their death, I will
tell you of another matter. Say, that I had a friend, at least as I take him,
and loving him so dearly, that I durst, nay I do trust him with all that I am
worth, and being to take a voyage either upon command or commodity, fearing
some ill courses to be taken for my children if I should die, knowing women
generally so sorrowful for a lost husband, that they will not tarry long for a
new: and what fathers in law be to orphants, while widows sigh and say
nothing, having (in trust to my friend) made a secret deed of gift of all my
estate unto him, the rather that my wife and children may fare the better: and
now I have escaped many dangers by sea and land, and spoiled of all that I had
with me, come home, hoping to find comfort yet at mine own house with that I
left behind me: and there no sooner entered in at the gate, but with a coy
look, and a cold welcome, I find my wife either turned out of doors, or so
basely used within, that she could well wish to be without: and then, if I take
it unkindly, be bidden mend it as I can, and so with a frown or a frumpe,
almost thrust out of doors, be constrained to go to Law for mine own living,
while my mistaken f^^end having turned Turk, ca^es for nothing but his own
commodity: and contrary to all conscience, plays with me for mine own money,
till the Lawyer and he together, have won me quite out of mine own land, and
so play me the Traitor with my trust; leave me in the misery of my fortune, to
end my unhappy days: Now can you say to this, I pray you be not angry?


Fern. Yes very well; for since you see no remedy, but God is such a God in
the world, as makes the devil work many wonders among men, is it not better
with Patience to endure a cross, then to crucify the soul with impatience:
But say that you should have a wife that you thought did love you well, when
she would stroke your beard, and never lie from your lips, and would speak
you as fair as Eve did Adam when she coosened him with an Apple; would not
abide an Oath for a bushel of gold, and be so sparing of her purse, that she
would not loose the dropping of her nose: bridle it in her countenance like a
Mare that were knapping on a Cow-thistle: would wear no ru^^s but of the small
set, though of the finest Lawne that might be gotten, and edged with a Lace of
the best fashion: would not abide no embro^erie inther apparel, yet have the
best stuff she could lay her hands (...) sparingly at dinn^^, when she had
broke her fast in the bed: and missed not a Sermon, though she pro^^ted little
by the word: This dissembling piece of flesh, making a show of lamentation, out
of the abundance of her little love, for lack of your good company, if you
were but a mile out of the Town: and if you were to take a journey, would lay
an O^ion to her eyes, to draw out the Rheum in steed of tears: and having
eaten an apple, with ^inching in a backward wind, send out a belching sigh for
sorrow of the absence of her Goose-man: and then after all these, and a world
of other tricks, to bring a man in a bad belief of her good mind: if you
returning home a night sooner then expected, and a year sooner then welcome,
should (having keys to your own doors) come in, and find in your own bed
betwixt the arms (I go no lower) of your too much beloved, the living
carcass of a lubberly rascal, or perhaps the perfumed cores of some dainty
Companion, working upon the ground of your pleasure, to plant the fruit of idle
fancy, to the horne-griefe of your poor heart, could you be pacified with, I
pray you be (...) Angry.


Fern. Indeed you put me to it, with an, If: But I hope there are no such
women, fie for shame* it were enough to make murder, but Patience being the
mean to save many a man's life, and that perhaps being her first fault, and she
upon repentance after a secret reprehension likely to turn honest, were it not
better to steal away, and have her maid to wake her, the matter cleanly
shuffled up, and she with sorrow rather to confess it in secret, and to be
sorry for it, and in shame of her fault to leave it while few know it rather
then in a fury or frenzy bring in your neighbors, raise up your house, beat
your wife, imprison the knave, bring your wife to shame, and make the world
privy to your ^u^koldry: and so she in a desperate madness, either shameless
after a little shame, or graceless, in impatience to bear her correction,
either cut her own throat, or yours, or both, and so all come to confusion,
through lack of a little charitable discretion: No, God forbid, for rather
th^n any such mischance should fall, is it not better to say, I pray you be not
angry.

For to quit your coffeehouse, say that I should (as God forbid I should)
have married an honest Woman, that has brought me many pretty children is a
good huswife in her house, careful for her children, and loving both to them
and me, and for the space of many years, with a good opinion of all her
neighbors, and good credit with all that know her, had passed some score of
years or two with me with as much contentment as a reasonable man might desire:
and to make her amends for all her kindness, I should either take a whore into
my house, or keep her as a hackney at rack and manger abroad so long, till
being led by the nose, to believe that she loves me, when I pay for the nursing
of half a dozen of bastards: of which, if I be the wicked father, my
conscience has little comfort in* and if any other (as it is most likely) be
the father or fathers, how am I beguiled to play poor noddy, to let my Purse
blood, to pay for the maintayning of another pleasure: And at the last, if
she find me^ abridge my liberality, in a venomous humor come with an out^ry
to my door, with a nest of her fellow beggars, and there with railing upon ^e
calling me old leacher, whoremonger, and I know not what, lay her brats down
before my gate, and so with gaping mouth goes her way, leaving me to my purse
only, to seek the saving of my credit, and so become a grief unto my wife, a
sorrow unto my children, and a laughing stock, to mine enemies, a by word
among my neighbors, a shame to my self, and an enemy to mine own soul: and
thus seeing my wealth wasted, my credit lost or impared, and God so displeased,
that I know not which way to turn my self: Shall I neither be Angry with the
whore for dewraying me, nor with my self to let her befoole me?


Fe^n. No, I say as I did, I pray you be not Angry, for she did but her kind,
to use her eyes to the benefit of the rest of her members: and therefore you
being a man of judgment, ought rather to be sorry for her wickedness, then to
show your own weakness, in such years to have a thought of wantonness: but
sure the flesh is weak, and the strongest may fall, better is a sorrowful
repentance, then a fretting madness: and since fretting at your own folly to
sell all the land you have, will not get you a foot of earth more then your
grave, be not at wars with your self to no purpose: cease from doing evil,
make much of your honest wife, serve God in true repentance, and the Devil
shall do you no hurt: for, is it not better to bear your cross, especially
being of your own making, then to run into further mischief by the wicked
humor of impatience? But to the purpose: say this, (to quit you with another
proposition) put the ^^se that I being (as you see) a proper man, and in the
way of good-speed with a handsome W^man, and she in state able to do for an
honest man that would love her, and make much of her, and I having intent to
deal honestly with her: and she gives me her faith and truth, and swears by
her very soul that I have her heart so fast, that no man shall have her hand
from me and I thinking that because she is old she is honest: and, because she
swears, that she said true: go about my businesses as she bids me for some
few days, and then to return to the joining up of the matter betwixt us, and
in the mean time, after that I have spent perhaps more then half my years
wages upon her in Wine and Sugar, and good cheer, and hope to come to be
merry, come and find her married to a filthy coosening knave, who by a little
more Money than I had in my Purse for the present, to bribe another rascal
like himself, who was the maker of the match, dwells in my hoped house, gives
me the bag for my Money and has my fat old sow in such a snare, that there is
no getting of her out again: when I am thus handled for my good will, with
this wicked old piece of white-leather, to put my trust in an old hogs-stie for
my habitation, and to be thrust out of doors for my labor, Shall I not be
Angry?


Fab. Oh no, in any ease: for Women have wits beyond men's reason, especially
when they are past a Child, or childbearing, more then they that are past
children. Oh I tell you it is a perilous thing to slip occasion in matters of
Love: and age is either froward or frail, and therefore you should rather have
fed her humor full ere you had left her, then to think that she would be
unprovided till you should come again to her: And therefore, I say, as you
say, I pray you be not Angry. For I will tell you, Say that I being a man
every way to content an honest woman, and having unhappily bestowed my self
upon a woman of the worst kind, which before I married her, being neither
widow, maid, nor wife, but a plain whore: and this misery of my days, being
by my folly brought to some better state then she was worthy: and seeing her
self in a glass grown fat through good fare and ease, and setting her
countenance even with the pride of her folly, beginning to think better of her
self, then half the parish besides, should chance upon a little kindness,
grow in love with my kinsman, or he with her and so they grow so great, that I
should stand like John hold my staff, while they take their pleasure: she
should sit at the upper end of the Table, and I at the neither end: she lie in
one Chamber, and I in another, and yet must not find fault with it for fear of
a stab, or a fig, or some other villainy, but with a seeming countenance bear
all, as if pudding were the only meat of the world, while one makes horns at
me, another moes at me, another calls me cuckold, another wittall, and I know
all to be true, and cannot, or dare not do withal: Do you think that flesh
and blood can bear this, and not be Angry.


Fern. Yes very well: for as you have flesh and blood, so you have wit and
reason: and when your wit and reason can consider, how her trade brings more
commodity, and with less travel then your traffic: If you be not wilful
that you will hear no body speak but your self or so scornful; that you
can endure no companion in kindness: or so covetous, that you will not spare a
penny toward the nursing of your neighbors child: or so proud, that you
scorn the gift of a friend: you will find that such a wife is worth too Milch,
cowes: and whatsoever the world says, you are, beholding to none but her: and
where others beggar their husbands, she has made you the head-man of the
parish: and then cannot you winck at a little fault that is so full of profit?
Yes I warrant you; and therefore I may well say, I pray you be not Angry?


Fab. True, it may be that some good ass that knows not how to live without
the basest trade of Beggerie, will put on any Patience, for profit: But from
such a rascal nature God deliver me. But to requite you with as good as you
bring, let me tell you: If I should serve a man of great wealth, and he have a
wenching humor, and he keeping more Maide-seruants in his house, then ever
meant to be true Uirgins, and one of these wild cattle, that for the price of
a red petticote would venture the lyning of her placket, should by a mischance
of her Masters making, fall into a two heeld Timpanie, which could by no means
be cured, without my consenting to a wicked marriage for a little money; which
I by the villainy of the Trull, which would put the trick upon me, must seem
willingly to yield unto for fear of I know not what to fall out, I know not
why: and so giving a countenance of contentment, to the confusion of my hearts
comfort, when she should be delivered of this mischief, hoping that she would
meddle no more with any such matters, begin to make a little more of her then
she was worthy: and she thereupon so lusty, that she cared not for the parish,
so long as the Constable was her friend, give entertainment to whom she list,
and use me as she list: set more horns then hairs on my head, and care not if
I were hanged for my good will. This rascal round about, without good
complexion or good condition, as ill favored as mannered, and so spoken, as
wicked: being thus void of grace, careless of all credit, and irremoueable
in her resolution, for the wicked course of her life, this (I say) hellish
piece offlesh to domineere over me, and with the countenance of her master, to
make a slave of her good man, who should be sent of errands, while she were
with her Arrants: I should fetch wine for their drinking, turn the spit to
their roast-meate, or walk their horses, while they were sadling my Fillie:
and yet all this (and I say not what else) I must bear, as though it were no
burden for a small reckoning at the weeks end, for washing a foul shirt, or
setting of my ruffs right, or seething of a calves head, or making sauce to a
tame goose, or for a nod of my Master, that makes a noddy of his servant: for
such and such like matters, to make up all matters, and swallow grief so in my
throat, that it is ready to choke me in the going down: Is it possible to do
all this, that you could do, I, and not be Angry?


Fern. Yes, very well: for profit is so pleasing, that it puts out a great many
ill thoughts that would trouble a man that has no wit, and for honesty, it is
a good thing I must confess: But, if a man be not borne rich and keep
himself so, he shall gain little by simplicity: and therefore as I said,
where Patience brings profit, I say still, bear with your fortune, and be not
Angry. But leaving to talk more of Female discontentments, let me say this:
That I being a Man of sufficiency to supply the Office of a good place, borne
of a Noble house, bred up in all courses requisite for a Gentleman, have
traveled diverse countries, seen^ much of the world by Sea and Land, and
through want of my Fathers discretion, not left so good a portion as may
maintain my reputation, without some better matter than mine own estate, and
driven for my better comfort, to put my fortune under the favor of him, whom I
know not what has made rich: and being only wise in the world has no feeling
of Gods grace, ^ut by a thousand ill practices, find the mean before his
death to look over a great deal of more ground then his grave and this
captain of the damned crew, who is haled to hell with a world of chains, the
son of a beggar, and brother to a villain, to govern over the honesty of my
heart with the commandment of evil service: or finding me not for his humor,
to frown on me like an old frying-panne: or to rate me like a Dog, because I
will not be a Devil: to be employed in more vildnesse then half a Christian
could endure to hear of: now I say, to spend my time in this misery only for
picking of a sallad, waighting at a trencher, looking on a fair house, making
courtesy to an old Relic, hold the basin to the Rheum* or hearing the
Music of a rotten Cough: and after many years patience in this purgatory,
where all the wisdom I have learned, were but to corrupt the nature of a good
wit, either for a trifle to be frowned at, and by tricks to be wrought out: or
with a livery without a badge, to seek my fortune in some other soil, to have
served long for nothing or for worse then nothing, when discontentments must be
cancelled and I for fear of a mischief, must speak all honor of dishonor,
and with a Merry go sorry sigh out my days that are no betterblessed: when I
shall see a f^ole graced, and better wits put down: honesty scorned, and
knavery in more account then commendable: and I coosening my self with an
imagination, that service was an heritage, when I found nothing but loss of
time and repentance; Have I not cause think you with all this, to be angry?


Fab. And yet I say, I pray you be not Angry: For, if ye had so much of the
grace of God, as to make you rather have the hope of preferment, then to yield
to an ill impl^yment, no doubt but eyth^r your private life will find some
secret contentment, or your patience will find s^mewhere, aduancements of your
virtues: and therefore rather be joyful o^ Gods blessing, than impatient with
your fortune, and think not amiss that I say, ^ pray you be not Angry. But to
requite you: Say that I having more money in my Purse than a wise man would
part with, but upon the better reckoning, should be persuaded to play the
Usurer, and so with little reward to make my money multiply, and by the cunning
working of a cunny-cat^hing knave, I should be brought (in hope of gain) to
take in pawn for my money some lease of a good farm, or piece of rich plate:
which being not fetched by the day of payment, would return me more than double
my money: put my money out of my hands, which I have fared full hard to get
together, and I at the glad of m^ forf^yt, hoping to gain more than a good
conscience would away withal, ^inde my lease not worth a point, by a former
deed of gift, or such a conueyance as carries all away from my fingers, and
leave me (for all my cunning) in the Law, to plead repentance to my folly: or
my plate challenged for some piece of pilfery, and I brought to trouble for I
know not what, and to get out I know not how, till I have brought my stock to
a poor state where I may see the just reward of Usury, when I look in my
purse and find nothing: Would not this make one Angry?


Fern. Not a whit: for knaves will be knaves, and fools must be bitten ere
they be wise: of which if you be none, no ^oubt but there are enough in the
world. And find all the Anger in the world will not recover a penny loss, let
me say to you, as you say to me, I pray you be not Angry. And let me tell you,
that upon a time it was my hap to have a friend (as I thought) wh^m I loved
dearly: and building upon the care of his conscience, that for a world of
wealth he would not play the Jew with me: It fell ^ut, that I having more
than a months mind to a Wench above a year old, whose worthiness every way
might command a better servant than my self, and yet it had so feign out
betwixt us, that our affections were so settled, that I thought (without death)
there could be no remove: and therefore fearing no fortune, relying so much
upon her love, loving (as I said) my imagined friend more ^ha^ a wise man
should do (for there is a measure to be kept in all thing^e made him acquainted
with my secrets touching the intent to steal away my Mistress from the place
where she had no pleasure to be kept in, ^s she had been long, like a chicken
in a coope: and to the performing of this purpose, hoping to have use of his
best help, deliver him a ring or a Jewel of some value to present unto my
love, when I know his means better than mine own to have access unto her
without suspicion: and he after a worl^ of protestations sealed with too many
oaths, to deal so faithfully, carefully, and secretly for me, as my heart
could desire; when faith there was none nor care of me, nor secrecy, but in
keeping all from me, when like a dissembling Jew, he uses my Jewel for a
mean to rob me of my better Jewel: when he presented it as from himself, and
revealing some matter of secrecy betwixt us, unpleasing to her, and nothing to
my profit, with enchanting charms winnes her affection, and borrows my Money
to cut my throat, till having carried away my Mistress, he either laugh at we,
or write me a letter of excuse to collogue with me: When I think how with
trusting a Knave, I have played the fool, in conscience say, If ever man would
fall out with himself, have I not cause to be Angry.


Fab. No: for as you ^ayd to me, knaves will be knaves: and in matters of love,
he that will not be the follower of his own cause, may hap to be overthrown
in his own suit: and to look for constancy in a woman, especially of young
years, when bribes and gifts are able to work great matters in those courses,
it is a mere folly: for, say that some are (I know not how many) as constant
as Pen^l^pe, yet let Danae take heed of a golden shower in her lap: and
therefore, I pray you be not angry. For let me tell you, to be deceived by a
friend, it is an ordinary matter: to loose a wench, it is a thousand men's
fortune: and therefore since she was so fickle to trust to think her better
lost than found: and for him, get your golden Jewels and your Money from him,
and let him walk with his wicked household stuff: and let me tell you of a
coffeehouse of mind. It was my hap, (I may say my ill hap) to cast my
affection of late upon a very proper young man of a pure complexion, neither
effeminate, nor course face^, neither of leather-sellers, nor painters company,
but a good feature and well colored: and for his countenance, neither Paul's
steeple height, nor with the fall of the tide: but carried in so good (...)
measure, as showed his wits no more out of order than his members: for his
voice, neither Treble nor Ba^e, but a good meine: and his speech neither
Rethoricall, nor Logical, nor tragical, nor Colasticall: but such (...)
neither too little, nor too much, as answering directly to every question: and
speaking nece^^arily upon good occasion wan him such commendation for his
discretion, as increasing much my affection, made me (as I thought) upon good
judgment, mak^ him a great ^ubiect to my contentment: in brief, I ^ingled him
out of company, to make him my Companion took him to my house, bestowed
bountifully upon him, let him not want any thing that was needful for him: my
table to dine at, a fair chamber for his lodging, yea and sometime made him my
bedfellow* furnished him with money, horse, apparel, books, and credit for
whatsoever he would demand, yea, and in my absence t^usted him with the
government of my whole house, till my favor bred in ^is folly that that at
the first I saw not, such a presumption of his own worthiness, as I liked
not, where controulling even my self for a trifle, himself to blame in the
self same nature for a greater matter, thinking all too little that was done
for him, and urging more than was meet for him: a^ last not able to suppress
the venom of his pride, till his heart made his head swell as big as a
Cods-head; in recompense of all my kindness, plays false with my servant
Maid, steals away my eldest daughter, robs my Cofers, troubles my conscience,
crackes my credit, befooles m^ wit and does what he may to seek the ruin of
my state; Is it possibl^ that a man could think of such a villain, and not be
Angry?


Fern. Yea very well; and I say unto you: I pray you be not Angry: For, still
knaves will be knaves; and a man had need eat a bushel of salt with a Man,
before he grow too far to trust him: for he was a worldling, and out of the
simplicity of your honesty, thinking him to be that he was not, might learn
him to trust his like, or any of all, at least with your house, your Daughter,
(if you have any) or your servants, i^ you keep any: and having Patience with
your lack of judgment, do for your Daughter, as you have cause in nature and
reason, and pray in charity ^or his Soul, what ever become of his carcass
and since (I hope) you will take this for no ill counsel, I say as I did, I
pray you be not Angry.


FINIS.
