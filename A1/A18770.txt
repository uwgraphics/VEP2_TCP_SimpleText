To the Heroical minded Gentleman, Master Humphrey King.
BY the Authors immutable decree, being his last, this book was destinate to
you, and upon your allowance, to pass for authorized. What he willed, I have
performed. Agreeing in this with the Authors opinion, That the clerest sighted
can best judge of colors. What your experience is in this divine herb, al
men do know; and acknowledge you to be The Sovereign of Tobacco, and for such
they do honor you. If I do not otherwise use those terms of skill, and
phrases in your commendation, which are commonly accustomed to be set forth,
to the worthy patrons of men's works, which the Author no doubt would have done
if he had lived: it is for want of knowledge both of art to do it, and of your
perfections, which do merit more than I can give sufficient testimony of;
only by the report that runs of your fame, I do avouch in one word that you
are Most-worthie. And for such I do recommend this rare work of a most
precious herb unto you. What may either be said for it, or surmised against
it, you know right well; and therefore I do leave all men to receive your
instruction, and you to Gods merciful protection.

A. I.

The Printer to the Reader.
GEntle Reader, this discourse of Tobacco being left in my hands by a gentleman
who in his own particular had seen great trial of the effects thereof, and
as well by private conference with men of learning, as by the reading of such
authors of credit, who have reported the strange and wonderful operations
thereof, he was moved to make known unto all men that which the most part did
doubt of, touching the use and practice thereof, as well in taking the smoke of
it with the Pipe, the leaf being dry, as in applieng the green leaf to the
cure of many sores and diseases. What he did undertake and give me in charge
(as it were by his last Will) I have put in execution, and published the same,
according to the request of the party deceased. Which I have done with more
willingness, being credibly informed by diverse of good credit, that besides
the effects reported by the author, of the taking of it with the Pipe; it has
cleared the sight in a knight of great Commaundment and Worship: and cured a
gentleman that long languished of a Consumption. I doubt not but it has many
other strange virtues which are yet unknown. But these that are already
approved, I do recommend unto thy view and use; and so do I wish thee all
happiness.

THE DESTINCT and several opinions of the late, and best Physicians that have
written of the nature of TOBACCO: Gathered together for the better assurance,
and confirmation of the diverse natures and qualities thereof.
IT is an especial note, which I have observed in all mine authors, that in
respect of curing wounds, cuts, or other harms (almost whatsoever) and in
which this herb is of virtue to heal, whilst it is yet green, that the
same natural operations in it then* the very same are to be had in it, when
it is now dried, according as the Indians of Trinidade use, in laying it in the
shadow, and where no wind or sun come to draw out the power or virtue in
exhalations.

Indeed it would seem somewhat much for any man to say, that if the drying of
it were acording to the care of them, who here with us make it their trade to
gain by, that we might attribute so much power to it, being dried after such a
manner: but surely I cannot think, but that coming from those poor people,
where covetousness has not taught the child to cut his fathers throat for
gain, or to dissemble with any for profit, we may esteem it either as good as
the green, or at least as that green which grows here in our clime, which
reason persuades us is unapt to bring fo^th the herb in her natural heat and
virtue being so hot, and our soil so cold.

Another thing I have much wondered at, wherefore diverse having discourst so
largely upon the applying it to ulcers, burninges, wounds, and such like, they
have not longer stayed upon the reports which they might make of receiving it
in pipes, as we now use, unless it be for this, (and indeed I judge it one of
the chief causes) that time and experience, which both corrects old and brings
forth new things, either had not discovered to those writers the manner of
receiving it as we now use it, or if they did use it, yet it had been so little
time in practice, as they had not seen those conclusions wrought wrought by it
which we have, and to say truth, who has long known it an usual thing in this
part of the world, to drink Tobacco? and yet who is he that ever knew it
longest and can justly say, that this or that discommoditie is come to him by
it, unless drinking it extremely, he has changed the good into a bad effect,
since every extreme virtue is a vice: and then who will either deem Tobacco
worse since he has abused it, or not judge him ill deserving so good a
benefit, that knows not how to make his profit, having so easy a means as
a moderate receipt.

And by this means I doubt not but some has both done themselves wrong,
wronged us, and done other injury, who (if they had not heard of some whom
vnrespectiue drincking had harmed) would happily have been soon drawn to use
it for their health, who now remaining feared with examples, shun it as an
inconvenience, which else they had entertained as a public good.

But here I would not that any man should think I arrogate to my self any
title of perfection in physic; far be it from my thoughts that I should
interest my self unworthily in that, which by no right I can claim: but Salua
reuere^^ia, I presume that no man will impute it as an error to me, that I should
speak generally in some respects; my experience shall not detract from their
studies, and let no man take offense, that since I speak of my self what I
have tried on my self, they may think I go about to impriuiledge their
knowledge of that respect which belongs unto them. I w^i^e not as willing to
expose myself to the rude censure of any, i^ I thought it would do any man
more wrong in particular, than it would do good to (...) general, I protest I
would not be found a man that would do wrong: who entertaines my labors is
not beholding to me, but to him that commands me to do what I have done, and
to him will I attribute all respect and merit.

But to proceed, before I come to mine authors, you shall have the opinion of a
younger Dr. who loves and has made as far trials of drinking Tobacco as any
man that is found: who doubts (says he) but having leaves of Tobacco brought
from the Indians, and purposelie dried in the shadow, where the working of the
sun nor any otherheat may draw o^t the life and power which is found in it,
seeing that that power and virtue which it grows with, retyres it self into
the leaf, and as the Parace^sians and Chimists say, is to be distilled and
fetched out by fire; who is so fond as to think, that when there is no other
means for it to turn into water, or to receive compositions, but that the
thing being as it were breathed by the fire into a man's body, should not convey
it self in a most subtle and pearcing substance, into the distinct parts of
our bodies, and not almost work the same effects in a man, which a lightening
does in a corrupt air, clensing and purifieng it from all stenches and bad
vapors? and from hence it is, that a stinking breath, proceeding not from any
great or dangerous infection, is (by drinking Tobacco fasting in the morning)
cleansed away* but it is to be ^oted, that in this case we are to receive it in
good quantity down, so that it force to cough, and either fetch the corruption
off the stomach, which engenders it, or at least wise dries it up, and so
takes away the cause.

For the headache, proceeding of any cold or wind* experienc^ has confirmed
examples enough, and our own reasons, if we wanted examples, might be
sufficiently strong to persuade us, that nothing should be more sovereign.

Who but entends to watch extraordinarily, I could wish he had but seen some
of the same effects which it has wrought in diverse that would never credit it,
till they had made trial, only drinking a pipe full at any time when we find
our selves drowsy and would wake.

Who has ever found a more soueraign remedy against coughs, rheum in the
stomach, head, and eyes? from whence it will fetch the humor in so strange
quantity, as in some is admirable.

There is a certain kind of people that speak nothing but ridles, they dwell
under the hot clime of the still yeard, they are somewhat nosie, and very rich
in diverse white and red excrements, called Alebuttons, I could wish that some
of them had the wit after a certain kind of merry assembling, called the
Drunkards round, to allay that same distemperat vapor of pure Rhenish, with a
draught or two of this Tobacco. There is a reason if they could hit on it, that
would persuade wise men, that after they have been in the land of Tanquam, a
little of this downward, (...) fetch up that same that makes them so mad in
the brains, and I doubt not but some honest remembrancer or other, will put it
into their heads that haunt those provinces, to use this receipt when they
intend good fellowship, and would hold out.

But for any direction or order of receiving it, I will not take away from men
of art so much right, as to say directly, you must use this or that course that
which I have seen most used and bringing forth best effect, is to receive it in
the morning fasting; for commonly men which use it not idely, find that at that
time it does them most ease. And I would not that any should receive it at any
time but when he finds himself not well disposed, or being well, suspects
either that he has surfaited, or something which he has in his stomach, may
make him ill.

I have found it very excellent and sovereign* being tired and weary with
iournying too far, but in this the quantety works the experiment, for as a
little causes wakefulnesse, so it being taken overmuch, as six or seven
pipes full, it will procure a most profound sleep; and I have found it taken
away that wearisomnesse in one night, which I have thought would not have left
me in many days: and this I put in excecution, to try how that was* true that
a Spaniard writes of the Indians, who reports, that after their travels and
labors, they will drink vnmeasurably of Tobacco, which (after they had
slept) took away all weariness of body, and makes them as prompt and apt to
business, as if they had been many days without doing any thing, and surely I
found it very near the truth, for the next day, I did perceive my weariness
almost utterly gone, although not quite, which perhaps might be for want of
custom, or because my sickness before was apt to make me feel that longer
than I should have done being well.

But that I may use mine opinion, which I will not confirm by any precise
comparison, I think that those writers which have so effectually written of
the nature of Tobacco, by outward applications both knew the secreat effects of
the green leaf, applying it to wounds, and of the dried leaf receiving it by
pipes: but hearing of so strange a manner of receiving it, as physic was never
guilty to the understanding of, they thought it meet to preserve in a
perpetual concealment among themselves, least being known to the world, the
inhabilitie of other herbs and devises being discovered, and this made known,
it might turn to the common detrement and hurt of their Art; for in reason,
why should any man lay open willingly, or suffer another to enter into the
secret conceits and internetie of our knowledge, when such internetie might
make it either les prised, or cause a public cause to receive a general
disesteeme for a particular occasion. And I doubt not but if an idle
Tabacconist, and a hot Physician were met without a moderator, it would prove a
hard question in their natural reasons, whether he that first devised this
secret of drinking Tobacco, being a physician himself, (as sur^ly I thing he
was) was worthy to be accounted a good or an evil person, since he (it is
likely) for his own private commodity, did make that known to many, by the
which many have received more loss of gold in general, than any of them did
receive good, to whom he did first impart it.

Well, be he what he will, or what he was, I doubt not but he did a more good
deed than he was advised of, and therefore deserves in mine opinion to be
otherwise requited than according to the quality of his deserts, which if it
may be thought infinite in respect of himself, then let not him want his due,
for it were sin that since so few men deserve well, any of them should cease to
good works, because they want that respect in which their worth may interest
them.



And thus far for drinking of Tobacco, which is more vulgarly received with
us now than ever, and although it seems that the Indians use to take this
Tobacco in other manner of pipes than we, yet I think we shall not need to
think our earthen or ^^^ier pipes more unapt than those which the Indians make
of Palm leaves and such like.

I could stand longer to persuade the world of some wonders that I have seen
effected with one draught of excellent Tobacco, but some that are as hard of
belief as he that persuaded himself a man could not break his neck with a
fall from Paul's, if he fell upon feather beds, I will omit to the opportunity
of their own experience, which I my self once trie^ upon one that would in
kindness face me down that there was no force in such an idle smoke; but of
this I could tell you a long story, and I could make you believe he was ready
to bewRAY himself, and rent his buttons, and break his points, if not for
anger, yet for some thing else that made him afraid of a worse matter.

But to conclude, I will limit no man to any prescript order of drinking
Tobacco, nor wish that any should use it, but as they find themselves cold in
their stomach, rheumaticke, or having the headache, or for diverse other such
necessary occasions, for I see not how such unmeasurable drinking should not
both harm them that drink it, and wrong others by robbing the world of so
singular a treasure as this. I could therefore wish it were a penal law, that
whosoever should abuse it by unmeasurable and needless drinking, should
forfait at the pleasure of his Excelsitude, from three times upward, so much as
he has wasted-toward the maintenance of Tobacco in the treasury, and by this
means I fear not, but we should make that our singular profit, which we now
turn to our disprofit and harm, and that we should not remain in that great
want of good Tobacco which we have done of a long time together, but that
hoarding Apothicaries might be glad to abate their prises of their mingle
mangle which forsooth they will not sell, under unreasonable rate, when there
is scarce good to be got, although that which they have be as bad at the best,
as the worst of but indi^^erent good, when good may be bought.

That which may be said more I refer to the conceit of them that hold it in her
due price, for my self in few, I think that there is nothing that harms a
man inwardly from his girdle upward* but may be taken away with a moderate use
of Tobacco, and in those parts consist the chief reasons of our health, for
the stomach and head being clear and void of evil humors, commonly the whole
body is the better.

And I will expose the censure hereof to many, who I know would prove as adverse
to me in any matter, whereof I should desire their opinon, as to their enemies*
yet let them say, that can say most to envy against it, happily some one as
wise as a woodcocke will raise his flight on his beck, and cry fie, fie, how
it stincks, smell you it not? or tell me he will hire an Irish man to
chimney-sweep my stomach, (for woodcocks are a wise kind of wild fools) but
can such fools, fellows I mean, tell any discommodity it has brought, I
speak it with an upright fear to God, I think man has not known an
excellenter preservative against the late dangerous infection, than this, and
if any one who made use of it in good order, has died of the infection, I am
truly resolved, that for that one which died, it has saved threescore, whose
esteem hereof being less than the merit it self, have preserved themselves
by extraordinarily receiving it amongst company, not for any affection or hope
they have had to fortefie themselves against so dangerous an incident, but by
mere power of the herb; how many then shall I think have been saved, who
knowing in good order to make their profitable use thereof, have served their
necessity, and saved their lives?

Now to come to the second form of receiving this herb, I have made choice
of three especial men which write most at large, namely, Charles Stephen, and
John Liebault, two Frenchmen, and Aegidius Eurartus: There is likewise
Monardes, a Spaniard, who has written very largely of it, but because he is
already translated into English, I will refer that which he has very large
to his own volume. One cause (notwithstanding) makes me to take an occasion to
leave him, and that is, for that he is a Spaniard of Civil, and yet is found
to have gathered some reasons which he has out of other Authors, and yet
reports himself to have been conversant with the Indians, from whence me
thinks he might well (...) brought confi^^^tions enough* to which he (...)
been an eye witness, to confirm that which he sees almost the great^ part of
one world to be already conf^^med.

But that you shall not need to seek far for him* that which he has, he
has it for the most part to this effect, and thus he prescribes us our order
of receiving it.

The green leaves (he says) being put into the hot embers, and applied to any
place even with the embers, are singular against all aches, opulations in the
stomach, swelling pains of the stone, the mothe^, worms gnawing in the belly
and guts, carbuncles, and all evils that come of cold causes. And in wounds
either on man or beast in the whole cour^^ of his direction he presents no
other rule but the mere infusion of the ^uic^ of Tobacco, being bruised or
stamped, and afterward the wound wrapped up in a leaf likewise somewhat bruised.
Now for our two Frenchmen, I will write that more at large which they have of
it, which thus follows.

The diversity of names given to this herb.
THis herb with the French has been most known by the name of Nicotiana:
the first occasion was, that (as the Greeks, Romans, and others, travailing to
India or other places, where they found plants, unknown cities, or lands, they
usually gave them their own names, to remain in memory to posterity that such
an one had done his common wealth that service) so Monsieur Nicot a French man,
Ambassador to the king of Portugal, sending this herb first into France
gave it his name.

Others that by tradition have noted the means from whence they received this,
have called it Queen mother herb, for that when Monsieur Nicot had sent it
commended to her, she first planted it.

Others have surnamed it of the great Prior, for that such an one receiving
this herb from Lisbone, and having first planted it in France, afterward
experienst the diverse virtues and singular natures which he found in it,
making it known to the world, how much excellent it was: the common people
finding it most used by him, and nowhere to be found but in his garden, could
give it no distinct title, but would that it should be caled his herb.

Others there want not which call it Petum Masculine, and yet far differing in
quality and effect, from that the Portugals and Spaniards have called Petum
Feminine, but howsoever or wheresoever this has received that name, it shall
suffice that we remember it to have been most known among the french, by some
one of these three names, though now perhaps use and better knowledge has made
it known unto them, as unto us, by the name of Tobacco. But to proceed.

This Monsieur Nicot, being of the council of the French king, and by him sent
of Embassage to the king of Portugal, whilst he yet was lieger there, would
make often resort to see in the records of that country, what diversity of
matter, strange accidents, or other matter of note might best fit the memory of
a man of his estate* among other he found that at such a time this Tobacco had
been sent as a present (worthy the gratefullest acceptaunce) from Florida
thither, who happily desirous to try of what truth a thing of such miracle
might be, was by a gentleman (keeper of the Records) presented with a root
thereof, which he presently planted in his garden, intending to try if the fame
of the thing were no greater than the thing it self, which soon he found, by
an adventure which happened ere he thought of it, for before himself had made
trial hereof to the particular ^se of any, it fortuned that a boy which had
long time been wearilie tormented and grieved with a dangerous infection or
sore, commonly called, Noli me tangere, had gotten some one leaf of this
herb, and thinking nothing could make his sore worse than it was, applied it
to his face, where the sore had eaten away the flesh most pitifully, and
almost rotted his nosthrils, and other parts which it wrought on, (as the
nature of such a Canker is) having thus applied the herb some few times,
report was made to the Ambassador how good effect it had wrought, hereupon
Monsieur Nicot, caused the child after he had been with him eight or ten
days, to be sent to the kings Physician to have his counsel, if he saw it
needful, or at the least to judge and see what good this Tab^cco had wrought
in so dangerous a sore. The kings Physician (yet all Phisiti^ions will not do
so) immediately refused to take the child into his hand to cure, although
happily he might have had much money for a little pain: but told the
Ambassador that the force of the disease and poison was already destroyed by
the applying of this Tobacco, and so it was indeed, for within very short time,
the patient recovered and became very sound and perfectly healed of his sore.

Afterward, that trial might be made what nature it had in working in other
kind of sores, it fortuned that the Ambassadors cook had most pitifully ^ut
his hand, with one of those great chopping knifes they use to cut or shread
meat withal, who almost despairing of help, showed unto the steward of the
house how sorely he was hurt, and how much he ^eared the danger of the blow:
the Steward forthwith counceld him to take of Tobacco, and to apply it to the
hurt, which after he had done half a dosen times, he found his hand very whole
and perfectly well, in so much that within few days the quality and nature of
this herb was very famous in the kings court, and became as much desired as
it was wondered at: and yet that a confirmation hereof might be had, A gentleman
of good accoumpt who was long time known to have had an ulcer on his leg,
for the space of two years, desired that the Ambassador would be pleased to
bestow some leaves of Tobacco on him (for he did intend after the trial of
much surgery, to see if beyond hope any help might be found in this herb for
an incurable evil) who gave him of it, and willed him to apply it (...) fir^^
(...) the green leaves, and their ^o bruise them that the juice may come
forth, and so to apply it to the place infected, which having done by the space
of nine or ten days, he was cured by this, which happily had cost his purse
largely, and might have been to his infinite pain, had he not found this
remedy, which cost but little, and redeemed health, with the smallest travail
that ever Physic found ou^.

And yet further, to a gentlewoman that had a dart rotten in her face, and was
past all cure and care of Surgery, the Ambassador caused to be applied this
herb, not presuming it were able to heal her (that had no hope left her of
better than that which she endured) but desirous to see if it were possible to
be healed with Tobacco, which neither Art nor Physic could prevail with:
hoping that at the least if it did no good, yet it could do no ill; and see,
he had not applied this a fortnight, but the gentlewoman was restored to her
health, and the sore became perfectly healed, for which so good hap, the poor
gentlewoman would often repair to the Ambassador, yielding him infinite
thanks for his happy endeavor that turned to so good end.

There was likewise a Captain, whose son had that mortal and almost
incurable desease which we call the Kings evil, (because thought to be cured
by none but the Princes themselves) he often resorted to the Ambassador,
bringing with him his son, to whom Monsieur Nicot ministered this (...),
(ordered as before) and it wa^ not long ere he as the rest was made sound and
well, without that ever any thing else was ministered unto him than Tobacco.

The fame and esteem of Tobacco being come into so great request among those
of the kings court, the Ambassador grew with great diligence and regard to
note the virtues thereof, and as it were to foretell unto himself some great
wonder of strange import, (such commonly men conceive when their hopes
exceeding ordinary bounds, affect that, that happily they find effected,
beyond the common course of conceit) and it was even about that time, when
Monsieur Nico^ having received news that the Lady Monteg^y, a german borne,
did perish, and as it were went after her death to her grave, sorely vexed with
an ulcer engendered of the perilous and hellish sore which we before spoke of,
and call Noli me tangere; and that at the same instant the Countess of Ruff
having her face perished with a dart, (the like whereof we had also before) and
she having now long time had the counsel and often aduises of the best
Physicians that France could afford, which you may think a Lady of such high
esteem would try to the highest strain ere she would die, if Physic might
save her, and that be had for any money; but when those had left her, and she
remained alone left to her last fortune, she used of this herb, and was
cured; for it was not long after that king Frances the second, as likewise the
queen mother, had received roots hereof, which came commended to them from
Lisbone, with the man^r how to use and apply it to the sick.

Other experiences hereof were made by the lord of Iarwicke gouerner of Rochel,
who in a solemn feast made open report at the queen mothers table, to M.
Nicot how he had distilled this Tobacco with an ^ther little herb or weed,
which he found in the woods, and had thereby cured one extremely pained with
the dsease called Asmaticke, the nature of which disease is, to stop the
passage of the wind, and make us breath uneasily.

This herb in form much resembles Consonde, and is of so near a likeness
and resemblance, that you would judge it to be the greater Consond.



The maine stalk of Tobacco grows upright, and big in proportion, his leaves
are velueted, and are in growth bigger and larger at the stalk than toward
the end of the leaf, resembling the plain form of any other leaf not
ragged, save that you shall have some leaves broader and larger than both your
hands, and in length as much as three hands breadth.

Some you shall have growing very high, sometimes to the height of nine or ten
foot, yea sometimes a cubit, but that fortunes according to the ordering of it
when it is sown.

The leaves sometimes grow half a foot distant the one from the other, if it
has any great height.

The flower of the Tobacco is much like the flower of Niel, sometimes yellow,
and sometimes of a carnation color, and som^times in form like a bell.

And when it casts the flower, it leaves the former proportion, and takes
the semblance of an apple, in which you may find the seeds enclosed very
small, appearing not much unlike to Iusquiasm seeds, which are yellowish: but
when they grow to be toward their full ripeness, then they appear more near
to a black. In those regions from whence we received first the knowledge
hereof, Tobacco has both flower, seed, and leaf, at one instant, but the
reason is, those countries of the Indians are better and apter to bring forth
sooner such hot herbs than a cold climate. In the nine or tenth month it
springs very much at the foot, for then is the root fastened into the ground
with a great sort of very weak strings.

Who would make experiment of the green leaf, to apply it to any ulcer, sore,
or cut, shall in brusing of it find a juice thick and slimie, but in the
smell it is indifferently well savoring, although such as have no use of the
smell would judge it strong and noisome, in taste it is somewhat biting, it is
dry in the first degree, and whosoever would have it good, should do well to
sow it in the hottest and most fertile ground, for such it requires.

The best place wherein it will most prosper and be naturally planted in our
countries, is where the sun shines most, and if it be possible against some
wall which may defend it from the North wind, which is an infinite enemy to
this herb, and withal it were convenient that no wind at all, being over
rigourous, should come near it, for the weakness of the stalk caused by the
high growth of the herb, is such, that a small wind will blow it down,
unless happily it be deeply rooted. If the weather be over dry, it will
desire much watering. Cold kills this, and therefore all means are to be used
against it.

Who would sow it, ought by the opinion of the best skild in Physic, to take
this order, first take a dosen seeds of those which you find enclosed in that
part of the seed which resembles the bell, and put them together into one
hole, about three inches deep in the ground, and the cause why you are to plant
it deep is because the seeds be very small and little, and might be choked.
If the weather be over dry, you shall do well to water it fifteen days
together. It may be sown in manner like the herb Laistich, whose seeds are
mingled with earth or sand.

It will seem long ere it appear above ground, but that will be according to
the nature of the ground, and yet even then it will be longer than many other
seeds, but immediately as soon as you see it begin to spring, you shall cover
it as much as you can conveniently, least that frosts, or cold, or tempestious
rain, nip it away, or wash it down; and after convenient time of growth, you
shall take it up by the root, cutting up the ground round about, so that there
may none of the strings of the root be broken, which to prevent, you may very
well wash away the earth with water, and then replant it again, near some wall,
within two or three foot, but if the ground be not good there, (as commonly it
may happen) then prepare with apt manuring it.

For the time of sowing it in England I agree rather with Monardes than these
two, who say it is best sowing it in the midst of April, but I would rather
hold it better to sow it in March, for the same occasion that Monardes writes,
howbeit Stephen and Liebault write that the Spaniards and Indians sow it after
harvest.

It is hot and dry in the second degree, and therefore fit undoubtedly to purge
and cleanse, by experience (they affirm) it has healed Noli me tangere, so
named because it resembles I think a cursed shrew that must not be touched when
she is angry.

It has healed the disease called the Wolf, the Canker, the kings evil, all
old sores, wounds, ^etters, broad biles, Apostumes, pricking of the fish called
Viues, (the nature of whose touch is to procure infinite bleeding even to
death) and diverse other diseases, which experience has not yet brought to
light.

These men affirm that who so has the gout, and when the extreamitie of the
pain begins, rubbeth the infected place with oil Olive, and afterward
apply warm leaves of Tobacco, shall find great ease.

Who takes the leaves and seeths them in water, and makes thereof a sirupe
with sugar, and receives of it every morning to the quantity of two ownces,
shall find how much power it has to dissolve gross humors, to ease the hard
drawing of the breath, break an old cough or fleume, and how it causes
dissolution of hard swellings in the body, if before the receipt heerof we
receive some universal purge, and then the juice of the leaves unstop the
kidney, and softneth the hardness by being only applied unto the region of
the kidny: and in case we want of the leaves, the powder mingled with any
ointment proper to such an evil, is auailable. The same means avails in
coldness of the stomach, the belly, the collique, and the inward parts,
being applied to the Nauil.

They affirm that in France a man having a sore ulcer, or impostume, caused by
the evil of naples, that we call in English the French something, was immediately
cured thereof.

It is a singular remedy against soundings, to receive the smoke as we use
with pipes; and that which is more strange than the world would credit, the
inhabitants of Florida often nourish themselves four or five days together by
the smoke, neither eating nor drinking any thing whatsoever, and this is most
certainly confirmed by that which he writes.

More than this writes Liebault, that there are which distill water of the
green leaves of Tobacco in a Limbecke of glass, which water is no less
singular in all effects, than the very juice, helping all wounds, sores, and
bruses, even restoring to men which by some adventure have lost their nails,
new ones, by washing that part with the water destilled, and afterward wrapping
them up in fine linen clothes, dipped in the water.

Some there are also who (to speak like a Chimist) do distill oil of
Tobacco, per descensum, which oil, these authors (agreing with the
Paracelsians) prefer before all other applications, either of leaves, juice,
or powder, because the quintescences and extractions drawn out of the simples,
are the subtle spirit, and have the purest virtue and faculty of the
substance from the which they are drawn.

They prescribe unto us this kind of receipt, Take of the choicest and most
substantial leaves of this Tobacco one pound, beat them in a mortar of Marble,
after take half a pound of sweet hogs grease, refind and clarified, without
salt, and this being melted, ad to it the Tobacco, and set it over a soft fire
to sees deliberatly, until such time as you find the waterish humor of the
Tobacco vapoured away, and that the mingled substances retain the form of a
perfect ointment, this reserve for a singular and medicinable good.

Another is this, Take Rosel, new wax, and turpentine, of each three ounces,
melt them together, and then add unto them a pound of Tobacco prepared as
before, mingle them together, and after with a slow fire set them to
incorporat, seething together five or six hours, until the water of the
Tobacco be clean vapoured away, after this is done, strain it through a
course linen cloth, that may be very strong: afterward take half a pound of
Venice Turpentine, and infuse it into these things beforesaid, without any
more boiling of it, but stirring it continually until it be cold, afterward
preserve these as precious ointments: touching their effects; the first of
these two is the better for sores, ulcers, carbuncles, tetters, and to
dissolve, than the second, because Tobacco has so much the more efficacy, by
how much there are fewer commixions. The second is better than the first, to
consolidate any wound, dissolve impostumes and swellings, and to appease their
rage.

Further you may make a singular Baulme, by cutting green leaves of Tobacco
and putting them into a glass well stopped, if you set it a good time in hot
water, or in the sun, or buried in Ventre equino, by the space of forty
days, and doubtless you shall find so singular a baulme as shall not be less
admirable (say mine authors) than that oil which is made by the Paracelsians
for all kind of uses that shall be desired in a herb of that nature.

AeGidius Eurartus in his discourse De herba Panacaea, writes, how a certain
woman had given her cat a very strong poison, when the poor cat was now in
that taking that she could not stand with dissinesse, and striued to void forth
the poison in vain, the woman remembering her self, found means to open her
jaws, and making a little ball of bruised Tobacco, mingled with butter, thrust
it into her mouth, and so swallowing it down, within a short time she cast up
all the poison and so was saved.

L^o (...) wills that we should gather the leaves in the month of July, and
then bruise and distill them in a double Limbecke, with two spouts of glass,
and keep this a year, for (says he) this received to the quantity of an
ounce, for the increasing of health in a sick stomach, is most effectual.

There is likewise a Salt and an Oil to be made of Tobacco, both of them more
singular and effectual for all diseases, than either the leaves, or juice, or
water, which the Paracelsians and Chimists generally agree in, because they
will that in this oil should be contained the true life and natural virtue in
greater substance and better quality than any of the other.

Iacobus Gohorius a Parisien, teaches us this manner of making of the Salt.
First (says he) calcine this Tobacco, and afterward dissolve it; pour it into
a pipkin, and let it vapor according to reason, this shall be singular for
ulcers, and such like, and this is the manner of drawing salt out of all
vegitable things, burn your herb first in the fire, (yet some use to dry it
in the shadow) but being even burnt to ashes, you have the more salt; afterward
taking a leaden vessel full of most pure clear water, infuse these ashes,
which being set to the fire, let it boil some quantity, and then pour it
into an other vessel, where receiving it in a clean cloth, let it hang a while
by the fire, that the water may dry it self clean away, and not to have any
moisture remaining, and in this cloth being so dry, shall you find that Salt.

Another manner is this, take the herb being dried, and put it into a close
pipkin, under which you shall make fire, until it be burnt into a fine white
ash, then let it boil in rain water, or distilled water, until the fourth
part be consumed, then let it stand a while, and after pour it into an other
vessel, which shall be full of pure and clear water, and that which shall go
out of the pipkin, euaporat with a slow fire into a glas-bottle, and the Salt
shall remain in the bottom.

Leonardus Fier^nantus a famous Physician of our time, writes that he took the
root and seed of Tobacco, and bruised them together, in a mortar, the leaves
waighed (says he) four pounds, afterward he went and laid them in Ventre
equin^, by the space of thirty days, and to the end that it might not
corrupt, he put in some Salt, with six ounces of Aqua vitae, then distilling
it in Balneo Mariae, even to the extraction of all the moistness, and to the
end he might the better conserve it, he added so much oil of Sulpher that it
even smelt of it, and with this composition he served his turn in sundry
occasions: those which were troubled with agues he was wont to cure hereby,
giving them but one spoonful at once, those which were wounded or otherwise
hurt, if they did either drink hereof, or bath their wounds in some quantity
of it, not without great admiration, he used to to cure.

These be the opinions that be termed Receptiores of this plant, i. that be
more received than the rest; and these I have delivered therefore, not of mine
own (otherwise than of mine own collection) but from the best Physicians that
have written latest thereof: if therefore the natures of Tobacco, and the
diverse qualities it has, be more confirmed than before, it is well, if not,
it is never the worse, I mean it shall never the more nor disable nor derogate
from it: this I say, because there be so many heads as there be bodies to bear
them, and so many wits, and so many judgments will follow; some of knowledge,
some of experience, some of fancy, some one way, some another, every man
according to his humor: well, the plant has grown, the Physician written, and
the author of this work has gathered, who wishes every one his due, the
planter, the writer, and the reader.

FINIS.
