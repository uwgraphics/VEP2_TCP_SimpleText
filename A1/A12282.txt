Monon Calon
Agato^ quoth parato
In greco
Let parrot I pray you / have lyerte to prate
For aurea lyngua greca / ought to be magnyfyed
if it were co^d perfytely / and after the rate
As lyngua latina / in scote matter occupied
But our grekis / their greek so well have applied
That they cannot say in greek / riding by the way
How hosteler / fetch my horse a botell of hay
Neither frame a silogisme / in phrisesomorum
Formaliter et greece / cum medio termino
Our grekys ye walow / in the wash ^ol argolycoru^
For though ye can tell in greek what is phormio
yet ye seek our your greek / in Capricornio
For they scrape ou^ good scripture / and set in a gall
ye go about to amend / and ye mare all
Some argue / secundum quid ad simpliciter
And yet he would be rekenyd / pro ariopagita
And some make distinctions / multipliciter
Whether ita were before non / or ^o^ before ita
Nether wise nor well lernid but like hermophradita
Set sophia aside / for every jack raker
And every mad medler must now be a maker
In achademia Parrot / dare no problem keep
For grecifari / so occupyeth the chair
That latinum far^ / may fall to rest and sleep
And silogisari / was drowned at sturbrydge fair
Tryuyals / and quatryuyals / so sore now they appayre
That Parrot the Popagay / has pytye to behold
How the rest of good lernyng / is roufled up and tro^
Albertus / de modo significandi
And Donatus / be driven out of scole
Prisians head broken / now handy ^andy
And inter didascolos / is rekened for a fool
Alexander / a gander of Menanders pole
With da ca^sales / is cast out of the gate
And da racionales / dare not show his pate.
Plautfi in his comedies / a child shall now rehearse
And medyll with Quintylyan / in his declaracyons
That pety Caton / can scantly construe a verse
With Aueto / in Greco / and such solemn salutacyo^s
Can skantly the ten^s / of his ^oniugacyons
Setting their myndys / so much of eloquens
That of their scole matters / lost is the hole sentens
Now a nutmeg / a nutmeg / cum gariop^olo
For parrot to pyke upon / his brain for to stable
Sweet synamum styckis / and pleris cum musco
In Paradyce / that place of pleasure perdurable
The progeny of parrottis / were fair and favorable
Now in valle ebron / parrot is feign to feed
C^stecrosse / and saint Nycholas / parrot be your good speed
The myrrour that I tote in / quasi diaphonum
Uel quasi speculum / in Enigmate
Elencum / or else / Emtimematicum
For logicious to look on / somewhat sophistice
Retoricyons and orators / in fresh humanyt^
Support parrot / I pray you with your suffrageornate
Of confuse tantum / avoiding the chekmate
But of that supposicyon / that called is art
Confuse distrubytyue / as Parrot has devised
Let every man / after his merit / take his part
For in this process / Parrot nothing has surmysed
No ma^ter pretended / nor nothing enterprysed
But that metaphora / alegoria with all
Shall be his protectyon / his pauys and his wall
For parot is no churlish Chowgh / nor no f^ekyd pie
Parrot is no pendugum / that men call a carlyng
Parrot is no woodecocke / nor no butterfly
Parrot is no stameryng stare / ye men call a starlyng
But Parot is my own dear heart / and my dear de^li^g
Melpomene ye fair maid / she burneshed his beke
I pray you let Parrot / have lyberte to speak
Parrot / is fair byrd for a lady
God of his goodness / him framed and wrought
When Parrot is ded / she does not putrefy
ye all thing mortal shall torn unto naught
Except man's soul / that Christ so dear bought
That never may dye / nor never dye shall
Make much of parrot / the popegay ryall
For that pereles prince / that parrot did create
He made you of nothing / by his magistye
Point well this problem / that parrot does prate
And remember among / how parrot and ye
Shall lepe from this life / as merry as we be
Pomp / pride / honor / riches and worldly lust
Parrot says plainly / shall turn all to d^st
Thus parrot does pray you
with heart most tender
To rekyn with this recule now
And it to remember

Of the death of the noble prince King Edward ye forth / per Skeltonidem
Laureatum.
MIseremini met / ye that be my freendis
This world / has formyd me down to fall
How may I endure when ye every thing endis
What creature is borne / to be eternal
Now there is no more / but pray for me all
Thus say I Edward / that late was your King
And xxiii. years tulyd / this imperyall
Some unto pleasure / and some to no lykyng
Mercy I ask / of my mysdoynge
What auaylyth bit / frendys to be my foo
Sith I can not resyst / nor amend your complaining
Quia ecce nunc in puluere dormio
I sleep now in molde / as it is natural
As earth / unto earth / has his reuerture
what ordained god / to be terestryall
without recours / to the earth of nature
who to live ever / may be sure
what is it to trust / on mutabylyte
Sith that in this world / no thing may endure
For now am I gone / that late was in prosperyte
To presume there upon / it is but a vanyte
Not certain / but as a chery fair full of w^
Reigned not I of late / in great felycyte
Et ecce nunc in puluere dormio
Where was in my life / such one as I
while lady fortune / with me had contynuaunce
Granted not she me / to hane victory
In England to rain / and to contribute France
She took me by the hand / and led me a dance
And with her sugerd lyppys / on me she smyled
But what / for her dyssemblyd countenance
I coud not beware / till I was begyled
Now from this world / she has me excyled
when I was lothyst / hens for to go
And I am in age / but as who says a child
Et ecce nunc in puluere dormio
I had enough / I held me not content
without remembrance / that I should dye
And more ever to incroche / ready was I bent
I knew not how long / I should it occupy
I made the tower strong / I wist not why
I knew not to whme / I purchasyd Te^tsall
I a mendyd Doue^ / on the mountain hye
And London I provoked / to fortify the wall
I made Notyn gam / a place royall^
Wyndsore / El^am / and many other mo
Yet at the last / I went from them all
Et ecce nunc in puluere dormio
Where is now / my conquest and victory
Where is my riches / and my royal array
where be my coursers / and my horses hye
where is my mirth / my solas / and play
As vanyte to nonght / all is wandered away
O lady Bes / long for me may ye call
For I am departed / tyldomys day
But love ye that lord / that is souerayn of all
Where be my castles / and buyldynges royal
But Wyndsore alone / now I have no mo
And of Eton / the prayers perpetual
Et ecce nunc in puluere dormio
Why should a man / be proud or presume hye
Saint Bernard / thereof nobly does trete
Seyth a man / is but a sack of stercorty
And shall return / unto wormys mete
Why / what came of Alexaunder the great
Orels of strong Sampson / who can tell
Were not worms ordained / their flesh to fre^e
And of Salamon / that was of wit the well
Absolon / profferyd his hear for to sell
Yet for all his bewte / wormys ete him also
And I but late / in honor did excel
Et Ecce nunc in puluere dormio
I have pleyd my pageyond / now am I past
Ye wot well all / I was of no great yield
This al thing concludyd / shall be at the last
when death approchyth / then lost is the field
Then sythen this world / me no longer up held
Nor naught would conserve me / here in my place
In manus tuas domine / my sprite up I yield
Humbly besechyng / the god of thy grace
O ye curtes commyns / your hertys unbrace
Benyngly now to pray for me also
For right well you know / your king I was
Et Ecce nunc in puluere dormio
Finis.
Skeleton Laureate against the Scotts.
Against the proud Scottys claterynge
That never will leave their tratlynge
Wan they the field / and lost their king
They may well say / fie on that winning
TO these fond sottes. And tratlyng Skottys
How they are blind. In their own mind
And will not know. Their over throw
At branxton more. They are so stowre
So frantyke mad. They say they had
And wan the field. With spear and shield
That is as true. As black is blew
And grene is gray. What ever they say
Iemmy is ded. And closyd in led
That was their own king. Fie on that wynnyng
At Floddon hyllys. Out bowys our byllys
Slew all the flower. Of their honor
Are not these scottys. Folys and sottys
Such boste to make. To prate and crake
To face to brace. All void of grace
So proud of heart. So overthwart
So out of frame. So void of shame
As it is enrolde. Written and told
With in this quaire. Who list repair
And there in reed. Shall find in deed
A mad reckoning. Consydrynge all thing
That the scottys may sing. Fie on the winning
When the Scotte lived.
IOly Iemmy / ye scornful Scot
Is it come unto your lot
A solemn sumner for to be
It greyth naught for your degree
Our King of England for to sygh^
Your sovereign lord / our prince of might
Ye for to send / such a Cytacyon
It shameth all your noughty nacyon
In comparyson / but king Koppynge
Unto one prince / anointed king
Ye play Hop Lobbyn of Lowdean
ye show right well / what good ye can
ye may be lord of Locryan
Christ fence you / with a fryinge pan
Of Edynge borrow / and saint Ionys town
A dieu sir sumner / cast of your crown.
When the Scot was slain.
COntynually I shall remember
The merry month of september
With the xi. day of the same
For then began / our mirth and game
So that now I have devised
And in my mind / I have comprised
Of the proud Scot / king Iemmy
To write some little tragedy
For no manner consyderacyon
Of any sorrowful Lamentacyon
But for the special consolacyon
Of all our royal englysh nacyon
Melnomone / O muse tragedy all
Unto your grace / for grace now I call
To guide my pen / and my pen to enbybe
Illumyn me / your Poet and your Sstybe
That with myrture / of Aloes and bitter gall
I may compounde / confectures for A^cordyall
To anger the Scotts / and Irysh keterynges with all
That late were discomfect / with battle mar^yall
Thalya / my Muse / for you also call I
To touch them with tauntes / of your armony
A medley to make / of mirth with sadness
The hertes of England / to comfort with gladness
And now to begin / I will me adres
To you rehersyng / the sum of my process
King Iamy / Iemmy / Iocky my Io
ye Summond our king / why did ye so
To you / nothing it did accord
To Summon our king / your soueraygne lord
A king a Sumner / it was great wonder
Know ye not sugar / and salt a sonder
your Sumner to saucy / to malapert
your harrold in arms / not yet half expert
ye thought ye did / yet valyauntly
Not worth three skyppes of a Pie
Sir skyr galyard / ye were so skyt
your will / than ran before your wit.
your lege ye laid / and your aly
your frantyck fable / not worth a fly
French king / or one or other
Regardyd ye should / your lord / your brother
Trowyd ye sir Iemy / his nobull grace
From you sir scot / would turn his lace
With guy sir scot / of Galaway
Now is your pride / fall to decay
Male vryd / was your falls intent
For to offend / your presydent
your soueraygne lord / most reverent
your lord / your brother and your regent.
In him is sygured / Melchisedec
And ye were disloyal Amalec
He is our noble Scipione
Anointed king / and ye were none
Though ye untruly / your father have slain
His title is true / in France to raygne
And ye proud scot / Dunde / Dunbar
Pardy ye were / his homager
And su^er to his parlyament
For your untruth / now arye shent
ye bare your self / some what to bold
Therefore ye lost / your copye hold
ye were bond tenent / to his estate
Lost is your game / ye art check mate
Unto the castle of Norram
I understand / to sone ye came
At Branxston more / and Floddrn hills
Our Englysh bows / our Englysh bylles
Against you gave / so sharp a shower
That of Scotland / ye lost the flower
The white lion there rampaunt of mood
He ragyd and rent out your heart blood
He the white / and ye the red
The white / there slew the red stark ded
Thus for your guerdon quyt ar ye
Thankyd be god in Trinyte
And sweet saint George our ladies knyghe
your eye is out / a dew good night
ye were stark mad to make a fray
His grace being out of the way
But by the power and might of god
For your own tail ye made a rod
ye wantyd wit / sir at a word
ye lost your spurrys / ye lost your sword
ye might have buskyd you to huutley bankys
your pride was peuysh to play such prankys
your pouerte cowde not attain
with our king royal / war to maintain
Of the king of Nauer^e / ye might take heed
Ungraciously how he does speed
In double delyng / so he did dreme
That he is king / without a Reme
And for example / he would none take
Experiens has brought you / in such a brake
your wealth / yonr joy / your sport / your play
your braggyng bost / your royal array
your beard so brym / as bore at bay
your seven systers / that Gun so gay
All have ye lost / and cast away.
Thus fortune has turned you / I dare well say
Now from a king / to a clot of clay
Out of your Robes / ye were shaked
And wretchedly ye lay / stark naked
For lack of grace / hard was your hap
The Popes cures / gave you that clap.
Of the out Isles / the rough foted Scotts
We have well eased them of the bottes
The rude rank Scotts / like dronken dranes
A^ Englysh bows / have fetched their banes
It is not syttyng / in tower and town
A Sumner / to were a kings crown
Fortune on you / therefore did frown
ye were to hye / ye at cast down
Sir sumner now / where is your crown
Cast of your crown / cast up your crown
Sir S^mner / now ye have lost your crown.

Unto diverse people that remord his rymyng against the scot Iemmy.
I Am now constrained
With words nothing feigned
This Inuectyue to make. For some peoples sake
That list for to iangyll
And waywardly to wrangyll
Against this my making
Their males thereat shaking
At it reprehendyng. And venemously stingyng
Rebukyng and remordyng
And nothing according.
Cause have they none other
But for that he was brother
Brother unnatural. Unto our king royal
Against whom he did fight
Falsely against all right
Like that untrue rebel
Falls Kayn against Abell
Who so thereat pyketh mood
The tokens are not good
To be true Englysh blood
For if they understood
His traytourly dispyght
He was a recrayed knight
A subtle sysmatyke
Right nere an heretyke
Of grace out of the state
And dyed excomunycate
And for he was a king
The more shameful rekenyng.
Of him should men report
In ernest and in sport
He skantly loves out king
That grudgeth at this thing
That cast such ouerthwartes
Percase have hollow hearts.

Per Skeleton Laureat.
Prologus Skeltonidis Laureati super ware the Hawke.
THis work devised is
For such as do a mys
And specially to control
Such as have cure of soul
That be so far abusyd
They can not be excusyd
By reason nor by law
But that they play the daw
To hawke or else to hunt
From the Auter to the funt
with cry vnreuerent
Be fore the sacrament
within the holy church bowndis
That of our faith / the grownd is
That priest that hawkys so
All grace is far him fro
He seems a sysmatyke
Or else an heretic
For faith in him is faynte
There fore to make complaynt
Of such mysaduysed
Parsons / and dysgysed
This book we have devised
Compendyously comprysed
No good priest to offend
But such dawes to amend
In hope that no man shall
Be myscontent withal
I Shall you make relacyon
By way of a postrofacyon
Under supportacyon
Of your pacyent tolleracyon
How I Skeleton Laureat
Deuysyd and also wrate
Upon a lewd Curate
A parson benyfyced
But nothing well aduysed
He shall be as now nameles
But he shall not be blameles
Nor he shall not be shameless
For sure he worught a mys
To hawke in my church of Dys
This fond frantyke fouconer
With his polutyd pawtenar
As priest vnreuerent
Straight to the sacrament
He made his hawke to fly
with hogeous showte and cry
The hy auter he strypte naked
There on he stood and craked
He shoke down all the clothys
And swear horrible oaths
Be fore the face of god
By moses and Arons rod
Or that he thens yede
His hawke should pray and feed
Upon a pegions maw
The blood ran down raw
Upon the auter stone
The hawke tyryd on a bonne
And in the holy place
She mutyd there a chase
Upon my corporas face
Such sacrificium laudis
He made with such gambawdis
Obseruate
His second hawke wexyd gery
And was with flyenge weary
She had flowyn so often
That on the rode loft
She perkyd her to rest
The Fauconer then was pressed
Came runnynge with a dow
And cried stow stow stow
But she would not bow
He then to be sure
Called her with a lure
Her me^e was very crude
She had not well endude
She was not clean ensaymed
She was not well reclaymed
But the fawconer unfeigned
Was much more febler brayned
The hawke had no list
To come to his fyst
She looked as she had the frounc^
With that he gave her a bounc^
Full upon the gorge
I will not feign nor forge
The hawke with that clap
Fell down with evil hap
The church doors were sparred
Fast boltyd and barryd
yet with a pretty gyn
I fortuned to come In
This rebel to behold
where of I him controld
But he said that he would
A gaynst my mind and will
In my church hawke still
Considerate
On saint John^ decollacyon
He hawked on this facyon
Tempore / vesperarum
S^ / non scu^dumsarum
But like a march harum
His brains were so parum
He said he would not let
His houndys for to fet
To hunte there by lyberte
In the despyte of me
And to halow there the fox
Down went my offering box
Book bell and cand ill
All that he might handyll
Cross staff / lectryne and banner
Fell down on this manner
Deliberate
with troll / cytrace and trouy
They rangyd hankyn bouy
My church all a bow^e
This fawconer then began showte
These be my gospellers
These be my pystyllers
These be my querysters
To help me to sing
My hawks to mattens ring
Is this preestly gydynge
His hawke then flew upon
The rode with mary and John^
Dealt he not like a fon
Dealt he not like a daw
Or else is this goddis law
Decrees or Decretals
Or holy Sinodals
Or else prouincyals
Thus within the walls
Of holy church to deal
Thus to ryng a peale
with his hawkys bells
Dowtles such losels
Make the church to be
In small auctoryte
A curate in special
To snappar and to fall
In to this opyn crime
To look on this were time
Uigilate
But who so that lokys
In the offycyallys bokys
There he may se and reed
That this is matter in deed
How be it maiden meed
Made them to be a greed
And so the scrybe was feed
And the Phatasay
Then durst nothing say
But let the matter slyp
And made truth to tryp
And of the spu^all law
They made but a gew gaw
And took it outen drink
And this the cause does shrynke
The church is thus abusyd
Reproched and pollutyd
Correctyon has no place
And all for lack of grace
De plorate
Look now in Exodi
And de archa domini
with regum by and by
The bybyll will not ly
How the temble was kept
How the temple was swept
where sanguis taurorum
Aut sanguis vitulorum
was offryd with in the wallys
After Ceremoniallys
when it was polutyd
Sentence was executyd
By wey of e^pyacyon
For reconcylyacyon
Diuinitate
Then much more by the rode
where Crystis precious blood
Daily offryd is
To be polutyd this
And that he wysshyd with all
That the dow^es donge down might fa^
In to my chalys at mas
when consecratyd was
The blessed sacrament
O pryeest vnreuerent
He said that he would hunt
From the Altar to the Funt.

The tunnyng of Elynour Rummyng. Per Skeleton Laureat.
TEll you I chyll
If that ye will
A while be still
Of a comely gyll
That dwele on a hill
But she is not gryll
For she is somewhat sage
And well worn in age
For her vysage
It woldt a swage
A man's courage
Her lothely lere
Is nothing clear
But ugly of chere
Droupy and drowsy
Scuruy and lowsy
Her face all bowsy
Comely crynklyd
Woundersly wrynklyd
Like a roast pigs ear
Brystled with here
Her lewd lyppes twain
They slauer men said
Like a ropy rain
A gummy glayre
She is ugly fair
Her nose somdele hoked
And camously crooked
Never stoppynge
But ever droppynge
Her skin lose and slack
Greuyned like a sack
With a crooked back
Her eyes gowndy
Are full vnsowndy
For they are blered
And she gray hered
Iawed like a Ietty
A man would have pytty
To se how she is gumbed
Fyngered and thumbed
Gently Ioynted
Gresed and anointed
Up to the knockles
The bones her huckels
Like as they were with buckels
Together made fast
Her youth is far past
Fo^ed like a plane
Legs like a crane
And yet she will iet
Like a Ioyly fet
In her furred flocket
And graye russet rocket
With symper the cocket
Her huke of Lyncole grene
It had been hers I wene
More then forty year
And so does it apere
For the grene bare thredes
Look like sere wedes
Wyddered like hay
The woll worue away
And yet I dare say
She thinks her self gaye
Upon the holy day
When she does her array
And gyrdeth in her gytes
Stytched and pranked with pletes
Her kyrtell Brystowe red
With clothes upon her head
That wey a sow of led
Wrythen in wonder wise
After the sarasyns gyse
With a whym wham
Knyt with a trym tram
Upon her brain pan
Like an Egypcyan
Lapped about
When she goes out
Her self for to show
She dryueth down the dew
With a pair of heles
As broad as two wheles
She hobles as she gose
With her blanket hose
Over the falowe
Her shone smered with talowe
Gresed upon dyrt
That baudeth her skyrt
Primus passus
And this comely dame
I under stand her name
Is Ely^our Rummynge
A^ home in her wonnynge
And as men say
She dwelt in Sothray
In a certain stead
Bysyde Lederhede
She is a tonnysh gyb
The devil and she be syh.
But to mke up my tale
She breweth noppy ale
And makes there of port sale
To trauellars / to tynkers
To sweters / to swynkers
And all good ale drynkers
That will nothing spare
But drink till they stare
And bring them self bare
With now away the mare
And let us sley care
As wise as an hare
Come who so will
To Elynoure on the hill
With fill the cup fill
And sit there by still
Erly and late
Thither comes Kate
Cysly and Sare
With their legs bare
And also their fete
Hardely full vnswete
with their h^les dagged
Their kyrtelles all to ^agged
Their smockes all to ragged
with tytters and tatters
Bring dysshes and platters
with all their might runnynge
To Elynour Rummynge
To have of her tunnynge
She leneth them on the same
And thus begins the game
Some wenches come vnlased
Some huswynes come vnbrased
with their naked pappes
That flyppes and flapp^s
It wygges and it wagges
Like tawny saffron bags
A sort of foul drabbes
All scuruy with scabbes
Some be flybytten
Some skewed as a kytten
Some with a sho clout
Bind their heddes a bout
Some have no herelace
Their locks about their face
Their tresses untrust
All full of unlust
^
Some cawry mawry
Fall vntydy tegges
Like rotten eggs
Such a ^ewde sort
To Elynour resort
From tide to tide
A bide a bide
And to you shall be told
How her al^ is sold
To mawte and to molde
Secundus passus.
Some have no money
That thither commy
For their ale to pay
That is a shreud array
Elynour swered nay
Ye shall not bear away
Mine ale for naught
By him that me bought
With hey dog hay
Have these hogs away
with get me a staff
The swyne eat my draffe
Stryke the hogs with a clubbe
They have drunk up my swyllyng tubbe
For be there never so much prese
These swyne go to the hye dese
The sow with her pigs
The bore his tail wrygges
His rumpe also he frygges
Against the hye benche
With fo / there is a stenche
Gather up thou wenche
See thou not what is fall
Take up dyrt and all
And bear out of the hall
God give it ill preuynge
Clenly as yuell cheuynge
But let us turn plain
There we left again
For as ill a patch as that
The hens ron in the mashfat
For they go to roust
Straight over the ale Ious^
And donge when it commes
In the ale tons
Than Elynour takes
The mashe bolle and shakes
The hens donge away
And skommeth it into a tray
Where as the ycest is
With her maungy fystis
And sometime she blennes
The donge of her hens
And the ale together
And says gossyp come hyder
This ale shall be thycker
And flower the more quycker
For I may tell you
I learned it of a Jew
^han I began to brewe
And I have found it true
Drink now while it is new
And ye may it broke
It shall make you look
younger than ye be
years two or three
For ye may prove it by me
Behold she said and se
How bright I am of ble
Ich am not cast away
That can my husband say
When we kys and play
In lust and in lykyng
He calls me his whytyng
His mullyng and his nytyng
His nobbes and his conny
His swetyng and his honny
With bas my pretty bonny
Thou art worth good and monny
This make I my falyre fonny
Till that he dreme and dronny
For after all our sport
Than will he rout and suort
Than swetely together wely
As two pigs in a sty.
To cease me seems best
And of this tale to rest
And for to leave this letter
Because it is no better
And because it is no swetter
We will no farther ryme
Of it / at this time
But we will turn plain
Where we left again
Tertius passus
Instead of coin and monny
Some bring her a conny
And some a pot with honny
Some a salt / and some a spone
Some their hose some their shom
Some ran a good trot
With a skellet or a pot
Some fill their pot full
Of good Lemster woll
An huswyfe of trust
Whau she is a thrust
Such a web can spyn
Her thryfte is full thyn
Some go straight thither
Be it slaty or slyder
They hold the hye way
They care not what men say
Be that as be may
Some loathe to be espyde
Some start in at the back side
Over the hedge and pale
And all for the good all
Some run till they sweet
Bring with them malte or where
And dame Elynour entrete
To byrle them of the best
Than comes an other gest
She sweted by the rode of Rest
Her lyppes are so dry
Without drink she must dye
Therefore fill it by and by
And have here a pecke of ry
Anon comes another
As dry as the other
And with her does bring
Mele / salt / or other thing
Her hernest gyrdle / her wedding ring
To pay for her scot
As comes to her lot
Some brings her husbandis hood
Because the ale is good
Another brought her his cap
To offer to the al^ tap
with flax and with towe
And some brought sour dowe
with hey and with how
Sit we down a row
And drink till we blow
And pype tyrly tyrlowe
Some laid to pledge
Their hatchet and their wedge
Their hekell and their tele
Their rock / their spynnyg whele
And some went so narrow
They laid to pledge their wharrowe
Their rybskyn and their spyndell
Their nedell and their thymbell
Here was scant thyrft
When they made such shyf^
Their thrust was so great
They asked never for mete
But drink still drink
And let the cat wynke
Let us wasshe our gommes
From the dry crommes
Quartus passus
Some for very need
Laid down a skey^e of threde
And some a skeyue of yarne
Some brought from the barn
Both Benes and Pease
Small chaffer does ease
Sometime / now and than
Another there was that ^an
With a good brass pan
Her color was full wan
She ran in all the ha^t
Unbrased and vnlast
Tawny swart and sallowe
Like a cake of tallowe
I swear by all hallowe
It was a stare to take
The devil in a brake
And than came haltyng Ione
And brought a gambone
Of bakon that was resty
But lord as she was testy
Angry as a waspy
She began to yane and gaspy
And bad Elynour go bet
And fill in good met
It was dear that was far fet
Another brought a spycke
Of a bacon flycke
Her tongue was very quycke
But she spoke some what thycke
Her fellow did sta^mer and stut
But she was a foul slut
For her mouth fomyd
And her belly groned
Ione said she / had eten a fyest
By Christ said she thou lie
I have as sweet a breath
As thou with shameful death
Tha^ Elynour said / ye calettes
I shall break your palettes
without ye now cease
And so was made the dronken peace
Than thydder came drouken Ales
And she was full of tales
Of tidings in wales
And of saint James in Gales
And of the Portyngales
with lo gossyp I wys
Thus and thus it is
There has been great war
Between Temple bar
And the cross in chepe
And there came an hepe
Of mylstones in a route
She speaks thus in her snou^
S^euelyng in her nose
As though she had the pose
Lo here is an old typpet
And ye will give me a syppet
Of your stale ale
God send you good sale
And as she was drnkynge
She fill in a wynkynge
with a barley hood
She pyst where she stood
Than began she to weep
And forth with fell on sleep
Elynonr took her up
And blessed her with a cup
Of new ale in corns
Ales found therein no thorns
But supped it up at ones
She found therein no bones
Quintus passus.
Now in comes another rabell
First one with a ladell
Another with a cradell
And with a side sadell
And there began a ^abell
A clatterynge and a babell
Of foles fylly
That had a fool wfth wylly
with ^ast you / and gup gylly
She could not lie stylly
Then came in a geuet
And swear by saint Benet
I drank not this sen^^^
A draught to my pay
Elynour I the pray
Of thine ale let us assay^
And have here apylche of graye
I were skynnes of conny
That causes I look so donny
Another than did ^yche her
And brought a pottell pycher
A tonnell / and a bottell
But she had lost the stoppell
She cut of her sho sole
And stopped there with the hol^
Among all the blommer
Another brought a skommer
A fryenge pan and a styce
Elynour made the price
For god ale each whyt
Than sterte in made kyt
That had little wit
She seemed somdele seek
And brought a penny cheke
To dame Elynour
For a draught of lycour
Than Margery my^ke ducke
Her kyrtell she did vptucke
An yuche about her kne
Her legs that ye might se
But they were sturdy and stubbed
Mighty pestels and clubbed
As fair and as white
As the foot of a kyte
She was somewhat foul
Croke necked like an oule
And yet she brought her fee^
A cautell of Essex chese
Was well a foot thycke
Full of magottes quycke
It was huge and great
And mighty strong meat
For the d^uyll to eat
It was tart and punyete
Another sort of sluttes
Some brought walnuttes
Some apples / some peers
Some brought their clyppyng sheres
Some brought this and that
Some brought I wot nere what
Some brought their husbands hat
Some podynges and lynkes
Some trypes that stynkes
But of all this thronge
One came them among
She seemed half a leche
And began to preche
Of the tewsday in the weke
When the mare does keke
Of the virtue of an unset leke
Of ^er husbands break
With the feders of a quale
She could to burde on sail
And with good ale ba^me
She could make a charm
To help with all a stytch
She seemed to be a wytch
Another brought two goslynges
That were noughty fros^yuges
She brought them in a wallet
She was a cumly callet
The goslenges were vntyde
Elynor began to chyde
They be wretchockes thou have brought
They are shyre shaking naught
Secundus passus.
Maude Ruggy / thither skypped
She was ugly hypped
And ugly thycke lypped
Like an onyon syded
Like tan ledder byded
She had her so guyded
Between the cup and the wall
That she was there with all
In to a palsy fall
With that her head shaked
And her hands quaked
Ones head would have aked
To se her naked
She drank so of the dragges
The dropsy was in her legs
Her face glystryng like glass
All foggy fat she was
She had also the gout
In all her joints about
Her breath was sour and stalt
And smelled all of ale
Such a bedfellaw
Would make one cast his craw
But yet for all that
She drank on the mash fat
There came an old rybybe
She halted of a kybe
And had broken her shyn
At the threshold coming in
And fell so wide open
That one might se her token
The devil there on be wroken
What need all this be spoken
She yelled like a calfe
Rise up on gods half
Said Elynour Rummyng
I be shrew the for thy cummy^g
And as she at her did pulck
Quake / quake / said the duck
In that lampatrams lap
With fie / cover thy shap
With sum flyp flap
God give it ill hap
Said Elynour / for sham^
Like an honest dame
Up she stert / half lame
And skantly could go
For pain and for woe
In came another dant
With a gose and a gan^
She had a wide wesant
She was nothing pleasant
Necked like an Olyfaut
It was a bullyfant
A gredy cormerant
Another brought her garlyke heddes
Another brought her bedes
Of Iet or of cole
To offer to the ale pole
Some brought a wymble
Some brought a thymble
Some brought a sylke lace
Some brought a pyncase
Some her husbands gown
Some a pyllowe of down
Some of the napery
And all this shyfte they make
For the good ale sake
Astrawe said Bele stand vttes
For we have eggs and butter
And of pygeons a pair
Than sterte forth a fie sgygge
And she brought a bore pygge
The flesh there of was rank
And her brethe strongely s^anke
Yet or she went she drank
And gat her great thank
Of Elynour for her ware
That she thither bare
To pay for her share
Now truly to my thinking
This is a solemn drinking
Septimus passus
Soft quod one hight Sybbyll
And let me with you bybyll
She sat down in the place
With a sorry fate
Whey wormed about
Garnysshed was her suout
With here and there a puscull
Like a scabbyd muscull
This ale said she is noppy
Let us syppe and soppy
And not spyll a droppy
For so mote I hoppy
It coleth well my croppy
Dame Elynour said she
Have here is for me
A clout of London pynnes
And with that she begynnes
The pot to her pluck
And drank a good luck
She swynged up a quarte
At ones for her part
Her paunche was so puffed
And so with ale stuffed
Had she not hyed a pace
She had defoyled the place
Than began the sport
Among that dronken sort
Dame Elynour said they
Lend here a cock of hey
To make all thing clean
ye wot well what we mean
But sir among all
That sat in that hall
There was a prycke me denty
Sat like a seynty
And began to paynty
As though she would faynty
She made it as koye
As a lege moy
She was not half so wise
As she was peuysshe nyse
She said never a word
But rose from the board
And called for our dame
Elynour by name
We supposed I wys
That she rose to pys
But the very ground
Was for to compound
With Elynour in the spence
To pay for her expense
I have no penny nor grote
To pay said she / god wot
For wasshyng of my throat
But my bedes of amber
Bear them to your chamber
Than Elynour did them hyde
Within her beds side
But some than sat right sad
That nothing had
There of their own
Neither gelt nor pawn
Such were there menny
That had not a penny
But when they should walk
Were feign with a chalk
To score on the balke
Or score on the tail
God give it ill hayle
For my fyngers ytche
I have written to mytche
Of this mad mummy ge
Of Elynour Rummynge
Thus ends the gest
Of this worthy fest.
Quod Skeleton Laureat.
Laureati Skeltonidis in despectu malignantium disticon.
QUamuis insanis / quamuis marcescis inanis
Inuidi cantamus / hec loca plena locis
Bien men souuient.
