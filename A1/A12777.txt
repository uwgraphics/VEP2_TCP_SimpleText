TO THE MOST MIGHTY AND MAGNIFICENT EMPRESS ELIZABETH, BY THE GRACE OF GOD
QVEENE OF ENGLAND, FRANCE AND IRELAND DEFENDER OF THE FAITH etc.

Her most humble Servant: Ed. Spenser.

The first Book of the Faerie Queen. Containing The Legend of the Knight of
the Red Cross, OR Of Holiness.
LOI the man, whose Muse whylome did mask,
As time her taught, in lowly Shephards weeds,
Am now enforst a far unfitter task,
For trumpets stern to change mine Oaten reeds:
And sing of Knights and Ladies gentle deeds,
Whose praises having slept in silence long,
Me, all too mean, the sacred Muse areeds
To blazon broad emongst her learned throng:
Fierce wars and faithful loves shall moralize my song.
Help then, O holy virgin chief of nine,
Thy weaker Nouice to perform thy will,
Lay forth out of thine everlasting scryne
The antique rolls, which there lie hidden still,
Of Faerie knights and fairest Tanaquill,
Whom that most noble Briton Prince so long
Sought through the world, and suffered so much ill,
That I must rue his undeserved wrong:
O help thou my weak wit, and sharpen my dull tongue.
And thou most dreaded impe of highest Jove,
Fair Venus son, that with thy cruel dart
At that good knight so cunningly did roue,
That glorious fire it kindled in his heart,
Lay now thy deadly Heben bow apart,
And with thy mother mylde come to mine aid:
Come both, and with you bring triumphant Murt,
In loves and gentle iollities arraid,
After his murdrous spoils and bloody rage allayd.
And with them eke, O Goddess heavenly bright,
Mirror of grace and Majesty divine,
Great Lady of the greatest Isle, whose light
Like Phoebus lamp throughout the world does shine,
Shed thy fair beams into mine feeble eyne,
And raise my thoughts too humble and too vile,
To think of that true glorious type of thine,
The argument of mine afflicted style:
The which to hear, vouchsafe, O dearest dread a while.
Canto I.
The Patron of true Holiness,
Foul Error does defeat:
Hypocrisy him to entrappe,
Does to his home entreat.
A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plain,
Ycladd in mighty arms and silver shield,
Wherein old dints of deep wounds did remain,
The cruel marks of many' a bloody field;
Yet arms till that time did he never wield:
His angry steed did chide his foming bitt,
As much disdayning to the curb to yield:
Full jolly knight he seemd, and fair did sit,
As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fit.
And on his breast a bloody Cross he bore,
The dear remembrance of his dying Lord,
For whose sweet sake that glorious badge he wore,
And dead as living ever him adored:
Upon his shield the like was also scor'd,
For sovereign hope, which in his help he had:
Right faithful true he was in deed and word,
But of his cheer did seem too solemn sad;
Yet nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad.
Upon a great adventure he was bond,
That greatest Gloriana to him gave,
That greatest Glorious Queen of Faery land,
To win him worship, and her grace to have,
Which of all earthly things he most did crave;
And ever as (...) rode his heart did earne,
To prove his puissance in battle brave
Upon his foe, and his new force to learn;
Upon his foe, a Dragon horrible and stearne.
A lovely Lady rode him fair beside,
Upon a lowly Ass more white then snow,
Yet she much whiter, but the same did hide
Under a vele, that wimpled was full low,
And over all a black stole she did throw,
As one that inly mournd: so was she sad,
And heavy sat upon her palfrey slow:
Seemed in heart some hidden care she had;
And by her in a line a milkewhite lamb she lad.
So pure and innocent, as that same lamb,
She was in life and every virtuous lore,
And by descent from Royal lynage came
Of ancient Kings and Queens, that had of yore
Their scepters stretched from East to Western shore,
And all the world in their subjection held,
Till that infernal feend with foul uproar
Forwasted all their land, and them expeld:
Whom to avenge, she had this Knight from far co^peld.
Behind her far away a Dwarf did lag,
That lasie seemd in being ever last,
Or wearied with bearing of her bag
Of needments at his back. Thus as they past,
The day with clouds was suddeine ouercast,
And angry Jove an hideous storm of rain
Did pour into his Lemans lap so fast,
That every wight to shroud it did constrain,
And this fair couple eke to shroud themselves were fain.
Enforst to seek some covert nigh at hand,
A shadie grove not far away they spide,
That promised aid the tempest to withstand:
Whose lofty trees yclad with summers pride,
Did spread so broad, that heavens light did hide,
Not perceable with power of any starr:
And all within were paths and alleies wide,
With footing worn, and leading inward far:
Fair harbor that them seems, so in they entered ar.
And forth they pass, with pleasure forward led,
Ioying to hear the birds sweet harmony,
Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred,
Seemd in their song to scorn the cruel sky.
Much can they praise the trees so straight and hy,
The sailing Pine, the Cedar proud and tall,
The vine-propp Elm, the Poplar never dry,
The builder Oak, sole king of forests all,
The Aspine good for staves, the Cypress funeral.
The Laurel, meed of mighty Conquerours
And Poets sage, the Fur that weepeth still,
The Willow worn of forlorn Paramours,
The Eugh obedient to the benders will,
The Birch for shaftes, the Sallow for the mill,
The Mirrhe sweet bleeding in the bitter wound,
The warlike Beech, the Ash for nothing ill,
The fruitful Olive, and the Platane round,
The caruer Holme, the Maple seeldom inward sound.
Led with delight, they thus beguile the way,
Until the blustering storm is ouerblowne;
When weening to return, whence they did stray,
They cannot find that path, which first was shown,
But wander too and fro in ways unknown,
Furthest from end then, when they nearest ween,
That makes the^ doubt, their wits be not their own:
So many paths, so many turnings seen,
That which of them to take, in diverse doubt they been.
At last resolving forward still to fare,
Till that some end they find or in or out,
That path they take, that beaten seemd most bare,
And like to lead the labyrinth about;
Which when by tract they hunted had throughout,
At length it brought them to a hollow cave,
Amid the thickest woods. The Champion stout
Eftsoons dismounted from his courser brave,
And to the Dwarf a while his needless spear he gave.
Be well aware, quoth then that Lady mild,
Least sudden mischief ye too rash provoke:
The danger hid, the place unknown and wild,
Breeds dreadful doubts: Often fire is without smoke,
And peril without show: therefore your hardy stroke
Sir knight withold, till further trial made.
Ah Lady (said he) shame were to revoke,
The forward footing for an hidden shade:
Virtue gives her self light, through darkness for to wade.
Yea but (quoth she) the peril of this place
I better wot then you, though now too late,
To wish you back return with foul disgrace,
Yet wisdom warnes, whilst foot is in the gate,
To stay the step, ere forced to retrate.
This is the wandering wood, this Errors den,
A monster vile, whom God and man does hate:
Therefore I read beware. Fly fly (quoth then
The fearful Dwarf:) this is no place for living men.
But full of fire and greedy hardiment,
The youthful knight could not for ought be staide,
But forth unto the darksom hole he went,
And looked in: his glistring armor made
A little glooming light, much like a shade,
By which he saw the ugly monster plain,
Half like a serpent horribly displaide,
But the other half did woman's shape retain,
Mostlothsom, filthy, foul, and full of vile disdain.
And as she lay upon the durtie ground,
Her huge long tail her den all ouerspred,
Yet was in knots and many boughtes vpwound,
Pointed with mortal sting. Of her there bred,
A thousand young ones, which she daily fed,
Sucking upon her poisnous dugs, eachone
Of sundry shapes, yet all ill favored:
Soon as that uncouth light upon them shone,
Into her mouth they crept, and sudden all were gone.
Their dam vpstart, out of her den effraide,
And rushed forth, hurling her hideous tail
About her cursed head, whose folds displaid
Were stretched now forth at length without entraile,
She looked about, and seeing one in mayle
Armed to point, sought back to turn again;
For light she hated as the deadly bale,
Ay wont in desert darkness to remain,
Where plain none might her see, nor she see any plain.
Which when the valiant Elfe perceived, he lept
As Lion fierce upon the flying pray,
And with his trenchand blade her boldly kept
From turning back, and forced her to stay:
Therewith enraged, she loudly began to bray,
And turning fierce, her speckled tail aduaunst,
Threatening her angry sting, him to dismay:
Who naught aghast, his mighty hand enhaunst:
The stroke down from her head unto her shoulder glaunst
Much daunted with that dint, her sense was dazd,
Yet kindling rage her self she gathered round,
And all attonce her beastly body raizd
With doubled forces high above the ground:
Tho wrapping up her wrethed stern arownd,
Lept fierce upon his shield, and her huge train
All suddenly about his body wound,
That hand or foot to stir he strove in vain:
God help the man so wrapped in Errors endless train.
His Lady sad to see his sore constraint,
Cride out, Now now Sir knight, show what ye be
Add faith unto your force, and be not faint:
Strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee.
That when he heard, in great perplexity,
His gall did grate for grief and high disdain,
And knitting all his force got one hand free,
Wherewith he grypther gorge with so great pain,
That soon to loose her wicked bands did her co^straine.
Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw
A flood of poison horrible and black,
Full of great lumps of flesh and gobbets raw,
Which stunck so (...), that it forced him slack,'
His grasping hold, and (...) her turn him back:
Her vomit full of books and papers was,
With loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lack,
And creeping sought way in the weedy gras:
Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has.
As when old father Nilus gins to swell
With timely pride above the Egyptian vale,
His fattie waves do fertile slime outwell,
And ouerflow each plain and lowly dale:
But when his later ebb gins t'auale,
Huge heaps of mudd he leaves, wherein there breed
Ten thousand kinds of creatures partly male
And partly femall of his fruitful seed;
Such ugly monstrous shapes elswher may no man reed.
The same so sore annoyed has the knight,
That welnigh choked with the deadly stink,
His forces fail, ne can no longer fight.
Whose courage when the feend pereeiud to shrink,
She poured forth out of her hellish sink
Her fruitful cursed spawne of serpents small,
Deformed monsters, foul, and black as ink,
Which swarming all about his legs did crall,
And him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all.
As gentle Shepherd in sweet euentide,
When ruddy Phoebus gins to welke in west,
High on an hill, his flock to vewen wide,
Marks which do byte their hasty supper best,
A cloud of cumbrous gnattes do him molest,
All striving to infixe their feeble stinges,
That from their noyance he no where can rest,
But with his clownish hands their tender wings,
He brusheth often, and often does mar their murmurings.
Thus ill bestedd, and fearful more of shame,
Then of the certain peril he stood in,
Half furious unto his foe he came,
Resolud in mind all suddenly to win,
Or soon to lose, before he once would lin;
And stroke at her with more then manly force,
That from her body full of filthy sin
He raft her hateful head without remorse;
A stream of cole black blood forth gushed from her corse
Her scattred brood, soon as their Parent dear
They saw so rudely falling to the ground,
Groaning full deadly, all with troublous fear,
Gathred themselves about her body round,
Weening their wonted entrance to have found
At her wide mouth: but being there withstood
They flocked all about her bleeding wound,
And sucked up their dying mothers blood,
Making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good.
That detestable sight him much amazde,
To see th'vnkindly Impes of heaven accursed,
Devour their dam; on whom while so he gazd,
Having all satisfide their bloody thurst,
Their bellies swollen he saw with fullness burst,
And bowels gushing forth: well worthy end
Of such as drunk her life, the which them nursed;
Now needs him no longer labor spend,
His foes have slain themselves, with whom he should contend.
His Lady seeing all, that chaunst, from far
Approcht in have to greet his victory,
And said, Fair knight, borne under happy star,
Who see your vanquished foes before you lie:
Well worthy be you of that Armory,
Wherein ye have great glory won this day,
And proou'd your strength on a strong enemy,
Your first adventure: many such I pray,
And henceforth ever wish, that like succeed it may.
Then mounted he upon his Steed again,
And with the Lady backward sought to wend;
That path he kept, which beaten was most plain,
Ne ever would to any byway bend,
But still did follow one unto the end,
The which at last out of the wood them brought.
So forward on his way (with God to friend)
He passed forth, and new adventure sought,
Long way he traueiled, before he heard of ought.
At length they chaunst to meet upon the way
An aged Sire, in long black weeds yclad,
His feet all bare, his beard all hoarie gray,
And by his belt his book he hanging had;
Sober he seemde, and very sagely sad,
And to the ground his eyes were lowly bent,
Simple in show, and void of malice bad,
And all the way he prayed as he went,
And often knocked his breast, as one that did repent.
He fair the knight saluted, louting low,
Who fair him quited, as that courteous was:
And after asked him, if he did know
Of strange adventures, which abroad did pas.
Ah my dear Son (quoth he) how should, alas,
Silly old man, that lives in hidden cell,
Bidding his beads all day for his trespass,
Tidings of war and worldly trouble tell?
With holy father sits not with such things to mell.
But if of danger which hereby does dwell,
And homebred devil ye desire to hear,
Of a strange man I can you tidings tell,
That wastes all this country far and near.
Of such (said he) I chiefly do inquere,
And shall thee well reward to show the place,
In which that wicked wight his days does wear:
For to all knighthood it is foul disgrace,
That such a cursed creature lives so long a space.
Far hence (quoth he) in wastfull wilderness
His dwelling is, by which no living wight
May ever pass, but thorough great distress.
Now (said the Lady) draws toward night,
And well I wot, that of your later fight,
Ye all forwearied be: for what so strong,
But wanting rest will also want of might?
The Sun that measures heaven all day long,
At night does bait his steedes the Ocean waves among.
Then with the Sun take Sir, your timely rest,
And with new day new work at once begin:
Untroubled night they say gives counsel best.
Right well Sir knight ye have advised bin,
Quoth then that aged man; the way to win
Is wisely to advise: now day is spent;
Therefore with me ye may take up your In
For this same night. The knight was well content:
So with that godly father to his home they went.
A little lowly Hermitage it was,
Down in a dale, hard by a forests side,
Far from resort of people, that did pas
In traueill to and (...): a little wide
There was an holy chapel edify de,
Wherein the Hermit dewly wont to say
His holy things each morn and euentyde:
Thereby a crystal stream did gently play,
Which from a sacred fountain welled forth always.
Arrived there the little house they fill,
Ne look for entertainment, where none was.
Rest is their feast, and all things at their will;
The noblest mind the best contentment has.
With fair discourse the evening so they pas:
For that old man of pleasing words had store,
And well could file his tongue as smooth as glass,
He told of Saints and Popes, and evermore
He strowd an Aue-Mary after and before.
The drouping Night thus creeps on them fast,
And the sad humor loading their eye liddes,
As messenger of Morpheus on them cast
Sweet slo^bring deaw, the which to sleep them biddes:
Unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes:
Where when all drowned in deadly sleep he finds,
He to his study goes, and there amiddes
His magic books and arts of sundry kinds,
He seeks out mighty charms, to trouble sleepy minds.
Then choosing out few words most horrible,
(Let none them read) thereof did verses frame,
With which and other spelles like terrible,
He bad awake black Plutoes griesly Dame,
And cursed heaven, and spoke reprochful shame
Of highest God, the Lord of life and light,
A bold bad man, that dared to call by name
Great Gorgon, prince of darkness and dead night,
At which Cocytus quakes and Styx is put to flight.
And forth he called out of deep darkness dredd
Legions of Sprights, the which like little flies
Fluttring about his euerdamned hedd,
A wait whereto their service he applies,
To aid his friends, or fray his enemies:
Of those he chose out two, the falsest two,
And fittest for to forge true-seeming lies;
The one of them he gave a message too,
The other by himself staide other work to do.
He making speedy way through spersed air,
And through the world of waters wide and deep,
To Morpheus house does hastily repair.
Amid the bowels of the earth full steep,
And low, where dawning day does never peep,
His dwelling is; there Tethys his wet bed
Does ever wash, and Cynthia still does steep
In silver deaw his ever drouping head,
Whiles sad Night over him her ma^tle black does spread.
Whose double gates he finds locked fast,
The one fair framed of burnisht Yuory,
The other all with silver ouercast;
And wakeful dogs before them far doelye,
Watching to banish Care their enemy,
Who often is wont to trouble gentle Sleep.
By them the Sprite does pass in quietly,
And unto Morpheus comes, whom drowned deep
In drowsy fit he finds: of nothing he takes keep.
And more, to lulle him in his slumber soft,
A trickling stream from high rock tumbling down
And every drizling rain upon the loft,
Mixed with a murmuring wind, much like the sown
Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne:
No other noise, nor peoples troublous cries,
As still are wont t'annoy the walled town,
Might there be heard: but careless Quiet lies,
Wrapped in eternal silence far from enimyes.
The Messenger approaching to him spoke,
But his waste words retournd to him in vain:
So sound he slept, that naught might him awake.
Then rudely he him thrust, and pusht with pain,
Whereat he began to stretch: but he again
Shook him so hard, that forced him to speak.
As one then in a dream, whose dryer brain
Is tossed with troubled sighs and fancies weak,
He mumbled soft, but would not all his silence break.
The Sprite then began more boldly him to wake,
And threatened unto him the dreaded name
Of Hecate: whereat he began to quake,
And lifting up his lompish head, with blame
Half angry asked him, for what he came.
Hither (quoth he) me Archimago sent,
He that the stubborn Sprites can wisely tame,
He bids thee to him send for his intent
A fit false dream, that can delude the sleepers sent.
The God obayde, and calling forth straight way
A diverse dream out of his prison dark,
Delivered it to him, and down did lay
His heavy head, deuoide of careful carke,
Whose senses all were straight benumbd and stark.
He back returning by the Yuorie door,
Remounted up as light as cheerful Lark,
And on his little wings the dream he bore,
In have unto his Lord, where he him left before.
Who all this while with charms and hidden arts,
Had made a Lady of that other Spright,
And framed of liquid air her tender parts
So lively and so like in all men's sight,
That weaker sense it could have ravished quight:
The maker self for all his wondrous wit,
Was nigh beguiled with so goodly sight:
Her all in white he clad, and over it
Cast a blackstole, most like to seem for Vna fit.
Now when that idle dream was to him brought,
Unto that Elfin knight he bad him fly,
Where he slept soundly void of evil thought,
And with false shows abuse his fantasy,
In sort as he him schooled privily:
And that new creature borne without her dew,
Full of the makers guyle with usage sly
He taught to imitate that Lady true,
Whose semblance she did carry under feigned hew.
Thus well instructed, to their work they haste,
And coming where the knight in slomber lay,
The one upon his hardy head him plaste,
And made him dream of loves and lustful play,
That nigh his manly heart did melt away,
Bathed in wanton blis and wicked joy:
Then seemed him his Lady by him lay,
And to him playnd, how that false winged boy,
Her chaste heart had subdewd, to learn Dame pleasures toy.
And she her self of beauty sovereign Queen,
Fair Venus seem de unto his bed to bring
Her, whom he waking evermore did ween,
To be the chastest flower, that aye did spring
On earthly branch, the daughter of a king,
Now a loose Leman to vile service bound:
And eke the Graces seemed all to sing,
Hymen 1/10 Hymen, dancing all around,
Whylst freshest Flora her with Yuie girlond crowned.
In this great passion of unwonted lust,
Or wonted fear of doing ought amiss,
He starteth up, as seeming to mistrust,
Some secret ill, or hidden foe of his:
Lo there before his face his Lady is,
Under black stole hyding her bayted hook,
And as half blushing offered him to kis,
With gentle blandishment and lovely look,
Most like that virgin true, which for her knight him took
All clean dismayed to see so uncouth sight,
And half enraged at her shameless guise,
He thought have slain her in his fierce despite,
But hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise,
He stayde his hand, and began himself advise
To prove his sense, and tempt her feigned truth.
Wringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise,
Tho can she weep, to stir up gentle ruth,
Both for her noble blood, and for her tender youth.
And said, Ah Sir, my liege Lord and my love,
Shall I accuse the hidden cruel fate,
And mighty causes wrought in heaven above,
Or the blind God, that does me thus amate,
For hoped love to win me certain hate?
Yet thus perforce he bids me do, or die.
Die is my dew: yet rue my wretched state
You, whom my hard auenging destiny
Has made judge of my life or death indifferently.
Your own dear sake forced me at first to leave
My Fathers kingdom, There she stopped with tears;
Her swollen heart her speech seemd to bereave,
And then again begone, My weaker years
Captived to fortune and frail worldly fears
Fly to your faith for succor and sure aid:
Let me not die in languor and long tears.
Why Dame (quoth he) what has ye thus dismayed?
What frayes ye, that were wont to comfort me affrayd?
Love of your self, she said, and dear constraint
Lets me not sleep, but waste the weary night
In secret anguish and vnpittied plaint,
Whiles you in careless sleep are drowned quight.
Her doubtful words made that redoubted knight
Suspect her truth: yet since no'vntruth he knew,
Her fawning love with foul disdainefull spite
He would not shend, but said, Dear dame I rue,
That for my sake unknown such grief unto you grew.
Assure your self, it fell not all to ground;
For all so dear as life is to my heart,
I deem your love, and hold me to you bound;
Nelet vain fears procure your needless smart,
Where cause is none, but to your rest depart.
Not all content, yet seemd she to appease
Her mournful plaintes, beguiled of her art,
And (...) with words, that could not chose but please,
So slyding softly forth, she turned as to her ease.
Long after lay he musing at her mood,
Much grieved to think that gentle Dame so light,
For whose defense he was to shed his blood.
At last dull wearines of former fight
Having yrockt a sleep his irksome spright,
That troublous dream began freshly toss his brain,
With bowres, and beds, and ladies dear delight:
But when he saw his labor all was vain,
With that misformed spright he back returned again.
Cant. II.
The guilefull great Enchaunter parts.
The Redcrosse Knight from Truth:
Into whose steps fair falsehood steps,
And works him woeful ruth.
BY this the Northern wagoner had set
His seuenfold teme behind the steadfast star,
That was in Ocean waves yet never wet,
Bur firm is fixed, and sends light from far
To al, that in the wide deep wandering arre:
And cheerful Chaunticlere with his note shrill
Had warned once, that Phoebus fiery carre,
In have was climbing up the Eastern hill,
Full envious that night so long his room did fill.
When those accursed messengers of hell,
That feigning dream, and that faire-forged Spright
Came to their wicked master, and began tell
Their bootelesse pains, and ill succeeding night:
Who all in rage to see his skillful might
Deluded so, began threaten hellish pain
And sad Proserpines wrath, them to affright.
But when he saw his threatening was but vain,
He cast about, and searched his baleful books again.
Eftsoons he took that miscreated fair,
And that false other Spright, on whom he spread
A seeming body of the subtle air,
Like a young Squire, in loves and lusty head
His wanton days that ever loosely led,
Without regard of arms and dreaded fight:
Those two he took, and in a secret bed,
Covered with darkness and misdeeming night,
Them both together laid, to joy in vain delight.
Forthwith he runs with feigned faithful have
Unto his guest, who after troublous sights
And dreams began now to take more sound repast,
Whom suddenly he wakes with fearful frights,
As one aghast with feends or damned sprights,
And to him calls, Rise rise unhappy Swain,
That here wex old in (...), whiles wicked wights
Have knit themselves in Venus shameful chain;
Come see, where your false Lady does her honor stain.
All in amaze he suddenly up start
With sword in hand, and with the old man went;
Who soon him brought into a secret part,
Where that false couple were full closely meant
In wanton lust and lewd enbracement:
Which when he saw, he burnt with gealous fire,
The eye of reason was with rage yblent,
And would have slain them in his furious ire,
But hardly was restreined of that aged sire.
Retourning to his bed in torment great,
And bitter anguish of his guilty sight,
He could not rest, but did his stout heart eat,
And wast his inward gall with deep despite,
Yrkesome of life, and too long lingering night.
At last fair Hesperus in highest sky
Had spent his la^pe, and brought forth dawning light,
Then up he rose, and clad him hastily;
The dwarf him brought his steed: so both away do fly.
Now when the rosy fingred Morning fair,
Weary of aged Tithones saffron bed,
Had spread her purple robe through deawy air,
And the high hills Titan discovered,
The royal virgin shook of drousy head,
And rising forth out of her baser bower,
Looked for her knight, who far away was fled,
And for her dwarf, that wont to wait each hour;
Then began she wail and weep, to see that woeful stowre.
And after him she rode with so much speed,
As her slow beast could make; but all in vain:
For him so far had borne his light-foot steed,
Pricked with wrath and fiery fierce disdain,
That him to follow was but fruitless pain;
Yet she her weary limbs would never rest,
But every hill and dale, each wood and plain
Did search, sore grieved in her gentle breast,
He so ungently left her, whom she loved best.
But subtle Archimago when his guests
He saw divided into double parts,
And Vna wandering in woods and forests,
The End of his drift, he praisd his devilish arts,
That had such might over true meaning hearts:
Yet rests not so, but other means does make,
How he may work unto her further smarts:
For her he hated as the hissing snake,
And in her many troubles did most pleasure take.
He then deuisde himself how to disguise;
For by his mighty science he could take
As many forms and shapes in seeming wise,
As ever Proteus to himself could make:
Sometime a foul, sometime a fish in lake,
Now like a fox, now like a dragon fell,
That of himself he often for fear would quake,
And often would fly away. O who can tell
The hidden power of herbs, and might of Magic spel?
But now seemde best, the person to put on
Of that good knight, his late beguiled guest:
In mighty arms he was yclad anon:
And silver shield, upon his coward breast
A bloody cross, and on his crauen crest
A bounch of hears discolourd diversely:
Full jolly knight he seemde, and well addressed,
And when he sat upon his courser free,
Saint George himself ye would have deemed him to be.
But he the knight, whose semblaunt he did bear,
The true Saint George was wandered far away,
Still flying from his thoughts and gealous fear;
Will was his guide, and grief led him astray.
At last him chaunst to meet upon the way
A faithless Sarazin all armde to point,
In whose great shield was writ with letters gay
Sans foy: full large of limb and every joint
He was, and cared not for God or man a point.
He had a fair companion of his way,
A goodly Lady clad in scarlotred,
Purfled with gold and pearl of rich assay,
And like a Persian mitre on her head
She wore, with crowns and owches garnished,
The which her lavish lovers to her gave,
Her wanton palfrey all was ouerspred
With tinsell trappings, wouen like a wave,
Whose bridle rung with golden bells and bosses brave.
With fair disport and courting dalliaunce
She intertainde her lover all the way:
But when she saw the knight his spear advance,
She soon left of her mirth and wanton play,
And bad her knight address him to the fray:
His foe was nigh at hand. He prickte with pride
And hope to win his Ladies heart that day.
Forth spurred fast: adowne his coursers side
The red blood trickling staind the way, as he did ride.
The knight of the Redcrosse when him he spide,
Spurring so hot with rage dispiteous,
Began fairly couch his spear, and toward ride:
Soon meet they both, both fell and furious,
That daunted with their forces hideous,
Theit steeds do stagger, and amazed stand,
And eke themselves too rudely rigorous,
Astonished with the stroke of their own hand,
Do back rebutte, and each to other yealdeth land.
As when two rams stird with ambitious pride,
Fight for the rule of the rich fleeced flock,
Their horned fronts so fierce on either side,
Do meet, that with the terror of the shocke.
Astonished both, stands fencelesse as a block.
Forgetful of the hanging victory:
So stood these twain, unmoved as a rock,
Both staring fierce, and holding idely,
The broken relics of their former cruelty.
The Sarazin sore daunted with the buffe
Snatcheth his sword, and fiercely to him flies;
Who well it wards, and quyteth cuff with cuff:
Each others equal puissaunce enuies,
And through their iron sides with cruelties
Does seek to perce: repining courage yields
No foot to foe. The flashing fire flies
As from a forge out of their burning shields,
And streams of purple blood new dies the verda^t fields.
Curse on that Cross (quoth. then the Sarazin)
That keeps thy body from the bitter fit;
Dead long ygoe I wot thou had bin,
Had not that charm from thee forwarned itt:
But yet I warn thee now assured sit,
And hide thy head. Therewith upon his crest
With rigorso outrageous he smitt,
That a large share it hewd out of the rest,
And glauncing down his shield, from blame him fairly blessed.
Who thereat wondrous wroth, the sleeping spark
Of native virtue began eftsoons revive,
And at his haughty helmet making mark,
So hugely stroke, that it the steel did riue,
And cleft his head. He tumbling down alive,
With bloody mouth his mother earth did kis,
Greeting his grave: his grudging ghost did strive
With the frail flesh; at last it flitted is,
Whether the souls do fly of men, that live amiss.
The Lady when she saw her champion fall,
Like the old ruins of a broken tower,
Staid not to wail his woeful funeral,
But from him fled away with all her power;
Who after her as hastily began scowre,
Bidding the dwarf with him to bring away
The Sarazins shield, sign of the conqueroure,
Her soon he ouertooke, and bad to stay,
For present cause was none of dread her to dismay.
She turning back with ruefull countenance,
Cride, Mercy mercy Sir vouchsafe to show
On silly Dame, subject to hard mischaunce,
And to your mighty will. Her humblesse low
In so rich weeds and seeming glorious show,
Did much emmoue his stout heroicke heart,
And said, Dear dame, your suddein overthrow
Much rueth me; but now put fear apart,
And tell, both who ye be, and who that took your part.
Melting in tears, then began she thus lament;
The wreched woman, whom unhappy hour
Has now made thrall to your commandment,
Before that angry heavens list to lowre,
And fortune false betraide me to thy power,
Was, (O what now avails that I was?)
Borne the sole daughter of an Emperor,
He that the wide West under his rule has,
And high has set his throne, where Tiberis does pas.
He in the first flower of my freshest age,
Betrothed me unto the only hair
Of a most mighty king, most rich and sage;
Was never Prince so faithful and so fair,
Was never Prince so meek and debonaire;
But ere my hoped day of spousall shone,
My dearest Lord fell from high honors staire,
Into the hands of his accursed fone,
And cruelly was slain, that shall I ever moan.
His blessed body spoild of lively breath,
Was afterward, I know not how, conuaid
And fro me hid: of whose most innocent death
When tidings came to me unhappy maid,
O how great sorrow my sad soulea ssaid.
Then forth I went his woeful corse to find,
And many years throughout the world I straid,
A virgin widow, whose deep wounded mind
With love, long time did languish as the stricken hind.
At last it chanced this proud Sarazin,
To meet me wandering, who perforce me led
With him away, but yet could never win
The Fort, that Ladies hold in sovereign dread.
There lies he now with foul dishonor dead,
Who whiles he liude, was called proud Sans foy,
The eldest of three brethren, all three bred
Of one bad sire, whose youngest is Sansioy,
And twixt them both was born the bloody bold Sansloy.
In this sad plight, friendlesse, unfortunate,
Now miserable I Fidessa dwell,
Craving of you in pity of my state,
To do none ill, if please ye not do well.
He in great passion all this while did dwell,
More busying his quick eyes, her face to view,
Then his dull ears, to hear what she did tell,
And said, fair Lady heart of flint would rue
The undeserved woes and sorrows, which ye show.
Henceforth in safe assurance may ye rest,
Having both found a new friend you to aid,
And lost an old foe, that did you molest:
Better new friend then an old foe is said.
With change of cheer the seeming simple maid
Let fall her eien, as shamefast to the earth,
And yielding soft, in that she naught gain said,
So forth they rode, he feining seemly merth,
And she coy looks: so dainty they say makes derth.
Long time they thus together traueiled,
Til weary of their way, they came at last,
Where grew two goodly trees, that fair did spread
Their arms abroad, with gray moss ouercast,
And their green leaves trembling with every blast,
Made a calm shadow far in compass round:
The fearful Shepherd often there aghast
Under them never sat, ne wont there sound
His merry oaten pipe, but shund th'vnlucky ground.
But this good knight soon as he them can spy,
For the cool shade him thither hastly got:
For golden Phoebus now that mounted hie,
From fiery wheels of his fair chariot
Hurled his beam so scorching cruel hot,
That living creature mote it not abide;
And his new Lady it endured not.
There they alight, in hope themselves to hide
From the fierce heat, and rest their weary limbs a tide,
Fair seemly pleasaunce each to other makes,
With goodly purposes there as they sit:
And in his falsed fancy he her takes
To be the fairest wight, that lived yet;
Which to express, he bends his gentle wit,
And thinking of those branches green to frame
A girlond for her dainty forehead fit,
He plucked a bough; out of whose rifte there came
Small drops of gory blood, that trickled down the same.
Therewith a piteous yelling voice was heard,
Crying, O spare with guilty hands to tear
My tender sides in this rough rynd embard,
But fly, ah fly far hence away, for fear
Least to you hap, that happened to me hear,
And to this wretched Lady, my dear love,
O too dear love, love bought with death too dear.
Astond he stood, and up his hear did houe,
And with that suddein horror could no member move.
At last whenas the dreadful passion
Was ouerpast, and manhood well awake,
Yet musing at the strange occasion,
And doubting much his sense, he thus bespake;
What voice of damned Ghost from Limbo lake,
Or guilefull spright wandering in empty air,
Both which frail men do oftentimes mistake,
Sends to my doubtful ears these speeches rare,
And tuefull plants, me bidding guiltless blood to spare?
Then groaning deep, Nor damned Ghost, (quoth. he,)
Nor guileful sprite to thee these words does speak,
But once a man Fradubio, now a tree,
Wretched man, wretched tree; whose nature weak
A cruel witch her cursed will to wreake,
Has thus transformd, and plast in open plains,
Where Boreas does blow full bitter bleake,
And scorching Sun does dry my secret veins:
For though a tree I seem, yet cold and heat me pains.
Say on Fradubio then, or man, or tree,
Quoth. then the knight, by whose mischievous arts
Art thou misshaped thus, as now I see?
He often finds medicine, who his grief imparts;
But double griefs afflict concealing hearts,
As raging flames who strives to suppress.
The author then (said he) of all my smarts,
Is one Duessa a false sorceresse,
That many erra^t knights has brought to wretchedness.
In prime of youthly years, when courage hott
The fire of love and joy of cheualree
First kindled in my breast, it was my lot
To love this gentle Lady, whom ye see,
Now not a Lady, but a seeming tree;
With whom as once I rode accompanyde,
Me chanced of a knight encountered be,
That had a like fair Lady by his side,
Like a fair Lady, but did foul Duessa hyde.
Whose forged beauty he did take in hand,
All other Dames to have exceded far;
I in defense of mine did likewise stand,
Mine, that did then shine as the Morning star:
So both to batteill fierce arraunged arre,
In which his harder fortune was to fall
Under my spear: such is the dye of war:
His Lady left as a prise martial,
Did yield her comely person, to be at my call.
So doubly loved of ladies unlike fair,
The One seeming such, the other such indeed,
One day in doubt I cast for to compare,
Whether in beauties glory did exceed;
A Rosy girlond was the victors meede:
Both seemde to win, and both seemde won to be,
So hard the discord was to be agreede.
Fralissa was as fair, as fair mote be,
And euerfalse Duessa seemde as fair as she.
The wicked witch now seeing all this while
The doubtful ballaunce equally to sway,
What not by right, she cast to win by guile,
And by her hellish science raisd straight way
A foggy mist, that ouercast the day,
And a dull blast, that breathing on her face,
Dimmed her former beauties shining ray,
And with foul ugly form did her disgrace:
Then was she fair alone, when none was fair in place.
Then cride she out, fie, fie, deformed wight,
Whose borrowed beauty now appears plain
To have before bewitched all men's sight;
O leave her soon, or let her soon be slain.
Her loathly visage viewing with disdain,
Eftsoons I thought her such, as she me told,
And would have killed her; but with feigned pain,
The false witch did my wrathful hand withold:
So left her, where she now is turned to treen mould.
Then forth I took Duessa for my Dame,
And in the witch vnweeting ioyd long time,
Ne ever wist, but that she was the same,
Till on a day (that day is every Prime,
When Witches wont do penance for their crime)
I chaunst to see her in her proper hew,
Bathing her self in origane and thyme:
A filthy foul old woman I did view,
That ever to have touched her, I did deadly rue.
Her nether parts misshapen, monstrous,
Were hidd in water, that I could not see,
But they did seem more foul and hideous,
Then woman's shape man would believe to be.
Then forth from her most beastly company
I began refrain, in mind to slipp away,
Soon as appeard safe opportunity:
For danger great, if not assurd decay
I saw before mine eyes, if I were known to stray.
The devilish hag by chaunges of my cheer
(...) my thought; and drowned in (...) night,
With wicked herbs and ointments did besmeare
My body all, through charms and magic might,
That all my senses were bereaved quight:
Then brought she me into this desert waste,
And by my wretched lovers side me pight,
Where now enclosd in wooden walls full fast,
Banished from living wights, our weary days we waste.
But how long time, said then the (...) knight,
Are you in this misformed house to dwell?
We may not change (quoth he) this evil plight,
Till we be bathed in a living well;
That is the term prescribed by the spell.
O how, sayd'he, mote I that well out find,
That may restore you to your wonted well?
Time and suffised fates to former kind
Shall us restore, none else from hence may us vnbynd.
The false Duessa, now Fidessa hight,
Heard how in vain Fradubio did lament,
And knew well all was true, But the good knight
Full of sad fear and ghastly dreriment,
When all this speech the living tree had spent,
The bleeding bough did thrust into the ground,
That from the blood he might be innocent,
And with fresh clay did close the wooden wound:
Then turning to his Lady, dead with fear her fownd.
Her seeming dead he fownd with feigned fear,
As all vnweeting of that well she knew,
And paynd himself with busy care to rear
Her out of careless swowne. Her eylids blew
And dimmed fight with pale and deadly hew
At last she up began lift: with trembling cheer
Her up he took, too simple and too true,
And often her kissed. At length all passed fear,
He set her on her steed, and forward forth did bear.
Cant. III.
Forsaken Truth long seeks her love,
And makes the Lion mylde,
Marres blind Devotions mart, and falls
In hand of leachour vylde.
Naught is there under heavens wide hollownesse,
That moves more dear compassion of mind,
Then beauty brought t'vnworthie wretchedness
Through enuies snares or fortunes freakes unkind:
I, whether lately through her brightne blind,
Or through allegiance and fast fealty,
Which I do owe unto all womankynd,
Feel my heart perst with so great agony,
When such I see, that all for pity I could die.
And now it is empassioned so deep,
For fairest Vnaes sake, of whom I sing,
That my frail eyes these lines with tears do steep,
To think how she through guylefull handeling
Though true as touch, though daughter of a king,
Though fair as ever living wight was fair,
Though nor in word nor deed ill meriting,
Is from her knight divorced in despair
And her dew loves deryu'd to that vile witches shayre.
Yet she most faithful Lady all this while
Forsaken, woeful, solitary maid
Far from all peoples preace, as in exile,
In wilderness and wastfull deserts strayd,
To seek her knight; who subtily betrayed
Through that late vision, which th'Enchaunter wrought
Had her abandond. She of naught affrayd,
Through woods and wastnes wide him daily sought;
Yet wished tydinges none of him unto her brought.
One day nigh weary of the yrkesome way,
From her vnhastie beast she did alight,
And on the grass her dainty limbs did lay
In secret shadow, far from all men's sight:
From her fair head her fillet she vndight,
And laid her stole aside. Her angels face
As the great eye of heaven shyned bright,
And made a sunshine in the shady place;
Did never mortal eye behold such heavenly grace.
It fortuned out of the thickest wood
A ramping Lion rushed suddeinly,
Hunting full greedy after saluage blood;
Soon as the royal virgin he did spy,
With gaping mouth at her ran greedily,
To have attonce deuourd her tender corse:
But to the pray when as he drew more ny,
His bloody rage aswaged with remorse,
And with the sight amazd, forgot his furious forse.
In stead thereof he kissed her weary feet,
And lickt her lilly hands with fawning tongue,
As he her wronged innocence did weet.
O how can beauty master the most strong,
And simple truth subdue auenging wrong?
Whose yielded pride and proud submission,
Still dreading death, when she had marked long,
Her heart began melt in great compassion,
And drizling tears did shed for pure affection.
The Lion Lord of every beast in field
Quoth she, his princely puissance does abate,
And mighty proud to humble weak does yield,
Forgetful of the hungry rage, which late
Him pricked, in pit tie of my sad estate:
But he my Lion, and my noble Lord
How does he find in cruel heart to hate
Her that him loved, and ever most adord,
As the God of my life? why has he me abhord?
Redounding tears did choke the end of her plaint,
Which softly ecchoed from the neighbor wood;
And sad to see her sorrowful constraint
The kingly beast upon her gazing stood;
With pity calmd, down fell his angry mood.
At last in close heart shutting up her pain,
Arose the virgin borne of heavenly brood,
And to her snowy Palfrey got again,
To seek her strayed Champion, if she might attain.
The Lion would not leave her desolate,
But with her went along, as a strong guard
Of her chaste person, and a faithful mate
Of her sad troubles and misfortunes hard:
Still when she slept, he kept both watch and ward,
And when she wakt, he waited diligent,
With humble service to her will prepared:
From her fair eyes he took commandment,
And ever by her looks conceived herintent.
Long (...) thus (...) through (...) wide,
By which she thought her wandering knight should pas,
Yet never show of living wight (...);
Till that at length she found the trodden (...),
In which the tract of peoples footing was,
Under the steep foot of a mountain hoar;
The same she follows, till at last she has
A damzell spyde slow footing her before,
That on her shoulders sad a (...) of water bore.
To whom approaching she to her began call,
To weet, if dwelling place were nigh at hand;
But the rude wench her answered naught at all,
She could not hear, nor speak, nor understand;
Till seeing by her side the Lion (...),
With suddeine fear her pitcher down she threw,
And fled away: for never in that land
Face of fair Lady she before did view,
And that dredd Lions look her cast in deadly hew.
Full fast she fled, ne ever looked behynd,
As if her life upon the wager lay,
And home she came, whereas her mother blind
Sat in eternal night: naught could she say,
But (...) catching hold did her dismay
With quaking hands, and other signs of fear:
Who full of ghastly fright and cold affray,
Began shut the door. By this (...) there
Dame Vna, weary Dame, and entrance did requere.
Which when none yielded, her unruly Page
With his rude claws the wicket open rent,
And let her in; where of his cruel rage
Nigh dead with fear, and faint astonishment,
She found them both in darkefome corner pent;
Where that old woman day and night did pray
Upon her beads devoutly penitent;
Nine hundred Pater nosters every day,
And thrice nine hundred Aues she was wont to say.
And to augment her painful penance more,
Thrice every week in (...) she did sit,
And next her wrinkled (...) rough sackecloth wore,
And thrice three times did fast from any bitt:
But now for fear her beads she did forgett.
Whose needelesse dread for to remove away,
Fair Vna framed words and count'naunce fit:
Which hardly (...), at length she (...) them pray,
That in their cotage (...) that night she rest her may.
The day is spent, and comes drowsy night,
When every creature shrouded is in sleep;
Sad (...) (...) her (...) in weary plight,
And at her feet the Lion watch does keep:
In stead of (...), and weep
For the late (...) of her (...) loved knight,
And (...), and evermore does (...)
Her tender (...) tears all night,
All night she (...) too long, and often looks (...) light.
Now when (...) was (...) hye
Above the (...) (...) chair,
And all in (...) did (...),
One knocked at the door, and in would fare;
He knocked (...), and often (...), and swear,
That ready entrance was not at his call:
For on his (...) load he bare
Of nightly (...) and pillage several,
Which he had got abroad by purchase criminal,
He was to weete a stout and sturdy thief,
Wont to rob Churches of their ornaments,
And poor men's boxes of their due relief,
Which given was to them for good intents;
The holy Saints of their rich vestiments
He did disrobe, when all men careless slept,
And spoild the Priests of their (...),
Whiles none the holy things in safety kept;
Then he by conning sleights in at the window erept.
And all that he by right or wrong could find,
Unto this house he brought, and did bestow
Upon the daghter of this woman blind,
Abessa daughter of Corceca (...),
With whom he whoredom vsd, that few did know,
And fed her fatt with feast of offerings,
And plenty, which in all the land did grow;
Nespared he to give her gold and rings:
And now he to her brought part of his stolen things.
Thus long the door with rage and threats he bett,
Yet of those fearful women none durstrize,
The Lion frayed them, him into let:
He would no longer stay him to aduize,
But open breaks the door in furious wize,
And entering is; when that disdainful beast
Encountering fierce, him suddein does surprise,
And seizing cruel claws on trembling breast,
Under his Lordly foot him proudly has suppressed.
Him booteth not resist, nor succor call,
His bleeding heart is in the vengers hand,
Who straight him rent in thousand pieces small,
And quite dismembered has: the thirsty land
Drunk up (...) life, (...) corse left on the (...).
His fearful friends we are out the woeful night,
Ne dare (...) weep, nor seem to understand
The heavy hap, which on them is alight,
Afraid, least to themselves the like mishappen might.
Now when (...) day the world discovered has,
Up Vna rose, up rose the lion eke,
And on their former journey forward pas,
In ways unknown, her wandering knight to seek,
With pains far passing that long wandering Greek,
That for his love refused deitye;
Such were the labors of this Lady meek,
Still seeking him, that from her still did fly,
Then furthest from her hope, when most she weened nigh.
Soon as she parted thence, the fearful twain,
That blind old woman and her daughter dear
Came forth, and finding Kirkrapine there slain,
For anguish great they began to rend their hear,
And (...) their breasts, and naked flesh to rear.
And whcn they both had wept and wayld their fill,
Then forth they ran like two amazed dear,
Half mad through malice, and revenging will,
To follow her, that was the causer of their ill.
Whom ouertaking, they began loudly bray,
With hollow houling, and lamenting cry,
Shamefully at her railing all the way,
And her accusing of dishonesty,
That was the (...) of faith and chastity;
And still amidst her railing she did pray,
That plagues, and (...), and long misery
Might fall on her, and follow all the way,
And that in endless error she might ever stray.
But when she saw her prayers naught prevail,
She back returned with some labor lost;
And in the way, as she did weep and wail,
A knight her met in mighty arms embost,
Yet knight was not for all his bragging bost,
But subtle Archimag, that Vna sought
By traynes into new troubles to have toste:
Of that old woman tidings he besought,
If that of such a Lady she could tellen ought.
Therewith she began her passion to renew,
And cry, and curse, and rail, and rend her hear,
Saying, that harlott she too lately knew,
That causd her shed so many a bitter tear,
And so forth told the story of her fear:
Much seemed he to moan her hapless (...),
And after for that Lady did inquere;
Which being taught, he forward began advance
His fair enchaunted steed, and eke his charmed lance.
Ere long he came, where Vna traueild slow,
And that wild Champion waiting her beside:
Whom seeing such, for dread he durst not show
Him self too nigh at hand, but turned wide
Unto an hill; from whence when she him spyde,
By his like seeming shield her knight by name
She weend it was, and toward him (...):
Approaching nigh she wist, it was the same,
And with fair fearful humblesse toward him she came.
And weeping said, Ah my long lacked Lord,
Where have ye been thus long out of my sight?
Much feared I to have been quite abhord,
Or ought have done, that ye displeasen might,
That should as death unto my dear heart light;
For since mine eye your joyous sight did mis,
My cheerful day is turned to chearelesse night,
And eke my night of death the shadow is;
But welcome now my light, and shining lamp of blis.
He thereto meeting said, My dearest Dame,
Far be it from your thought, and fro my will,
To think that knighthood I so much should shame,
As you to leave, that have me loved still,
And chose in Faery court of mere goodwil,
Where noblest knights were to be found on earth:
The earth shall sooner leave her kindly skill
To bring foth fruit, and make eternal derth,
Then I leave you, my liefe, yborn of heavenly berth.
And sooth to say, why I left you so long,
Was for to seek adventure in strange place,
Where Archimago said a felon strong
To many knights did daily work disgrace;
But knight he now shall never more deface,
Good cause of mine excuse, that moteye please
Well to accept, and ever more embrace
My faithful service, that by land and seas
Have vowed you to defend. Now then your plaint appease.
His lovely words her seemd due recompense
Of all her passed pains: one loving hour
For many years of sorrow can dispense:
A dram of sweet is worth a pound of sour:
She has forgott, how many, a woeful stowre
For him she late endurd; she speaks no more
Of past: true is, that true love has no power
To looken back; his eyes be fixed before.
Before her stands her knight, for whom she toyld so sore.
Much like, as when the beaten marinere.
That long has wandered in the (...) wide,
Often soust in swelling Tethys saltish tear,
And long time having tand his tawney hide,
With blustering breath of Heaven, that none (...) bide,
And scorching flames of fierce Orions hound,
Soon as the port from far he has espide,
His cheerful whistle merrily does sound,
And Nereus crowns with cups; his mates him pledge around.
Such joy made Vna, when her knight she found;
And eke th'enchaunter joyous seemde no less,
Then the glad merchant, that does view from ground
His ship far come from watrie wilderness,
He hurles out vows, and Neptune often does bless:
So forth they past, and all the way they spent
Discoursing of her dreadful late distress,
In which he asked her, what the Lion meant:
Who told her all that fell in journey, as she went.
They had not ridden far, when they might see
One pricking toward them with hasty heat,
Full strongly armd, and on a courser free,
That through his fiersnesse fomed all with sweat,
And the sharp iron did for anger eat,
When his hot ryder spurd his chauffed side;
His look was stern, and seemed still to threat
Cruel revenge, which he in heart did hyde,
And on his shield Sans loy in bloody lines was did.
When nigh he drew unto this gentle pair
And saw the Red-crosse, which the knight did bear,
He burnt in fire, and began eftsoons prepare
Himself to batteill with his couched spear.
Loath was that other, and did faint through fear,
To taste th'vntryed dint of deadly steel;
But yet his Lady did so well him cheer,
That hope of new good hap he began to feel;
So bent his spear, and spurd his horse with iron heel.
But that proud Paynim forward came so ferce,
And full of wrath, that with his sharphead spear
Through vainly (...) shield he quite did perce,
And had his staggering steed not shronke for fear,
Through shield and body eke he should him bear:
Yet so great was the puissance of his push,
That from his sadle quite he did him bear:
He tombling rudely down to ground did rush,
And from his gored wound a well of blood did gush.
Dismounting lightly from his lofty steed,
He to him lept, in mind to reaue his life,
And proudly said, (...) there the worthy meed
Of him, that slew Sansfoy with bloody knife;
Henceforth his ghost freed from repining strife,
In peace may passen over Let he lake,
When mourning altars purgd with enemies life,
The black infernal Furies done aslake:
Life from (...) thou tookst, Sansloy shall from thee take.
Therewith in haste his helmet began unlace,
Till Vna cride, O hold that heavy hand,
Dear Sir, what ever that thou be in place:
Enough is, that thy foe does vanquished stand
Now at thy mercy: Mercy not withstand:
For he is one the truest knight alive,
Though conquered now he lie on lowly land,
And whilst him (...) favored, fair did thrive
In bloody field: therefore of life him not (...) epriue.
Her piteous words might not abate his rage,
But rudely rending up his helmet, would
Have slain him straight: but when he sees his age,
And hoarie head of Archimago old,
His hasty hand he does amassed hold,
And half ashamed, wondered at the sight:
For the old man well knew he, though untold,
In charms and magic to have wondrous might,
Ne ever wont in field, ne in round lists to fight.
And said, Why Archimago, lucklesse sire,
What do I see? what hard mishap is this,
That has thee hither brought to taste mine ire?
Or thine the fault, or mine the error is,
Instead of foe to wound my friend amiss?
He answered naught, but in a trance still lay,
And on those guile full (...) eyes of his
The cloud of death did sit. Which done away,
He left him lying so, ne would no longer stay.
But to the virgin comes, who all this while
Amassed stands, her self so mocked to see
By him, who has the guerdon of his guile,
For so misfeigning her true knight to be:
Yet is she now in more perplexity,
Left in the hand of that same Paynim bold,
From whom her booteth not at all to fly;
Who by her cleanly garment catching hold,
Her from her Palfrey plucked, her visage to behold.
But her fires servant full of kingly aw
And high disdain, whenas his sovereign Dame
So rudely handled by her foe he saw,
With gaping iawesfull greedy at him came,
And ramping on his shield, did ween the same
Have reft away with his sharprending claws:
But he was stout, and lust did now inflame
His courage more, that from his griping paws
He has his shield redeemd, and forth his swerd he draws.
O then too weak and feeble was the forse
Of saluage beast, his puissance to withstand:
For he was strong, and of so mighty corse,
As ever wielded spear in warlike hand,
And feats of arms did wisely understand.
Est soones he perced through his chaufed chest
With thrilling point of deadly iron brand,
And launcht his Lordly heart: with death oppressed
He ror'd aloud, whiles life forsook his stubborn breast.
Who now is left to keep the forlorn maid
From raging spoil of law less victors will?
Her faithful guard removed, her hope dismayed,
Her self a yielded pray to save or spill.
He now Lord of the field, his pride to fill,
With foul reproaches, and disdaineful spite
Her vildly entertaines, and will or nill,
Bears her away upon his courser light:
Her prayers naught prevail, his rage is more of might.
And all the way, with great lamenting pain,
And piteous plaintes she fills his dull ears,
That stony heart could riuen have in twain,
And all the way she wetts with flowing tears:
But he enraged with rancor, nothing hears.
Her servile beast yet would not leave her so,
But follows her far of, ne ought he fears,
To be partaker of her wandering woe,
More mild in beastly kind, then that her beastly foe.
Can. IIII.
To sinful house of Pride, Duessa
guydes the faithful knight,
Where brothers death to wreak Sansioy
does chaleng him to fight.
YOung knight, what ever that do arms profess,
And through long labors huntest after fame,
Beware of fraud, beware of fickleness,
In choice, and change of thy dear loved Dame,
Least thou of her believe too lightly blame,
And rash misweening do thy heart remove:
For unto knight there is no greater shame,
Then lightness and inconstancy in love,
That does this Redcrosse knights ensample plainly prove
Who after that he had fair Vna lorne,
Through light misdeeming of her loialtie,
And fale Duessa in her sted had borne,
Called Fidess, and so supposd to be;
Long with her traueild, till at last they see
A goodly building, bravely garnished,
The house of mighty Prince it seemd to be:
And toward it a broad high way that led,
All bare through peoples feet, which thither traueiled.
Great troops of people traueild thetherward
Both day and night, of each degree and place,
But few returned, having escaped hard,
With balefull beggary, or soul disgrace,
Which ever after in most wretched care,
Like loathsome lazars, by the hedges lay.
Thither Duessa badd him bend his pace:
For she is weary of the toilsom way,
And also nigh consumed is the lingering day.
A stately Palace built of squared brick,
Which cunningly was without mortar laid,
Whose walls were high, but nothing strong, nor thick
And golden foil all over them displaid,
That purest sky with brightness they dismayed:
High lifted up were many lofty towers,
And goodly galleries far over laid,
Full of fair windows, and delightful bowres;
And on the top a Dial told the timely hours.
It was a goodly heap for to behold,
And spoke the praises of the workmans wit;
But full great pity, that so fair a mould
Did on so weak foundation ever sit:
For on a sandy hill, that still did flitt,
And fall away, it mounted was full hie,
That every breath of heaven shaked itt:
And all the hinder parts, that few could spy,
Were ruinous and old, but painted cunningly.
Arrived there they passed in forth right;
For still to all the gates stood open wide,
Yet charge of them was to a Porter hight
Called Maluenu, who entrance none denide:
Thence to the hall, which was on every side
With rich array and costly arras dight:
Infinite sorts of people did abide
There waiting long; to win the wished sight
Of her, that was the Lady of that Palace bright.
By them they pass, all gazing on them round,
And to the Presence mount; whose glorious view
Their frail amazed senses did confound:
In living Princes court none ever knew
Such endless richesse, and so sumpteous show;
Ne Persia self, the nourse of pompous pride
Like ever saw. And there a noble crew
Of Lords and Ladies stood on every side,
Which with their presence fair, the place much beautifide.
High above all a cloth of State was spread,
And a rich throne, as bright as sunny day,
On which there sat most brave embellished
With royal robes and gorgeous array,
A maiden Queen, that shone as Titans ray,
In glistring gold, and perelesse precious stone;
Yet her bright blazing beauty did assay
To dim the brightness of her glorious throne,
As envying her self, that too exceeding shone.
Exceeding shone, like Phoebus fairest child,
That did presume his fathers fyrie wayne,
And flaming mouths of steedes unwonted wild
Through highest heaven with weaker hand to rain;
Proud of such glory and advancement vain,
While flashing beams do daze his feeble eyes,
He leaves the welkin way most beaten plain,
And rapt with whirling wheels, inflames the skyen,
With fire not made to burn, but fayrely for to shine.
So proud she shyned in her princely state,
Looking to heaven; for earth she did disdain,
And sitting high; for lowly she did hate:
Lo under neath her scornful feet, was layne
A dreadful Dragon with an hideous train,
And in her hand she held a mirrhour bright,
Wherein her face she often vewed feign,
And in her selfe-lou'd semblance took delight;
For she was wondrous fair, as any living wight.
Of griesly Pluto she the daughter was,
And sad Proserpina the Queen of hell;
Yet did she think her pearelesse worth to pas
That parentage, with pride so did she swell,
And thundering Jove, that high in heaven does dwell,
And wield the world, she claymed for her sire,
Or if that any else did Jove excel:
For to the highest she did still aspyre,
Or if ought higher were then that, did it desire.
And proud Lucifera men did her call,
That made her self a Queen, and crowned to be,
Yet rightful kingdom she had none at all,
Ne heritage of native soueraintie,
But did usurp with wrong and tyranny
Upon the scepter, which she now did hold;
Ne ruld her Realm with laws, but policy,
And strong aduizement of six wisards old,
That with their counsels bad her kingdom did uphold.
Soon as the Elfin knight in presence came,
And false Duessa seeming Lady fair,
A gentle Husher, Vanity by name
Made rowme, and passage for them did prepaire:
So goodly brought them to the lowest stayre
Of her high throne, where they on humble knee
Making obeysaunce; did the cause declare,
Why they were come, her royal state to see,
To prove the wide report of her great Maiestee.
With lofty eyes, half loath to look so low,
She thancked them in her disdainefull wise,
Ne other grace vouchsafed them to show
Of Princess worthy, scarce them bad arise.
Her Lords and Ladies all this while devise
Themselves to setten forth to strangers sight:
Some frounce their curled hear in courtly guise,
Some prancke their ruffes, and others trimly dight
Their gay attire: each others greater pride does spite.
Goodly they all that knight do entertayne,
Right glad with him to have increast their crew;
But to Duess each one himself did pain
All kindness and fair courtesy to show;
For in that court whylome her well they knew:
Yet the stout Faery among the midst crowd
Thought all their glory vain in knightly view,
And that great Princess too exceeding proud,
That to strange knight no better countenance allowd.
Suddein vpriseth from her stately place
The royal Dame, and for her coche does call;
All hurtlen forth, and she with princely pace,
As fair Aurora in her purple pall,
Out of the East the dawning day does call:
So forth she comes: her brightness broad does (...);
The heaps of people thronging in the hall,
Do ride each other, upon her to gaze:
Her glorious glitter and light does all men's eyes amaze.
So forth she comes, and to her coche does clyme,
Adorned all with gold, and girlonds gay,
That seemd as fresh as Flora in her prime,
And strove to match, in royal rich array,
Great (...) golden chair, the which they say
The Gods stand gazing on, when she does ride
To Jove's high house through heavens bras paued way
Drawn of fair Pecocks, that excel in pride,
And full of (...) eyes their tails dispredden wide.
But this was drawn of six unequal beasts,
On which her six sage Counselors did ride,
Taught to obey their bestiall be heasts,
With like conditions to their kinds applyde:
Of which the first, that all the rest did guide,
Was sluggish Idleness the nourse of sin;
Upon a slothful Ass he chose to ride,
Arayd in habit black, and amiss thin,
Like to an holy Monck, the service to begin.
And in his hand his Portesse still he bare,
That much was worn, but therein little redd,
For of devotion he had little care,
Still drowned in sleep, and most of his days dedd;
Scarce could he once uphold his heavy hedd,
To looken, whether it were night or day:
May seem the wayne was very evil ledd,
When such an one had guiding of the way,
That knew not, whether right he went, or else astray.
From worldly cares himself he did (...),
And greatly shunned manly exercise,
From (...) work he challenged essoyne,
For contemplation sake: yet otherwise,
His life he led in lawless riotise;
By which he grew to grievous malady;
For in his lustlesse limbs through evil guise
A shaking (...) continually:
(...) one was Idleness; first of this company.
And by his side rode loathsome Gluttony,
Deformed creature, on a filthy swyne,
His belly was vpblowne with luxury;
And eke with fatness swollen were his eyne,
And like a Crane his neck was long and fine,
With which he swallowd up excessive feast,
For want whereof poor people often did pyne,
And all the way, most like a brutish beast,
He spued up his gorge, that all did him deteast.
In green vine leaves he was right fitly clad;
For other clothes he could not wear for heat,
And on his head an yuie girland had,
From under which fast trickled down the sweat:
Still as he rode, he somewhat still did eat,
And in his hand did bear a bouzing can,
Of which he supt so often, that on his seat
His dronken course he scarce vpholden can,
In shape and life more like a monster, then a man.
Unfit he was for any wordly thing,
And eke unable once to stir or go,
Not meet to be of counsel to a king,
Whose mind in meat and drink was drowned so,
That from his friend he seeldome knew his fo:
Full of diseases was his carcas blew,
And a dry dropsy through his flesh did flow,
Which by misdiet daily greater grew:
Such one was Gluttony, the second of that crew.
And next to him rode lustful Lechery,
Upon a bearded Got, whose rugged hear,
And whally eyes (the sign of gelosy,)
Was like the person self, whom he did bear:
Who rough, and black, and filthy did appear,
Unseemly man to please fair Ladies eye;
Yet he of Ladies often was loved dear,
When fairer faces were bid standen by:
O who does know the bent of women's fantasy?
In a green gown he clothed was full fair,
Which underneath did hide his filthiness,
And in his hand a burning heart he bare,
Full of vain follies, and new fanglenesse;
For he was false, and fraught with fickleness,
And learned had to love with secret looks,
And well could dance, and sing with ruefulnesse,
And fortunes tell, and read in loving books,
And thousand other ways, to bait his fleshly hooks.
Inconstant man, that loved all he saw,
And lusted after all, that he did love,
Ne would his looser life be tide to law,
But ioyd weak wemens hearts to tempt, and prove
If from their loyal (...) he might them move;
Which lewdnes filled him with reproachful pain
Of that foul evil, which all men reprove,
That rotts the marrow, and consumes the brain:
Such one was Lechery, the third of all this train.
And greedy (...) by him did ride,
Upon a Camel laden all with gold;
Two iron coffets hong on either side,
With precious metal full, as they might hold,
And in his lap an heap of coin he told;
For of his wicked pelpe his God he made,
And unto hell him self for money sold;
Accursed usury was all his trade,
And right and wrong ylike in equal ballaunce waide.
His life was nigh unto deaths door yplaste,
And threadbare cote, and cobled shoes he ware,
Ne scarce good morsel all his life did taste,
But both from back and belly still did spare,
To fill his bags, and richesse to compare;
Yet child ne kinsman living had he none
To leave them to; but thorough daily care
To get, and nightly fear to lose his own,
He led a wretched life unto him self unknown.
Most wretched wight, whom nothing might suffice,
Whose greedy lust did lack in greatest store,
Whose need had end, but no end couetise,
Whose wealth was want, whose plenty made him pore,
Who had enough, yett wished ever more,
A vile disease, and eke in foot and hand
A grievous gout tormented him full sore,
That well he could not touch, nor go, nor stand:
Such one was Avarice, the forth of this fair band.
And next to him malicious Envy rode,
Upon a ravenous wolf, and still did chaw
Between his cankred teeth a venomous tode,
That all the poison ran about his chaw;
But inwardly he chawed his own maw
At neibors wealth, that made him ever sad;
For death it was, when any good he saw,
And wept, that cause of weeping none he had,
But when he heard of harm, he wexed wondrous glad.
All in a kirtle of discolourd say
He clothed was, ypaynted full of eyes;
And in his bosom secretly there lay
An hateful Snake, the which his tail vptyes
In many folds, and mortal sting implies.
Still as he rode, he gnasht his teeth, to see
Those heaps of gold with griple Couetyse,
And grudged at the great felicitee
Ofproud Lucifera, and his own companee.
He hated all good works and virtuous deeds,
And him no less, that any like did use,
And who with gracious bread the hungry feeds,
His alms for want of faith he does accuse;
So every good to bad he does abuse:
And eke the verse of famous Poets wit
He does backebite, and spightfull poison spues
From leprous mouth on all, that ever writ:
Such one vile Envy was, that first in row did (...).
And him beside rides fierce revenging Wrath,
Upon a Lion, loath for to be led;
And in his hand a burning brond he has,
The which he brandisheth about his head;
His eyes did hurl forth sparcles fiery red,
And stared stern on all, that him beheld,
As ashes pale of hew and seeming ded;
And on his dagger still his hand he held,
Tre^bling through hasty rage, when choler in him sweld.
His ruffin raiment all was staind with blood,
Which he had spilt; and all to rags yrent,
Through vnaduized rashness woxen wood;
For of his hands he had no government,
Ne cared for blood in his auengement:
But when the furious fit was ouerpast,
His cruel facts he often would repent;
Yet wilful (...) he (...) would forecast,
How many mischieues should ensue his heedlesse have.
Full many mischiefs follow oruell Wrath;
Abhorred bloodshed, and tumultuous strife,
Un manly murder, and (...) scath,
Bitter despite, with rancours rusty knife,
And fretting grief the enemy of life;
All these, and many evils more haunt ire,
The swelling Spleen, and Frenzy raging rife,
The shaking Palsy, and Saint Fraunces fire:
Such one was Wrath, the last of this ungodly tire.
And after all upon the wagon beam
Rode Satan, with a smarting whip in hand,
With which he forward lasht the laesy teme,
So often as Slowth still in the mire did stand.
Huge routs of people did about them band,
Showting for joy, and still before their way
A foggy mist had covered all the land;
And underneath their feet, all scattered lay
Dead sculls and bones of men, whose life had gone astray.
So forth they marchen in this goodly sort,
To take the solace of the open air,
And in fresh flowring fields themselves to sport;
Emongst the rest rode that false Lady fair,
The foul Duessa, next unto the chair
Ofproud Lucifer', as one of the train:
But that good knight would not so nigh repair,
Him self estraunging from their ioyaunce vain,
Whose fellowship seemd far unfit for warlike swain.
So having solaced themselves a space^,
With pleasaunce of the breathing fields yfed,
They back returned to the princely Place;
Whereas an errant knight in arms ycled,
And heathnish shield, wherein with letters red
Was writ Sans joy, they new arrived find:
Enflamed with fury and fires hardy head,
He seemd in heart to harbor thoughts unkind,
And nourish bloody vengeance in his bitter mind.
Who when the shamed shield of slain Sans foy
He spide with that same Fary champions page,
Bewraying him, that did of late destroy
His eldest brother, burning all with rage
He to him lept, and that same envious gage
Of victors glory from him snacht away:
But th'Elfin knight, which ought that warlike wage,
Disdaind to loose the meed he won in fray,
And him rencountring fierce, reskewd the noble pray.
Therewith they began to hurtlen greedily,
Redoubted battle ready to darrayne,
And clash their shields, and shake their swerds on hy,
That with their stir they troubled all the train;
Till that great Queen upon eternal pain
Of high displeasure, that ensewen might,
Commanded them their fury to refrain,
And if that either to that shield had right,
In equal lists they should the morrow next it fight.
Ah dearest Dame, quoth. then the Paynim bold,
Pardon the error of enraged wight,
Whom great grief made forgett the raines to hold
Of reasons rule, to see this recreaunt knight,
No knight, but treachour full of false despite
And shameful treason, who through guile has slain
The prowest knight, that ever field did fight,
Even stout Sans foy (O who can then refrayn?)
Whose shield he bears renuerst, the more to heap disdayn.
And to augment the glory of his guile,
His dearest love the fair Fidessa lo
Is there possessed of the traitor vile,
Who reapes the harvest sown by his foe,
Sown in bloody field, and bought with woe:
That brothers hand shall dearly well requight
So be, O Queen, you equal favor show.
Him little answered the angry Elfin knight;
He never meant with words, but swords to plead his right.
But threw his gauntlet as a sacred pledge,
His cause in combat the next day to try:
So been they parted both, with hearts on edg,
To be aueng'd each on his enemy.
That night they pas in joy and iollity,
Feasting and courting both in bower and hall;
For Steward was (...) Gluttony,
That of his plenty poured forth to all;
Which done, the Chamberlain Slowth did to rest them call.
Now whenas darkesome night had all displayed
Her coleblacke curtein over brightest sky,
The warlike youths on dayntie couches laid,
Did chase away sweet sleep from sluggish eye,
To muse on means of hoped victory.
But whenas Morpheus had with leaden mace,
Arrested all that courtly company,
Vprose Duessa from her resting place,
And to the Paynims lodging comes with silent pace.
Whom broad awake she finds, in troublous fit,
Forecasting, how his foe he might annoy,
And him amoues with speeches seeming fit:
Ah dear Sansioy, next dearest to Sansfoy,
Cause of my new grief, cause of new joy,
Joyous, to see his image in mine eye,
And greeud, to think how foe did him destroy,
That was the flower of grace and cheualrye;
Lo his (...) to thy secret faith I fly.
With gentle words he can her fayrely greet,
And bad say on the secret of her heart.
Then sighing soft, I learn that little sweet
Often tempred is (quoth she) with muchell smart:
For since my breast was launcht with (...) dart
Of dear Sanfoy, I never ioyed hour,
But in eternal woes my weaker hatt
Have wasted, loving him with all my power,
And for his sake have felt full many an heavy (...).
At last when perils all I weened past,
And hoped to reap the crop of all my care,
Into new woes vnweeting I was cast,
By this false faytor, who unworthy ware
His worthy shield, whom he with guilefull (...)
Entrapped slew, and brought to shameful grave.
Me silly maid away with him he bare,
And ever since has kept in darksom cave,
For that I would not yield, that to Sansfoy I gave.
(...) since fair Sun has sperst that lowering clowd,
And to my loathed life now shows some light,
Under your beams I will me safely shroud,
From dreaded storm of his disdainful spite:
To you the inheritance belonges by right
Of brothers praise, to you eke longes his love.
Let not his love, let not his restless spright,
Be unrevenged, that calls to you above
From wandering Stygian shores, where it does endless move.
Thereto said he, fair Dame be naught dismayed
For sorrows past; their grief is with them gone:
Ne yet of present peril be afraid:
For needless fear did never vantage none,
And helpless hap it booteth not to moan.
Dead is Sansfoy, his vital pains are past,
Though grieved ghost for vengeance deep do groan
He lives, that shall him pay his duties last,
And guilty Elfin blood shall sacrifice in have:
O But I fear the fickle freakes (quoth she)
Of fortune false, and odds of arms in field.
Why dame (quoth he) what odds can ever be,
Where both do fight alike, to win or yield?
Yea but (quoth she) he bears a charmed shield,
And eke enchaunted arms, that none can perce,
Ne none can wound the man, that does them wield.
Charmd or enchaunted (answered he then ferce)
I no whitt reck, ne you the like need to reherce.
But fair Fidessa, since fortunes guile,
Or enemies power has now captiued you,
Return from whence ye came, and rest a while
Till morrow next, that I the Elfe subdew,
And with Sansfoyes dead dowry (...).
Ay me, that is a double death (she said)
With proud foes sight my sorrow to renew:
Where ever yet I be, my secret aid
Shall follow you. So passing forth she him obaid:
Cant V.
The faithful knight in equal field
subdewes his faithless foe,
Whom false Duessa saues, and for
his cure to hell does go.
THe noble heart, that harbors virtuous thought,
And is with child of glorious great intent,
Can never rest, until it forth have brought
The Eternal brood of glory excellent:
Such restless passion did all night torment
The flaming courage of that Faery knight,
Deuizing, how that doughtie turnament
With greatest honor he atchieuen might;
Still did he wake, and still did watch for dawning light,
At last the golden Oriental gate
Of greatest heaven began to open fair,
And Phoebus fresh, as brydegrome to his mate,
Came dancing forth, shaking his deawie hair:,
And hurls his glistring beams through gloomy air.
Which when the wakeful Elfe perceiud, straight way
He started up, and did him self prepayre,
In sunbright arms, and battailous array:
For with that Pagan proud he combatt will that day.
And forth he comes into the commune hall,
Where early wait him many a gazing eye,
To weet what end to stranger knights may fall.
There many Minstrales maken melody,
To drive away the dull melancholy,
And many Bardes, that to the trembling chord
Can tune their timely voices cunningly,
And many Chroniclers, that can record
Old loves, and wars for Ladies done by many a Lord.
Soon after comes the cruel Sarazin,
In wouen maile all armed warily,
And sternly looks at him, who not a pin
Does care for look of living creatures eye.
They bring them wines of Greece and Araby,
And dainty spices fetched from furthest Ynd,
To kindle heat of courage privily:
And in the wine a solemn oath they bynd
T'obserue the facred laws of arms, that are assynd.
At last forth comes that far renowned Queen,
With royal pomp and princely majesty;
She is ybrought unto a paled green,
And placed under stately canapee,
The warlike feats of both thofe knights to see.
On the other side in all men's open view
Duessa placed is, and on a tree
Sansfoy his shield is hanged with bloody hew:
Both those the laurel girlonds to the victor dew.
A shrilling trompett sownded from on hye,
And unto battaill bad them selves address:
Their shining shieldes about their wrestes they tie,
And burning blades about their heads do bless,
The instruments of wrath and heaviness:
With greedy force each other does assail,
And strike so fiercely, that they do impresse
Deep dinted furrows in the battred mayle:
The iron walls to ward their blows are weak and frail.
The Sarazin was stout and wondrous strong,
And heaped blows like (...) hammers (...):
For after blood and vengeance he did long.
The knight was fires, and full of youthly heat,
And doubled strokes, like dreaded thunders threat:
For all for praise and honor he did fight.
Both stricken stryke, and beaten both do beat,
That from their shields forth flies fiery light,
And hewn helmets deep show marks of eithers might.
So the one for wrong, the other strives for right:
As when a Gryfon seized of his pray,
A Dragon fires encountreth in his flight,
Through widest air making his idle way,
That would his rightful rauine rend away:
With hideous horror both together smight,
And souce so sorc, that they the heavens affray:
The wise Southsayer seeing so sad sight,
The Amazed vulgartelles of wars and mortal fight.
So th'onc for wrong the other strives for right,
And each to deadly shame would drive his foe:
The cruel steel so greedily does bight
In tender flesh, that streams of blood down flow,
With which the arms, that erst so bright did show
Into a pure vermillion now are did:
Great ruth in all the gazers hearts did grow,
Seeing the gored wounds to gape so wide,
That victory they dare not wish to either side.
At last the Paynim chaunst (...) cast his eye,
His suddein eye, flaming with wrathful fire,
Upon his brothers shield, which hong thereby:
There with redoubled was his raging ire,
And said, Ah wretched son of woeful sire,
Do thou sit wayling by black Stygian lake,
Whylest here thy shield is hanged for victors hyre,
And sluggish german do thy forces slake,
To after-send his foe, that him may overtake?
Go caytiue Elfe, him quickly overtake,
And soon redeem from his long wandering woe,
Go guilty ghost, to him my message make,
That I his shield have quit from dying foe.
Therewith upon his crest he stroke him so,
That twice he reeled, ready twice to fall;
End of the doubtful battle deemed tho
The lookers on, and loud to him began call
The false Duessa, Thine the shield, and I, and all.
Soon as the Faerie heard his Lady speak,
Out of his swowning dream he began awake,
And quickening faith, that erst was woxen weak,
The creeping deadly cold away did shake:
Tho moved with wrath, and shame, and Ladies sake,
Of all attonce he cast auengd to be,
And with so' exceeding fury at him struck,
That forced him to stoop upon his knee;
Had he not stouped so, he should have cloven be.
And to him said, Go now proud Miscreant,
Thy self thy message do to german dear,
Alone he wandering thee too long does want:
Go say, his foe thy shield with his does bear.
Therewith his heavy (...) he high began rear,
Him to have slain; when lo a darkesome clowd
Upon him fell: he no where does appear,
But (...) is. The (...) him calls (...),
But answer none receives: the darkness him does shroud
In haste Duessa from her place arose,
And to him running said, O prowest knight,
That ever Lady to her love did chose,
Let now abate the terror of your might,
And quench the flame of furious despite,
And bloody vengeance; lo the infernal powers
Covering your foe with cloud of deadly night,
Have borne him hence to Plutoes balefull bowres.
The conquest yours, I yours, the shield, and glory yours.
Not all so satisfide, with greedy eye
He sought all round about, his thristy blade
To bathe in blood of faithless enemy;
Who all that while lay hid in secret shade:
He stands amazed, how he thence should fade.
At last the trumpets Triumph sound on hie,
And running Heralds humble homage made,
Greeting him goodly with new victory,
And to him brought the shield, the cause of enmity.
Wherewith he goes to that sovereign Queen,
And falling her before on lowly knee,
To her makes present of his service seen:
Which she accepts, with thanks, and goodly gree,
Greatly aduauncing his gay cheualree.
So marches home, and by her takes the knight,
Whom all the people follow with great glee,
Shouting, and clapping all their hands on hight,
That all the air it fills, and flies to heaven bright.
Home is he brought, and laid in sumptuous bed:
Where many skillful leaches him abide,
To salve his hurts, that yet still freshly bled.
In wine and oil they wash his wounds wide,
And softly began embalme on every side.
And all the while, most heavenly melody
About the bed sweet music did divide,
Him to beguile of grief and agony:
And all the while Duessa wept full bitterly.
As when a weary traueiler that strayes
By muddy shore of broad seuen-mouthed Nile,
Vnweeting of the perilous wandering ways,
Does meet a cruel crafty Crocodile,
Which in false grief hyding his harmefull guile,
Does weep full sore, and sheddeth tender tears:
The foolish man, that pitties all this while
His mournful plight, is swallowd up unawares,
Forgetful of his own, that minds an others cares.
So wept Duessa until euentyde,
That shyning lamps in Jove's high house were light:
Then forth she rose, (...) longer would abide,
But comes unto the place, where th'Hethen knight
In slombring swownd nigh void of vital spright,
Lay covered with inchaunted cloud all day:
Whom when she found, as she him left in plight,
To wayle his woeful case she would not stay,
But to the Eastern coast of heaven makes speedy way.
Where griesly Night, with visage deadly sad,
That Phoebus cheerful face durst never view,
And in a foul black pitchy mantle clad,
She finds forth coming from her darksome mew,
Where she all day did hide her hated hew.
Before the door her iron charet stood,
Already harnessed for journey new;
And coleblacke steedes yborne of hellish brood,
That on their rusty bits did champ, as they were wood.
Who when she saw Duessa sunny bright,
Adornd with gold and jewels shining clear,
She greatly grew amazed at the sight,
And th'vnacquainted light began to fear:
For never did such brightness there appear,
And would have back retired to her cave,
Until the witches speech she began to hear,
Saying, yet O thou dreaded Dame, I crave
Abide, till I have told the message, which I have.
She stayed, and forth Duessa began proceed,
O thou most ancient Grandmother of all,
More old then Jove, whom thou at first did breed,
Or that great house of Gods caelestiall,
Which wast begot in Daemogorgons hall,
And sawst the secrets of the world unmade,
Why suffredst thou thy Nephews dear to fall
With Elfin sword, most shamefully betrade?
Lo where the stout Sansioy does sleep in deadly shade.
And him before, I saw with bitter eyes
The bold Sansfoy shrinck underneath his spear;
And now the pray of fowls in field he lies,
Nor wayld of friends, nor laid on groaning bear,
That whylome was to me too dearly dear.
O what of Gods then boots it to be borne,
If old Aveugles sons so cuill hear?
Or who shall not great Nights children scorn,
When two of three her Nephews are so foul forlorn.
Up then, up dreary Dame, of darkness Queen,
Go gather up the relics of thy race,
Or else go them avenge, and let be seen,
That dreaded Night in brightest day has place,
And can the children of fair light deface.
Her feeling speeches some (...) moved
In heart, and change in that great mothers face:
Yet pity in her heart was never proved
Till then: for evermore she hated, never loved.
And said, Dear daughter rightly may I rue
The fall of famous children borne of me,
And good successes, which their foes ensew:
But who can turn the stream of destinee,
Or break the chain of strong necessitee,
Which fast is tide to Jove's eternal seat.
The sons of Day he favors, I see,
And by my ruins thinks to make them great:
To make one great by others loss, is bad excheat.
Yet shall they not escape so freely all;
For some shall pay the price of others guilt:
And he the man that made Sansfoy to fall,
Shall with his own blood price, that he has spilt.
But what art thou, that telst of Nephews kilt?
I that do seem not I, Duessa ame,
Quoth she, how ever now in garments gilt,
And gorgeous gold arayd I to thee came;
Duessa I, the daughter of Deceit and Shame.
Then bowing down her aged back, she kissed
The wicked witch, saying, In that fair face
The false resemblaunce of Deceit, I wist
Did closely lurk; yet so true-seeming grace
It carried, that I scarce in darksome place
Could it discern, though I the mother be
Of fashood, and root of Duessaes race.
O welcome child, whom I have longd to see,
And now have seen unawares. Lo now I go with thee.
Then to her iron wagon she betakes,
And with her bears the foul welfauourd witch:
Through mirkesome air her ready way she makes.
Her twyfold Teme, of which two black as pitch,
And two were brown, yet each to each vnlich,
Did softly swim away, ne ever stamp,
Unless she chau^st their stubborn mouths to twitch;
Then foming tar, their bridles they would champ,
And trampling the fine element, would fiercely ramp.
So well they sped, that they be come at length
Unto the place, whereas the Paynim lay,
Deuoid of outward sense, and native strength,
Couerd with charmed cloud from view of day,
And sight of men, since his late luckelesse fray.
His cruel wounds with cruddy blood congeald,
They binden up so wisely, as they may,
And handle softly, till they can be heald:
So lay him in her charett, close in night conceald.
And all the while she stood upon the grouud,
The wakefull dogs did never cease to bay,
As giving warning of th'vnwonted sound,
With which her iron wheels did them affray,
And her dark griesly look them much dismay;
The messenger of death, the ghastly owl
With drery shriekes did also her bewray;
And hungry wolves continually did howl,
At her abhorred face, so filthy and so foul.
Thence turning back in silence soft they stole,
And brought the heavy corse with easy pace
To yawning gulf of deep Auernus hole.
By that same hole an entrance dark and bace
With smoke and sulphur hiding all the place,
Descends to hell: there creature never past,
That back returned without heavenly grace;
But dreadful Furies, which their chains have brast,
And damned sprights sent forth to make ill men aghast.
By that same way the direful dames do drive
Their mournful charett, filled with rusty blood,
And down to Plutoes house are come biliue:
Which passing through, on every side them stood
The trembling ghosts with sad amazed mood,
Chattring their iron teeth, and staring wide
With stony eyes; and all the hellish brood
Of feends infernal flockt on every side,
To gaze on erthly wight, that with the Night durst ride.
They pas the bitter waves of Acheron,
Where many souls sit wailing woefully,
And come to fiery flood of Phlegeton,
Whereas the damned ghosts in torments fry,
And with sharp shrilling shriekes do bootlesse cry,
Cursing high Jove, the which them thither sent.
The house of endless pain is built thereby,
In which ten thousand sorts of punishment
The cursed creatures do eternally torment.
Before the threshold dreadful Cerberus
His three deformed heads did lay along,
Curled with thousand adders venomous,
And lilled forth his bloody flaming tongue:
At them he began to rear his bristles strong,
And felly gnarre, until Days enemy
Did him appease; then down his tail he hong
And suffered them to passen quietly:
For she in hell and heaven had power equally.
There was Ixion turned on a wheel,
For daring tempt the Queen of heaven to sin;
And Sisyphus an huge round stone did reele
Against an hill, ne might from labor lin;
There thristy Tantalus hong by the chin;
And Tityus fed a vultur on his maw;
Typhoeus joints were stretched on a gin,
Theseus condemned to endless sloth by law
And fifty sisters water in let vessels draw.
They all beholding worldly wights in place,
Leave off their work, unmindful of their smart,
To gaze on them; who forth by them do pace,
Till they become unto the furthest part:
Where was a Cauey wrought by wondrous art,
Deep, dark, uneasy, doleful, comfortless,
In which sad Aesculapius far apart
Emprisond was in chains remediless,
For that Hippolytus rent corse he did redress.
Hippolytus a jolly huntsman was,
That wont in charett chase the foming bore;
He all his Peers in beauty did surpas,
But Ladies love as loss of time forbore:
His wanton stepdame loved him the more,
But when she saw her offered sweets refusd
Her love she turned to hate, and him before
His father fierce of treason false accusd,
And with her gealous terms his open ears abusd.
Who all in rage his Sea-god sire besought,
Some cursed vengeance on his son to cast:
From surging gulf two Mo^sters straight were brought,
With dread whereof his chacing steedes aghast,
Both charett swifte and huntsman ouercast.
His goodly corpse on ragged clifts yrent,
Was quite dismembered, and his members chaste
Scattered on every mountain, as he went,
That of Hippolytus was left no moniment.
His cruel stepdame seeing what was done,
Her wicked days with wretched knife did end,
In death auowing th'innocence of her son.
Which hearing his rash Sire, began to rend
His hear, and hasty tongue, that did offend:
Tho gathering up the relics of his smart
By Dianes means, who was Hippolyts friend,
Them brought to Aesculape, that by his art
Did heal them all again, and joined every part.
Such wondrous science in man's wit to rain
When Jove auizd, that could the dead reviue,
And fates expired could renew again,
Of endless life he might him not deprive,
But unto hell did thrust him down alive,
With flashing thunderbolty wounded sore:
Where long remaining, he did always strive
Him self with salues to health for to restore,
And slake the heavenly sire, that raged evermore.
There ancient Night arriving, did alight
From her nigh weary wayne, and in her arms
To AEsculapius brought the wounded knight:
Whom having softly disaraid of arms,
Tho began to him discover all his harms,
Beseeching him with prayer, and with praise,
If either salues, or oils, or herbs, or charms
A for done wight from door of death mote raise,
He would at her request prolong her nephews days.
Ah Dame (quoth. he) thou temptest me in vain,
To dare the thing, which daily yet I rue,
And the old cause of my continued pain
With like attempt to like end to renew.
Is not enough, that thrust from heaven dew
Here endless penance for one fault I pay,
But that redoubled crime with vengeance new
Thou biddest me to eeke? Can Night defray
The wrath of thundering Jove, that rules both night and day?
Not so (quoth. she) but since that heavens king
From hope of heaven has thee excluded quight,
Why fear thou, that can not hope for thing,
And fear not, that more thee hurten might,
Now in the power of everlasting Night?
Go to then, O thou far renouned son
Of great Apollo, show thy famous might
In medicine, that else has to thee won
Great pains, and greater praise, both never to be done.
Her words preuaild: And then the learned leach
His cunning hand began to his wounds to lay,
And all things else, the which his art did teach:
Which having seen, from thence arose away
The mother of dredd darkness, and let stay
Aueugles son there in the leaches cure,
And back retourning took her wonted way,
To run her timely race, whilst Phoebus pure
In western waves his weary wagon did recure.
The false Duessa leaving noyous Night,
Returned to stately palace of Dame Pride;
Where when she came, she found the Faery knight
Departed thence, albee his wounds wide
Not thoroughly heald, unready were to ride.
Good cause he had to hasten thence away;
For on a day his wary Dwarf had spyde,
Where in a dungeon deep huge nombers lay
Of caytiue wretched thralls, that wayled night and day.
A ruefull sight, as could be seen with eye;
Of whom he learned had in secret wise
The hidden cause of their captivity,
How mortgaging their lives to Couetise,
Through wastfull Pride, and wanton Riotise,
They were by law of that proud Tyranness
Prouokt with Wrath, and Enuyes false surmise,
Condemned to that Dongeon merciless,
Where they should live in woe, and dye in wretchedness.
There was that great proud king of Babylon,
That would (...) all nations to adore,
And him as only God to call upon,
Till through celestial doom thrown out of door,
Into an Ox he was transformd of yore:
There also was king Croesus, that enhaunst
His heart too high through his great richesse store;
And proud Antiochus, the which aduaunst
His cursed hand against God, and on his altares daunst.
And them long time before, great Nimrod was,
That first the world with sword and fire warrayd;
And after him old Ninus far did pas
In princely pomp, of all the world obayd;
There also was that mighty Monarch laid
Low under all, yet above all in pride,
That name of native sire did foul upbraid,
And would as Ammons son be magnifide,
Till scornd of God and man a shameful death he did.
All these together in one heap were thrown,
Like carkases of beasts in butchers stall.
And in another corner wide were strowne
The Antique ruins of the Romans fall:
Great Romulus the Grandsyre of them all,
Proud Tarquin, and too lordly Lentulus,
Stout Scipio, and stubborn Hanniball,
Ambitious Sylla, and stern Marius,
High Caesar, great Pompey, and fires Antonius.
Amongst these mighty men were women mixed,
Proud women, vain, forgetful of their yoke:
The bold Semiramis, whose sides transfixt
With sons own blade, her foul reproaches spoke;
Fair Sthenoboea, that herself did choke
With wilful chord, for wanting of her will;
High minded Cleopatra, that with stroke
Of Aspes sting herself did stoutly kill:
And thousands more the like, that did that dongeon fill
Besides the endless routes of wretched thralles,
Which thither were assembled day by day,
From all the world after their woeful falls,
Through wicked (...), and wasted welthes decay.
But most of all, which in the Dongeon lay
Fell from high Princes courts, or Ladies bowres,
Where they in idle pomp, or wanton play,
Consumed had their goods, and thriftlesse hours,
And lastly thrown themselves into these heavy stowres.
Whose case whenas the careful Dwarf had told,
And made ensample of their mournful sight
Unto his master, he no longer would
There dwell in peril of like painful plight,
But early rose, and ere that dawning light
Discovered had the world to heaven wide,
He by a privy Posterne took his flight,
That of no envious eyes he mote be spyde:
For doubtless death ensewed, if any him descryde.
Scarce could he footing find in that foul way,
For many corses, like a great Lay-stall
Of murdered men which therein strowed lay,
Without remorse, or decent funeral:
Which al through that great Princess pride did fall
And came to shameful end. And them beside
Forth ryding underneath the castle wall,
A Donghill of dead carcases he spyde,
The dreadful spectacle of that sad house of Pride.
Can. VI.
From lawless lust by wondrous grace
fair Una is releast:
Whom saluage nation does adore,
and learnes her wise beheast.
AS when a ship, that flies fair under sail,
An hidden rock escaped has unawares,
That lay in wait her (...) for to (...) wail,
The Mariner yet half amazed stares
At peril past, and yet it doubt ne dares
To joy at his foolhappie oversight:
So doubly is distressed twixt joy and cares
The dreadlesse courage of this Elfin knight,
Having escapt so sad ensamples in his sight.
Yet sad he was, that his too hasty speed
The fair Duess' had forced him leave behind;
And yet more sad, that Vna his dear dreed
Her truth had staynd with treason so unkind:
Yet crime in her could never creature find,
But for his love, and for her own self sake,
She wandered had from one to other Ynd,
Him for to seek, ne ever would forsake,
Till her unawares the fires Sansloy did overtake.
Who after Archimagoes foul defeat,
Led her away into a forest wild,
And turning wrathful fire to lustful (...),
With beastly sin thought her to have defilde,
And made the vassal of his pleasures vilde.
Yet first he cast by treaty, and by traynes,
Her to persuade, that stubborn fort to yilde:
For greater conquest of hard love he gaynes,
That works it to his will, then he that it constraines.
With fawning words he courted her a while,
And looking lovely, and often sighing sore,
Her constant heart did tempt with diverse guile:
But words, and looks, and sighs she did abhore,
As rock of Diamond steadfast evermore.
Yet for to feed his fyrie lustful eye,
He snatched the vele, that hong her face before;
Then began her beauty shine, as brightest sky,
And burnt his beastly heart t'efforce her chastitye.
So when he saw his flattering arts to fail,
And subtle engines bett from batteree,
With greedy force he began the fort assail,
Whereof he weend possess soon to be,
And win rich spoil of ransackt chastitee.
Ah heavens, that do this hideous act behold,
And heavenly virgin thus outraged see,
How can ye vengeance just so long withhold,
And hurl not flashing flames upon that Paynim bold?
The pitteous maiden careful comfortless,
Does throw out thrilling shriekes, and shrieking cries,
The last vain help of wemens great distress,
And with loud plaintes importuneth the skies,
That molten stars do drop like weeping eyes;
And Phoebus flying so most shameful sight,
His blushing face in foggy cloud implies,
And hydes for shame. What wit of mortal wight
Can now devise to quitt a thrall from such a plight?
Eternal providence exceeding thought,
Where none appears can make her self a way:
A wondrous way it for this Lady wrought,
From Lions claws to pluck the gryped pray.
Her shrill outcryes and shrieks so loud did bray,
That all the woods and forestes did resownd;
A troop of Faunes and Satyrs far a way
Within the wood were dancing in a rownd,
Whiles old Syluanus slept in shady arber sownd,
Who when they heard that pitteous strained voice,
In haste forsook their rural meriment,
And ran toward the far rebownded noyce,
To weet, what wight so loudly did lament.
Unto the place they come incontinent:
Whom when the raging Sarazin espyde,
A rude, mishappen, monstrous rablement,
Whose like he never saw, he durst not bide,
But got his ready steed, and fast away began ride.
The wyld woodgods arrived in the place,
There find the virgin doolfull desolate,
With ruffled rayments, and fair blubbred face,
As her outrageous foe had left her late,
And trembling yet through fear of former hate;
All stand amazed at so uncouth sight,
And gin to pity her unhappy state,
All stand astonished at her beauty bright,
In their rude eyes unworthy of so woeful plight.
She more amazd, in double dread does dwell;
And every tender part for fear does shake:
As when a greedy Wolf through honger fell
A seely Lamb far from the flock does take,
Of whom he means his bloody feast to make,
A Lion spies fast running toward him,
The innocent pray in have he does forsake,
Which quitt from death yet quakes in every lim
With change of fear, to see the Lion look so grim.
Such fearful fit assaid her trembling heart,
Ne word to speak, ne joint to move she had:
The saluage nation feel her secret smart,
And read her sorrow in her countenance sad;
Their frowning forheades with rough horns yclad,
And rustic horror all a side do lay,
And gently grenning, show a semblance glad
To comfort her, and fear to put away,
Their backward bent knees teach her humbly to obey.
The doubtful Damzell dare not yet committ,
Her single person to their barbarous truth,
But still twixt fear and hope amazd does sit,
Late learnd what harm to hasty trust ensu'th,
They in compassion of her (...) der youth,
And wonder of her beauty so uerayne,
Are won with pity and unwonted ruth,
And all prostrate upon the lowly plain,
Do kiss her feet, and fawn on her with countenance feign.
Their hearts she (...) by their humble guise,
And yieldes her to extremity of time;
So from the ground she fearelesse does arise,
And walks forth without suspect of crime:
They all as glad, as birds ofioyous Pryme,
Thence lead her (...), about her (...) round,
Shouting, and (...) all a shepherds ryme,
And with green branches strowing all the ground,
Do worship her, as Queen, with olive girlond cround.
And all the way their merry pipes they sound,
That all the woods with doubled Echo ring,
And with their horned feet do wear the ground,
Leaping like wanton kids in pleasant Spring.
So toward old Syluanus they her bring;
Who with the noise awaked, comes out,
To weet the cause, his weak steps governing,
And aged limbs on Cypress stadle stout,
And with an yuie twyne his waste is girt about.
Far off he wonders, what them makes so glad
(...) Bacchus merry (...) they did invent,
Or Cybeles frantickerites have made them mad;
They drawing nigh, unto their God present
That flower of faith and beauty excellent:
The God himself vewing that mirrhour rare,
Stood long amazd, and burnt in his intent;
His own fair Dryope now he thinks not fair,
And Pholoe foul, when her to this he does compaire.
The woodborne people (...) before her flat,
And worship her as Goddess of the wood;
And old (...) self (...) not, what
To think of (...) so fair, but gazing stood,
In doubt to (...) her borne of earthly brood;
Sometimes Dame Venus self he seems to see,
But Venas never (...) mood;
Sometimes (...) he her takes to be,
But misseth bow, and (...), and buskins to her (...).
By view of her he ginneth to (...)
His ancient love, and dearest Cyparisse,
And calls to mind his (...) alive,
How fair he was, and yet not fair to this,
And how he slew with glauncing dart amiss
A gentle Hynd, the which the lovely boy
Did love as life, above all worldly bliss;
For grief whereof the lad n'ould after (...),
But pynd away in anguish and selfewild (...).
The woody Nymphs, fair Hamadryades
Her to behold do thither run apace,
And all the troop of light foot Naiades,
Flock all about to see her lovely face:
But when they vewed have her heavenly grace,
They envy her in their malicious mind,
And fly away for fear offowle disgrace:
But all the (...) (...) their woody kind,
And henceforth nothing fair, but her on earth they find
Glad of such luck, the luckelesse lucky maid,
Did her content to please their feeble eyes,
And long time with that saluage people stayed,
To gather breath in many miseryes.
During which time her gentle wit she plyes,
To teach them truth, which worshipped her in vain,
And made her The Image of Idolatryes;
But when their bootlesse zeal she did restrain
From her own worship, they her Ass would worship fayn.
It fortuned a noble warlike knight
By just occasion to that forest came,
To seek his kindred, and the lignage right,
From whence he took his weldeserued name:
He had in arms abroad won muchell fame,
And filled far lands with glory of his might,
Plain, faithful, true, and enemy of shame,
And ever loved to fight for Ladies right,
But in vain glorious frayes he little did delight.
A Satyrs son yborne in forest wyld,
By strange adventure as it did betyde,
And there begotten of a Lady myld,
Fair Thyamis the daughter of Labryde,
That was in sacred bands of wedlock tide
To Therion, a loose unruly swayne;
Who had more joy to raunge the forest wide,
And chase the saluage beast with busy pain,
Then serve his Ladies love, and waste in pleasures vain.
The forlorn maid did with (...) longing burn,
And could not lack her lovers company,
But to the wood she goes, to serve her turn,
And seek her spouse, that from her still does fly,
And follows other game and venery:
A Satyr chaunst her wandering for to find,
And kindling coals of lust in brutish eye,
The loyal linkes of wedlock did unbind,
And made her person thrall unto his beastly kind.
So long in (...) there be held
Her (...) to his (...) desire,
Till that with timely (...) her belly sweld,
And bore a boy unto that saluage sire:
Then home he (...) her for to retire,
For ransom leaving him the late-borne child;
Whom till to (...) years he (...) aspyre,
He nousled up in life and manners wild,
Emongst wild beasts and woods, from laws of men exilde.
For all he taught the (...):
To (...) cowardice and bastard fear;
His trembling hand he would him force to put
Upon the Lion and the rugged Bear,
And from the she Bears teats her whelps to tear;
And eke wyld roaring Bulls he would him make
To tame, and (...) their backs not made to bear;
And the Robuckes in flight to overtake,
That every beast for fear of him did fly and quake.
Thereby so fearelesse, and so fell he grew,
That his own (...) and master of his guise
Did often tremble at his horrid view,
And often for dread of hurt would him advise,
The angry beasts not rashly to despise,
Nor too much to provoke: for he would learn
The Lion stoup to him in lowly wife;
(A lesson hard) and make the (...) stern
Leave roaring, when in rage he for revenge did earne.
And for to make his power approved more,
Wyld beasts in iron yokes he would compel;
The spotted Panther, and the (...) Bore,
The Pardale swift, and the Tigre cruel;
The Antelope, and Wolf both swift and cruel;
And them constrain in equal teme to draw.
Such joy he had, their stubborn hearts to quell,
And sturdie courage tame with dreadful aw,
That his beheast they feared, as a tyrans law.
His loving mother came upon a day
Unto the woods, to see her little son;
And chaunst unawares to meet him in the way,
After his sportes, and cruel pastime done,
When after him a Lioness did run,
That roaring all with rage, did loud requere
Her children dear, whom he away had won:
The Lion whelps she saw how he did bear,
And lull in rugged arms, withouten childish fear.
The fearful Dame all quaked at the sight,
And turning back, began fast to fly away,
Until with love reuokt from vain affright,
She hardly yet persuaded was to stay,
And then to him these womanish words began say;
Ah Satyrane, my dearling, and my joy,
For love of me leave off this dreadful play;
To dally thus with death, is no fit toy,
Go find some other play-fellowes, mine own sweet boy.
In these and like delights of bloody game
He trained was, till ryper years he raught,
And there abode, whylst any beast of name
Walked in that forest, whom he had not taught,
To fear his force: and then his courage haught
Desyrd of foreign foemen to be known,
And far abroad for strange adventures sought:
In which his might was never overthrown,
But through al Faery land his famous worth was blown
Yet evermore it was his manner fair,
After long labors and adventures spent,
Unto those native woods for to repair,
To see his sire and offspring ancient.
And now he thither came for like intent;
Where he unawares the fairest Vna found,
Sraunge Lady, in so strange habiliment,
Teaching the Satyrs, which her sat around
True sacred lore, which from her sweet lips did redound.
He wondered at her wisdom heavenly rare,
Whose like in women's wit he never knew;
And when her cutteous deeds he did compare,
Began her admire, and her sad sorrows rue,
Blaming of Fortune, which such troubles threw,
And ioyd to make proof of her cruelty
On gentle Dame, so hurtlesse, and so true:
Thenceforth he kept her goodly company,
And learnd her discipline of faith and verity.
But she all vowed unto the Redcrosse knight,
His wandering peril closely did lament,
Ne in this new acquaintance could delight,
But her dear heart with anguish did torment,
And all her wit in secret counsels spent,
How to escape. At last in privy wise
To Satyrane she showed her intent;
Who glad to gain such favor, began devise,
How with that pensive Maid he best might thence arise.
So on a day when Satyrs all were gone,
To do their service to Syluanus old,
The gentle virgin left behind alone
He led away with courage stout and bold.
Too late it was, to Satyrs to be told,
Or ever hope recover her again:
In vain he seeks that having cannot hold.
So fast he carried her with careful pain,
That they the wods are past, and come now to the plain.
The better part now of the lingering day,
They traueild had, whenas they far espide
A weary wight for wandering by the way,
And toward him they began in have to ride,
To weete of news, that did abroad betide,
Or tidings of her knight of the Redcrosse.
But he them spying, began to turn aside,
For fear as seemd, or for some feigned loss;
More greedy they of news, fast toward him do cross.
A silly man, in simple weeds forworne,
And soild with dust of the long dried way;
His sandales were with to ilsome travel torn,
And face all tand with scorching sunny ray,
As he had traueild many a summers day,
Through boiling sands of Arabie and Ynde;
And in his hand a Jacobs staff, to stay
His weary limbs upon: and eke behind,
His scrip did hang, in which his needments he did bind.
The knight approaching nigh, of him inquerd
Tidings of war, and of adventures new;
But wars, nor new adventures none he herd.
Then Vna began to ask, if ought he knew,
Or heard abroad of that her champion true,
That in his armor bare a croslet red.
Ay me, Dear dame (quoth. he) well may I rue
To tell the sad sight, which mine eyes have red:
These eyes did see that knight both living, and eke ded.
That cruel word her tender heart so thrild,
That suddein cold did run through every vain,
And stony horror all her senses filled
With dying fit, that down she fell for pain.
The knight her lightly reared up again,
And comforted with courteous kind relief:
Then won from death, she bad him tellen plain
The further process of her hidden grief;
The lesser pangs can bear, who has endured the chief.
Then began the Pilgrim thus, I chaunst this day,
This fatal day, that shall I ever rue,
To see two knights in travel on my way
(A sorry sight) arraung'd in batteill new,
Both breathing vengeance, both of wrathful hew:
My fearful flesh did tremble at their strife,
To see their blades so greedily imbrew,
That drunk with blood, yet thristed after life:
What more? the Redcrosse knight was slain with Paynim knife.
Ah dearest Lord (quoth. she) how might that be,
And he the stoutest knight, that ever won?
Ah dearest dame (quoth. he) how migh I see
The thing, that might not be, and yet was done?
Where is (said Satyrane) that Paynims son,
That him of life, and us of joy has refte?
Not far away (quoth. she) he hence does won
Foreby a fountain, where I late him left
Washing his bloody wounds, that through the fteele were cleft.
Therewith the knight thence marched forth in have,
Whiles Vna with huge (...) oppressed,
Could not for sorrow follow him so fast;
And soon he came, as he the place had ghest,
Whereas that Pagan proud him self did rest,
In secret shadow by a fountain side:
Even he it was, that erst would have suppressed
Fair Vna: whom when Satyrane espide,
With foul reproachful words he boldly him defide.
And said, Arise thou cursed Miscreaunt,
That have with knightlesse guile and treacherous train
Fair knighthood fowly shamed, and do vaunt
That good knight of the Redcrosse to have slain:
Arise, and with like treason now maintain
Thy guilty wrong, or else thee guilty yield.
The Sarazin this hearing, rose amain,
And catching up in have his three square shield,
And shining helmet, soon him buckled to the field.
And drawing nigh him said, Ah misborn Elfe,
In evil hour thy foes thee hither sent,
Another wrongs to wreak upon thy self:
Yet ill thou blamest me, for having blent
My name with guile and traitorous intent;
That Redcrosse knight, perdie, I never slew,
But had he been, where erst his arms were lent,
Th'enchaunter vain his error should notrew:
But thou his error shall, I hope now prouen true.
Therewith they began, both furious and fell,
To thunder blows, and fiersly to assail
Each other, bent his enemy to quell,
That with their force they perst both plate and maile,
And made wide furrows in their fleshes frail,
That it would pity any living eye.
Large floods of blood adowne their sides did rail;
But floods of blood could not them satisfy:
Both hongred after death: both chose to win, or die.
So long they fight, and full revenge pursue,
That fainting each, them selves to breathen let,
And often refreshed, battle often renew:
As when two Bores with rancling malice met,
Their gory sides fresh bleeding fiercely frett,
Til breathless both themselves aside retire,
Where foming wrath, their cruel tuskes they whett,
And trample the earth, the whiles they may respire;
Then back to fight again, new breathed and entire.
So fiersly, when these knights had breathed once,
They began to fight return, increasing more
Their puissant force, and cruel rage attonce,
With heaped strokes more hugely, then before,
That with their drery wounds and bloody gore
They both deformed, scarsely could be known.
By this sad Vna fraught with anguish sore,
Led with their noise, which through the air was thrown:
Arrived, where they in earth their fruitles blood had sown.
Whom all so soon as that proud Sarazin
Espide, he began revive the memory
Of his lewd lusts, and late attempted sin,
And left the doubtful battle hastily,
To catch her, newly offered to his eic:
But Satyrane with strokes him turning, staid,
And sternely bad him other business plie,
Then hunt the steps of pure unspotted Maid:
Wherewith he al enraged, these bitter speeches said.
O foolish faeries son, what fury mad
Has thee incenst, to have thy doleful fate?
Were it not better, I that Lady had,
Then that thou had repented it too late?
Most senseless man he, that himself does hate,
To love another. Lo then for thine aid
Here take thy lovers token on thy pate.
So they to fight; the whiles the royal Maid
Fledd far away, of that proud Paynim sore afraid
But that false Pilgrim, which that leasing told,
Being in deed old Archimage, did stay
In secret shadow, all this to behold,
And much rejoiced in their bloody fray:
But when he saw the Damsel pass away
He left his stond, and her pursewd apace,
In hope to bring her to her last decay.
But for to tell her lamentable case,
And eke this battles end, will need another place.
Cant. VII.
The Redcrosse knight is captive made
By Gyaunt proud oppressed,
Prince Arthure meets with Una great
ly with those news distressed.
What man so wise, what earthly wit so ware,
As to discry the crafty cunning train,
By which deceit does mask in visour fair,
And cast her colors died deep in grain,
To seem like truth, whose shape she well can feign,
And fitting gestures to her purpose frame;
The guiltless man with guile to entertain?
Great maistresse of her art was that false Dame,
The false Duessa, cloked with Fidessaes name.
Who when returning from the drery Night,
She fownd not in that perilous house of Pride,
Where she had left, the noble Redcross knight,
Her hoped pray; she would no longer bide,
But forth she went, to seek him far and wide.
Ere long she fownd, whereas he weary sat,
To rest him self, soreby a fountain side,
Disarmed all of yron-coted Plate,
And by his side his steed the grassy forage ate.
He feeds upon the cooling shade, and bays
His sweatie forehead in the breathing wynd,
Which through the tre^bling leaves full gently plays
Wherein the cheerful birds of sundry kind
Do chauntsweet music, to delight his mind,
The witch approaching began him fayrely greet,
And with reproach of carelesnes unkind,
Upbraid, for leaving her in place unmeet,
With foul words tempring fair, sour gall with honey sweet.
Unkindness past, they began of solace treat,
And bathe in pleasaunce of the joyous shade,
Which shielded them against the boiling heat,
And with green boughs decking a gloomy glade,
About the fountain like a girlond made;
Whose bubbling wave did ever freshly well,
Ne ever would through fervent summer fade
The sacred Nymph, which therein wont to dwell,
Was out of Dianes favor, as it then befell.
The cause was this: one day when Phoebe fair
With all her band was following the chase,
This Nymph, quite tired with heat of scorching air
Satt down to rest in midst of the race:
The goddess wroth began fowly her disgrace,
And badd the waters, which from her did flow,
Be such as she her self was then in place.
Thenceforth her waters wexed dull and slow,
And all that drink thereof, do faint and feeble grow.
Hereof this gentle knight vnweeting was,
And lying down upon the sandy graile,
Drunk of the stream, as clear as crystal glass;
Eftsoons his manly forces began to fail,
And mighty strong was turned to feeble frail:
His changed powers at first them selves not felt,
Till crudled cold his courage began assail,
And cheerful blood in fayntnes chill did melt,
Which like a fever fit through all his body swelt.
Yet goodly court he made still to his Dame,
Pourd out in loosnesse on the grassy grownd,
Both careless of his health, and of his fame:
Till at the last he heard a dreadful sownd,
Which through the wood loud bellowing, did rebownd,
That all the earth for terror seemd to shake,
And trees did tremble. Th'Elfe therewith astownd,
Vpstarted lightly from his looser make,
And his unready weapons began in hand to take.
But ere he could his armor on him dight,
Or get his shield, his monstrous enemy
With sturdie steps came stalking in his sight,
An hideous Geaunt horrible and hye,
That with his tallnesse seemd to threat the sky,
The ground eke groned under him for dreed;
His living like saw never living eye,
Ne durst behold: his stature did exceed
The hight of three the tallest sons of mortal seed.
The greatest Earth his uncouth mother was,
And blustering AEolus his boasted sire,
Who with his breath, which through the world does pas,
Her hollow womb did secretly inspyre,
And filled her hidden caves with stormy ire,
That she conceived; and trebling the dew time,
In which the wombes of women do expyre,
Brought forth this monstrous mass of earthly slyme,
Puffed up with empty wynd, and filled with sinful crime.
So grown great through arrogant delight
Of the high descent, whereof he was yborne,
And through presumption of his matchless might,
All other powers and knighthood he did scorn.
Such now he marches to this man forlorn,
And left to loss: his stalking steps are stayde
Upon a snaggy Oak, which he had torn
Out of his mothers bowelles, and it made
His mortal mace, wherewith his foemen he dismayde.
That when the knight he spyde, he began advance
With huge force and insupportable main,
And toward him with dreadful fury praunce;
Who hapless, and eke hopeless; all in vain
Did to him pace, sad battle to darrayne,
Disarmd, disgraste, and inwardly dismayde,
And eke so faint in every joint and vain,
Through that frail fou^tain, which him feeble made,
That scarsely could he weeld his bootlesse single blade.
The Geaunt struck so maynly merciless,
That could have overthrown a stony tower,
And were not heavenly grace, that him did bless,
He had been pouldred all, as thin as flower:
But he was wary of that deadly stowre,
And lightly lept from underneath the blow
Yetso exceeding was the villeins power
That with the wind it did him overthrow,
And all his senses stoond, that still he lay full low.
As when that devilish iron Engine wrought
In deepest Hell,, and framd by Furies skill,
With (...) Nitre and quick Sulphur fraught,
And ramd with bollet rownd, ordaind to kill,
Conceiueth fire, the heavens it does fill
With thundering noise, and all the air does choke,
That none can breath, nor see, nor hear at will,
Through smouldry cloud of duskish stinking smok,
That the only breath him daunts, who has escapt the stroke.
So daunted when the Geaunt saw the knight,
His heavy hand he heaued upon hye,
And him to dust thought to have battred quight,
Until Duessa loud to him began cry;
O great Orgoglio, greatest under sky,
O hold thy mortal hand for Ladies sake,
Hold for my sake, and do him not to dye,
But vanquished (...) eternal bondflaue make,
And me thy worthy meed unto thy Leman take.
He hearkened, and did stay from further harms,
To gayneso goodly guerdon, as she spoke:
So willingly she came into his arms,
Who her as willingly to grace did take,
And was possessed of his newfound make.
Then up he took the slombred senseless corse,
And (...) he could out of his swowne awake,
Him to his castle brought with hasty forse,
And in a Dongeon deep him threw without remorse.
From that day forth Duessa was his dear,
And highly honored in his haughty eye,
He gave her gold and purple pall to wear,
And triple crown set on her head full hye,
And her endowd with royal majesty:
Then for to make her (...) more of men.
And peoples hearts with awful terror tie,
A monstrous beast ybredd in filthy fen
He chose, which he had kept long time in darksom den.
Such one it was, as that renowned Snake
Which great Alcides in Stremona slew,
Long fostred in the filth of Lerna lake,
Whose many heads out budding ever new,
Did breed him endless labor to subdew:
But this same Monster much more ugly was;
For seven great heads out of his body grew,
An iron breast, and back of scaly bras,
And all embrewd in blood, his eyes did shine as glass.
His tail was stretched out in wondrous length,
That to the house of heavenly gods it raught,
And with extorted power, and borrowed strength,
The euerburning lamps from thence it braught,
And prowdly threw to ground, as things of naught;
And underneath his filthy feer did tread,
The sacred things, and holy heastes foretaught.
Upon this dreadful Beast with seven fold head
He set the false Duessa, for more aw and dread.
The woeful Dwarf, which saw his masters fall,
Whiles he had keeping of his grasing steed,
And valiant knight become a cay (...) thrall,
When all was past, took up his forlorn weed,
His mighty Armor, missing most at need;
His silver shield, now idle maisterlesse;
His poynant spear, that many made to bleed,
The ruefull moniments of heaviness,
And with them all departes, to tell his great distress.
He had not trauaild long, when on (...) way
He woeful Lady, woeful Vna met,
Fast flying from that Paynims greedy pray,
Whilst Satyrane him from pursuit did let:
Who when her eyes she on the Dwarf had set,
And saw the signs, that deadly tydinges spoke,
She fell to ground for sorrowful regret,
And lively breath her sad breast did forsake,
Yet might her pittcous heart be seen to pant and quake.
The messenger of so unhappy news,
Would feign have did: dead was his heart within,
Yet outwardly some little comfort shows:
At last recovering heart, he does begin
To rubb her temples, and to chaufe her chin,
And every tender part does toss and turn:
So hardly he the flitted life does win,
Unto her native prison to return:
Then gins her grieved ghost thus to lament and mourn.
Ye dreaty instruments of doleful sight,
That do this deadly spectacle behold,
Why do ye longer feed on loathed light,
Or liking find to gaze on earthly mould,
Since cruel fates the careful threads unfold,
The which my life and love together tide?
Now let the stony dart of senseless cold
Perce to my heart, and pas through every side,
And let eternal night so sad fro me hyde.
O light some day, the lamp of highest Jove,
First made by him, men's wandering ways to guide,
When darkness he in deepest (...) drove,
Henceforth (...) hated face for ever hyde,
And shut up heavens windows shyning wide:
For earthly sight can naught but sorrow breed,
And late (...), which shall long abide.
Mine eyes no more on (...) shall feed,
But seeled up with death, shall have their deadly meed.
Then down again she fell unto the ground;
But he her quickly reared up again:
Thrice did she sink (...) in deadly swownd,
And thrice he her (...) with busy pain:
At last when life recouer'd had the rain,
And ouer-wrestled his strong enemy,
With foltring tongue, and trembling every vain,
Tell on (quoth she) the woeful Tragedy,
The which these relics sad present unto mine eye.
Tempestuous fortune has spent all her spite,
And thrilling sorrow thrown his utmost dart;
Thy sad tongue cannot tell more heavy plight,
Then that I seele, and harbor in mine heart:
Who has endured the whole, can bear each part.
If death it be, it is not the first wound,
That launched has my breast with bleeding smart
Begin, and end the bitter balefull stound;
Iflesse, then that I fear, more favor I have found.
Then began the Dwarf the whole discourse declare,
The subtle trains of Archimago old;
The wanton loves of false Fidessa fair,
Bought with the blood of vanquished Paynim bold:
The wretched pair transformd to (...) mould;
The house of Pride, and (...) round about;
The combat, which he with Sansioy did hold;
The lucklesse conflict with the Gyaunt (...),
Wherein captived, of life or (...) he stood in doubt.
She heard with patience all unto the end,
And strove to master sorrowful assay,
Which greater grew, the more she did contend,
And almost rent her tender heart in tway;
And love fresh coals unto her fire did Iay:
For greater love, the greater is the loss.
Was never Lady loved dearer day,
Then she did love the knight of the Redorosse;
For whose dear sake so many troubles her did toss.
At last when fervent sorrow (...) was,
She up arose, resolving him to find
Alive or dead: and forward forth (...) pas,
All as the Dwarf the way to her assynd:
And ever more in constant careful mind
She fedd her wound with fresh (...);
Long tossed with storms, and bet with (...) wind,
High over hills, and low adowne the dale,
She wandered many a wood, and measurd many a vale.
At last she (...) by good (...) to (...)
A goodly knight, (...) by the way
Together with his (...), (...)
His glitterand armor shined far away,
Like glauncing light of (...) brightest (...);
From top to toe no place (...),
That deadly (...) of (...)
Athwart his breast a (...).
That shind, like twinkling stars, with stones most precious
And in the midst thereof one precious stone
Of wondrous worth, and (...) of wondrous mights,
Shapt like a Ladies head, exceeding shone,
Like Hesperus (...) the lesser lights,
And strove for to amaze the weaker sights;
Thereby his mortal blade full comely hong
In yuory sheath; (...) with (...) slights;
Whose hilts were burnisht gold, and handle strong
Of mother perle, and buckled with a golden tongue.
His haughty Helmet, horrid all with gold,
Both glorious (...), and great terror bredd,
For all the crest a Dragon did enfold
With greedy paws, and over all did spredd
His golden wings: his dreadful hideous hedd
Close couched on the beuer, seemd to throw
From flaming mouth bright sparckles fiery redd,
That suddeine (...) to faint hearts did show;
And scaly (...) was stretched adowne his back full low.
Upon the top of all his lofty crest,
A (...) of (...) diversely,
With (...) pearl, and gold full richly dressed,
Did shake, and seemd to dance for iollity,
Like to an Almond tree ymounted hye
On top of green Selinis all alone,
With blossoms brave bedecked (...);
Her (...) do (...) every one
At every little breath, that under heaven is blown.
His warlike shield all closely covered was,
Ne might of (...) all eye be ever seen;
Not made of (...), (...) of enduring bras,
Such earth (...) soon consumed been:
But all of Diamond perfect pure and cleene
It framed was, one massy entire mould,
Hewn out of Adamant rock with engines keen,
That point of spear it never percen could,
Ne dint of direful sword divide the substance would.
The same to wight he never wont disclose,
But when as monsters huge he would dismay,
Or daunt unequal armies of his foes,
Or when the flying heavens he would affray:
For so exceeding shone his glistring ray,
That Phoebus golden face it did attaint,
As when a cloud his beams does ouer-lay
And silver Cynthia wexed pale and faint,
As when her face is staynd with magic arts constraint.
No magic arts hereof had any might,
Nor bloody words of bold Enchaunters call,
But all that was not such, as seemd in sight,
Before that shield did fade, and suddeine fall:
And when him list the rascal routes appall,
Men into stones therewith he could transmew,
And stones to dust, and dust to naught at all;
And when him list the prouder looks subdew
He would them gazing blind, or turn to other hew.
Ne let it seen that credence this exceedes,
For he that made the same, was known right well
To have done much more admirable deeds.
It Merlin was, which whylome did excel
All living wightes in might of magic spell:
Both shield, and sword, and armor all he wrought
For this young Prince, when first to arms he fell,
But when he did, the Faery Queen it brought
To Faerie land, where yet it may be seen, if sought.
A gentle youth, his dearly loved Squire
His spear of heben wood behind him bare,
Whose harmeful head, thrice heated in the fire,
Had riuen many a breast with pikehead square;
A goodly person, and could menage fair,
His stubborn steed with curbed canon bitt,
Who under him did amble as the air,
And chaust, that any on his back should sit;
The iron rowels into frothy foam he bitt.
When as this knight nigh to the Lady drew,
With lovely court he began her entertain;
But when he heard her aunswers loath, he knew
Some secret sorrow did her heart distraine:
Which to allay and calm her storming pain,
Fair feeling words he wisely began display,
And for her humor fitting purpose feign,
To tempt the cause it self for to bewray;
Wherewith enmoud, these bleeding words she began to say.
What worlds delight, or joy of living speech
Can heart, so plungd in sea of sorrows deep,
And heaped with so huge misfortunes, reach?
The careful cold begins for to creep,
And in my heart his iron arrow steep,
Soon as I think upon my bitter bale:
Such helpless harms yts better hidden keep,
Then rip up grief, where it may not avail,
My last left comfort is, my woes to weep and wail.
Ah Lady dear, quoth then the gentle knight,
Well may I ween, your grief is wondrous great;
For wondrous great grief groneth in my spright,
Whiles thus I hear you of your sorrows treat.
But woeful Lady, let me you intrete,
For to unfold the anguish of your heart:
Mishaps are maistred by advice discrete,
And counsel mitigates the greatest smart;
Found never help, who never would his hurts impart.
O but (quoth. she) great grief will not be told,
And can more easily be thought, then said.
Right so (quoth. he) but he, that never would,
Could never: will to might gives greatest aid.
But grief (quoth. she) does greater grow displaid,
If then it find not help, and breeds despair.
Despair breeds not (quoth. he) where faith is (...).
No faith so fast (quoth. she) but flesh does pair.
Flesh may empaire (quoth. he) but reason can repair.
His goodly reason, and well guided speech
So deep did settle in her gracious thought,
That her persuaded to disclose the breach,
Which love and fortune in her heart had wrought,
And said fair Sir, I hope good hap has brought
You to inquere the secrets of my grief,
Or that your wisdom will direct my thought,
Or that your prowess can me yield relief:
Then hear the story sad, which I shall tell you brief.
The forlorn Maiden, whom your eyes have seen
The laughing stock of fortunes mockeries,
Am the only daughter of a King and Queen,
Whose parents dear whiles equal destinies,
Did come about, and their felicities
The favorable heavens did not envy,
Did spread their rule through all the territories,
Which Phison and Euphrates flows by,
And Gehons golden waves do wash continually.
Till that their cruel cursed enemy,
An huge great Dragon horrible in sight,
Bred in the loathly lakes of Tartary,
With murdrous rauine, and devouring might
Their kingdom spoild, and country wasted quight:
Themselves, for fear into his jaws to fall,
He forced to castle strong to take their flight,
Where fast embard in mighty brazen wall,
He has them now fowr years besiegd to make the^ thrall.
Full many knights aduenturous and stout
Have enterprizd that Monster to subdew;
From every coast that heaven walks about,
Have thither come the noble Martial crew,
That famous hard atchieuements still pursew,
Yet never any could that girlond win,
But all still shronke, and still he greater grew:
All they for want of faith, or guilt of sin,
The pitteous pray of his ficrs cruelty have bin.
At last yled with far reported praise,
Which flying fame throughout the world had spread,
Of doughty knights, whom Fary land (...) raise,
That noble order hight of maidenhed,
Forthwith to court of Gloriane I sped,
Of Gloriane great Queen of glory bright,
Whose kingdoms seat Cleopolis is red,
There to obtain some such redoubted knight,
That Parents dear from tyrants power deliver might.
Yt was my chance (my chance was fair and good)
There for to find a fresh unproven knight,
Whose manly hand imbrewd in guilty blood
Had never been, ne ever by his might
Had thrown to gtound the unregarded right:
Yet of his prowess proof he since has made
(I witness am) in many a cruel fight;
The groaning ghosts of many one dismaide
Have felt the bitter dint of his auenging blade.
And ye the forlorn relics of his power,
His biting sword, and his devouring spear,
Which have endured many a dreadful stowre,
Can speak his prowess, that did erst you bear,
And well could rule: now he has left you hear,
To be the record of his ruefull loss,
And of my doleful disauenturous dear:
O heavy record of the good Redcrosse,
Where have ye left your lord, that could so well you toss?
Well hoped I, and fair beginnings had,
That he my captive languor should redeem,
Till all vnweeting, an Enchaunter bad
His sense abusd, and made him to misdeeme
My loyalty, not such as it did seem
That rather death desire, then such despite.
Be judge ye heavens, that all things right esteem,
How I him loved, and love with all my might,
So thought I eke of him, and think I thought aright.
Thenceforth me desolate he quite forfooke,
To wander, where wild fortune would me lead,
And other by ways he himself betook,
Where never foot of living wight did tread,
That brought not back the balefull body dead;
In which him chanced false (...) meet,
Mine only foe, mine only deadly dread,
Who with her witchcraft and misseeming sweet,
Inueigled him to follow her desires unmeet.
At last by subtle sleights she him betrayed
Unto his foe, a Gyaunt huge and tall,
Who him disarmed, dissolute, dismayed,
Unawares surprised, and with mighty mall
The monster merciless him made to fall,
Whose fall did never foe before behold;
And now in darkesome dungeon, wretched thrall,
Remediless, for aie he does him hold;
This is my cause of grief, more great, then may be told.
Ere she had ended all, she began to faint:
But he her comforted, and fair bespake,
Certes, Madame, ye have great cause of plaint,
That stoutest heart, I ween, could cause to quake.
But be of cheer, and comfort to you take:
For till I have acquitt your captive knight,
Assure your self, I will you not forsake.
His cheerful words reviu'd her chearelesse spright,
So forth they went, the Dwarf the^ guiding ever right.
Cant. VIII.
Fair virgin to redeem her dear
Brings Arthure to the fight:
Who slayes that Gyaunt, wounds the beast,
And strips Duessa quight.
AY me, how many perils do enfold
The righteous man, to make him daily fall,
Were not that heavenly grace does him uphold,
And (...) truth acquit him out of all:
Herloue is firm, her care continual,
So often as he thorough his own foolish pride,
Or weakness is to sinful bands made thrall:
Else should this Redcrosse knight in bands have did,
For whose deliverance she this Prince does thither guyd.
They sadly traueild thus, until they came
Nigh to a castle builded strong and hye:
Then cryde the Dwarf, lo yonder is the same,
In which my Lord my liege does lucklessely,
Thrall to that Gyaunts hateful tyranny:
Therefore, dear Sir, your mighty powers assay.
The noble knight alighted by and by
From lofty steed, and badd the Lady stay,
To see what end of fight should him befall that day.
So with his Squire, th'admirer of his might,
He marched forth toward that castle wall;
Whose gates he fownd fast shutt, ne living wight
To ward the same, nor answer comers call.
Then took that Squire an horn of bugle small,
Which hong adowne his side in twisted gold,
And tasselles gay. Wide wonders over all
Of that same horns great virtues weren told,
Which had approved been in uses manifold.
Was never wight, that heard that shrilling sownd,
But trembling fear did feel in every vain;
Three miles it might be easy heard arownd,
And Echoes three aunswerd it self again:
No false enchauntment, nor deceiptfull train
Might once abide the terror of that blast,
But presently was void and wholly vain:
No gate so strong, no lock so firm and fast,
But with that percing noise flew open quite, or brast.
The same before the Geaunts gate he blew,
That all the castle quaked from the grownd,
And every door of freewill open flew:
The Gyaunt self dismayed with that sownd,
Where he with his Duessa dalliaunce fownd.
In have came rushing forth from inner bower,
With staring countenance stern, as one astownd,
And staggering steps, to weet, what suddein stowre,
Had wrought that horror strange, and dared his dreaded power.
And after him the proud Duessa came,
High mounted on her many headed beast,
And every head with fyrie tongue did flame,
And every head was crowned on his creast,
And bloody mouthed with late cruel feast.
That when the knight beheld, his mighty shild
Upon his manly arm he soon addressed,
And at him fiersly flew, with courage filled,
And eger greediness through every member thrild.
Therewith the Giant buckled him to fight,
Inflamd with scornful wrath and high disdain,
And lifting up his dreadful club on hight,
All armd with ragged snubbes and knottie grain,
Him thought at first encounter to have slain.
But wist and wary was that noble Pere,
And lightly leaping from so monstrous maine,
Did fair avoid the violence him nere;
It booted naught, to think, such thunderbolts to bear.
Ne shame he thought to shonne so hideous might,
The idle stroke, enforcing furious way,
Missing the mark of his misaymed sight
Did fall to ground, and with his heavy sway
So deeply dinted in the driven clay,
That three yardes deep a furrow up did throw:
The sad earth wounded with so sore assay,
Did groan full grievous underneath the blow,
And trembling with strange (...), did like an erthquake show.
As when almighty Jove in wrathful mood,
To wreake the guilt of mortal sins is bent,
Hurles forth his thundering dart with deadly food,
Enrold in flames, and smouldring dreriment,
Through riuen clouds and molten firmament;
The fires threeforked engine making way,
Both lofty towers and highest trees has rent,
And all that might his angry passage stay,
And shooting in the earth, castes up a mount of clay.
His boystrous club, so buried in the grownd,
He could not rearen up again so light,
But that the knight him at advantage fownd,
And whiles he strove his combred clubbe to quight,
Out of the earth, with blade all burning bright
He smott of his left arm, which like a block
Did fall to ground, deprived of native might;
Large streams of blood out of the truncked stock
Forth gushed, like fresh water stream from riuen rock.
Dismayed with so desperate deadly wound,
And eke impatient of unwonted pain,
He lowdly brayd with beastly yelling sownd,
That all the fields rebellowed again,
As great a noise, as when in Cymbrian plain
An heard of Bulls, whom kindly rage does sting,
Do for the milky mothers want complain,
And fill the fields with troublous bellowing,
The neighbor woods arownd with hollow murmuring.
That when his dear Duessa heard, and saw
The evil stownd, that daungerd her estate,
Unto his aid she hastily did draw
Her dreadful beast, who swollen with blood of late
Came ramping forth with proud (...) gate,
And threatened all his heads like flaming brandes.
But him the Squire made quickly to retrate,
Encountering fires with single sword in hand,
And twixt him and his Lord did like a bulwark stand.
The proud Duessa full of wrathful spite,
And fires disdain, to be affronted so,
Enforst her purple beast with all her might
That stop out of the way to ouerthroe,
Scorning the let of so unequal foe:
But nathemore would that corageous swayne
To her yield passage, against his Lord to go,
But with outrageous strokes did him restrain,
And with his body bard the way atwixt them twain.
Then took the angry witch her golden cup,
Which still she bore, replete with magic arts;
Death and despeyre did many thereof sup,
And secret poison through their inner parts,
The Eternal bale of heavy wounded hearts;
Which after charms and some enchauntments said,
She lightly sprinkled on his weaker parts;
Therewith his sturdie courage soon was quayd,
And all his senses were with suddein dread dismayed
So down he fell before the (...) beast,
Who on his neck his bloody claws did seize,
That life nigh crushed out of his panting breast:
No power he had to stir, nor will to (...).
That when the careful knight began well auise,
He lightly left the foe, with whom he fought,
And to the beast began turn his enterprise;
For wondrous anguish in his heart it wrought,
To see his loved Squyre into such thraldom brought.
And high aduauncing his blood-thirstie blade,
Stroke one of those deformed heads so sore,
That of his puissaunce proud ensample made;
His monstrous scalpe down to his teeth it tore,
And that misformed shape misshaped more:
A sea of blood gusht from the gaping wownd,
That her gay garments staynd with filthy gore,
And ouerflowed all the field arownd;
That over shoes in blood he waded on the grownd.
There at he rored for excecding pain,
That to have heard, great horror would have bred,
And scourging th'emptie air with his long train,
Through great impatience of his grieved head
His gorgeous ryder from her lofty sted
Would have cast down, and trodd in durty mire,
Had not the Gyaunt soon her succored;
Who all enraged with smartand frantic ire,
Came hurtling in full fires, and forced the knight retire.
The force, which wont in two to be dispersed,
In one alone left hand he now unites,
Which is through rage more strong then both were erst;
With which his hideous club aloft he dites,
And at his foe with furious rigor smites,
That strongest Oak might seem to overthrow:
The stroke upon his shield so heavy lites,
That to the ground it doubleth him full low
What mortal wight could ever beareso monstrous blow?
And in his fall his shield, that covered was,
Did loose his vele by chance, and open flew:
The light whereof, that heuens light did pas,
Such blazing brightness through the air threw,
That eye mote not the same endure to view.
Which when the Gyaunt spyde with staring eye,
He down let fall his arm, and foft withdrew
His weapon huge, that heaued was on hye,
For to have slain the man, that on the ground did lie.
And eke the fruitfull-headed beast, amazd
At flashing beams of that sunshiny shield,
Became stark blind, and all his senses dazd
That down he tumbled on the durtie field,
And seemd himself as conquered to yield.
Whom when his maistresse proud perceived to fall,
Whiles yet his feeble feet for faintness reeld,
Unto the Gyaunt lowdly she began call,
O help Orgoglio, help, or else we perish all.
At her so pitteous cry was much amo ou'd,
Her champion stout, and for to aid his friend,
Again his wonted angry weapon proou'd:
But all in vain: for he has redd his end
In that bright shield, and all their forces spend
Them selves in vain: for since that glauncing sight,
He has no pour to hurt, nor to defend;
As where The Almighty's lightning brond does light,
It dimmes the dazed eyes, and daunts the senses quight.
Whom when the Prince, to batteill new addressed,
And threatening high his dreadful stroke did see,
His sparkling blade about his head he blessed,
And smote off quite his right leg by the knee,
That down he tombled; as an aged tree,
High growing on the top of rocky clift,
Whose hartstrings with keen steel nigh hewn be,
The mighty trunck half rent, with ragged rift
Does roll adowne the rocks, and fall with fearful drift.
Or as a Castle reared high and round,
By subtle engines and malicious slight
Is undermined from the lowest ground,
And her foundation forced, and feebled quight,
At last down falls, and with her heaped hight
Herhastie ruin does more heavy make,
And yields it self unto the victours might;
Such was this Gyaunts fall, that seemd to shake
The steadfast globe of earth, as it for fear did quake.
The knight then lightly leaping to the pray,
With mortal steel him smot again so sore,
That headless his unwieldy body lay,
All wallowd in his own foul bloody gore,
Which flowed from his wounds in wondrous store.
But soon as breath out of her breast did pas,
That huge great body, which the Gyaunt bore,
Was vanished quite, and of that monstrous mas
Was nothing left, but like an empty blader was.
Whose grievous fall, when false Duessa spyde,
Her golden cup she cast unto the ground,
And crowned mitre rudely threw aside;
Such percing grief her stubborn heart did wound,
That she could not endure that doleful stound,
But leaving all behind her, fled away:
The light-foot Squyre her quickly turned around.
And by hard means enforcing her to stay,
So brought unto his Lord, as his deserved pray.
The royal Virgin, which beheld from far,
In pensive plight, and sad perplexity,
The whole atchieuement of this doubtful war,
Came running fast to greet his victory,
With sober gladness, and myld modesty,
And with sweet joyous cheer him thus bespake;
Fair branch of noblesse, flower of chevalrie,
That with your worth the world amazed make,
How shall I quite the pains, ye suffer for my sake?
And you fresh budd of virtue springing fast,
Whom these sad eyes saw nigh unto deaths door,
What has poor Virgin for such peril past,
Where with you to reward? Accept therefore
My simple self, and service evermore:
And he that high does sit, and all things see
With equal eye, their merits to restore,
Behold what ye this day have done for me,
And what I cannot quite, requite with vsuree.
But since the heavens, and your fair handeling
Have made you master of the field this day,
Your fortune master eke with governing,
And well begone end all so well, I pray,
Ne let that wicked woman escape away;
For she it is, that did my Lord bethrall,
My dearest Lord, and deep in dongeon lay,
Where he his better days has wasted all.
O hear, how piteous he to you for aid does call.
Forthwith he gave in charge unto his Squyre,
That scarlot whore to keepen carefully;
Whiles he himself with greedy great desire
(...) the Castle entered forcibly,
Where living creature none he did espy;
Then began he lowdly through the house to call:
But no man cared to answer to his cry.
There raignd a solemn silence over all,
Nor voice was heard, nor wight was seen in bower or hall.
At last with creeping crooked pace forth came
An old old man, with beard as white as snow,
That on a staff his feeble steps did frame,
And guide his weary gate both too and fro;
For his eye sight him failed long ygo,
And on his arm a bounch of keys he bore,
The which unused rust did ouergrow:
Those were the keys of every inner door,
But he could not them use, but kept them still in store.
But very uncouth sight was to behold,
How he did fashion his untoward pace,
For as he forward mooud his footing old,
So backward still was turned his wrincled face,
Unlike to men, who ever as they trace,
Both feet and face one way are wont to lead.
This was the ancient keeper of that place,
And foster father of the Gyaunt dead;
His name Ignaro did his nature right aread.
His reverend hears and holy grauitee
The knight much honored, as beseemed well,
And gently asked, where all the people be,
Which in that stately building wont to dwell.
Who answered him full soft, he could not tell.
Again he asked, where that same knight was laid,
Whom great (...) with his puissaunce fell
Had made his (...) thrall; again he said,
He could not tell: ne ever other answer made.
Then asked he, which way he in might pas:
He could not tell, again he answered,
Thereat the courteous knight displeased was,
And said, Old sire, it seems thou have not red
How ill it sits with that same silver head,
In vain to mock, or mocked in vain to be:
But if thou be, as thou art pourtrahed
With natures pen, in ages grave degree,
Aread in grauer wise, what I demand of thee.
His answer likewise was, he could not tell.
Whose senseless speech, and doted ignorance
When as the noble Prince had marked well,
He ghest his nature by his countenance,
And calmd his wrath with goodly temperance.
Then to him stepping, from his arm did reach
Those keys, and made himself free entrance.
Each door he opened without any breach;
There was no bar to stop, nor foe him to empeach.
There all within full rich arayd he found,
With royal arras and resplendent gold,
And did with store of every thing abound,
That greatest Princes presence might behold.
But all the floor (too filthy to be told)
With blood of guiltless babes, and innocents true,
Which there were slain, as sheep out of the fold,
Defiled was, that dreadful was to view,
And sacred ashes over it was strowed new.
And there beside of marble stone was built
An Altar, carved with cunning ymagery,
On which true Christians blood was often spilt,
And holy Martyrs often done to dye,
With cruel malice and strong tyranny:
Whose blessed sprites from underneath the stone
To God for vengeance cryde continually,
And with great grief were often heard to groan,
That hardest heart would bleed, to hear their piteous moan.
Through every rowme he sought, and every bowr,
But no where could he find that woeful thrall:
At last he came unto an iron door,
That fast was locked, but key found not at all
Emongst that bounch, to open it withal;
But in the same a little grate was pight,
Through which he sent his voice, and loud did call
With all his power, to weet, if living wight
Were housed therewithin, whom he enlargen might.
Therewith an hollow, dreary, murmuring voice
These pitteous plaintes and dolours did resound;
O who is that, which bringes me happy choice
Of death, that here lie dying every stound,
Yet live perforce in balefull darkness bound?
For now three Moons have changed thrice their hew,
And have been thrice hid underneath the ground,
Since I the heavens cheerful face did view,
O welcome thou, that do of death bring tidings true.
Which when that Champion heard, with percing point
Of pity dear his heart was thrilled sore,
And trembling horror ran through every joint,
For ruth of gentle knight so foul forlore:
Which shaking off, he rent that iron door,
With furious force, and indignation fell;
Where entered in, his foot could find no flore,
But all a deep descent, as dark as hell,
That breathed ever forth a filthy banefull smell.
But nether darkness foul, nor filthy bands,
Nor noyous smell his purpose could withhold,
(Entire affection hates nicer hands)
But that with constant zele, and courage bold,
After long pains and labors manifold,
He found the means that Prisoner up to rear;
Whose feeble thighs, unable to uphold
His pined corse, him scarce to light could bear,
A ruefull spectacle of death and ghastly drere.
His sad dull eyes deep sunck in hollow pits,
Could not endure th'vnwonted sun to view;
His bare thin cheeks for want of better bits,
And empty sides deceived of their dew,
Could make a stony heart his hap to rue;
His rawbone arms, whose mighty brawned bowrs
Were wont to riue steel plates, and helmets hew,
Were (...) consumed, and all his vital powers
Decayed, and al his flesh shronk up like withered flowers.
Whom when his Lady saw, to him she ran
With hasty joy: to see him made her glad,
And sad to view his visage pale and wan,
Who erst in flowers of freshest youth was clad.
Tho when her well of tears she wasted had,
She said, Ah dearest Lord, what evil star
On you has frownd, and pourd his influence bad,
That of your self ye thus berobbed arre,
And this misseeming hew your ma^ly looks does mar?
But welcome now my Lord, in well or woe,
Whose presence I have lackt too long a day;
And fie on Fortune mine (...),
Whose wrathful wreakes them selves do now alay.
And for these wrongs shall treble penance pay
Of treble good: good grows of evils priefe.
The chearelesse man, whom sorrow did dismay,
Had no delight to treaten of his grief;
His long endured famine needed more relief.
Fair Lady, then said that victorious knight,
The things, that grievous were to do, or bear,
Them to renew, I wot, breeds no delight;
Best music breeds delight in loathing ear:
But the only good, that grows of passed fear,
Is to be wise, and ware of like agein.
This days ensample has this lesson dear
Deep written in my heart with iron pen,
That bliss may not abide in state of mortal men.
Henceforth Sir knight, take to you wonted strength,
And master these mishaps with patient might;
Lo where your foe lies stretched in monstrous length,
And lo that wicked woman in your sight,
The (...) of all your care, and wretched plight,
Now in your power, to let her live, or die.
To do her die (quoth. Vna) were despite,
And shame t'auenge so weak an enemy;
But spoil her of her scarlot robe, and let her fly.
So as she bad, that witch they disaraid,
And robbed of royal robes, and purple pall,
And ornaments that richly were displaid;
Ne spared they to strip her naked all.
Then when they had despoyld her tire and call,
Such as she was, their eyes might her behold,
That her misshaped parts did them appall,
A loathly, wrinckled hag; ill favored, old,
Whose secret filth good manners bids not be told,
Her crafty head was altogether bald,
And as in hate of honorable eld,
Was ouergrowne with scurfe and filthy scald;
Her teeth out of her rotten gummes were feld,
And her sour breath abhominably smeld;
Her dried dugs, like bladders lacking wind,
Hong down, and filthy matter from them w eld;
Her wrizled skin as rough, as maple rind,
So scabby was, that would have loathd all womankind.
Her nether parts, the shame of all her kind,
My (...) Muse for shame does blush to write;
But at her rompe she growing had behind
A foxes tail, with dong all fowly dight;
And eke her feet most monstrous were in sight;
For one of them was like an Eagles claw,
With griping talaunts armd to greedy fight,
The other like a bears uneven paw:
More ugly shape yet never living creature saw.
Which when the knights beheld, amazd they were,
And wondered at so foul deformed wight.
Such then (said Vna) as she seems here,
Such is the face of falsehood, such the sight
Of foul Duessa, when her borrowed light
Is laid away, and counterfesaunce known.
Thus when they had the witch disrobed quight,
And all her filthy feature open shown,
They let her go at will, and wander ways unknown.
She flying fast from heavens hated face,
And from the world that her discovered wide,
Fled to the wastfull wilderness apace,
From living eyes her open shame to hide,
And lurkt in rocks and caves long vnespide.
But that fair crew of knights, and Vna fair
Did in that castle afterward abide,
To rest them selves, and weary powers repair,
Where store they fownd of al, that dainty was and rare.
Cant. IX.
His loves and lignage Arthure tells
the knights knitt friendly hands:
Sir Treuisan flies from Despeyre,
Whom Redcros knight withstands.
O goodly golden chain, wherewith yfere
The virtues linked are in lovely wize:
And noble minds of yore allied were,
In brave poursuitt of cheualrous emprize,
That none did others safety despize,
Nor aid envy to him, in need that stands,
But friendly each did others praise deuize,
How to advance with favorable hands,
As this good Prince redeemd the Redcrosse knight from bands.
Who when their powers empayrd through labor long,
With dew repast they had recured well,
And that weak captive wight now wexed strong,
Them list no longer there at leisure dwell,
But forward fare, as their adventures fell,
But ere they parted, Vna fair besought
That stranger knight his name and nation tell;
Least so great good, as he for her had wrought,
Should die unknown, and buried be in thankles thought.
Fair virgin (said the Prince) ye mere quire
A thing without the compass of my wit:
For both the lignage and the certain Sire,
From which I sprung, from me are hidden yitt.
For all so soon as life did me admit
Into this world, and showed heuens light,
From mothers pap I taken was unfit:
And straight delivered to a Fary knight,
To be vpbrought in gentle thewes and martial might.
Unto old Timon he me brought byliue,
Old Timon, who in youthly years has been
In warlike feats th'expertest man alive,
And is the wisest now on earth I ween;
His dwelling is low in a valley green,
Under the foot of Rauran mossy hoar,
From whence the river Dee as silver cleene
His tombling dillowes rolls with gentle rore:
There all my days he traind me up in virtuous lore.
Thither the great magicien Merlin came,
As was his use; ofttimes to visitt me
For he had charge my discipline to frame,
And Tutors nouriture to ouersee.
Him often and often I asked in priuity,
Of what loins and what lignage I did spring.
Whose answer bad me still assured be,
That I was son and heir unto a king,
As time in her just term the truth to light should bring.
Well worthy impe, said then the Lady gent,
And Pupil fit for such a Tutors hand.
But what adventure, or what high intent
Has brought you hither into Fary land,
Aread Prince Arthure, crown of Martial band?
Full hard it is (quoth. he) to read aright
The course of heavenly cause, or understand
The secret meaning of the eternal might,
That rules men's ways, and rules the thoughts of Luing wight.
For whether he through fatal deep foresight
Me hither sent, for cause to me vnghest,
Or that fresh bleeding wound, which day and night
Whilome does rancle in my riuen breast,
With forced fury following his behest,
Me hither brought by ways yet never found,
You to have helped I hold my self yet blessed.
Ah courteous knight (quoth she) what secret wound
Could ever find, to grieve the gentlest heart on ground?
Dear Dame (quoth he) you sleeping sparks awake,
Which troubled once, into huge flames will grow,
Ne ever will their fervent fury slake,
Till living moisture into smoke do flow,
And wasted life do lie in ashes low.
Yet since silence lesseneth not my fire,
But told it flames, and hidden it does glow,
I will reuele, what ye so much desire:
Ah Love, lay down thy bow, that whiles I may (...)
It was in freshest flower of youthly years,
When courage first does creep in manly chest,
Then first that cole of kindly heat appears
To kindle love in every living breast;
But me had warnd old Cleons wise behest,
Those creeping flames by reason to subdew,
Before their rage grew to so great unrest,
As miserable lovers use to rue,
Which still wex old in woe, whiles woe still wexeth new.
That idle name of love, and lovers life,
As loss of time, and virtues enemy
I ever scormd, and ioyd to (...) strife,
In midst of their mournful Tragedy,
Ay wont to laugh, when them I heard to cry,
And blow the fire, which them to ashes brent:
Their God himself, grieud at my liberty,
Shot many a dart at me with fires intent,
But I them warded all with wary government.
But all in vain: no fort can be so strong,
(...) breast can armed be so sownd,
But will at last be won with battrie long,
Or unawares at disauantage fownd:
Nothing is sure, that grows on earthly grownd:
And who most trustes in arm of fleshly might,
And boastes, in beauties chain not to bebownd,
Does soonest fall in disauentrous fight,
And yeeldes his caytiue neck to victours most despite.
Ensample make of him your hapless joy,
And of my self now mated, as ye see;
Whose prouder vaunt that proud auenging boy
Did soon pluck down, and curbd my libertee.
For on a day pricked forth with iollitee
Of looser life, and heat of hardiment,
Raunging the forest wide on courser free,
The fields, the floods, the heavens with one consent
Did seem to laugh at me, and favor mine intent.
For wearied with my sportes, I did alight
From lofty steed, and down to sleep me laid;
The verdant gras my couch did goodly dight,
And pillow was my helmett fair displayed:
Whiles every sense the humor sweet embayd,
And slombring soft my heart did steal away
Me seemed, by my side a royal Maid
Her dainty limbs full softly down did lay:
So fair a creature yet saw never sunny day.
Most goodly glee and lovely blandishment
She to me made, and badd me love her dear;
For dearly sure her love was to me bent,
As when just time expired should appear.
But whether dreams delude, or true it were,
Was never heart so ravished with delight,
Ne living man like words did ever hear,
As she to me delivered all that night;
And at her parting said, She Queen of Faries hight.
When I awoke, and found her place deuoyd,
And naught but pressed gras where she had lain,
I sorrowed all so much, as erst I ioyd,
And washed all her place with watery eyes.
From that day forth I loved that face divine;
From that day forth I cast in careful mind,
To seek her out with labor, and long tyne,
And never vowed to rest, till her I find,
Nine months I seek in vain yet ni'll that vow vnbynd.
Thus as he spoke, his visage wexed pale,
And change of hew great passion did bewray;
Yett still he strove to cloak his inward bale,
And hide the smoke, that did his fire display,
Till gentle Vna thus to him began say;
O happy Queen of Faries, that have fownd
Among many, one that with his prowess may
Defend thine honor, and thy foes confownd:
True Loves are often sown, but seldom grow on grownd
Thine, O then, said the gentle Redcrosse knight,
Next to that Ladies love, shall be the place,
O fairest virgin, full of heavenly light,
Whose wondrous faith, exceeding earthly race,
Was firmest fixed in mine extremest case.
And you, my Lord, the Patron of my life,
Of that great Queen may well gain worthy grace:
For only worthy you through prowes priefe
If living man mote worthy be, to be her liefe.
So (...) discoursing of their loves,
The golden Sun his glistring head began show,
And sad remembrance now the Prince amoues,
With fresh desire his voyage to pursew:
Als Vna earnd her traue ill to renew.
Then those two knights, fast friendship for to bynd,
And love establish each to other true,
Gave goodly gifts, the signs of grateful mind,
And eke as pledges firm, right hands together joined.
Prince (...) gave a box of Diamond sure,
Embowd with gold and gorgeous ornament,
Wherein were closd few drops of liquor pure,
Of wondrous worth, and virtue excellent,
That any wownd could heal incontinent:
Which to requite, the Redcrosse knight him gave
A book, wherein this Saueours testament
Was writ with golden letters rich and brave;
A work of wondrous grace, and hable souls to save.
Thus been they parted, Arthur on his way
To seek his love, and the other for to fight
With (...) foe, that all her realm did pray.
But she now weighing the decayed plight,
And shrunken synewes of her chosen knight,
Would not a while her forward course pursew,
Ne bring him forth in face of dreadful fight,
Till he recovered had his former hew:
For him to be yet weak and weary well she knew.
So as they traueild, lo they began espy
An armed knight toward them gallop fast,
That seemed from some feared foe to fly,
Or other griesly thing, that him aghast.
Still as he fledd, his eye was backward cast,
As if his fear still followed him behynd;
Als flew his steed, as he his bands had brast,
And with his winged heels did tread the wynd,
As he had been a fool of Pegasus his kind.
Nigh as he drew, they might perceive his head
To be unarmed, and curld vncombed hears
Vpstaring stiff, dismayed with uncouth dread;
Nor drop of blood in all his face appears
Nor life in limb: and to increase his fears,
In foul reproach of knighthoodes fair degree,
About his neck an hempen rope he wears,
That with his glistring arms does ill agree;
But he of rope or arms has now no memoree.
The Redcrosse knight toward him crossed fast,
To weet, what mister wight was so dismayed:
There him he finds all senseless and aghast,
That of him self he seemd to be afraid,
Whom hardly he from flying forward stayed,
Till he these words to him deliver might;
Sir knight, aread who has ye thus arayd,
And eke from whom make ye this hasty flight:
For never knight I saw in such misseeming plight.
He answered naught at all, but adding new
Fear to his first amazment, staring wide
With stony eyes, and hartlesse hollow hew,
Astonished stood, as one that had aspyde
Infernal furies, with their chains vntyde.
Him yett again, and yett again bespake
The gentle knight, who naught to him replyde,
But trembling every joint did inly quake,
And foltring tongue at last these words seemd forth to shake.
For Gods dear love, Sir knight, do me not stay;
For lo he comes, he comes fast after me.
Est looking back would feign have run away;
But he him forced to stay, and tellen free
The secret cause of his perplexity,
Yet nathemore by his bold hearty speech,
Could his blood frosen heart emboldened be,
But through his boldness rather fear did reach,
Yett forced, at last he made through silence suddein breach.
And am I now in safety sure (quoth he)
From him, that would have forced me to dye.
And is the point of death now turned fro me,
That I may tell this hapless history?
Fear naught: (quoth he) no danger now is nigh?
Then shall I you recount a ruefull case,
(Said he) the which with this unlucky eye
I late beheld, and had not greater grace
Me reft from it, had been partaker of the place.
I lately chaunst (Would I had never chaunst)
With a fair knight to keepen companee,
Sir Terwin hight, that well himself aduaunst
In all affairs, and was both bold and free,
But not so happy as mote happy be:
He loved, as was his lot, a Lady gent,
That him again loved in the least degree:
For she was proud, and of too high intent,
And ioyd to see her lover languish and lament.
From whom retourning sad and comfortless,
As on the way together we did fare,
We met that villen (God from him me bless)
That cursed wight, from whom I escaped whyleare,
A man of hell, that calls himself Despair:
Who first us greets, and after fair areedes
Of tydinges strange, and of adventures rare:
So creeping close, as Snake in hidden weeds,
Inquireth of our states, and of our knightly deeds.
Which when he knew, and felt our feeble hearts
Embost with bale, and bitter biting grief,
Which love had launched with his deadly darts,
With wounding words and terms of foul repriefe,
He plucked from us all hope of dew relief,
That erst us held in love of lingering life;
Then hopeless hartlesse, began the cunning thief
Persuade us dye, to stint all further strife:
To me he lent this rope, to him a rusty knife.
With which sad instrument of hasty death,
That woeful lover, loathing longer light,
A wide way made to let forth living breath.
But I more fearful, or more lucky wight,
Dismayed with that deformed dismal sight,
Fledd fast away, half dead with dying fear;
Ne yet assured of life by you, Sir knight,
Whose like infirmity like chance may bear:
But God you never let his charmed speeches hear.
How may a man (said he) with idle speech
Be won, to spoil the Castle of his health?
I wot (quoth he) whom trial late did teach,
That like would not for all this worlds wealth:
His subtle tongue, like dropping honny, mealt'h
Into the heart, and searches every vain,
That ere one be aware, by secret stealth
His power is reft, and weakness does remain.
O never Sir desire to try his guilefull train.
Certes (said he) hence shall I never rest,
Till I that treachours art have heard and tryde;
And you Sir knight, whose name mote I request,
Of grace do me unto his cabin guide.
I that hight Treuisan (quoth he) will ride
Against my liking back, to do you grace:
But nor for gold nor glee will I abide
By you, when ye arrive in that same place;
For (...) had I die, then see his deadly face.
Ere long they come, where that same wicked wight
His dwelling has, low in an hollow cave,
Far underneath a craggy clifty plight,
Dark, doleful, dreary, like a greedy grave,
That still for carrion carcases does crave:
On top whereof ay dwelt the ghastly Owl,
Shrieking his balefull note, which ever drove
Far from that haunt all other cheerful foul;
And all about it wandering ghostes did wayle and howl.
And all about old stocks and stubs of trees,
Whereon nor fruit, nor leaf was ever seen,
Did hang upon the ragged rocky knees;
On which had many wretches hanged been,
Whose carcases were scattred on the green,
And thrown about the clifts. Arrived there,
That bare-head knight for dread and doleful teene,
Would feign have fled, ne durst approchen near,
But the other forced him stay, and comforted in fear.
That darkesome cave they enter, where they find
That cursed man, low sitting on the ground,
Musing full sadly in his sullein mind;
His griesie locks, long grown, and unbound,
Disordred hong about his shoulders round,
And hid his face; through which his hollow eyne
Looked deadly dull, and stared as astound;
His raw-bone cheeks through penury and pine,
Were shronke into his jaws, as he did never dyne.
His garment naught but many ragged clouts,
With thorns together pind and patched was,
The which his naked sides he wrapped abouts;
And him beside there lay upon the gras
A dreary corse, whose life away did pas,
All wallowd in his own yet lukewarm blood,
That from his wound yet welled fresh alas;
In which a rusty knife fast fixed stood,
And made an open passage for the gushing flood.
Which piteous spectacle, approving true
The woeful tale, that Trevisan had told,
When as the gentle Redcrosse knight did view,
With fiery zeal he burnt in courage bold,
Him to avenge, before his blood were cold,
And to the villein said, Thou damned wight,
The author of this fact, we here behold,
What justice can but judge against thee right,
With thine own blood to price his blood, here shed in sight.
What frantic fit (quoth he) has thus distraught
Thee, foolish man, so rash a doom to give?
What justice ever other judgment taught,
But he should dye, who merits not to live?
None else to death this man despayring drive,
But his own guilty mind deserving death.
Is then unjust to each his dew to give?
Or let him dye, that loatheth living breath?
Or let him die at ease, that lives here uneath?
Who travails by the weary wandering way,
To come unto his wished home in haste,
And meets a flood, that does his passage stay,
Is not great grace to help him over past,
Or free his feet, that in the myresticke fast?
Most envious man, that grieves at neighbors good,
And fond, that ioyest in the woe thou have,
Why wilt not let him pass, that long has stood
Upon the bancke, yet wilt thy self not pas the flood?
He there does now enjoy eternal rest
And happy ease, which thou do want and crave,
And further from it daily wanderest:
What if some little pain the passage have,
That makes frail flesh to fear the bitter wave?
Is not short pain well borne, that bringes long ease,
And lays the soul to sleep in quiet grave?
Sleep after toil, port after stormy seas,
Ease after war, death after life does greatly pleafe.
The knight much wondered at his suddeine wit,
And said, The term of life limited,
Ne may a man prolong, nor shorten it;
The soldier may not move from watchful sted,
Nor leave his stand, until his Captain bed.
Who life did limit by almighty doom,
(Quoth he) knows best the terms established;
And he, that points the Centonell his room,
Does license him depart at sound of morning droome.
Is not his deed, what ever thing is done,
In heaven and earth? did not he all create,
To die again? all ends that was begone.
Their times in his eternal book of fate
Are written sure, and have their certain date.
Who then can strive with strong necessity,
That holds the world in his still changing state,
Or shun the death ordaynd by destiny?
When hour of death is come, let none ask whence, nor why.
The longer life, I wot the greater sin,
The greater sin, the greater punishment:
All those great battles, which thou boasts to win,
Through strife, and bloodshed, and auengement,
Now praysd, hereafter dear thou shall repent:
For life must life, and blood must blood repay.
Is not enough thy evil life forespent?
For he, that once has missed the right way.
The further he does go, the further he does stray.
Then do no further go, no further stray,
But herely down, and to thy rest betake,
The Will to prevent, that life ensewen may.
For what has life, that may it loved make,
And gives not rather cause it to forsake?
Fear, sickness, age, loss, labor, sorrow, strife,
Pain, hunger, cold, that makes the heart to quake;
And ever fickle fortune rages rife,
All which, and thousands mo do make a loathsome life.
Thou wretched man, of death have greatest need,
If in true ballaunce thou will weigh thy state:
For never knight, that dared warlike deed,
More luckless dissauentures did amate:
Witness the dungeon deep, wherein of late
Thy life shutt up, for death so often did call;
And though good luck prolonged has thy date,
Yet death then, would the like mishaps forestall,
Into the which heareafter thou may happen fall.
Why then do thou, O man of sin, desire
To draw thy days forth to their last degree?
Is not the measure of thy sinful hire
High heaped up with huge (...),
Against the day of wrath, to burden thee?
Is not enough, that to this Lady mild
Thou falsest have thy faith with periuree,
And sold thy self to serve Duessa vild,
With whom in all abuse thou have thy self defild?
Is not he just, that all this does behold
From highest heaven, and bears an equal eye?
Shall he thy sins up in his knowledge fold,
And guilty be of thine impiety?
Is not his law, Let every sinner die:
Die shall all flesh? what then must needs be done,
Is it not better to do willingly,
Then linger, till the glass be all out run?
Death is the end of woes: die soon, O faries son.
The knight was much enmoued with his speech,
That as a swords point through his (...) did perse,
And in his conscience made a secret breach,
Well knowing (...) all, that he did rehearse,
And to his fresh remembrance did reuerse,
The ugly view of his deformed crimes,
That all his manly powers it did disperse,
As he were charmed with inchaunted rimes,
That oftentimes he quakt, and fainted oftentimes.
In which amazement, when the Miscreaunt
Perceived him to waver weak and frail,
Whiles trembling horror did his conscience daunt,
And hellish anguish did his soul assail,
To drive him to despair, and quite to quail,
He showed him painted in a table plain,
The damned ghosts, that do in torments wail,
And thousand feends that do them endless pain
With fire and brimstone, which for ever shall remain.
The sight whereof so thoroughly him dismayed,
That naught but death before his eyes he saw,
And ever burning wrath before him laid,
By righteous sentence of The Almighty's law:
Then began the villein him to ouercraw,
And brought unto him swords, ropes, poison, fire,
And all that might him to perdition draw;
And bad him choose, what death he would desire:
For death was dew to him, that had prouokt Gods ire.
But whenas none of them he saw him take,
He to him raught a dagger sharp and keen,
And gave it him in hand: his hand did quake,
And tremble like a leaf of Aspin green,
And troubled blood through his pale face was seen
To come, and go with tidings from the heart,
As it a ronning messenger had been.
At last resolved to work his final smart,
He lifted up his hand, that back again did start.
Which whenas Vna heard, through every vain
The crudled cold ran to her well of life,
As in a swowne: but so one reliu'd again,
Out of his hand she snatched the cursed knife,
And threw it to the ground, enraged rife,
And to him said, Fie fie, faint hearted knight,
What meanest thou by this reproachful strife?
Is this the battle, which thou vauntst to fight
With that fire-mouthed Dragon, horrible and bright?
Come, come away, frail, feeble, fleshly wight,
Ne let vain words bewitch thy manly heart,
Ne devilish thoughts dismay thy constant spright.
In heavenly mercies have thou not a part?
Why should thou then despeire, that chosen art?
Where justice grows, there grows eke greter grace,
The which does quench the brond of hellish smart,
And that accursed handwriting does deface.
Arise, Sir knight arise, and leave this cursed place.
So up he rose, and thence amounted straight.
Which when the carle beheld, and saw his guest
Would safe depart, for all his subtle slight,
He chose an halter from among the rest,
And with it hong him self, vnbid unblessed.
But death he could not work himself thereby;
For thousand times he so him self had dressed,
Yet nathelesse it could not do him die,
Till he should die his last, that is eternally.
Cant. X.
Her faithful knight fair Vna brings
To house of Holiness,
Where he is taught repentance, and
The way to heavenly bless.
What man is he, that boasts of fleshly might,
And vain assurance of mortality,
Which all so soon, as it does come to fight,
Against spiritual foes, yields by and by,
Or from the field most cowardly does fly?
Ne let the man ascribe it to his skill,
That thorough grace has gained victory.
If any strength we have, it is to ill,
But all the good is Gods, both power and eke will.
By that, which lately happened, Vna saw,
That this her knight was feeble, and too faint;
And all his sinews woxen weak and raw,
Through long enprisonment, and hard constraint,
Which he endured in his late restraint,
That yet he was unfit for bloody fight:
Therefore to cherish him with diets daint.
She cast to bring him, where he chearen might,
Till he recovered had his late decayed plight.
There was an ancient house not far away,
Renowmd throughout the world for sacred lore,
And pure unspotted life: so well they say
It gouernd was, and guided evermore,
Through wisdom of a matrone grave and hoar;
Whose only joy was to relieve the needs
Of wretched souls, and help the helpelesse pore:
All night she spent in bidding of her bedes,
And all the day in doing good and godly deeds.
Dame Caelia men did her call, as thought
From heaven to come, or thither to arise,
The mother of three daughters, well vpbrought
In goodly thewes, and godly exercise:
The eldest two most sober, chaste, and wise,
Fidelia and Speranza virgins were,
Though spousd, yet wanting wedlocks solemnize;
But fair Charissa to a lovely fere
Was lincked, and by him had many pledges dear.
Arrived there, the door they find fast locked;
For it was warely watched night and day,
For fear of many foes: but when they knocked,
The Porter opened unto them straight way:
He was an aged sire, all hory gray,
With looks full lowly cast, and gate full slow,
Wont on a staff his feeble steps to stay,
Hight Humilta. They pass in stouping low;
For straight and narrow was the way, which he did show.
Each goodly thing is hardest to begin,
But entered in a spacious court they see,
Both plain, and pleasant to be walked in,
Where them does meet a francklin fair and free,
And entertaines with comely courteous glee,
His name was Zele, that him right well became,
For in his speeches and behaueour he
Did labor lively to express the same,
And gladly did them guide, till to the Hall they came.
There fayrely them receives a gentle Squyre,
Of myld demeanure, and rare courtesee,
Right cleanly clad in comely sad attire;
In word and deed that showed great modestee,
And knew his good to all of each degree,
Hight Reverence. He them with speeches meet
Does fair entreat; no courting nicetee,
But simple true, and eke unfeigned sweet,
As might become a Squyre so great persons to greet.
And afterward them to his Dame he leads,
That aged Dame, the Lady of the place:
Who all this while was busy at her beads:
Which done, she up arose with seemly grace,
And toward them full matronely did pace.
Where when that fairest Vna she beheld,
Whom well she knew to spring from heavenly race,
Her heart with joy unwonted inly sweld,
As feeling wondrous comfort in her weaker eld.
And her embracing said, O happy earth,
Whereon thy innocent feet do ever tread,
Most virtuous virgin borne of heavenly berth,
That to redeem thy woeful parents head,
From tyrans rage, and euer-dying dread,
Have wandered through the world now long a day;
Yett ceassest not thy weary soles to lead,
What grace has thee now hither brought this way?
Or done thy feeble feet vnweeting hither stray?
Strange thing it is an errant knight to see
Here in this place, or any other wight,
That hither turns his steps. So few there be,
That chose the narrow path, or seek the right:
All keep the broad high way, and take delight
With many rather for to go astray,
And be partakers of their evil plight,
Then with a few to walk the rightest way;
O foolish men, why have ye to your own decay?
Thy self to see, and tired limbs to rest,
O matrone sage (quoth she) I hither came,
And this good knight his way with me addressed,
Ledd with thy praises and broad-blazed fame,
That up to heaven is blown. The ancient Dame,
Him goodly greeted in her modest guyse,
And enterteynd them both, as best became,
With all the court'sies, that she could deuyse,
Ne wanted ought, to show her bounteous or wise.
Thus as they began of sondrie things devise,
Lo two most goodly virgins came in place,
Ylinked arm (...) arm in lovely wise,
With countenance demure, and modest grace,
They numbered even steps and equal pace:
Of which the eldest, that Fidelia hight,
Like sunny beams threw from her Crystal face,
That could have dazd the rash beholders sight,
And round about her head did shine like heuens light.
She was araied all in lilly white,
And in her right hand bore a cup of gold,
With wine and water filled up to the hight,
In which a Serpent did himself enfold,
That horror made to all, that did behold;
But she no whitt did change her constant mood:
And in her other hand she fast did hold
A book that was both signd and sealed with blood,
Wherein dark things were writ, hard to be understood.
Her younger Sister, that Speranza hight,
Was clad in blew, that her beseemed well;
Not all so cheerful seemed she of sight,
As was her sister; whether dread did dwell,
Or anguish in her heart, is hard to tell:
Upon her arm a silver anchor lay,
Whereon she leaned ener, as befell:
And ever up to heaven, as she did pray,
Her steadfast eyes were bent, ne swarued other way.
They seeing Vna, toward her began wend,
Who them encounters with like courtesee;
Many kind speeches they between them spend,
And greatly joy each other for to see:
Then to the knight with shamefast modesty
They turn them selves, at Vnaes meek request,
And him salute with well beseeming glee;
Who fair them quites, as him beseemed best,
And goodly began discourse of many a noble gest.
Then Vna thus; But she your sister dear,
The dear Charissa where is she become?
Or wants she health, or busy is elsewhere?
Ah no, said they, but forth she may not come:
For she of late is lightened of her womb,
And has encreast the world with one son more,
That her to see should be but troublesome.
Indeed (quoth she) that should be trouble sore,
But thankt be God, and her increase so evermore.
Then said the aged Coelia, Dear dame,
And you good Sir, I wot that of your toil,
And labors long, through which ye he there came,
Ye both forwearied be: therefore a while.
I read you rest, and to your bowres recoyle.
Then called she a Groom, that forth him ledd
Into a goodly lodge, and began despoile.
Of puissant arms, and laid in easy bed;
His name was meek Obedience rightfully aredd.
Now when their weary limbs with kindly rest,
And bodies were refresht with dew repast,
Fair Vna began Fidelia fair request,
To have her knight into her schoolehous plaste,
That of her heavenly learning he might taste,
And hear the wisdom of her words divine.
She granted, and that knight so much agraste,
That she him taught celestial discipline,
And opened his dull eyes, that light mote in them shine.
And that her sacred Book, with blood ywritt,
That none could read, except she did them teach.
She unto him disclosed every whitt,
And heavenly documents thereout did preach,
That weaker wit of man could never reach,
Of God, of grace, of justice, of free will,
That wonder was to hear her goodly speech:
For she was hable, with her words to kill,
And raise again to life the heart, that she did thrill.
And when she list pour out her larger spright,
She would command the hasty Sun to stay,
Or backward turn his course from heuen's hight,
Sometimes great hosts of men she could dismay,
And eke huge mountains from their native seat
She would command, themselves to bear away,
And throw in raging sea with roaring threat.
Almighty God her gave such power, and puissaunce great.
The faithful knight now grew in little space,
By hearing her, and by her sisters lore,
To such perfection of all heavenly grace;
That wretched world he began for to abhore,
And mortal life began loath, as thing forlore,
Greeud with remembrance of his wicked ways,
And pricked with anguish of his sins so sore,
That he desirde, to end his wretched days:
So much the dart of sinful guilt the soul dismayes,
But wise Speranza gave him comfort sweet,
And taught him how to take assured hold
Upon her silver anchor, as was meet;
Else had his sins so great, and manifold
Made him forget all, that Fidelia told.
In this distressed doubtful agony,
When him his dearest Vna did behold,
Disdeining life, desiring leave to dye,
She found her self assayld with great perplexity
And came to Coelia to declare her smart,
Who well acquainted with that commune plight,
Which sinful horror works in wounded heart,
Her wisely comforted all, that she might,
With goodly counsel and aduisement right;
And streightway sent with careful diligence,
To fetch a Leach, the which had great insight
In that disease of grieved conscience,
And well could cure the same; His name was Patience.
Who coming to that sowle-diseased knight,
Could hardly him entreat, to tell his grief:
Which known, and all that noyd his heavy spright,
Well searched, (...) he began apply relief.
Of salues and medicines, which had passing prief,
And there to added words of wondrous might:
By which to ease he him recured brief,
And much aswag'd the passion of his plight,
That he his pain endured, as seeming now more light.
But yet the cause and root of all his ill,
Inward corruption, and infected sin,
Not purged nor heald, behind remained still,
And festring sore did ranckle yett within,
Close creeping twixt the marow and the skin.
Which to extirpe, he laid him privily
Down in a darksome lowly place far in,
Whereas he meant his corrosiues to apply,
And with straight diet tame his stubborn malady.
In ashes and sackcloth he did array
His (...) corse, proud humors to abate,
And dieted with fasting every day,
The swelling of his wounds to mitigate,
And made him pray both early and eke late:
And ever as superfluous flesh did rott
Amendment ready still at hand did wayt,
To pluck it out with pincers fyrie whott,
That soon in him was left no one corrupted iott.
And bitter Penance with an iron whip,
Was wont him once to disple every day:
And sharp Remorse his heart did prick and nip,
That drops of blood thence like a well did play;
And sad Repentance used to embay,
His blamefull body in salt water sore,
The filthy blottes of sin to wash away.
So in short space they did to health restore
The man that would not live, but erst lay at deaths door.
In which his torment often was so great,
That like a Lion he would cry and rore,
And rend his flesh, and his own synewes (...).
His own dear Vna hearing evermore
His ruefull shriekes and gronings, often tore
Her guiltless garments, and her golden hear,
For pity of his pain and anguish sore;
Yet all with patience wisely she did bear;
For well she wist, his crime could else be never clear.
Whom thus recouer'd by wise Patience,
And true Repentance they to Vna brought;
Who joyous of his cured conscience,
Him dearly kissed, and fayrely eke besought
Himself to chearish, and consuming thought
To put away out of his careful breast.
By this Charissa, late in childbed brought,
Was woxen strong, and left her fruitful nest;
To her fair Vna brought this unacquainted guest.
She was a woman in her freshest age,
Of wondrous beauty, and of bounty rare,
With goodly grace and comely personage,
That was on earth not easy to compare;
Full of great love, but Cupids wanton snare
As hell she hated, chaste in work and will;
Her neck and breasts were ever open bare,
That ay thereof her babes might suck their fill;
The rest was all in yellow robes arrayed still.
A multitude of babes about her hong,
Playing their sportes, that ioyd her to behold;
Whom still she fed, whiles they were weak and young,
But thrust them forth still, as they wexed old:
And on her head she wore attire of gold,
Adornd with gemmes and owches wondrous fair,
Whose passing price uneath was to be told;
And by her side there sat a gentle pair
Of turtle doves, she sitting in an yuory chair.
The knight and Vna entering, fair her greet,
And bid her joy of that her happy brood;
Who them requites with court'sies seeming meet,
And entertaynes with friendly cheerful mood.
Then Vna her besought, to be so good,
As in her virtuous rules to school her knight,
Now after all his torment well withstood,
In that sad house of Penance, where his spright
Had past the pains of hell, and long enduring night.
She was rightioyious of her just request,
And taking by the hand that Faeries son,
Began him instruct in every good behest,
Of love, and righteousness, and well to done,
And wrath, and hatred warely to shonne,
That drew on men Gods hatred, and his wrath,
And many souls in dolours had fordonne:
In which when him she well instructed has,
From thence to heaven she teaches him the ready path.
Wherein his weaker wandering steps to guide,
An ancient matrone she to her does call,
Whose sober looks her wisdom well descryde:
Her name was Mercy, well known over all,
To be both gracious, and eke liberal:
To whom the careful charge of him she gave,
To lead aright, that he should never fall
In all his ways through this wide worlds wave,
That Mercy in the end his righteous soul might save.
The godly Matrone by the hand him bears
Forth from her presence, by a narrow way,
Scattred with bushy thorns, and ragged breares,
Which still before him she removed away,
That nothing might his ready passage stay:
And ever when his feet encombred were,
Or began to shrink, or from the right to stray,
She held him fast, and firmly did vpbeare,
As careful Nourse her child from falling often does rear.
Eftsoons unto an holy Hospital,
That was fore by the way, she did him bring,
In which seven Bead-men that had vowed all
Their life to service of high heavens king
Did spend their days in doing godly thing:
There gates to all were open evermore,
That by the weary way were traueiling,
And one sat waiting ever them before,
To call in-commers by, that needy were and pore.
The first of them that eldest was, and best,
Of all the house had charge and government,
As Guardian and Steward of the rest:
His office was to give entertainment
And lodging, unto all that came, and went:
Not unto such, as could him feast again,
And double quite, for that he on them spent,
But such, as want of harbor did constrain:
Those for Gods sake his dewty was to entertain.
The second was as Almner of the place,
His office was, the hungry for to feed,
And thristy give to drink, a work of grace:
He feared not once him self to be in need,
Ne cared to hoord for those, whom he did breed:
The grace of God he laid up still in store,
Which as a stock he left unto his seed;
He had enough, what need him care for more?
And had he less, yet some he would give to the pore.
The third had of their wardrobe custody,
In which were not rich tyres, nor garments gay,
The plumes of pride, and wings of vanity,
But clothes meet to keep keen cold away,
And naked nature seemly to array;
With which bare wretched wights he daily clad,
The images of God in earthly clay;
And if that no spare clothes to give he had,
His own cote he would cut, and it distribute glad.
The fourth appointed by his office was,
Poor prisoners to relieve with gracious aid,
And captives to redeem with price of bras,
From Turks and Sarazins, which them had stayed;
And though they faulty were, yet well he wayd,
That God to us forgiueth every hour
Much more then that, why they in bands were laid,
And he that harrowd hell with heavy stowre,
The faulty souls from thence brought to his heavenly bower.
The fifth had charge sick persons to attend,
And comfort those, in point of death which lay;
For them most needs comfort in the end,
When sin, and hell, and death do most dismay
The feeble soul departing hence away.
All is but lost, that living we bestow,
If not well ended at our dying day.
O man have mind of that last bitter throw;
For as the tree does fall, so lies it ever low.
The sixth had charge of them now being dead,
In seemly sort their corses to engraue,
And deck with dainty flowers their brydall bed,
That to their heavenly spouse both sweet and brave
They might appear, when he their souls shall save.
The wondrous workmanship of Gods own mould,
Whose face he made, all beasts to fear, and gave
All in his hand, even dead we honor should.
Ah dearest God me grant, I dead be not defould.
The seventh now after death and burial done,
Had charge the tender Orphans of the dead
And wydowes aid, least they should be undone:
In face of judgment he their right would plead,
Ne ought the power of mighty men did dread
In their defense, nor would for gold or fee
Be won their rightful causes down to tread:
And when they stood in most necessitee,
He did supply their want, and gave them ever free.
There when the Elfin knight arrived was,
The first and chiefest of the seven, whose care
Was guests to welcome, toward him did pas:
Where seeing Mercy, that his steps vpbare,
And always led, to her with reverence rare
He humbly louted in meek lowliness,
And seemly welcome for her did prepare:
For of their order she was Patroness,
Albe Charissa were their chiefest founderesse.
There she awhile him stays, him self to rest,
That to the rest more hable he might be:
During which time, in every good behest
And godly work of Alms and charitee
She him instructed with great (...);
Shortly therein so perfect he became,
That from the first unto the last degree,
His mortal life he learned had to frame
In holy righteousness, without rebuke or blame.
Thence forward by that painful way they pas,
Forth to an hill, that was both steep and hy;
On top whereof a sacred chapel was,
And eke a little Hermitage thereby
Wherein an aged holy man did lie,
That day and night said his devotion,
Ne other worldly business did apply;
His name was heavenly Contemplation;
Of God and goodness was his meditation.
Great grace that old man to him given had;
For God he often saw from heavens hight,
All were his earthly eien both blunt and bad,
And through great age had lost their kindly sight,
Yet wondrous quick and persaunt was his spright,
As Eagles eye, that can behold the Sun:
That hill they scale with all their power and might,
That his (...) thighs nigh (...), and fordonne
Began fail, but by her help the top at last he won.
There they do find that godly aged Sire,
With snowy locks adowne his shoulders shed,
As hoary frost with spangles does attire
The mossy branches of an Oak half ded.
Each bone might through his body well be red,
And every sinew seen through his long fast:
For naught he cared his carcas long unfed;
His mind was full of spiritual repast,
And pyn'd his flesh, to keep his body low and chaste.
Who when these two approaching he aspide,
At their first presence grew agrieued sore,
That forced him lay his heavenly thoughts aside;
And had he not that Dame respected more,
Whom highly he did reverence and adore,
He would not once have moved for the knight.
They him saluted standing far before;
Who well them greeting, humbly did requight,
And asked, to what end they clomb that redious hight.
What end (quoth. she) should cause us take such pain,
But that same end, which every living wight
Should make his mark, high heaven to attain?
Is not from hence the way, that leads right
To that most glorious house, that glistreth bright
With burning stars, and everliving fire,
Where of the keys are to thy hand behight
By wise Fidelia? she does thee require,
To show it to this knight, according his desire.
Thrice happy man, said then the father grave,
Whose staggering steps thy steady hand does lead,
And shows the way, his sinful soul to save.
Who better can the way to heaven aread,
Then thou thy self, that was both borne and bred
In heavenly throne, where thousand Angels shine?
Thou do est the prayers of the righteous sead
Present before the majesty divine,
And his auenging wrath to clemency incline.
Yet since thou bidst, thy pleasure shall be done.
Then come thou man of earth, and see the way,
That never yet was seen of Faries son,
That never leads the traueiler astray,
But after labors long, and sad delay,
Bring them to joyous rest and endless blis.
But first thou must a season fast and pray,
Till from her bands the spright assoiled is,
And have her strength recur'd from frail infirmitis.
That done, he leads him to the highest Mount;
Such one, as that same mighty man of God,
That blood-red billows like a walled front
On either side disparted with his rod,
Till that his army dry-foot through them yod,
Dwelt forty days upon; where writ in stone
With bloody letters by the hand of God,
The bitter doom of death and balefull moan
He did receive, whiles flashing fire about him shone.
Or like that sacred hill, whose head full hie,
Adornd with fruitful Olives all arownd,
Is, as it were for endless memory
Of that dear Lord, who often thereon was fownd,
For ever with a flowring girlond crowned:
Or like that pleasant Mount, that is foray
Through famous (...) verse each where renownd,
On which the thrife three learned Ladies play
Their heavenly notes, and make full many a lovely lay.
From (...), far off he unto him did show
A little path, that was both steep and long,
Which to a goodly City led his view;
Whose walls and towers were builded high and strong
Of perle and (...) stone, that earthly tongue
Cannot describe, nor wit of man can tell;
Too high a ditty for my simple song:
The City of the great king hight it well,
Wherein eternal peace and happiness does dwell.
As he thereon stood gazing, he might see
The blessed Angels to and fro descend.
From highest heaven, in gladsome companee,
And with great joy into that City wend,
As commonly as friend does with his friend.
Whereat he wondered much, and began enquere,
What stately building durst so high extend
Her lofty towers unto the starry sphere,
And what unknown nation there empeopled were.
Fair knight (quoth. he) (...) that is,
The new Jerusalem, that God has built
For those to dwell in, that are chosen his,
His chosen people purged from sinful guilt,
With piteous blood, which cruelly was spilt
On cursed tree, of that unspotted lam,
That for the sins of all the world was kilt:
Now are they Saints all in that City sam,
More dear unto their God, then you^glings to their dam.
Till now, said then the knight, I weened well,
That great Cleopolis, where I have been,
In which that fairest Fary Queen does dwell
The fairest City was, that might be seen;
And that bright tower all built of crystal clean,
Panthea, seemd the brightest thing, that was:
But now by proof all otherwise I ween;
For this great City that does far surpas,
And this bright Angels tower quite dims that tower of glass.
Most true, then said the holy aged man;
Yet is Gleopolis for earthly fame,
The fairest piece, that eye beholden can:
And well beseemes all knights of noble name,
That couett in the immortal book of fame
To be eternized, that same to haunt,
And done their service to that sovereign Dame,
That glory does to them for guerdon grant:
For she is heavenly borne, and heaven may justly vaunt.
And thou fair ymp, sprung out from English race,
How ever now accounted Elfins son,
Well worthy do thy service for her grace,
To aid a virgin desolate foredonne.
But when thou famous victory have won,
And high emongst all knights have hong thy shield,
Thenceforth the suitt of earthly conquest shonne,
And wash thy hands from guilt of bloody field:
For blood can naught but sin, and wars but sorrows yield.
Then seek this path, that I to thee presage,
Which after all to heaven shall thee send;
Then peaceably thy painful pilgrimage
To yonder same Jerusalem do bend,
Where is for thee ordaind a blessed end:
For thou emongst those Saints, whom thou do see,
Shall be a Saint, and thine own nations friend
And Patron: thou Saint George shall called be,
Saint George of merry England, the sign of victoree.
Unworthy wretch (quoth. he) of so great grace,
How dare I think such glory to attain;
These that have it attaynd, were in like case
As wretched men, and lived in like pain.
But deeds of arms must I at last be feign,
And Ladies love to leave so dearly bought?
What need of arms, where peace does ay remain,
(Said he) and bitter battles all ate fought?
As for loose loves they'are vain, and vanish into naught.
O let me not (quoth he) then turn again
Back to the world, whose joys so fruitless are,
But let me hear for aie in peace remain,
Or straight way on that last long voyage fare,
That nothing may my present hope empare.
That may not be (said he) ne may thou yitt
Forgo that royal maids bequeathed care,
Who did her cause into thy hand committ,
Till from her cursed foe thou have her freely quitt.
Then shall I soon, (quoth. he) so God me grace,
Abett that virgins cause disconsolate,
And shortly back return unto this place,
To walk this way in Pilgrims poor estate.
But now aread, old father, why of late
Did thou behight me borne of English blood,
Whom all a Faeries son done nominate?
That word shall I (said he) auouchen good,
Since to thee is unknown the cradle of thy brood.
For well I wot, thou springst from ancient race
Of Saxon kings, that have with mighty hand
And many bloody battles fought in (...)
High reard their royal throne in Britans land
And vanquished them, unable to withstand:
From thence a Faery thee (...) reft,
There as thou slepst in tender swaddling band,
And her base Elfin brood there for thee left.
Such men do Chaungelings call, so chaungd by Faeries theft.
Thence she thee brought into this Faery land,
And in an heaped furrow did thee hyde,
Where thee a Ploughman all vnweeting fond,
As he his toylesome teme that way did guide,
And btought thee up (...) ploughmans state to bide,
Whereof Georgos he thee gave to name;
Till pricked with courage, and thy forces pride,
To Fary court thou came to seek for fame,
And prove thy puissaunt arms, as seems thee best became.
O holy Sire (quoth he) how shall I quight
The many favors I with thee have fownd,
That have my name and nation redd aright,
And taught the way that does to heaven bownd?
This said, adowne he looked to the grownd,
To have returned, but dazed were his eyne,
Through passing brightness, which did quite confound
His feeble sense, and too exceeding shine.
So dark are earthly things compard to things divine.
At last whenas himself he began to find,
To Vna back he cast him to retire;
Who him awaited still with pensive mind.
Great thanks and goodly meed to that good sire,
He thens departing gave for his pains hyre.
So came to Vna, who him ioyd to see,
And after little rest, began him desire,
Of her adventure myndfull for to be.
So leave they take of Coelia, and her daughters three.
Cant XI.
The knight with that old Dragon fights
two days incessantly:
The third him overthrows, and gayns
most glorious victory.
HIgh time now began it wex for Vna fair,
To think of those her captive Parents dear,
And their for wasted kingdom to repair:
Whereto whenas they now approached near,
With hearty words her knight she began to cheer,
And in her modest manner thus bespake;
Dear knight, as dear, as ever knight was dear,
That all these sorrows suffer for my sake,
High heaven behold the tedious toil, ye for me take.
Now are we come unto my native soil,
And to the place, where all our perilles dwell;
Here hauntes that feend, and does his daily spoil,
Therefore henceforth be it your keeping well,
And ever ready for your foeman fell.
The spark of noble courage now awake,
And strive your excellent self to excel;
That shall ye evermore renowned make,
Above all knights on earth, that batteill undertake.
With that they heard a roaring hideous sownd,
That all the air with terror filled wide,
And seemd uneath to shake the steadfast ground.
Eftsoons that dreadful Dragon they espyde,
Where stretched he lay upon the sunny side,
Of a great hill, himself like a great hill.
But all so soon, as he from far descryde
Those glistring arms, that heaven with light did fill,
He rousd himself full blyth, and hastened them until.
Then badd the knight this Lady yede aloof,
And to an hill her self withdraw aside,
From whence she might behold that battailles proof
And e^ke be safe from danger far descryde:
She him obayd, and turned a little wide,
Now O thou sacred Muse, most learned Dame,
Fair ympe of Phoebus, and his aged bryde,
The Nourse of time, and everlasting fame,
That warlike hands ennoblest with immortal name;
O gently come into my feeble breast,
Come gently, but not with that mighty rage,
Wherewith the martial troops thou do infest,
And hearts of great Heroes do enrage,
That naught their kindled courage may aswage,
Soon as thy dreadful trompe begins to sownd;
The God of war with his fires equipage
Thou do awake, sleep never he so sownd,
And feared nations do with horror stern astownd.
Fair Goddess lay that furious fit aside,
Till I of wars and bloody Mars do sing,
And Bryton fields with Sarazin blood bedyde,
Twixt that great faery Queen and Paynim king,
That with their horror heaven and earth did ring,
A work of labor long, and endless praise:
But now a while let down that haughty string,
And to my tunes thy second tenor raise,
That I this man of God his godly arms may blaze.
By this the dreadful Beast drew nigh to hand,
Half flying, and half footing in his haste,
That with his largeness measured much land,
And made wide shadow under his huge waste;
As mountain does the valley ouercaste.
Approaching nigh, he reared high before
His body monstrous, horrible, and vaste,
Which to increase his wondrous greatness more,
Was swollen with wrath, and poison, and with bloody gore.
And over, all with brazen scales was armd,
Like plated cote of steel, so couched near,
That naught mote perce, ne might his corse be harmd
With dint of swerd, nor push of pointed spear,
Which as an Eagle, seeing pray appear,
His aerie plumes does rouse, full rudely dight,
So shaked he, that horror was to hear,
For as the clashing of an Armor bright,
Such noise his rouzed scales did send unto the knight.
His flaggy wings when forth he did display,
Were like two sails, in which the hollow wynd
Is gathered full, and works speedy way:
And eke the pens, that did his pineons bynd,
Were like mayne-yardes, with flying canuas kind,
With which whenas him list the air to beat,
And there by force unwonted passage find,
The clouds before him fledd for terror great,
And all the heuens stood still amazed with his threat.
His huge long tail wownd up in hundred foldes,
Does ouerspred his long bras-scaly back,
Whose wreathed boughtes when ever he vnfoldes,
And thick entangled knots adown does slack,
Bespotted all with shieldes of red and black,
It sweepeth all the land behind him far,
And of three furlongs does but little lack;
And at the point two stinges in fixed arre,
Both deadly sharp, that sharpest steel exceeden far.
But stinges and sharpest steel did far exceed
The sharpness of his cruel rending claws;
Dead was it sure, as sure as death in deed,
What ever thing does touch his ravenous paws,
Or what within his reach he ever draws.
But his most hideous head my tongue to tell,
Does tremble: for his deep devouring jaws
Wide gaped, like the griesly mouth of hell,
Through which into his dark abyss all rauin fell.
And that more wondrous was, in either iaw
Three ranckes (...) teeth enraunged were,
In which yett trickling blood and gobbets raw
Of late devoured bodies did appear,
That sight thereof bredd cold congealed fear:
Which to increase, and all atonce to kill,
A cloud of smoothering smoke and sulphur sear
Out of his stinking gorge forth steemed still,
That all the air about with smoke and stench did fill.
His blazing eyes, like two bright shining shieldes,
Did burn with wrath, and sparkled living fire;
As two broad Beacons, set in open fields,
Send forth their flames far of to every shyre,
And warning give, that enemies conspyre,
With fire and sword the region to invade;
So flamed his eyne with rage and rancorous ire:
But far within, as in a hollow glade,
Those glaring lamps were set, that made a dreadful shade.
So dreadfully he toward him did pas,
Forelifting up a loft his speckled breast,
And often bounding on the bruised gras,
As for great ioyaunce of his new come guest.
Eftsoons he began advance his haughty crest,
As chauffed Bore his bristles does vpreare,
And shoke his scales to battle ready dressed;
That made the Redcrosse knight nigh quake for fear,
As bidding bold defyaunce to his foeman near.
The knight began fayrely couch his steady spear,
And fiercely ran at him with rigorous might:
The pointed steel arriving rudely theare,
His harder hyde would nether perce, nor bight,
But glauncing by forth passed forward right;
Yet sore amoued with so puissaunt push,
The wrathful beast about him turned light,
And him so rudely passing by, did brush
With his long tail, that horse and man to ground did rush.
Both horse and man up lightly rose again,
And fresh encounter toward him addressed:
But th'ydle stroke yet back recoyld in vain,
And found no place his deadly point to rest.
Exceeding rage enflamed the furious beast,
To be avenged of so great despite;
For never felt his imperceable breast
So wondrous force, from hand of living wight;
Yet had he proved the power of many a puissant knight.
Then with his wauing wings displayed wide,
Himself up high he lifted from the ground,
And with strong flight did forcibly diuyde
The yielding air, which nigh too feeble found
Her flitting parts, and element unsound,
To bear so great a weight: he cutting way
With his broad sails, about him soared round:
At last low stouping with unwieldy sway,
Snatched up both horse and man, to bear the^ quite away.
Long he them bore above the subject plain,
So far as Ewghen bow a shaft may send,
Till struggling strong did him at last constrain,
To let them down before his flightes end:
As hagard hawk presuming to contend
With hardy foul, above his hable might,
His weary pounces all in vain does spend,
To trusse the pray too heavy for his flight;
Which coming down to ground, does free it self by fight.
He so disseized of his gryping gross,
The knight his thrillant spear again assayd
In his bras-plated body to embosse,
And three men's strength unto the stroke he Iayd;
Wherewith the stiff (...) quaked, as affrayd,
And glauncing from his scaly neck, did glyde
Close under his left wing, then broad displayed.
The percing steel there wrought a wound full wide,
That with the uncouth smart the Monster lowdly cryde.
He cryde, as raging seas are wont to rore,
When wintry storm his wrathful wreck does threat,
The rolling billows beat the ragged shore,
As they the earth would shoulder from her seat,
And greedy gulf does gape, as he would eat
His neighbor element in his revenge:
Then gin the blustering brethren boldly threat,
To move the world from off his steadfast henge,
And boystrous battle make, each other to avenge.
The steely head stuck fast still in his flesh,
Till with his cruel claws he snatched the wood,
And quite a sunder broke. Forth flowed fresh
A gushing river of black gory blood,
That drowned all the land, whereon he stood;
The stream thereof would drive a water-mill.
Trebly angmented was his furious mood
With bitter sense of his deep rooted ill,
That flames of fire he threw forth from his large nosethril.
His hideous tail then hurled he about,
And therewith all enwrapt the nimble thyes
Of his froth-fomy steed, whose courage stout
Striving to loose the knott, that fast him ties,
Himself in streighter bands too rash implies,
That to the ground he is perforce constraynd
To throw his ryder: who can quickly rise
From of the earth, with durty blood distaynd,
For that reproachful fall right fowly he disdaynd.
And fercely took his trenchand blade in hand,
With which he stroke so furious and so fell,
That nothing seemd the puissaunce could withstand:
Upon his crest the hardened iron fell,
But his more hardened crest was armd so well,
That deeper dint therein it would not make;
Yet so extremely did the buffe him quell,
That from thenceforth he shund the like to take,
But when he saw them come, he did them still forsake.
The knight was wroth to see his stroke beguyld,
And smot again with more outrageous might;
But back again the sparcling steel recoyld,
And left not any mark, where it did light;
As if in Adamant rock it had been pight,
The beast impatient of his smarting wound,
And of so fierce and forcible despite,
Thought with his wings to stye above the ground;
But his late wounded wing unserviceable found.
Then full of grief and anguish vehement,
He lowdly brayd, that like was never heard,
And from his wide devouring oven sent
A flake of fire, that flashing in his beard,
Him all amazd, and almost made afeard:
The scorching flame sore swinged all his face,
And through his armor all his body seard,
That he could not endure so cruel case,
But thought his arms to leave, and helmet to unlace.
Not that great Champion of the antique world,
Whom famous Poets verse so much does vaunt,
And has for twelve huge labors high extold,
So many furies and sharp fits did haunt,
When him the poisoned garment did enchaunt
With Centaures blood, and bloody verses charmd,
As did this knight twelve thousand dolours daunt,
Whom fyrie steel now burnt, that erst him armd,
That erst him goodly armd, now most of all him harmd.
Faint, weary, sore, emboyled, grieved, brent
With heat, toil, wounds, arms, smart, and inward fire
That never man such mischiefs did torment;
Death better were, death did he often desire,
But death will never come, when needs require.
Whom so dismayed when that his foe beheld,
He cast to suffer him no more respire,
But began his sturdy stern about to weld,
And him so strongly stroke, that to the ground him feld.
It fortuned (as fair it then befell,)
Behynd his back vnweeting, where he stood,
Of ancient time there was a springing well,
From which fast trickled forth a silver flood,
Full of great virtues, and for medicine good.
Whylome, before that cursed Dragon got
That happy land, and all with innocent blood
Defyld those sacred waves, it rightly hot
The well of life, ne yet his virtues had forgot.
For unto life the dead it could restore,
And guilt of sinful crimes clean wash away,
Those that with sickness were infected sore,
It could recure, and aged long decay
Renew, as it were borne that very day.
Both Silo this, and Jordan did excel,
And The English Bath, and eke the german Spau,
Ne can Cephise, nor Hebrus match this well:
Into the same the knight back overthrown, fell.
Now began the golden Phoebus for to steep
His fiery face in billows of the west;
And his faint steedes watered in Ocean deep,
Whiles from their iournall labors they did rest,
When that infernal Monster, having kest
His weary foe into that living well,
Can high advance his broad discolored breast,
Above his wonted pitch, with countenance sell,
And clapped his iron wings, as victor he did dwell.
Which when his pensive Lady saw from far,
Great woe and sorrow did her soul assay,
As weening that the sad end of the war,
And began to highest God entirely pray,
That feared chance from her to turn away;
With folded hands and knees full lowly bent
All night she watched, ne once adowne would lay
Her dainty limbs in her sad dreriment,
But praying still did wake, and waking did lament.
The morrow next began early to appear,
That Titan rose to run his daily tace;
But early ere the morrow next began rear
Out of the sea fair Titans deawy face,
Up rose the gentle virgin from her place,
And looked all about, if she might spy
Her loved knight to move his manly (...):
For she had great doubt of his safety,
Since late she saw him fall before his enemy.
At last she saw, where he vpstarted brave
Out of the well, wherein he drenched lay;
As Eagle fresh out of the Ocean wave,
Where he has left his plumes all hory gray,
And decked himself with feathers youthly gay,
Like Eyas hawk up mounts unto the skies,
His newly budded pineons to assay,
And merueiles at him self, still as he flies:
So view this newborn knight to battle new did (...).
Whom when the damned feend so fresh did spy,
No wonder, if he wondered at the sight,
and doubted, whether his late enemy
It were, or other new supplied knight.
He, now to prove his late renewed might,
High brandishing his bright deaw-burning blade,
Upon his crested scalp so sore did smite,
That to the scull a yawning wound it made:
The deadly dint his dulled senses all dismayed.
I wot not, whether the revenging steel
Were hardened with that holy water dew,
Wherein he fell, or sharper edge did feel,
Or his baptized hands now greater grew;
Or other secret virtue did ensew;
Else never could the force of fleshly arm,
Ne molten metal in his blood embrew:
For till that stownd could never wight him harm,
By subtilty, nor slight, nor might, nor mighty charm.
The cruel wound enraged him so sore,
That loud he yielded for exceeding pain;
As hundred ramping Lions seemd to rore,
Whom ravenous hunger did thereto constrain:
Then began he toss aloft his stretched train,
And there with scourge the buxome air so sore,
That to his force to yielden it was feign;
Ne ought his sturdy strokes might stand before,
That high trees overthrew, and rocks in pieces tore.
The same aduauncing high above his head,
With sharp intended sting so rude him smott,
That to the earth him drove, as stricken dead,
Ne living wight would have him life behott:
The mortal sting his angry needle shot
Quite through his shield, and in his shoulder seasd,
Where fast it stuck, ne would thereout be got:
The grief thereof him wondrous sore diseasd,
Ne might his rancling pain with patience be appeasd.
But yet more mindful of his honor dear,
Then of the grievous smart, which him did wring,
From loathed soil he can him lightly rear,
And strove to loose the far infixed sting:
Which when in vain he tryde with struggeling,
Inflamed with wrath, his raging blade he hefte,
And struck so strongly, that the knotty string
Of his huge tail he quite a sonder clefte,
Five ioints thereof he hewd, and but the stump him left.
Heart cannot think, what outrage, and what cries,
With foul enfouldred smoke and flashing fire,
The hell-bred beast threw forth unto the skies,
That all was covered with darkness dire:
Then fraught with rancour, and engorged ire,
He cast at once him to (...) for all,
And gathering up himself out of the mire,
With his uneven wings did fiercely fall,
Upon his sunne-bright shield, and grypt it fast withal.
Much was the man encombred with his hold,
In fear to lose his weapon in his paw,
Ne wist yett, how his talaunts to unfold;
For harder was from Cerberus greedy iaw
To pluck a bone, then from his cruel claw
To reaue by strength, the griped gage away:
Thrice he assayd it from his foot to draw,
And thrice in vain to draw it did assay,
It booted naught to think, to rob him of his pray.
Tho when he saw no power might prevail,
His trusty sword he called to his last aid,
Wherewith he fiersly did his foe assail,
And double blows about him stoutly laid,
That glauncing fire out of the iron played;
As sparckles from the Anduile use to fly,
When heavy hammers on the wedg are swaid;
Therewith at last he forced him to vnty
One of his grasping feet, him to defend threby.
The other foot, fast fixed on his shield
Whenas no strength, nor stroks (...) him constrain
To loose, ne yet the warlike pledge to yield,
He smott thereat with all his might and maine,
(...) naught so wo^drous puissaunce might sustain;
Upon the joint the lucky steel did light,
And made such way, that (...) it quite in twain;
The paw yett missed not his minisht might,
But hong still on the shield, as it at first was pight.
For grief thereof, and devilish despite,
From his infernal fournace forth he threw
Huge flames, that dimmed all the heuens light,
Enrold in duskish smoke and brimstone blew;
As burning Aetna from his boiling (...)
Does belch out flames, and rocks in pieces broke,
And ragged ribs of mountains molten new,
(...) in coleblacke clouds and filthy smoke,
That all the land with ste^ch, and heaven with horror choke.
The heat whereof, and harmefull pestilence
So sore him noyd, that forced him to retire
A little backward for his best defense,
To save his body from the scorching fire,
Which he from hellish entrails did expire.
It chaunst (eternal God that chance did guide)
As he recoiled backward, in the mire
His nigh foreweried feeble feet did slide,
And down he fell, with dread of shame sore terrifide.
There grew a goodly tree him fair beside,
Laden with fruit and apples rosy redd,
As they in pure vermilion had been did,
Whereof great virtues over all were redd:
For happy life to all, which thereon fedd,
And life eke everlasting did befall:
Great God it planted in that blessed stedd
With his Almighty hand, and did it call
The tree of life, the crime of our first fathers fall.
In all the world like was not to be fownd,
Save in that soil, where all good things did grow,
And freely sprung out of the fruitful grownd,
As incorrupted Nature did them sow,
Till that dredd Dragon all did ouerthow.
Another like fair tree eke grew thereby,
Whereof who so did eat, eftsoons did know
Both good and ill: O mournful memory:
That tree through one ma^s fault has done us all to die.
From that first tree forth flowd, as from a well,
A trickling stream of Balm, most sovereign
And dainty dear, which on the ground still fell,
And ouerflowed all the fertile plain,
As it had deawed been with timely rain:
Life and long health that (...) ointment gave,
And deadly wounds could heal, and rear again
The senseless corse appointed for the grave.
Inio that same he fell: which did from death him save.
For nigh thereto the ever damned Beast
Durst not approach, for he was deadly made,
And all that life preserved, did detest:
Yet he it often aduentur'd to invade.
By this the drouping daylight began to fade,
And yied his rowme to sad succeeding night,
Who with her sable mantle began to shade
The face of earth, and ways of living wight,
And high her burning torch set up in heaven bright.
When gentle Vna saw the second fall
Of her dear knight, who weary of long (...),
And faint through loss of blood, moved not at all, might
But lay as in a dream of deep delight,
Besmeard with precious Balm, whose virtuous
Did heal his wounds, and scorching heat alay,
Again she stricken was with sore affright,
And for his safety began devoutly pray;
And watch the noyous night, and wait for joyous day.
The joyous day began early to appear,
And fair Aurora from the deawy bed
Of aged Tithone began her self to rear,
With rosy cheeks, for shame as (...) red;
Her golden locks for have were loosely (...)
About her ears, when Vna her did mark
Clymbe to her charet, all with flowers spread;
From heaven high to chase the chearelesse dark,
With merry note her loud salutes the mounting lark.
Then freshly up arose the doughty knight,
All healed of his hurts and wounds wide,
And did himself to battle ready dight;
Whose early foe awaiting him beside
To have deuourd, so soon as day he spyde,
When now he saw himself so freshly rear,
As if late fight had naught him damnifyde,
He woxe dismayed, and began his fate to fear;
Nathlesse with wonted rage he him advanced near.
And in his first encounter, gaping wide,
He thought attonce him to have swallowd quight,
And rusht upon him with outrageous pride;
Who him rencountring fierce, as hawk in flight,
Perforce rebutted back. The weapon bright
Taking advantage of his open (...),
Ran through his mouth with so importune might,
That deep emperst his darksom hollow maw,
And back retyrd, his life blood forth with all did draw.
So down he fell, and forth his life did breath;
That vanished into smoke and clouds swift;
So down he fell, that the'arth him underneath
Did groan, as feeble so great load to lift;
So down he fell, as an huge rocky clift,
Whose false foundation waves have washed away,
With dreadful poyse is from the mayneland rift,
And (...) down, great Neptune does dismay;
So down he fell, and like an (...) mountain lay.
The knight him self even trembled at his fall,
So huge and horrible a mass it seemd;
And his (...) Lady, that beheld it all,
Durst not approach for dread, which she misdeemd,
But yet at last, whenas the (...)
She saw not stir, of-shaking (...) affright,
She nigher drew, and saw that joyous end:
Then God she praysd, and thankt her faithful knight,
That had atchieude so great a conquest by his might.
Cant. XII.
Fair Una to the Redcrosse knight
betrouthed is with joy:
Though false Duessa it to bar
Her false sleightes do employ.
BEhold I see the haven nigh at hand,
To which I mean my weary course to bend;
Vere the maine shete, and bear up with the land,
The which before is fayrly to be kend,
And seems safe from storms, that may offend;
There this fair virgin weary of her way
Must landed be, now at her iourneyes end:
There eke my feeble bark a while may stay,
Till merry wynd and weather call her thence away.
Scarsely had Phoebus in the glooming East
Yett harnessed his fyrie-footed teeme,
Ne reard above the earth his flaming creast,
When the last deadly smoke aloft did steeme,
That sign of last outbreathed life did seem,
Unto the watchman on the castle wall;
Who thereby dead that balefull Beast did deem,
And to his Lord and Lady loud began call,
To tell, how he had seen the Dragons fatal fall,
Vprose with hasty joy, and feeble speed
That aged Sire, the Lord of all that land,
And looked forth, to weet, if true indeed
Those tydinges were, as he did understand,
Which whenas true by try all he out fond,
He badd to open wide his brazen gate,
Which long time had been shut, and out of hond
Proclaimed joy and peace through all his state;
For dead now was their foe, which them forrayed late.
Then began triumphant Trompets sownd on hye,
That sent to heaven the ecchoed report
Of their new joy, and happy victory
Against him, that had them long oppressed with tort,
And fast imprisoned in sieged fort.
Then all the people, as in solemn feast,
To him assembled with one full consort,
Rejoicing at the fall of that great beast,
From whose eternal bondage now they were releast.
Forth came that ancient Lord and (...) Queen,
Arayd in antique robes down to the grownd,
And sad habiliments right well (...);
A noble crew about them waited rownd
Ofsage and sober Peers, all gravely gownd;
Whom far before did march a goodly band
Of tall young men, all hable arms to sownd,
But now they laurel branches bore in hand;
Glad sign of victory and peace in all their land.
Unto that doughtie Conqueror they came,
And him before themselves prostrating low,
Their Lord and Patron loud did him proclaim,
And at his feet their laurel boughs did throw.
Soon after them all dancing on a row
The comely virgins came, with girlands dight,
As fresh as flowers in meadow green do grow,
When morning deaw upon their leaves does light:
And in their hands sweet Timbrels all vpheld on hight.
And them before, the fry of children young
Their wanton sportes and childish mirth did play,
And to the Maidens sownding tymbrels song
In well attuned notes, a joyous lay,
And made delightful music all the way,
Until they came, where that fair virgin stood;
As fair Diana in fresh summers day,
Beholdes her Nymphs, enraung'd in shady wood,
Some wrestle, some do run, some bathe in crystal flood,
So she beheld those may dens meriment.
With cheerful view; who when to her they came,
Themselves to ground with gracious humblesse (...)
And her adored by honorable name,
Lifting to heaven her everlasting fame:
Then on her head they set agirlond green,
And crowned her twixt earnest and twixt game;
Who in her self-resemblance well beseene,
Did seem such, as she was, a goodly maiden Queen.
And after all the rascal many ran,
Heaped together in rude rablement,
To see the face of that victorious man:
Whom all admired, as from heaven sent,
And gazd upon with gaping wonderment,
But when they came, where that dead Dragon Iay,
Stretched on the ground in monstrous large extent,
The sight with idle fear did them dismay,
Ne durst approach him nigh, to touch, or once assay.
Some feared, and fledd; some (...) and well it saynd;
One that would wiser seem, then all the rest,
Warnd him not touch, for yet perhaps remaynd
Some lingering life within his hollow breast,
Or in his womb might lurk some hidden nest
Of many Dragonettes, his fruitful seed;
Another said, that in his eyes did rest
Yet sparckling fire, and badd thereof take heed;
Another said, he saw him move his eyes indeed.
One mother, whenas her foolehardy child
Did come to near, and with his talants play
Half dead through fear, her little babe reuyld,
And to her gossibs began in counsel say;
How can I tell, but that his talents may
Yet scratch my son, or rend his tender hand.
So diversely them selves in vain they fray;
Whiles some more bold, to measure him (...) stand,
To prove how many acres he did spread ofland.
Thus flocked all the folk him rownd about,
The whiles that hoarie king, with all his train,
Being arrived, where that champion stout
After his foes defeasaunce did remain,
Him goodly greetes, and fair does entertayne,
With princely gifts of yuory and gold,
And thousand thanks him yeeldes for all his pain.
Then when his daughter dear he does behold,
Her dearly does embrace, and kisseth manifold.
And after to his Palace he them bringes,
With shaumes, and trompets, and with Clarions sweet;
And all the way the joyous people singes,
And with their garments strowes the paued street
Whence mounting up, they find purueyaunce meet
Of all, that royal Princes court became,
And all the floor was underneath their feet
Be spredd with costly scarlott of great name,
On which they lowly sit, and fitting purpose frame.
What needs me tell their feast and goodly guize,
In which was nothing riotous nor vain?
What needs of dainty dishes to deuize,
Of comely services, or courtly train?
My narrow leaves cannot in them vntayne
The large discourse of royal Princes state.
Yet was their manner then but bare and plain:
For th'antique world excess and pride did hate;
Such proud luxurious pomp is swollen up but late.
Then when with meats and drinks of every kind
Their fervent appetites they quenched had,
That ancient Lord began fit occasion find,
Of strange adventures, and of perils sad,
Which in his travel him befallen had,
For to demand of his renowned guest:
Who then with vtt'rance grave, and countenance sad,
From point to point, as is before expressed,
Discourst his voyage long, according his request.
Great pleasure mixed with pitiful regard,
That godly King and Queen did passionate,
Whiles they his pitiful adventures heard,
That often they did lament his lucklesse state,
And often blame the too importune fate,
That heapd on him so many wrathful wreakes:
For never gentle knight, as he of late,
So tossed was in fortunes cruel freakes;
And all the while salt tears bedeawd the hearers cheaks.
Then said that royal Pere in sober wise;
Dear Son, great been the evils, which ye bore
From first to last in your late enterprise,
That I note, whether praise, or pity more:
For never living man, I ween, so fore
In sea of deadly dangers was distressed;
But since now safe ye seized have the shore,
And well arrived are, (high God be blessed)
Let us deuize of ease and everlasting rest.
Ah dearest Lord, said then that doughty knight,
Of ease or rest I may not yet deuize;
For by the faith, which I to arms have plight,
I bownden am straight after this emprize,
As that your daughter can ye well aduize,
Back to return to that great Faery Quueene,
And her to serve six years in warlike wize,
Against that proud Paynim king, that works her teene:
Therefore I ought crave pardon, till I there have been.
Unhappy falls that hard necessity,
(Quoth he) the troubler of my happy peace,
And vowed foe of my felicity;
Ne I against the same can justly preace:
But since that band ye cannot now release,
Nor done undo; (for vows may not be vain)
Soon as the (...) of those six years shall cease,
Ye then shall hither back return again,
The marriage to accomplish vowed betwixt you twayn.
Which for my part I covet to perform,
In sort as through the world I did proclaim,
That who so killed that monster most deforme,
And him in hardy battle overcame,
Should have mine only daughter to his Dame,
And of my kingdom heir apparaunt be:
Therefore since now to thee perteynes the (...),
By dew desert of noble cheualree,
Both daughter and eke kingdom, lo I yield to thee.
Then forth he called that his daughter fair,
The fairest Vn' his only daughter dear,
His only daughter, and his only hair;
Who forth proceeding with sad sober cheer,
As bright as does the morning star appear
Out of the East, with flaming locks bedight,
To tell that dawning day is drawing near,
And to the world does bring long wished light;
So fair and fresh that Lady showed her self in sight.
So fair and fresh, as freshest flower in May;
For she had laid her mournful stole aside,
And widow-like sad wimple thrown away,
Wherewith her heavenly beauty she did hide,
Whiles on her weary journey she did ride;
And on her now a garment she did wear,
All lilly white, withoutten spot, or pride,
That seemd like silk and silver wouen near,
But neither silk nor silver therein did appear.
The blazing brightness of her beauties beam,
And glorious light of her sunshyny face
To tell, were as to strive against the stream,
My ragged rimes are all too rude and bace,
Her heavenly lineaments for to enchace.
Ne wonder; for her own dear loved knight,
All were she daily with himself in place,
Did wonder much at her celestial sight:
Often had he seen her fair, but never so fair dight.
So fairly dight, when she in presence came,
She to her Sire made humble reverence,
And bowed low, that her right well became,
And added grace unto her excellence:
Who with great wisdom, and grave eloquence
Thus began to say. But ear he thus had said,
With flying speed, and seeming great pretense,
Came running in, much like a man dismayed,
A Messenger with letters, which his message said.
All in the open hall amazed stood,
At suddeinnesse of that unwary sight,
And wondered at his breathless hasty mood.
But he for naught would stay his passage right,
Till fast before the king he did alight;
Where falling flat, great humblesse he did make,
And kissed the ground, whereon his foot was pight;
Then to his hands that writ he did betake,
Which he disclosing, read thus, as the paper spoke.
To thee, most mighty king of Eden fair,
Her greeting sends in these sad lines addressed,
The woeful daughter, and forsaken heir
Of that great Emperor of all the West;
And bids thee be aduized for the best,
Ere thou thy daughter linck in holy band
Of wedlock to that new unknown guest:
For he already plighted his right hand
Unto another love, and to another land.
To me sad maid, or rather widow sad,
He was affyaunced long time before,
And sacred pledges he both gave, and had,
Falfe erraunt knight, infamous, and forswore:
Witness the burning Altars, which he swore,
And guilty heavens of his bold perjury,
Which though he has polluted often of yore,
Yet I to them for judgment just do fly,
And them conjure t'auenge this shameful injury.
Therefore since mine he is, or free or bond,
Or false or true, or living or else dead,
Withhold, O sovereign Prince, your hasty hond
From knitting league with him, I you aread;
Neweene my right with strength adowne to tread,
Through weakness of my widowhed, or woe:
For truth is strong, her rightful cause to plead,
And shall find friends, if need requires so.
So bids thee well to fare, Thy neither friend, nor foe, Fidessa.
When he these bitter biting words had red,
The tidings strange did him abashed make,
That still he sat long time astonished
As in great muse, ne word to creature spoke.
At last his solemn silence thus he brake,
With doubtful eyes fast fixed on his guest;
Redoubted knight, that for mine only sake
Thy life and (...) late aduenturest,
Let naught be hid from me, that ought to be expressed.
What mean these bloody vows, and idle threats,
Thrown out from womanish impatient mind?
What heuens? what altars? what enraged heates
Here heaped up with terms of love unkind,
My conscience clear with guilty bands would bynd?
High God be witness, that I guiltless ame.
But if your self, Sir knight, ye faulty find,
Or wrapped be in (...) of former Dame,
With cry (...) do not it cover, but disclose the same.
To whom the Redcrosse knight this answer sent,
My Lord, my king, be naught hereat dismayed,
Till well ye wot by grave intendiment,
What woman, and wherefore does me upbraid
With breach of love, and loialty betrayed.
It was in my mishaps, (...) hitherward
I lately traueild, that unawares I stayed
Out of my way, through perils strange and hard;
That day should fail me, ere I had them all declard.
There did I find, or rather I was fownd
Of this false woman, that Fidessa hight,
Fidessa hight the falsest Dame on grownd,
Most false Duessa, royal richly dight,
That easy was to inueigle weaker sight:
Who by her wicked arts, and wiely skill,
Too false and strong for earthly skill or might,
Unawares me wrought unto her wicked will,
And to my foe betrayed, when least I feared ill.
Then stepped forth the goodly royal Maid,
And on the ground her self prostrating low,
With sober countenance thus to him said;
O pardon me, my sovereign Lord, to sheow
The secret treasons, which of late I know
To have been wrought by that false (...).
She only she it is, that erst did throw
This gentle knight into so great distress,
That death him did awaite in daily wretchedness.
And now it seems, that she suborned has
This crafty messenger with letters feign,
To work new woe and improuided (...),
By breaking of the band betwixt us twain;
Wherein she used has the practicke pame
Of this false footman, clokt with simplenesle,
Whom if ye please for to discover plain,
Ye shall him Archimage find, I guess,
The falsest man alive; woe tries shall find no less.
The king was greatly moved at her speech,
And all with suddein indignation freight,
Bad on that Messenger rude hands to reach.
Eftsoons the Guard, which on his state did wait,
Attacht that faytor false, and bound him strait:
Who seeming sorely chauffed at his band,
As chained bear, whom cruel dogs do bait,
With idle force did feign them to withstand,
And often semblaunce made to escape out of their hand.
But they him laid full low in dungeon deep,
And bound him hand and foot with iron chains.
And with continual watch did warely keep;
Who then would think, that by his subtle trains
He could escape foul death or deadly pains?
Thus when that Princes wrath was pacifide,
He began renew the late forbidden bains,
And to the knight his daughter dear he tide,
With sacred rites and vows for ever to abide.
His own two hands the holy knotts did knitt,
That none but death for ever can divide;
His own two hands, for such a turn most fit,
The housling fire did kindle and provide,
And holy water thereon sprinkled wide;
At which the bushy Teade a groom did light,
And sacred lamp in secret chamber hide,
Where it should not be quenched day nornight,
For fear of evil fates, but burnen ever bright.
Then began they sprinckle all the posts with wine,
And made great feast to solemnize that day;
They all (...) with frankincense divine,
And precious odours fetched from far away,
That all the house did sweat with great array:
And all the while sweet Music did apply
Her curious skill, the warbling notes to play,
To drive away the dull (...);
The whiles one sung a song of love and iollity.
During the which there was an heavenly noise
Heard sownd through all the Palace pleasantly,
Like as it had been many an Angels voice,
Singing before the eternal majesty,
In their trinall triplicitles on hye;
Yett wist no creature, whence that heavenly sweet
Proceeded, yet eachone felt secretly
Himself thereby (...) of his senses meet,
And ravished with rare impression in his sprite.
Great joy was made that day of young and old,
And solemn feast proclaymd throughout the land,
That their exceeding merth may not be told:
Snffice it hear by signs to understand
The usual joys at (...) of loves band.
Thrice happy man the knight himself did hold,
Possessed of his Ladies heart and hand,
And ever, when his eye did her behold,
His heart did seem to melt in pleasures manifold.
Her joyous presence and sweet company
(...) full (...) there did long (...),
Ne wicked (...), (...)
His dear delights were hable to annoy:
Yet swimming in that sea of (...) joy,
He naught (...), how he whilome had sworn,
Incase he could that (...) beast destroy,
Unto his (...) Queen back to (...):
The which he shortly did, and Vna left to mourn.
Now strike your sails ye jolly Mariners,
For we be come unto a quiet rode,
Where we must land some of our passengers,
And light this weary vessel of her lode.
Here she a while may make her safe abode,
Till she repaired have her tackles spent,
And wants supplide. And then again abroad
On the long voyage whereto she is bent:
Well may she speed and fairly finish her intent.
Finis Lib. I.
The second Book of the Faerie Queen. Containing The Legend of Sir Guyon. OR
Of Temperaunce.


RIght well I wot most mighty Sovereign,
That all this famous antique history,
Of some th'aboundance of an idle brain
Will judged be, and painted forgery,
Rather then matter of just memory,
Since none, that breaths living air, does know,
Where is that happy land of Faery,
Which I so much doc vaunt, yet no where show,
But vouch antiquities, which no body can know.
But let that man with better sense aduize,
That of the world least part to us is red:
And daily how through hardy enterprise,
Many great Regions are discovered,
Which to late age were never mentioned,
Who ever heard ofth'Indian Peru
Or who in venturous vessel measured
The Amarons huge river now found true
Or fruitfullest Virginia who did ever (...).
Yet all these were when no man did them know
Yet have from wisest ages hidden been
And later times things more unknown shall show
Why then should witless man so much misweene
That nothing is but that which he has seen?
What if within the Moons fair shining sphere
What if in (...) other star unseen
Of other worlds he happily should hear
He (...) would much more, yet such to some appear
Of faery land yet if he more inquyre
By certain signs here set in sondrie place
He may it find; ne let him then admyre
But yield his sense to be too blunt and bace
That n'ote without an hound fine footing trace
And then O fairest Princess under sky
In this fair mirrhour may behold thy face
And thine own realms in land of Faery
And in this antique image thy great auncestry.
The which O pardon me thus to enfold
In covert vele and wrap in shadows light
That feeble eyes your glory may behold
Which else could not endure those beams bright
But would be dazzled with exceeding light
O pardon and vouchsafe with patient ear
The brave adventures of this faery knight
The good Sir Guyon graciously to hear
In whom great rule of Temp'raunce goodly does appear.
Cant I.
Guyon by Archimage abusd,
the Redcrosse kniggt awaytes,
Fyndes Mordant and Amauia slain
With pleasures poisoned baytes.
THat conning Architect of cancred guyle,
Whom Princes late displeasure left in bands,
For falsed letters and suborned wyle,
Soon as the Redcrosse knight he understands,
To been departed out of Eden lands,
To serve again his sovereign Elfin Queen,
His arts he moves, and out of caytiues hands
Himself he frees by secret means unseen;
His shackles empty left, him self escaped cleene.
And forth he fares full of malicious mind,
To worken mischief and auenging woe,
Where ever he that godly knight may find,
His only heart sore, and his only foe,
Since Vna now he algates must forgo,
Whom his victorious hands did erst restore
To native crown and kingdom late ygoe:
Where she enioyes sure peace for evermore,
As wetherbeaten ship arryu'd on happy shore.
Him therefore now the object of his spite
And deadly food he makes: him to offend
By forged treason, or by open fight
He seeks, of all his drifte the aimed end:
Thereto his subtle engines he does bend
His practick wit, and his fair fyled tongue,
With thousand other sleightes: for well he kend,
His credit now in doubt full ballaunce hong;
For hardly could be hurt, who was already stong.
Still as he went, he crafty stales did lay.
With cunning traynes him to entrap unawares,
And privy spyals plast in all his way,
To weete what course he takes, and how he fares;
To ketch him at a vauntage in his snares.
But now so wise and wary was the knight
By trial of his former harms and cares,
That he descryde, and shonned still his slight:
The fish that once was caught, new bait will hardly byte.
Nath'lesse th'Enchaunter would not spare his pain,
In hope to win occasion to his will;
Which when he long awaited had in vain,
He chaungd his mind from one to other ill:
For to all good he enemy was still.
Upon the way him fortuned to meet,
Fair marching underneath a shady hill,
A goodly knight, all armd in harness meet,
That from his head no place appeared to his feet.
His carriage was full comely and upright,
His countenance demure and temperate,
But yett so stern and terrible in sight,
That cheard his friends, and did his foes amate:
He was an Elfin borne of noble state,
And mickle worship in his native land,
Well could he tourney and in lists debate,
And knighthood took of good Sir Huons hand,
When with king Oberon he came to Fary land.
Him als accompanyd upon the way
A comely Palmer, clad in black attire,
Of rypest years, and hears all hoarie gray,
That with a staff his feeble steps did stire,
Least his long way his aged limbs should tire:
And if by looks one may the mind aread,
He seemd to be a sage and sober sire,
And ever with slow pace the knight did lead,
Who taught his trampling steed with equal steps to tread.
Such whenas Archimago them did view,
He weened well to work some uncouth wyle,
Eftsoons vntwisting his (...) clew,
He began to weaue a web of wicked guyle,
And with fair countenance and flattring style,
To them approaching, thus the knight bespake:
Fair son of Mars, that seek with warlike spoil.
And great atchieu'ments great your self to make,
Vouchsafe to stay your steed for humble misers sake.
He stayed his steed for humble misers sake,
And badd tell on the tenor of his playnt;
Who feigning then in every limb to quake,
Through inward fear, and seeming pale and faint
With piteous moan his percing speech began paynt;
Dear Lady how shall I declare thy case,
Whom late I left in languorous constraynt?
Would God thy self now present were in place,
To tell this ruefull tale; thy sight could win thee grace.
Or rather would, O would it so had chaunst,
That you, most noble Sir, had present been,
When that lewd rybauld with vile lust aduaunst
Laid first his filthy hands on virgin cleene,
To spoil her dainty corpse so fair and sheene,
As on the earth, great mother of us all,
With living eye more fair was never seen,
Of chastity and honor virginal:
Witness ye heavens, whom she in vain to help did call.
How may it be, sdyd then the knight half wroth,
That knight should knighthood ever so have shent?
None but that saw (quoth. he) would ween for troth,
How shamefully that Maid he did torment.
Her looser golden locks he rudely rent,
And drew her on the ground, and his sharp sword,
Against her snowy breast he fiercely bent,
And threatened death with many a bloody word;
Tongue hates to tell the rest, that eye to see abhord.
Therewith amoued from his sober mood,
And lives he yet (said he) that wrought this act,
And done the heavens afford him vital food?
He lives, (quoth he) and boasts of the fact,
Ne yet has any knight his courage cracked.
Where may that treach our then (said he) be found,
Or by what means may I his footing tract?
That shall I show (said he) as sure, as hound
The stricke^ Dear does chaleng by the bleeding wound.
He stayed not longer talk, but with fierce ire
And zealous haste away is quickly gone,
To seek that knight, where him that crafty Squyre
Supposd to be. They do arrive anon,
Where sat a gentle Lady all alone,
With garments rent, and hear discheueled,
Wringing her hands, and making piteous moan;
Her swollen eyes were much disfigured,
And her fair face with tears was fowly blubbered.
The knight approaching nigh, thus to her said,
Fair Lady, through foul sorrow ill bedight,
Great pity is to see you thus dismayed,
And mar the blossom of your beauty bright:
For thy appease your grief and heavy plight,
And tell the cause of your conceived pain:
For if he live, that has you done despite,
He shall you do dew recompense again,
Or else his wrong with greater puissance maintain.
Which when she heard, as in despightfull wise,
She wilfully her sorrow did augment,
And offered hope of comfort did despise:
Her golden locks most cruelly she rent,
And scratcht her face with ghastly dreriment,
Ne would she speak, nesee, ne yet be seen,
But hid her visage, and her head down bent,
Either for grievous shame, or for great (...),
As if her heart with sorrow had transfixed been.
Till her that Squyre bespake, Madame my life,
For Gods dear love be not so wilful bent,
But do vouchsafe now to receive relief,
The which good fortune does to you present.
For what boots it to weep and to wayment,
When ill is chaunst, but does the ill increase,
And the weak mind with double woe torment?
When she her Squyre heard speak, she began (...)
Her voluntary pain, and feel some secret ease.
(...) she said, Ah gentle trusty Squyre,
What comfort can I woeful wretch conceive,
Or why should ever I henceforth desire,
To see fair heavens face, and life not leave,
Since that false Traitor did my honor reaue?
False traitor certes (said the Faerie knight)
I read the man, that ever would deceive
A gentle Lady, or her wrong through might:
Death were too little pain for such a foul despite.
But now, fair Lady, comfort to you make,
And read, who has ye wrought this shamfull plight.
That short revenge the man may overtake,
Where so he be, and soon upon him light.
Certes (said she) I wot not, how he hight,
But under him a gray steed he did wield,
Whose sides with dapled circles weren dight;
Upright he rode, and in his silver shield
He bore a bloody Cross, that quartred all the field.
Now by my head (said Guyon) much I muse,
How that same knight should do so foul amiss,
Or ever gentle Damzell so abuse:
For may I boldly say, he surely is
A right good knight, and true of word ywis:
I present was, and can it witness well,
When arms he swore, and straight did enterpris
Th'aduenture of the Errant damozell,
In which he has great glory won, as I hear tell.
Nathlesse he shortly shall again be tryde,
And fairly quit him of th'imputed blame,
Else be ye sure he dearly shall abide,
Or make you good amendment for the same:
All wrongs have mendes, but no amends of shame.
Now therefore Lady, rise out of your pain,
And see the saluing of your blotting name.
Full loath she seemd thereto, but yet did feign,
For she was inly glad her purpose so to gain.
Her purpose was not such, as she did feign,
Ne yet her person such, as it was seen,
But under simple show and semblant plain
Lurkt false Duessa secretly unseen,
As a chaste Virgin, that had wronged been:
So had false Archimago her disguysd,
To cloak her guile with sorrow and sad teene;
And eke himself had craftily deuisd
To be her Squire, and do her (...) well aguisd.
Her late forlorn and naked he had found,
Where she did wander in waste wilderness,
Lurking in rocks and caves far under ground,
And with green moss cou'ring her nakedness,
To hide her shame and loathly filthiness,
Since her Prince Arthur of proud ornaments
And borrowd beauty spoyld. Her nathelesse
Th'enchaunter finding fit for his intents,
Did thus reuest, and decked with dew habiliments.
For all he did, was to deceive good knights,
And draw them from pursuit of praise and fame,
To slug in sloth and sensual delights,
And end their days with irrenowmed shame.
And now exceeding grief him overcame,
To see the Redcrosse thus advanced hye;
Therefore this crafty engine he did frame,
Against his praise to stir up enmitye
Of such, as virtues like mote unto him allye.
So now he Guyon guydes an uncouth way
Through woods and mountains, till they came at last
Into a pleasant dale, that (...) lay
Betwixt two hills, whose high heads ouerplast,
The valley did with cool (...) ouercast;
Through midst thereof a little river rold,
By which there sat a knight with helm vnlaste,
Himself refreshing with the liquid cold,
After his travel long, and labors manifold.
Lo yonder he, cryde Archimage alowd,
That wrought the shameful fact, which I did show,
And now he does himself in secret shroud,
To fly the vengeance for his outrage dew;
But vain: for ye shall dearly do him rue,
So God ye speed, and send you good success;
Which we far off will here abide to view.
So they him left, inflamed with wrathfulnesse,
That straight against that knight his spear he did address.
Who seeing him from far so fierce to prick,
His warlike arms about him began embrace,
And in the rest his ready spear did stick;
Tho when as still he saw him toward pace,
He began rencounter him in equal race:
They been ymett, both ready to affrap,
When suddeinly that warrior began abace
His threatened spear, as if some new mishap
Had him betide, or hidden danger did entrap.
And cryde, Mercy Sir knight, and mercy Lord,
For mine offense and heedelesse hardiment,
That had almost committed crime abhord,
And with reproachful shame mine honor shent,
Whiles cursed steel against that badge I bent,
The sacred badge of my Redeemers death,
Which on your shield is set for ornament:
But his fierce foe his steed could stay uneath,
Who pricked with couragekene, did cruel battle breath
But when he heard him speak, straight way he knew
His error, and himself inclyning said,
Ah dear Sir Guyon, well becomes you,
But me behooves rather to upbraid,
Whose hasty hand so fat from reason strayd,
That almost it did heinous violence
On that fair image of that heavenly Maid,
That decks and arms your shield with fair defense:
Your court'sie takes on you another dew offense,
So been they both at one, and done vpreare
Their beuers bright, each other for to greet;
Goodly comportaunce each to other bear,
And entertain themselves with court'sies meet;
Then said the Redcrosse knight, Now mote I weet,
Sir Guyon, why with so fierce saliaunce,
And fell intent ye did at erst me meet;
For since I know your goodly governance,
Great cause, I ween, you guided, or some uncouth chance.
Certes (said he) well mote I shame to tell
The fond encheason, that me hither led.
A false infamous faitour late befell
Me for to meet, that seemed ill bested,
And playnd of grievous outrage, which he red
A knight had wrought against a Ladiegent;
Which to avenge, he to this place me led,
Where you he made the mark of his intent,
And now is fled, foul shame him follow, where he went.
So can he turn his earnest unto game,
Through goodly handling and wise temperaunce.
By this his aged Guide in presence came,
Who soon as one that knight his eye did glaunce,
Eft soones of him had perfect cognizaunee,
Since him in Faery court he late auizd;
And said, fair son, God give you happy chance,
And that dear Cross upon your shield deuizd,
Wherewith above all knights ye goodly seem aguizd.
Joy may you have, and everlasting fame,
Of late (...) hard atchieu'ment by you done,
For which enrolled is your glorious name
In heavenly Regesters above the Sun,
Where you a Saint with Saints your seat have wo^ne:
But wretched we, where ye have left your mark,
Most now anew begin, like race to run;
God guide thee, Guyon, well to end thy warke,
And to the wished haven bring thy weary bark.
Palmer, him answered the Redcrosse knight,
His be the praise, that this atchieu'ment wrought,
Who made my hand the organ of his might;
More then goodwill to me attribute naught:
For all I did, I did but as I ought.
But you fair Sir, whose pageant next ensewes,
Well mote ye thee, as well can wish your thought,
That home ye may report these happy news;
For well ye worthy been for worth and gentle thewes.
So courteous conge both did give and take,
With right hands plighted, pledges of good will.
Then Guyon forward began his voyage make,
With his black Palmer, that him guided still.
Still he him guided over dale and hill,
And with his steedy staff did point his way:
His race with reason, and with words his will,
From foul intemperaunce he often did stay,
And suffered not in wrath his hasty steps to stray.
In this fair wize they traueild long yfere,
Through many hard assayes, which did betide,
Of which he honor still away did bear,
And spread his glory through all countries wide.
At last as chaunst them by a forest side
To pass, for succor from the scorching ray,
They heard a ruefull voice, that dearnly cride,
With percing shriekes, and many a doleful lay;
Which to attend, awhile their forward steps they stay.
But if that careless heuens (qdshe) despise
The doom of just revenge, and take delight
To see sad pageaunts of men's miseries,
As bownd by them to live in lives despite,
Yet can they not warn death from wretched wight.
Come then, come soon, come sweetest death to me,
And take away this long lent loathed light:
Sharp be thy wounds, but sweet the medicines be,
That long captiued souls from weary thraldom free.
But thou, sweet Babe, whom frowning froward fate
Has made sad witness of thy fathers fall,
Since heaven thee deignes to hold in living state,
Long may thou live, and better thrive withal,
Then to thy lucklesse parents did befall:
Live thou, and to thy mother dead attest,
That clear she did from blemish criminal;
Thy little hands embrewd in bleeding breast
Lo I for pledges leave. So give me leave to rest.
With that a deadly shrieke she forth did throw,
That through the wood reechoed again,
And after gave a groan so deep and low,
That seemd her tender heart was rent in twain,
Or thrild with point of thorough piercing pain;
As gentle Hynd, whose sides with (...) steel
Through lau^ched, forth her bleeding life does rain,
Whiles the sad pang approaching she does feel,
Braies out her latest breath, and up her eyes does seele.
Which when that warrior heard, dismounting straict
From his tall steed, he rusht into the thick,
And soon arrived, where that sad pourtraict
Of death and dolor lay, half dead, half quick,
In whose white alabaster breast did stick
A cruel knife, that made a griesly wownd,
From which forth gusht a stream of goreblood thick,
That all her goodly garments staind arownd,
And into a deep sanguine did the grassy grownd.
Pitiful spectacle of deadly smart,
Beside a bubling fountain low she lay,
Which she increased with her bleeding heart,
And the clean waves with purple gore did ray;
Als in her lap a lovely babe did play
His cruel sport, in stead of sorrow dew;
For in her streaming blood he did embay
His little hands, and tender ioints embrew;
Pitiful spectacle, as ever eye did view.
Besides them both, upon the soiled gras
The dead corse of an armed knight was spread,
Whose armor all with blood besprincled was,
His ruddy lips did smyle, and rosy red
Did (...) his cheerful cheeks, yett being ded,
Seemd to have been a goodly personage,
Now in his freshest flower of lusty head,
Fit to inflame fair Lady with loves rage,
But that fires fate did crop the blossom of his age.
Whom when the good Sir Guyou did behold,
His heart began wexe as stark, as marblestone,
And his sresh blood did frieze with fearful cold,
That all his senses seemd berefte atone:
At last his mighty ghost began deep to groan,
As Lion grudging in his great disdain,
Mournes inwardly, and makes to him self moan,
Til ruth and frail affection did constrain,
His stout courage to stoop, and show his inward pain.
Out of her gored wound the cruel steel
He lightly snatched, and did the floodgate stop
With his fair garment: then gansoftly feel
Herfeeble pulfe, to prove if any drop
Of living blood yet in her veins did hop;
Which when he felt to move, he hoped fair
To call back life to her forsaken shop;
So well he did her deadly wounds repair,
That at the last she began to breath out living air.
Which he perceiving greatly began rejoice,
And goodly counsel, that for wounded heart
Is meetest medicine, tempred with sweet voice;
Ay me, dear Lady, which the image art
Of ruefull pity, and impatient smart,
What direful chance, armd with auenging fate,
Or cursed hand has played this cruel part,
Thus foul to hasten your untimely date;
Speak, O dear Lady speak: help never comes too late.
Therewith her dim eie-lids she up began rear,
On which the drery death did sit, as sad
As lump oflead, and made dark clouds appear;
But when as him all in bright armor clad
Before her standing she espied had,
As one out of a deadly dream affright,
She weakly started, yet she nothing drad:
Straight down again her self in great despite,
She groueling threw to ground, as hating life and light.
The gentle knight her soon with careful pain
Vplifted light, and softly did uphold:
Thrice he her reard, and thrice she sunck again,
Till he his arms about her sides began fold,
And to her said; Yet if the stony cold
Have not all seized on your frozen heart,
Let one word fall that may your grief unfold,
And tell the secret of your mortal smart;
He often finds present help, who does his grief impart.
Then casting up a deadly look, full low
She sight from bottom of her wounded breast,
And after, many bitter throbs did throw
With lips full pale and foltring tongue oppressed,
These words she breathed forth from riuen chest;
Leave, ah leave of, what ever wight thou be,
To let a weary wretch from her dew rest,
And trouble dying souls tranquilitee.
Take not away now got, which none would give to me.
Ah far be it (said he) Dear dame fro me,
To hinder soul from her desired rest,
Or hold sad life in long captiuitee:
For all I seek, is but to have redrest
The bitter pangs, that does your heart infest.
Tell then O Lady tell, what fatal priefe
Has with so huge misfortune you oppressed:
That I may cast to compass your relief,
Or die with you in sorrow, and partake your grief,
With feeble hands then stretched forth on hye,
As heaven accusing guilty of her death,
And with dry drops congealed in her eye,
In these sad words she spent her utmost breath:
Hear then, O man, the sorrows that uneath
My tongue can tell, so far all sense they pas:
Lo this dead corpse, that lies here underneath,
The gentlest knight, that ever on green gras
Gay steed with spurs did prick, the good Sir Mortdant was.
Was, (ay the while, that he is not so now)
My Lord my love; my dear Lord, my dear love,
So long as heuens just with equal brow,
Vouchsafed to behold us from above,
One day when him high courage did emmoue,
As wont ye knights to seek adventures wild,
He pricked forth his puissaunt force to prove,
Me then he left enwombed of this child,
This luckles child, whom thus ye see with blood defild.
Him fortuned (hard fortune ye may guess)
To come, where vile Acrasia does won,
Acrasia a false enchaunteresse,
That many errant knights has foul fordonne:
Within a wandering Island, that does run
And stray in perilous gulf, her dwelling is,
Fair Sir, if ever there ye travel, shonne
The cursed land where many wend amiss,
And know it by the name; it hight the Bower of blis.
Her blis is all in pleasure and delight,
Wherewith she makes her lovers dronken mad,
And then with words and weeds of wondrous might,
On them she works her will to uses bad:
My liefest Lord she thus beguiled had
For he was flesh: (all flesh does frayltie breed)
Whom when I heard to been so ill bestad
Weak wretch I wrapped my self in Palmers weed,
And cast to seek him forth through danger and great dreed
Now had fair Cynthia by even tournes
Full measured three quarters of her year,
And thrice three times had filled her crooked horns,
Whenas my womb her burdein would forbear,
And bad me call Lucina to me near.
Lucina came: a manchild forth I brought:
The woods, the Nymphs, my bowres, my midwiues wear,
Hard help at need. So dear thee babe I bought,
Yet naught to dear I deemd, while so my dear I sought
Him so I sought, and so at last I fownd
Where him that witch had thralled to her will,
In chains of lust and lewd desires vbownd
And so transformed from his former skill,
That me he knew not, nether his own ill;
Till through wise handling and fair governance,
I him recured to a better will,
Purged from drugs of foul intemperaunce:
Then means I began devise for his deliverance.
Which when the vile Enchaunteresse perceived,
How that my Lord from her I would repriue,
With cup thus charmd, him parting she deceiud;
Sad verse, give death to him that death does give,
And loss of love, to her that loves to live,
So soon as Bacchus with the Nymphe does lincke,
So parted we and on our journey drive,
Till coming to this well, he stoupt to drink:
The charm fulfild, dead suddeinly he down did sincke.
Which when I wretch, Not one word more she said
But breaking of, the end for want of breath,
And slyding soft, as down to sleep her laid,
And ended all her woe in quiet death.
That seeing good Sir Guyon, could uneath
From tears abstain for grief his heart did grate,
And from so heavy sight his head did wreath,
Accusing fortune, and too cruel fate,
Which plonged had fair Lady in so wretched state.
Then turning to his Palmer said, Old sire
Behold the image of mortality,
And feeble nature clothed with fleshly tire
When raging passion with fierce tyranny
Robs reason of her dew regalitie,
And makes it servant to her basest part,
The strong it weakens with infirmity:
And with bold fury arms the weakest heart;
The strong through pleasure soonest falls, the weak through smart.
But temperaunce (said he) with golden squire
Betwixt them both can measure out a mean,
Nether to melt in pleasures (...),
Nor frye in hartlesse grief and doleful tene.
Thrice happy man, who fares them both atweene.
But since this wretched woman overcome
Of (...), rather then of crime has been,
Reserve her cause to her eternal doom,
And in the mean vouchsafe her honorable toombe.
Palmer, quoth. he, death is an equal doom
To good and bad, the commen In of rest;
But after death the trial is to come,
When best shall be to them, that lived best:
But both alike, when death has both suppressed,
Religious reverence does burial teene,
Which who so wants, wants so much of his rest:
For all so greet shame after death I ween,
As self to dyen bad, unburied bad to been.
So both agree their bodies to engraue;
The great earthes womb they open to the sky,
And with sad Cypress seemly it embraue,
Then covering with a clod their closed eye,
They lay therein those corses tenderly,
And bid them sleep in everlasting peace.
But ere they did their utmost obsequy,
Sir Guyon more affection to increace,
Bynempt a sacred vow, which none should ay releace.
The dead knights sword out of his sheath he drew,
With which he cut a lock of all their hear,
Which meddling with their blood and earth, he threw
Into the grave, and began devoutly swear;
Such and such evil God on Guyon rear,
And worse and worse young Orphane bethy pain,
If I or thou dew vengeance do forbear,
Till guilty blood her guerdon do obtain:
So shedding many tears, they closd the earth again.
Cant II.
Babes bloody hands may not be clensd,
the face of golden Mean.
Her sisters two Extremities:
strive her to banish clean.
THus when Sir Guyon with his faithful guide
Had with dew rites and dolorous lament
The end of their sad Tragedy vptyde,
The little babe up in his arms he hent;
Who with sweet pleasaunce and bold blandishment
Began smyle on them, that rather ought to weep,
As careless of his woe, or innocent
Of that was done, that ruth emperced deep
In that knights heart, and words with bitter tears did steep.
Ah lucklesse babe, borne under cruel star,
And in dead parents balefull ashes bred,
Full little weenest thou, what sorrows are
Left thee for portion of thy liuelyhed,
Poor Orphane in the wide world scattered,
As budding branch rent from the native tree,
And thrown forth, till it be withered:
Such is the state of men: Thus enter we
Into this life with woe and end with miseree.
Then soft him self inclyning on his knee
Down to that well, did in the water ween
(So love does loath disdainefull nicitee.)
His guilty hands from bloody gore to cleene;
He washed them often and often, yet naught they been
For all his washing cleaner. Still he strove,
Yet still the little hands were bloody seen,
The which him into great amaz'ment drove,
And into diverse doubt his wavering wonder cloue.
He wist not whether blott of foul offense
Might not be purgd with water nor with bath;
Or that high God, in lieu of innocence,
Imprinted had that token of his wrath,
To show how sore bloodguiltinesse he hat'h;
Or that the charm and veneme, which they dronck,
Their blood with secret filth infected has,
Being diffused through the senseless tronck,
That through the great contagion direful deadly stonck,
Whom thus at gaze, the Palmer began to board
With goodly reason, and thus fair bespake;
Ye been right heart amated, gracious Lord,
And of your ignorance great merueill make,
Whiles cause not well conceived ye mistake.
But know, that secret virtues are infusd
In every fountain, and in every lake,
Which who has skill them rightly to have chusd,
To proof of passing wonders has full often vsd.
Of those some were so from their sourse indewd
By great Dame Nature, from whose fruitful pap
Their welheads spring, and are with moisture deawd;
Which feeds each living plant with liquid sap,
And filles with flowers fair Floraes painted lap:
But other some by guifte of later grace,
Or by good prayers, or by other hap,
Had virtue pourd into their waters bace,
And thenceforth were renowmd, and sought from place place.
Such is this well, wrought by occasion strange,
Which to her Nymph befell. Upon a day,
As she the woods with bow and shaftes did raunge,
The hartlesse Hynd and Robucke to dismay,
Dan Faunus chaunst to meet her by the way,
And kindling fire at her fair burning eye,
Inflamed was to follow beauties chase,
And chaced her, that fast from him did fly;
As Hynd from her, so she fled from her enemy.
At last when failing breath began to faint,
And saw no means to escape, of shame affrayd,
She set her down to weep for sore constraint,
And to Diana calling loud for aid,
Her dear besought, to let her die a maid.
The goddess heard, and suddeine where she sat,
Welling out streams of tears, and quite dismayed
With stony fear of that rude rustic mate,
Transformd her to a stone from steadfast virgins state.
Lo now she is that stone, from whose two heads,
As from two weeping eyes, fresh streams do flow,
Yet cold through fear, and old conceived dreads;
And yet the stone her semblance seems to show,
Shapt like a maid, that such ye may her know;
And yet her virtues in her water bide:
For it is chaste and pure, as purest snow,
Ne lets her waves with any filth be did,
But ever like her self unstained has been tryde.
From thence it comes, that this babes bloody hand
May not be clensd with water of this well:
Ne certes Sir strive you it to withstand,
But let them still be bloody, as befell,
That they his mothers innocence may tell,
As she bequeathd in her last testament;
That as a sacred Symbol it may dwell
In her sons flesh, to mind reuengement,
And be for all chaste Dames an endless moniment.
He hearkened to his reason, and the child
Vptaking, to the Palmer gave to bear;
But his sad fathers arms with blood defilde,
An heavy load himself did lightly rear,
And turning to that place, in which whyleare
He left his lofty steed with golden sell,
And goodly gorgeous barbes, him found not theare.
By other accident that erst befell,
He is conuaide, but how or where, here fits not tell.
Which when Sir Guyon saw, all were he wroth,
Yet algates mote he soft himself appease,
And fairly fare on foot, how ever loath;
His double burden did him sore disease.
So long they traueiled with little ease,
Till that at last they to a Castle came,
Built on a rock adjoining to the seas,
It was an ancient work of antique frame,
And wondrous strong by nature, and by skillful frame.
Therein three sisters dwelt of sundry sort,
The children of one sire by mothers three;
Who dying whylome did divide this fort
To them by equal shares in equal fee:
But stryfull mind, and diverse qualitee
Drew them in parts, and each made others foe:
Still did they strive, and daily disagree;
The eldest did against the youngest go,
And both against the midst meant to worken woe.
Where when the knight arrived, he was right well
Received, as knight of so much worth became,
Of second sister, who did far excel
The other two; Medina was her name,
A sober sad, and comely courteous Dame;
Who rich arayd, and yet in modest guize,
In goodly garments, that her well became,
Fair marching forth in honorable wize,
Him at the threshold met, and well did enterprise.
She led him up into a goodly bower,
And comely courted with meet (...),
Ne in her speech, ne in her hauiour,
Was lightness seen, or looser vanity,
But gracious womanhood, and gravity,
Above the reason of her youthly years:
Her golden locks she roundly did vptye
In breaded tramels, that no looser hears
Did out of order stray about her dainty ears.
Whilst she her self thus busily did frame,
Seemly to entertain her new-come guest,
News hereof to her other sisters came,
Who all this while were at their wanton rest,
Accourting each her friend with lavish fest:
They were two knights of perelesse puissaunce,
And famous far abroad for warlike gest,
Which to these Ladies love did countenance,
And to his mistress each himself strove to advance.
He that made love unto the eldest Dame,
Was hight Sir Huddibras, an hardy man;
Yet not so good of deeds, as great of name,
Which he by many rash adventures wan,
Since errant arms to sew he first began;
More huge in strength, then wise in works he was,
And reason with foole-hardize over ran;
Stern melancholy did his courage pas,
And was for terror more, all armd in shyning bras.
But he that loved the youngest, was Sansloy,
He that fair Vna late foul outraged,
The most unruly, and the boldest boy,
That ever warlike weapons menaged,
And to all lawless lust encouraged,
Through strong opinion of his matchless might:
Ne ought he cared, whom he endamaged
By tortious wrong, or whom bereaved of right.
He now this Ladies Champion chose for love to fight.
These two gay knights, vowed to so diverse loves,
Each other does envy with deadly hate,
And daily war against his foeman moves,
In hope to win more favor with his mate,
And the others pleasing service to abate,
To magnify his own. But when they heard,
How in that place strange knight arrived late,
Both knights and ladies forth right angry fared,
And fercely unto battle stern themselves prepared.
But ere they could proceed unto the place,
Where he abode, themselves at discord fell,
And cruel combat joined in middle space:
With horrible assault, and fury fell,
They heapt huge strokes, the scorned life to quell,
That all on uproar from her settled seat,
The house was raysd, and all that in did dwell;
Seemd that loud thunder with amazement great
Did rend the rattling skies with flames of fouldring heat.
The noise thereof called forth that stranger knight,
To weet, what dreadful thing was there in hand;
Where when as two brave knights in bloody fight
With deadly rancour he enraunged fond,
His sunbroad shield about his wrest he bond,
And shyning blade vnsheathd, with which he ran
Unto that stead, their strife to understand;
And at his first arrival, them began
With goodly means to (...), well as he can.
But they him spying, both with greedy forse
Attonce upon him ran, and him beset
With strokes of mortal steel without remorse,
And on his shield like iron sledges bet:
As when a Bear and Tygre being met
In cruel fight on lybicke Ocean wide,
Espy a traueiler with feet surbet,
Whom they in equal pray hope to divide,
They stint their strife, and him assail on every side.
But he, not like a weary traueilere,
Their sharp assault right boldly did rebut,
And suffered not their blows to byte him nere,
But with redoubled buffes them back did put:
Whose grieved minds, which choler did englut,
Against themselves turning their wrathful spite,
(...) with new rage their shieldes to hew and cut;
But still when Guyon came to part their fight,
With heavy load on him they freshly began to smight.
As a tall ship tossed in troublous seas,
Whom raging winds threatening to make the pray
Of the rough rocks, do diversely disease,
Meets two contrary billows by the way,
That her on either side do sore assay,
And boast to swallow her in greedy grave;
She scorning both their spights, does make wide way,
And with her breast breaking the fomy wave,
Does ride on both their backs, and fair her self does save.
So boldly he him bears, and rusheth forth
Between them both, by conduct of his blade.
Wondrous great prowess and heroic worth
He showed that day, and rare ensample made,
When two so mighty warriors he dismade:
Attonce he wards and strikes, he takes and paies,
Now forced to yield, now forcing to invade,
Before, behind, and round about him lays:
So double was his pains, so double be his praise.
Strange sort of fight, three valiant knights to see
Three combats join in one, and to darraine
A triple war with triple enmitee,
All for their Ladies froward love to gain,
Which gotten was but hate. So love does rain
In stoutest minds, and makes monstrous war;
He makes war, he makes peace again,
And yett his peace is but continual (...):
O miserable men, that to him subject arre.
(...) thus they mingled were in furious arms,
The fair Medina with her tresses torn,
And naked breast, in pity of their harms,
Emongst them ran, and falling them (...),
Besought them by the womb, which them had born,
And by the loves, which were to them most dear,
And by the knighthood, which they sure had sworn,
Their deadly cruel discord to forbear,
And to her just conditions offaire peace to hear.
But her two other sisters standing by,
Her loud gainsaid, and both her champions bad
Pursew the end of their strong enmity.
As ever of their loves they would be glad.
Yet she with pitthy words and counsel sad,
Still strove their stubborn rages to revoke,
That at the last suppressing fury mad,
They began abstain from dint of direful stroke,
And hearken to the sober speeches, which she spoke.
Ah puissaunt Lords, what cursed evil Spright,
Or fell Erinnys in your noble hearts,
Her hellish (...) has kindled with despite,
And stird you up to work your wilful smarts?
Is this the joy of arms? be these the parts
Of glorious knighthood, after blood to thrust,
And not regard dew right and just deserts?
Vain is the vaunt, and victory unjust,
That more to mighty hands, the^ rightful cause does trust.
And were their rightful cause of difference,
Yet were not better, fair it to accord,
Then with bloodguiltnesse to heap offense,
And mortal vengeance join to crime abhord?
O fly from wrath, fly, O my liefest Lord:
Sad be the sights, and bitter fruits of war,
And thousand furies wait on wrathful sword;
Ne ought the praise of prowess more does mar,
Then foul revenging rage, and base contentious jar.
But lovely concord, and most sacred peace
Does nourish virtue, and fast friendship breeds;
Weak she make strong, and strong thing does increase,
Till it the pitch of highest praise exceeds:
Brave be her wars, and honorable deeds,
By which she triumphs over ire and pride,
And winnes an Olive girlond for her meeds:
Be therefore, O my dear Lords, pacifide,
And this misseeming discord meekely lay aside.
Her gracious words their rancour did appall,
And suncke so deep into their boiling breasts,
That down they let their cruel weapons fall,
And lowly did abase their lofty crests
To her fair presence, and discrete behests.
Then she began a treaty to procure,
And stablish terms betwixt both their requests,
That as a law for ever should endure;
Which to observe in word of knights they did assure.
Which to confirm, and fast to bind their league,
After their weary sweat and bloody toil,
She them besought, during their quiet treague,
Into her lodging to repair a while,
To rest themselves, and grace to reconcile.
They soon consent: so forth with her they fare,
Where they are well receiud, and made to spoil
Themselves of soiled arms, and to prepare
Their minds to pleasure, and their mouths to dainty fare.
And those two froward sisters, their fair loves
Came with them eke, all were they wondrous loath,
And fained cheer, as for the time behoues,
But could not color yet so well the troth,
But that their natures bad appeard in both:
For both did at their second sister grutch,
And inly grieve, as does an hidden moth
The inner garment frett, not th'vtter touch;
One though there cheer too (...), the other thought too mutch.
Elissa (so the eldest hight) did deem
Such entertainment base, ne ought would eat,
Ne ought would speak, but evermore did seem
As discontent for want of metth or meat;
No solace could her Paramour entreat
Her once to show, ne court, nor dalliaunce,
But with bent lowering brows, as she would threat,
She scould, and frownd with froward countenance,
Unworthy of fair Ladies comely governance.
But young Perissa was of other mind,
Full of disport, still laughing, loosely light,
And quite contrary to her sisters kind;
No measure in her mood, no rule of right,
But poured out in pleasure and delight;
In wine and meats she flowd above the banck,
And in excess exceeded her own might;
In sumptuous tire she ioyd her self to pranck,
But of her love too lavish (little have she thanck.)
First by her side did sit the bold Sansloy,
Fit mate for such a mincing mineon,
Who in her looseness took exceeding joy;
Might not be found a francker franion,
Of her leawd parts to make companion:
But Huddibras, more like a Malecontent,
Did see and grieve at his bold fashion;
Hardly could he endure his hardiment,
Yett still he satt, and inly did him self torment.
Betwixt them both the fair Medina sat
With sober grace, and goodly carriage:
With equal measure she did moderate
The strong extremities of their outrage,
That forward pair she ever would assuage,
When they would strive dew reason to exceed;
But that same froward twain would accorage,
And of her plenty add unto their need:
So kept she them in order, and her self in heed.
Thus fairly she attempered her feast,
And pleased them all with meet satiety:
At last when lust of meat and drink was ceast,
She Guyon dear besought of courtesy,
To tell from whence he came through ieopardy,
And whether now on new adventure bownd.
Who with bold grace, and comely gravity,
Drawing to him the eyes of all arownd,
From lofty siege began these words aloud to sownd.
This thy demand, O Lady, does revive
Fresh memory in me of that great Queen,
Great and most glorious virgin Queen alive,
That with her sovereign power, and scepter shene
All Faery land does peaceably sustene.
In widest Ocean she her throne does rear,
That over all the earth it may be seen;
As morning Sun her beams dispredden clear,
And in her face fair peace, and mercy does appear.
In her the richesse of all heavenly grace,
In chief degree are heaped up on hye:
And all that else this worlds enclosure bace,
Has great or glorious in mortal eye.
Adornes the person of her Majesty;
That men beholding so great excellence,
And rare perfection in mortalitye,
Do her adore with sacred reverence,
As th'Idole of her makers great magnificence.
To her I homage and my service owe,
In number of the noblest knights on ground,
Among whom on me she deigned to bestow
Order of Maydenhead, the most renownd,
That may this day in all the world be found,
An yearly solemn feast she wontes to make
The day that first does lead the year around;
To which all knights of worth and courage bold
Resort, to hear of strange adventures to be told.
There this old Palmer showed himself that day,
And to that mighty Princess did complain
Of grievous mischiefs, which a wicked Fay
Had wrought, and many whelmd in deadly pain,
Whereof he craved redress. My Sovereign,
Whose glory is in gracious deeds, and joys
Throughout the world her mercy to maintain,
Eftsoons deuisd redress for such annoyes;
Me all unfit for so great purpose she employes,
Now has fair Phebe with her silver face
Thrice seen the shadows of the nether world,
Since last I left that honorable place,
In which her royal presence is entrold;
Ne ever shall I rest in house nor hold,
Till I that false Acrasia have won;
Of whose foul deeds, too hideous to be told
I witness am, and this their wretched son,
Whose woeful parents she has wickedly fordonne,
Tell on, fair Sir, said she, that doleful tale,
From which sad ruth does seem you to restrain,
That we may pity such unhappy bale,
And learn from pleasures poison to abstain:
Ill by ensample good does often gain.
Then forward he his purpose began pursew,
And told the story of the mortal pain,
Which Mordant and Amauia did rue;
As with lamenting eyes him self did lately view.
Night was far spent, and now in Ocean deep
Orion, flying fast from hissing snake,
His flaming head did hasten for to steep,
When of his pitteous tale he end did make;
Whilst with delight of that he wisely spoke,
Those guestes beguyled, did beguyle their eyes
Of kindly sleep, that did them overtake.
At last when they had marked the changed skies,
They wist their hour was spent; the^ each to rest him hyes

Belphoebe foul forlorn.
SO one as the morrow fair with purple beams
Dispersed the shadows of the misty night,
And Titan playing on the eastern streams,
Began clear the deawy air with springing light,
Sir Guyon mindful of his vow yplight,
Vprose from drowsy couch, and him addressed
Unto the journey which he had behight:
His (...) arms about his noble breast,
And many-folded shield he bound about his wrest.
Then taking Conge of that virgin pure,
The bloody-handed babe unto her truth
Did earnestly committ, and her conjure,
In virtuous lore to train his tender youth,
And all that gentle noriture ensues:
And that so soon as ryper years he rought,
He might for memory of that days ruth,
Be called Ruddymane, and thereby taught,
T'auenge his Parents death on the^, that had it wrought.
So forth he fared, as now befell, on foot,
Since his good steed is lately from him gone;
Patience perforce: helpless what may it boot
To frett for anger, or for grief to moan?
His Palmer now shall foot no more alone:
So fortune wrought, as under green woods side
He lately hard that dying Lady groan,
He left his steed without, and spear beside,
And rushed in on foot to aid her, cre she did.
The whiles a losell wandering by the way,
One that to bounty never cast his mind,
Ne thought of honor ever did assay
His baser breast, but in his kestrell kind
A pleasing vain of glory he did find,
To which his flowing tongue, and troublous spright
Gave him great aid, and made him more inclynd:
He that brave steed there finding ready dight,
Purloynd both steed and spear, and ran away full light.
Now began his heart all swell in iollity,
And of him self great hope and help conceived,
That puffed up with smoke of vanity,
And with selfe-loued personage deceived,
He began to hope, of men to be received
For such, as he him thought, or feign would be:
But for in court gay portaunce he perceived,
And gallant show to be in greatest gree,
Eftsoons to court he cast t'aduaunce his first degree.
And by the way he chanced to espy
One sitting idle on a sunny banck,
To whom auaunting in great bravery,
As Peacocke, that his painted plumes does pranck,
He smote his courser in the trembling flanck,
And to him threatened his hart-thrilling spear:
The seely man seeing him ride so rank,
And aim at him, fell flatt to ground for fear,
And crying Mercy loud, his pitious hands began rear.
Thereat the Scarcrow wexed wondrous proud,
Through fortune of his first adventure fair,
And with big thundering voice reuyld him loud;
Vile Caytiue, vassal of dread and despair,
Unworthy of the commune breathed air,
Why live thou, dead dog, a longer day,
And do not unto death thy self prepayre.
Die, or thy self my captive yield for ay;
Great favor I thee grant, for answer thus to stay.
Hold, O dear Lord, hold your dead-doing hand,
Then loud he cryde, I am your humble thrall.
Ah wretch (quoth. he) thy destinies withstand
My wrathful will, and do for mercy call.
I give thee life: therefore prostrated fall,
And kiss my stirrup; that thy homage be.
The Miser threw him self, as an Offall,
Straight at his foot in base humilitee,
And cleeped him his liege, to hold of him in fee,
So happy peace they made and fair accord:
Eftsoons this liegeman began to wexe more bold,
And when he felt the folly of his Lord,
In his own kind he began him self unfold:
For he was wily witted, and grown old
In cunning sleightes and practick knavery.
From that day forth he cast for to uphold
His idle humor with fine slattery,
And blow the bellows to his swelling vanity.
Trompart fit man for Braggadochio,
To serve at court in view of vaunting eye;
Vaineglorious man, when fluttring wind does blow
In his light wings, is lifted up to sky:
The scorn of knighthood and true cheualrye,
To think without desert of gentle deed,
And noble worth to be advanced hye:
Such praise is shame; but honor virtues meed
Does bear the fairest flower in honorable seed.
So forth they pas, a well consorted pair,
Till that at length with Archimage they meet:
Who seeing one that shone in armor fair,
On goodly course thondring with his feet,
Eftsoons supposed him a person meet,
Of his (...) to make the instrument:
For since the Redcrosse knight he erst did weet,
To been with Guyon knitt in one consent,
The ill, which erst to him, he now to Guyon meant.
And coming close to Trompart began inquere
Of him, what mighty warrior that mote be,
That rode in golden sell with single spear,
But wanted sword to wreake his enmitee.
He is a great aduenturer, (said he)
That has his sword through hard assay forgone,
And now has vowed, till he avenged be,
Of that despite, never to wearen none;
That spear is him enough to done a thousand groan.
Th'enchaunter greatly ioyed in the vaunt,
And weened well ere long his will to win,
And both his foen with equal foil to daunt.
Tho to him louting lowly did begin
To plain of wrongs, which had committed bin
By Guyon, and by that false Redcrosse knight,
Which two through treason and deceiptfull gin,
Had slain Sir Mordant, and his Lady bright:
That more him honor win, to wreak so foul despite.
Therewith all suddeinly he seemd enragd,
And threatened death with dreadful countenance,
As if their lives had in his hand been gagd;
And with stiff force shaking his mortal lance,
To let him weet his doughtie valiaunce,
Thus said; Old man, great sure shall be thy meed,
If where those knights for fear of dew vengeance
Do lurk, thou certainly to me areed,
That I may wreake on them their heinous hateful deed.
Certes, my Lord, (said he) that shall I soon,
And give you eke good help to their decay.
But mote I wisely you advise to done;
Give no ods to your foes, but do puruay
Your self of sword before that bloody day:
For they be two the prowest knights on grownd,
And often approved in many hard assay,
And eke of surest steel, that may be fownd,
Do arm yourself against that day, them to confownd.
Dotard, (said he) let be thy deep advise;
Seems that through many years thy wits thee fail,
And that weak eld has left thee nothing wise,
Else never should thy judgment be so frail,
To measure manhood by the sword or mayle.
Is not enough four quarters of a man,
Withouten sword or shield, an host to quayle?
Thou little wotest, what this right hand can:
Speak they, which have beheld the battles, which it wan.
The man was much abashed at his boast;
Yet well he wist, that who so would contend
With either of those knights on even coast,
Should need of all his arms, him to defend,
Yet feared least his boldness should offend,
When Braggadocchio said, Once I did swear,
When with one sword seven knights I brought to end,
Thence forth in battle never sword to bear,
But it were that, which noblest knight on earth does wear.
Perdy Sir knight, said then th'enchaunterbliue,
That shall I shortly purchase to your hond:
For now the best and noblest knight alive,
Prince Arthur is, that wonnes in Faerie land;
He has a sword, that flames like burning brond.
The same by my device I undertake
Shall by to morrow by thy side be fond.
At which bold word that boaster began to quake,
And wondered in his mind, what mote that Monster make.
He stayed not for more bidding, but away
Was suddein vanished out of his sight:
The Northern wind his wings did broad display
At his command, and reared him up light
From of the earth, to take his aerie flight.
They looked about, but no where could espy
Tract of his foot: then dead through great affright
They both nigh were, and each bad other fly:
Both fled attonce, ne ever back returned eye.
Till that they come unto a forest green,
In which they shroud themselves from causeles fear;
Yet fear them follows still, where so they been,
Each trembling leaf, and whistling wind they hear,
As ghastly bug does unto them affeare:
Yet both do strive their fearfulness to feign.
At last they heard a horn, that shrilled clear
Throughout the wood, that ecchoed again,
And made the forest ring, as it would riue in twain.
Eft through the thick they heard one rudely rush;
With noise whereof he from his lofty steed
Down fell to ground, and crept into a bush,
To hide his coward head from dying dreed.
But Trompart stoutly stayed to taken heed,
Of what might hap. Eftsoone there stepped forth
A goodly Lady clad in hunters weed,
That seemd to be a woman of great worth,
And by her stately portance, borne of heavenly birth.
Her face so fair as flesh it seemed not,
But heavenly pourtraict of bright Angels hew,
Clear as the sky, withouten blame or blot,
Through goodly mixture of complexions dew;
And in her cheeks the vermeill red did show
Like roses in a bed of lillies shed,
The which ambrosiall odours from them threw,
And gazers sense with double pleasure fed,
Hable to heal the sick, and to revive the ded.
In her fair eyes two living lamps did flame,
Kindled above at th'heuenly makers light,
And darted fyrie beams out of the same,
So passing persant, and so wondrous bright,
That quite bereaved the rash beholders sight:
In them the blinded god his lustful fire
To kindle often assayd, but had no might;
For with dredd Majesty, and awful ire,
She broke his wanton darts, and quenched bace desire.
Her yuorie forhead, full of bounty brave,
Like a broad table did it self dispred,
For Love his lofty triumphs to engraue,
And write the battles of his great godhed:
All good and honor might therein be red:
For there their dwelling was. And when she spoke,
Sweet words, like dropping honny she did shed,
And twixt the perles and rubins softly brake
A silver sound, that heavenly music seemd to make.
Upon her eyelids many Graces sat,
Under the shadow of her even brows,
Working belgardes, and amorous retrate,
And every one her with a grace endowes:
And every one with meekness to her bows.
So glorious mirrhour of celestial grace,
And sovereign moniment of mortal vows,
How shall frail pen descriue her heavenly face,
For fear through want of skill her beauty to disgrace?
So fair, and thousand thousand times more fair
She seemd, when she presented was to sight,
And was yclad, for heat of scorching air,
All in a silken Camus lylly whight,
Purfled upon with many a folded plight,
Which all above besprinckled was throughout,
With golden aygulets, that glistred bright,
Like twinkling stars, and all the skirt about
Was hemd with golden fringe
Below her ham her weed did somewhat train,
And her straight legs most bravely were embayld
Ingilden buskins of costly Cordwayne,
All bard with golden bendes, which were entayld
With curious antickes, and full fair (...):
Before they fastened were under her knee
In a rich jewel, and therein entrayld
The ends of all the knots, that none might see,
How they within their fouldings close enwrapped be.
Like two fair marble pillours they did seen,
Which do the temple of the Gods support,
Whom all the people deck with girlands green,
And honor in their festival resort;
Those same with stately grace, and princely port
She taught to tread, when she her self would grace,
But with the woody Nymphs when she did play,
Or when the flying Libbard she did chase,
She could them nimbly move, and after fly apace.
And in her hand a sharp bore-speare she held,
And at her back a bow and quiver gay,
Stuffed with steele-headed darts, wherewith she queld
The saluage beasts in her victorious play,
Knit with a golden bauldricke, which forelay
Athwart her snowy breast, and did divide
Her dainty paps; which like young fruit in May
Now little began to swell, and being tide,
Through her thin weed their places only signifide.
Her yellow locks crisped, like golden wyre,
About her shoulders weren loosely shed,
And when the wind emongst them did inspyre,
They waued like a penon wide dispred
And low behind her back were scattered:
And whether art it were, or heedelesse hap,
As through the flouring forest rash she fled,
In her rude hears sweet flowers themselves did lap,
And flourishing fresh leaves and blossoms did enwrap.
Such as Diana by the sandy shore
Of swift Eurotas, or on Cynthus green,
Where all the Nymphs have her unawares forlore,
Wandreth alone with bow and arrows keen,
To seek her game: Or as that famous Queen
Of Amazons, whom Pyrrhus did destroy,
The day that first of Priame she was seen,
Did show her self in great triumphant joy,
To succor the weak state of sad afflicted Troy.
Such when as hartlesse Trompart her did view,
He was dismayed in his coward mind,
And doubted, whether he himself should show,
Or fly away, or bide alone behind:
Both fear and hope he in her face did find,
When she at last him spying thus bespake;
Hayle Groom; did not thou see a bleeding Hynde,
Whose right haunch erst my steadfast arrow struck?
If thou did, tell me, that I may her overtake.
Wherewith reviu'd, this answer forth he threw;
O Goddess, (for such I thee take to be)
For nether does thy face terrestrial show,
Nor voice sound mortal; I auow to thee,
Such wounded beast, as that, I did not see,
Since erst into this forest wild I came.
Bur (...) thy goodly head forgive it me,
To (...), which of the Gods I shall thee name,
That unto thee dew worship I may rightly frame.
To whom she thus, but ere her words ensewd,
Unto the bush her eye did suddein glaunce,
In which vain Braggadocchio was mewd,
And saw it stir: she left her percing lance,
And toward began a deadly shafte advance,
In mind to mark the beast. At which sad stowre,
(...) forth stepped, to stay the mortal chance,
Out crying, O what ever heavenly power,
Or earthly wight thou be, withhold this deadly hour.
O stay thy hand, for yonder is no game
For thy fires arrows, them to exercize,
But lo my Lord, my liege, whose warlike name,
Is far renowmd through many bold emprize;
And now in shade he shrouded yonder lies.
She staid: with that he crauld out of his nest,
Forth creeping on his caitiue hands and thies,
And standing stoutly up, his lofty crest
Did fiercely shake, and rowze, as coming late from rest.
As fearful foul, that long in secret cave
For dread of soring hawk her self has hid,
Not caring how her silly life to save,
She her gay painted plumes disorderid,
Seeing at last her self from danger rid,
Peepes forth, and soon renews her native pride;
She gins her feathers foul disfigured
Prowdly to prune, and set on every side,
So shakes off shame, ne thinks how erst she did her hide.
So when her goodly visage he beheld,
He began himself to vaunt: but when he vewd
Those deadly tools, which in her hand she held,
Soon into other fitts he was transmewd,
Till she to him her gracious speech renewd;
All hail, Sir knight, and well may thee befall,
As all the like, which honor have pursewd
Through deeds of arms and prowess martial;
All virtue merits praise, but such the most of all.
To whom he thus, O fairest under sky,
True be thy words, and worthy of thy praise,
That warlike feats do highest glorify.
Therein I have spent all my youthly days,
And many battles fought, and many fraies
Throughout the world, where so they might be found,
Endeavoring my dreaded name to raise
Above the Moon, that fame may it resound
In her eternal tromp, with laurel girlond cround.
But what art thou, O Lady, which do raunge
In this wild forest, where no pleasure is,
And do not it for joyous court exchange,
Emongst thine equal peers, where happy blis
And all delight does reign, much more then this?
There thou may love, and dearly loved be,
And swim in pleasure, which thou here do mis;
There may thou best be seen, and best may (...):
The wood is fit for beasts, the court is fit for thee.
Who so in pomp of proud estate (quoth. she)
Does swim, and bathes him self in courtly blis,
Does waste his days in dark obscuritee,
And in oblivion ever buried is:
Where ease abownds, yt's eath to do amiss;
But who his limbs with labors, and his mind
Behaues with cares, cannot so easy mis.
Abroad in arms, at home in studious kind
Who seeks with painful toil, shall honor soonest find.
In woods, in waves, in wars she wonts to dwell,
And will be found with peril and with pain;
Ne can the man, that moulds in idle cell,
Unto her happy mansion attain:
Before her gate high God did Sweat ordain,
And wakefull watches ever to abide:
But easy is the way, and passage plain
To pleasures palace; it may soon be spide,
And day and night her doors to all stand open wide.
In Princes court. The rest she would have said,
But that the foolish man, filled with delight
Of her sweet words, that all his sense dismayed,
And with her wondrous beauty ravished quight,
Began burn in filthy lust, and leaping light,
Thought in his bastard arms her to embrace.
With that she (...) back, her Iauelin bright
Against him bent, and fiercely did menace:
So turned her about, and fled away apace.
Which when the Pesaunt saw, amazd he stood,
And grieved at her flight; yet durst he not
Pursew her steps, through wild unknown wood;
Besides he feared her wrath, and threatened shot
Whiles in the bush he lay, not yet forgott:
Ne cared he greatly for her presence vain,
But turning said to Trompart, What foul blott
Is this to knight, that Lady should again
Depart to woods untouched, and leave so proud disdain?
Perdy (said Trompart) let her pas at will,
Least by her presence danger (...) befall.
For who can tell (and sure I fear it ill)
But that she is some power celestial?
For whiles she spoke, her great words did apall
My feeble courage, and my heart oppress,
That yet I quake and tremble over all.
And I (said Braggadocchio) thought no (...),
When first I heard her horn found with such ghastlinesse.
For from my mothers womb this grace I have
Me given by eternal destiny,
That earthly thing may not my courage brave
Dismay with fear, or cause on foot to fly,
But either hellish feends, or powers on hye:
Which was the cause, when erst that horn I heard,
Weening it had been thunder in the sky,
I hid my self from it, as one affeard;
But when I other knew, my self I boldly reard.
But now for fear of worse, that may betide,
Let us soon hence depart. They soon agree;
So to his steed he got, and began to ride,
As one unfit therefore, that all might see
He had not trained been in cheualree.
Which well that valiant courser did discern;
For he despisd to tread in dew degree,
But chaufd and fom'd, with courage fires and stern,
And to be easd of that base burden still did erne.
Cant. IIII.
Guyon does Furor bind in chains,
And stops occasion:
Delivers Phaon, and therefore
By strife is rayld upon.
IN brave poursuitt of honorable deed,
There is I know not (what) great difference
Between the vulgar and the noble seed,
Which unto things of valorours pretense
Seems to be borne by native influence;
As feats of arms, and love to entertain,
But chiefly skill to ride seems a science
Proper to gentle blood; some others feign
To menage steeds, as did this vaunter; but in vain.
But he the rightful owner of that steed,
Who well could menage and subdew his pride,
The whiles on foot was forced for to yeed,
With that black Palmer, his most trusty guide;
Who suffered not his wandering feet to slide.
But when strong passion or weak fleshlinesse,
Would from the right way seek to draw him wide,
He would through temperaunce and steadfastness,
Teach him the weak to stre^gthen, and the strong suppress.
It fortuned forth faring on his way,
He saw from far, or seemed for to see
Some troublous uproar or contentious fray,
Whereto he drew in have it to agree.
A mad man, or that feigned mad to be,
Drew by the hear along upon the grownd,
A handsome stripling with great crueltee,
Whom sore he bett, and gored with many a wownd,
That cheeks with tears, and sides with blood did all abownd.
And him behynd, a wicked Hag did stalk,
In ragged robes, and filthy disaray,
Her other leg was lame, that she no'te walk.
But on a staff her feeble steps did stay;
Her locks, that loathly were and hoarie gray,
Grew all before, and loosly hong vnrold,
But all behind was bald, and worn away,
That none thereof could ever taken hold,
And eke her face ill favored, full of wrinckles old.
And ever as she went, her tongue did walk
In foul reproach, and terms of vile despite,
Provoking him by her outrageous talk,
To heap more vengeance on that wretched wight;
Sometimes she raught him stones, wherewith to smite,
Sometimes her staff, though it her one leg were,
Withouten which she could not go upright;
Ne any evil means she did forbear,
That might him move to wrath, and in dignation rear.
The noble Guyon moved with great remorse,
Approaching, first the Hag did thrust away,
And after adding more impetuous forse,
His mighty hands did on the madman lay,
And plucked him back; who all on fire straight way,
Against him turning all his fell intent,
With beastly brutish rage (...) him assay,
And smott, and bitt, and kicked, and scratcht, and rent,
And did he wist not what in his auengement.
And sure he was a man of mickle might,
Had he had governance, it well to guide:
But when the frantic fit inflamd his spright,
His force was vain, and struck more often wide,
Then at the aimed mark, which he had eyde:
And often himself he chaunst to hurt unawares,
Whylest reason blent through passion, naught descryde
But as a blindfold Bull at randon fares,
And where he hits, naught knows, and whom he hurts, naught cares.
His rude assault and rugged handeling
Strange seemed to the knight, that aye with foe
In fair defense and goodly menaging
Of arms was wont to fight, yet nathemoe
Was he abashed now not fighting so,
But more enfierced through his currish play,
Him sternly grypt, and hailing to and fro,
To overthrow him strongly did assay,
But overthrew him self unawares, and lowerlay.
And being down the villein sore did beat,
And bruze with clownish (...) his manly face:
And eke the Hag with many a bitter threat.
Still called upon to kill him in the place.
With whose reproach and odious menace
The knight (...) in his haughty heart,
Knitt all his forces, and began soon unbrace
His grasping hold: so lightly did vpstart,
And drew his deadly weapon, to maintain his part.
Which when the Palmersaw, he loudly cryde,
Not so O Guyon, never think that so
That Monster can be maistred or destroyed:
He is no, ah, he is not such a foe,
As steel can (...), or strength can ouerthroe.
That same is Furor, cursed cruel wight,
That unto knighthood works much shame and woe;
And that same Hag, his aged mother, hight
Occasion, the root of all wrath and despite,
With her, who so will raging Furor tame,
Must first begin, and well her amenage:
First her restrain from her reproachful blame,
And evil means, with which she does enrage
Her frantic son, and kindles his courage,
Then when she is withdrawn, or strong withstood,
It Is eath his idle fury to aswage,
And calm the tempest of his passion wood;
The banks are overflowed, when stopped is the flood.
Therewith Sir Guyon left his first emprise,
And turning to that woman, fast her hent
By the hoare locks, that hong before her eyes,
And to the ground her threw: yet n'ould she stent
Her bitter railing and foul reuilement,
But still prouokt her son to wreake her wrong;
But nathelesse he did her still torment,
And catching hold of her ungracious tongue,
Thereon an iron lock, did fasten firm and strong.
Then whenas use of speech was from her reft,
With her two crooked hands she signs did make,
And beckned him, the last help she had left:
But he that last left help away did take,
And both her hands fast bound unto a stake,
That she note stir. Then began her son to fly
Full fast away, and did her quite forsake;
But Guyon after him (...) have did hye,
And soon him ouertooke in sad perplexitye.
In his strong arms he stiffly him embraste,
Who him gainstriuing, naught at all preuaild:
For all his power was utterly defaste,
And furious fitts at erst quite weren quaild:
Often he re'nforst, and often his forces fayld,
Yet yield he would not, nor his rancor slack.
Then him to ground he cast, and rudely hayld,
And both his hands fast bound behind his back,
And both his feet in fetters to an iron rack.
With hundred iron chains he did him (...),
And hundred knots that did him sore constrain:
Yet his great iron teeth he still did grind,
And grimly gnash, threatening revenge in vain:
His burning eyes, whom bloody strakes did stain,
Stared full wide, and threw forth sparks offyre,
And more for rank (...), then for great pain,
Shakt his long locks, colored like copper-wyre,
And (...) his tawny beard to show his raging ire.
Thus whenas Guyon Furor had captiud,
Turning about he saw that wretched Squyre,
Whom that mad man of life nigh late depriud,
Lying on ground, all foild with blood and mire:
Whom when as he perceived to respyre,
He began to comfort, and his wounds to dress.
Being at last recured, he began inquyre,
What hard mishap him brought to such distress,
And made that caytiues thrall, the thrall of wretchedness.
With heart then throbbing, and with watery eyes,
Fair Sir (quoth.he) what man can shun the hap,
That hidden lies unawares him to surpryse
Misfortune waits advantage to entrap
The man most wary in her whelming lap,
So me weak wretch, of many weakest wretch,
Vnweeting, and unware of such mishap,
She brought to mischief through her guilful trech,
Where this same wicked villein did me wa^dring ketch.
It was a faithless Squire, that was the sourse
Of all my sorrow, and of these sad tears,
With whom from tender dug of commune nourse,
Attonce I was vpbrought, and eft when years
More ripe us reason lent to chose our Pears,
Our selves in league of vowed love we knitt:
In which we long time without gealous fears,
Or faulty thoughts (...), as was fit;
And for my part I vow, dissembled not a whitt.
It was my fortune, commune to that age,
To love a Lady fair of great degree,
The which was borne of noble parentage,
And set in highest seat of dignitee,
Yet seemd no less to love, then loved to be:
Long I her served, and found her faithful still,
Ne ever thing could cause us disagree:
Love that two (...) makes one, makes eke one will:
Each strove to please, and others pleasure to fulfill.
My friend, hight Philemon, I did partake,
Of all my love and all my priuitie;
Who greatly joyous seemed for my sake,
And gracious to that Lady, as to me,
Ne ever wight, that more so welcome be,
As he to her, withouten blott or blame,
Ne ever thing, that she could think or see,
But unto him she would impart the same:
O wretched man, that would abuse so gentle Dame.
At last such grace I found, and means I wrought,
That I that Lady to my spouse had won;
Accord of friends, consent of Parents sought,
Affyaunce made, my happiness begone,
There wanted naught but few rites to be done,
Which marriage make; that day too far did seem:
Most joyous man, on whom the shining Sun,
Did show his face, my self I did esteem,
And that my falser friend did no less joyous deem.
But ear that wished day his beam disclosd,
He either envying my toward good,
Or of him self to treason ill disposd
One day unto me came in friendly mood,
And told for secret how he understood
That Lady whom I had to me assynd,
Had both distaind her honorable blood,
And eke the faith, which she to me did bynd;
And therefore wished me stay, till I more truth should find.
The gnawing anguish and sharp gelosy,
Which his sad speech infixed in my breast,
Ranckled so sore, and festred inwardly,
That my engreeued mind could find no rest,
Till that the truth thereof I did out wrest,
And him besought by that same sacred band
Betwixt us both, to counsel me the best.
He then with solemn oath and plighted hand
Assurd, ere long the truth to let me understand.
Ere long with like again he boorded me,
Saying, he now had boulted all the flower,
And that it was a groom of base degree,
Which of my love was partener Paramoure:
Who used in a darkesome inner bower
Her often to meet: which better to approve,
He promised to bring me at that hour,
When I should see, that would me nearer move,
And drive me to withdraw my blind abused love.
This graceless man for furtherance of his guile,
Did court the handmayd of my Lady dear,
Who glad t'embosome his affection vile,
Did all she might, more pleasing to appear.
One day to work her to his will more near,
He wooed her thus: Pryene (so she hight)
What great despite does fortune to thee bear,
Thus lowly to abase thy beauty bright,
That it should not deface all others lesser light?
But if she had her least help to thee lent,
T'adorne thy form according thy desert,
Their blazing pride thou would soon have blent,
And staynd their praises with thy least good part;
Ne should fair Claribell with all her art,
Though she thy Lady be, approach thee near:
For proof thereof, this evening, as thou art,
Array thy self in her most gorgeous gear,
That I may more delight in thy embracement dear.
The Mayde^ proud through praise, and mad through love
Him hearkened to, and soon her self arayd,
The whiles to me the treachour did remove
His crafty engine, and as he had said,
Me leading, in a secret corner laid,
The sad spectatour of my Tragedy;
Where left, he went, and his own false part played,
Disguised like that groom of base degree,
Whom he had feignd th'abuser of my love to be.
Eftsoons he came unto the appointed place,
And with him brought Pryene, rich arayd,
In Claribellaes clothes. Her proper face
I not descerned in that darkesome shade,
But weend it was my love, with whom he played.
All God, what horror and tormenting grief
My heart, my hands, mine eyes, and all assayd:
Me liefer were ten thousand deaths priefe,
Then wound of gealous worm, and shame of such repriefe.
I home retourning, fraught with foul despite,
And chawing vengeance all the way I went,
Soon as my loathed love appeard in sight,
With wrathful hand I slew her innocent;
That after soon I dearly did lament:
For when the cause of that outrageous deed
Demanded, I made plain and evident,
Her faulty Handmayd, which that bale did breed,
Confessed, how Philemon her wrought to change her weed.
Which when I heard, with horrible affright
And hellish fury all enragd, I sought
Upon my self that vengeable despite
To punish: yet it better first I thought,
To wreake my wrath on him, that first it wrought.
To Philemon, false faytour Philemon
I cast to pay, that I so dearly bought;
Of deadly drugs I gave him drink anon,
And washed away his guilt with guilty potion.
Thus heaping crime on crime, and grief on grief,
To loss of love adjoining loss of friend,
I meant to purge both with a third mischief,
And in my woes beginner it to end:
That was Pryene; she did first offend,
She last should smart: with which cruel intent,
When I at her my murdrous blade did bend,
She fled away with ghastly dreriment,
And I poursewing my fell purpose, after went.
Fear gave her wings, and rage enforst my flight;
Through woods and plains so long I did her chase,
Till this mad man, whom your victorious might
Has now fast bound, me met in middle space,
As I her, so he me poursewd apace,
And shortly ouertooke: I breathing ire,
Sore chauffed at my stay in such a case,
And with my heat kindled his cruel fire;
Which kindled once, his mother did more rage inspyre.
Betwixt them both, they have me done to dye,
Through wounds, and strokes, and stubborn handeling,
That death were better, then such agony,
As grief and fury unto me did bring;
Of which in me yet sticks the mortal sting,
That during life will never be appeasd.
When he thus ended had his sorrowing,
Said Guyon, Squyre, sore have ye been diseasd;
But all your hurts may soon through te^perance be easd.
Then began the Palmer thus, most wretched man,
That to affections does the bridle lend;
In their beginning they are weak and wan,
But soon through suff'rance grow to fearful end;
Whiles they are weak betimes with them contend:
For when they once to perfect strength do grow,
Strong wars they make, and cruel battry bend
Against fort of Reason, it to overthrow:
Wrath, gelosy, grief, love this Squyre have laid thus low.
Wrath, gealosie, grief, love do thus expel:
Wrath is a fire, and gealosie a weed,
Grief is a flood, and love a monster fell;
The fire of sparks, the weed of little seed,
The flood of drops, the Monster filth did breed:
But sparks, feed, drops, and filth do thus delay;
The sparks soon quench, the springing seed outweed
The drops dry up, and filth wipe clean away:
So shall wrath, gealosy, grief, love die and decay.
Unlucky Squire (said Guyon) since thou have
Fallen into mischief through intemperaunce,
Henceforth take heed of that thou now have past,
And guide thy ways with wary governance,
Least worse betide thee by some later chance.
But read how art thou named, and of what kin.
Phaon I hight (quoth he) and do advance
Mine auncestry from famous Coradin,
Who first to raise our house to honor did begin.
Thus as he spoke, lo far away they spyde
A varlet ronning toward hastily,
Whose flying feet so fast their way applyde,
That round about a cloud of dust did fly,
Which mingled all with sweat, did dim his eye.
He soon approached, panting, breathless, whot,
And all so soyld, that none could him descry;
His countenance was bold, and bashed not
For Guyons looks, but scornful eyglaunce at him shot.
Behind his back he bore a brazen shield,
On which was drawn fair, in colors fit,
A flaming fire in midst of bloody field,
And round about the wreath this word was writ,
Burnt I do burn. Right well beseemed it,
To be the shield of some redoubted knight;
And in his hand two darts exceeding flit,
And deadly sharp he held, whose heads were dight
In poison and in blood, of malice and despite.
When he in presence came, to Guyon first
He boldly spoke, Sir knight, if knight thou be,
Abandon this forestalled place at erst,
For fear of further harm, I counsel thee,
Or bide the chance at thine own ieopardee.
The knight at his great boldness wondered,
And though he scornd his idle vanitee,
Yet mildly him to purpose answered;
For not to grow of naught he it coniectured.
Varlet, this place most dew to me I deem,
Yielded by him, that held it forcibly.
But whence should come that harm, which thou do seem
To threat to him, that minds his chance t'abye?
Perdy (said he) here comes, and is hard by
A knight of wondrous power, and great assay,
That never yet encountered enemy,
But did him deadly daunt, or foul dismay;
Ne thou for better hope, if thou his presence stay.
How hight he then (said Guyon) and from whence?
Pyrrhochles is his name, renowned far
For his bold feats and hardy confidence,
Full often approud in many a cruel war,
The brother of Cymochles, both which arre
The sons of old Acrates and Despite,
Acrates son of Phlegeton and Jar;
But Phlegeton is son of Herebus and Night;
But Herebus son of Aeternitie is hight.
So from immortal race he does proceed,
That mortal hands may not withstand his might,
Drad for his derring do, and bloody deed;
For all in blood and spoil is his delight.
His am I Atin, his in wrong and right,
That matter make for him to work upon,
And stir him up to strife and cruel fight.
Fly therefore, fly this fearful stead anon,
Least thy foolhardize work thy sad confusion.
His be that care, whom most it does concern.
(Said he) but whether with such hasty flight
Art thou now bownd? for well mote I discern
Great cause, that carries thee so swifte and light.
My Lord (quoth. he) me sent, and straight behight
To seek Occasion; where so she be:
For he is all disposd to bloody fight,
And breathes out wrath and heinous crueltee;
Hard is his hap, that first falls in his ieopardee.
Mad man (said then the Palmer) that does seek
Occasion to wrath, and cause of strife;
She comes unsought, and shonned follows eke.
Happy, who can abstain, when Rancor rife
Kindles Revenge, and threats his rusty knife;
Woe never wants, where every cause is caught,
And rash Occasion makes unquiet life.
Then lo, where bound she sits, who^ thou have sought,
Said Guyon, let that message to thy Lord be brought.
That when the varlett heard and saw, straight way
He wexed wondrous wroth, and said, Vile knight,
That knights and knighthood do with shame vpbray,
And shewst th'ensa^ple of thy childishe might,
With silly weak old woman that did fight.
Great glory and gay spoil sure have thou got,
And stoutly proved thy puissaunce here in sight;
That shall Pyrrhochles well requite, I wott,
And with thy blood abolish so reproachful blott.
With that one of his thrillant darts he threw,
Headed with ire and vengeable despite;
The quiuering steel his aimed end well knew,
And to his breast it self intended right:
But he was wary, and ere it empight
In the meant mark, aduaunst his shield atweene,
On which it seizing, no way enter might,
But back rebownding, left the forckhead keen;
Estsoones he fled away, and might no where be seen.
Cant. V.
Pyrrhochles does with Guyon fight,
And Furors chain vntyes,
Who him sore wounds, whiles Atin to
Gymochles for aid flies.
WHo ever does to temperaunce apply
His steadfast life, and all his actions frame,
Trust me, shall find no greater enemy,
Then stubborn perturbation, to the same;
To which right well the wise do give that name,
For it the goodly peace of stayed minds
Does overthrow, and troublous war proclaim:
His own woes author, who so bound it finds,
As did Pirrhocles, and it wilfully vnbindes.
After that varlets flight, it was not long,
Ere on the plain fast pricking Guyon spide
One in bright arms embatteiled full strong,
That as the Sunny beams do glaunce and, glide
Upon the trembling wave, so shined bright,
And round about him threw forth sparkling fire,
That seemd him to inflame on every side:
His steed was bloody red, and fomed ire,
When with the maistring spur he did him roughly stire.
Approaching nigh, he never staid to greet,
Ne chaffar words, proud courage to provoke,
But pricked so fires, that underneath his feet
The smouldring dust did rownd about him smoke,
Both horse and man nigh able for to choke;
And fayrly couching his steeleheaded spear,
Him first saluted with a sturdy stroke:
It booted naught Sir Guyon coming near
To think, such hideous puissaunce on foot to bear.
But lightly shunned it, and passing by,
With his bright blade did smite at him so fell,
That the sharp steel arriving forcibly
On his broad shield, bitt not, but glaun cingfell
On his horse neck before the quilred sell,
And from the head the body sundred quight.
So him dismounted low, he did compel
On foot with him to matchen equal fight;
The truncked beast fast bleeding, did him fowly dight.
Sore bruzed with the fall, he slow vprose,
And all enraged, thus him loudly shent;
Disle all knight, whose coward courage chose
To wreake it self on beast all innnocent,
And shund the mark, at which it should be meant,
Thereby thine arms seem strong, but manhood frayl:
So have thou ost with guile thine honor blent;
But little may such guile thee now auayl,
If wonted force and fortune do me not much fayl.
With that he drew his flaming sword, and struck
At him so fiercely, that the upper marge
Of his seuenfolded shield away it took,
And glauncing on his helmet, made a large
And open gash therein: were not his targe,
That broke the violence of his intent,
The weary soul from thence it would discharge,
Nathelesse so sore a buff to him it lent,
That made him reele, and to his breast his beuer bent.
Exceeding wroth was Guyon at that blow,
And much ashamd, that stroke of living arm
Should him dismay, and make him stoup so low,
Though otherwise it did him little harm:
Tho hurling high his iron braced arm,
He smote so manly on his shoulder plate,
That all his left side it did quite disarme;
Yet there the steel stayed not, but inly bate
Deep in his flesh, and opened wide a red floodgate.
Deadly dismayed, with horror of that dint
Pyrrhochles was, and grieved eke entyre;
Yet nathemore did it his fury stint,
But added flame unto his former fire,
That welnigh molt his heart in raging ire;
Ne thenceforth his approved skill, to ward,
Or strike, or hurtle rownd in warlike gyre,
Remembered he, ne cared for his saufgard,
But rudely raged, and like a cruel tygre fared.
He hewd, and lasht, and foynd, and thondred blows,
And every way did seek into his life,
Ne plate, ne male could ward so mighty throws,
But yielded passage to his cruel knife.
But Guyon, in the heat of all his strife,
Was wary wise, and closely did awayt
Advantage, whilst his foe did rage most rife;
Sometimes a thwart, sometimes he struck him strayt,
And falsed often his blows, t'illude him with such bayt.
Like as a Lion, whose imperial power
A proud rebellious Unicorn defyes,
T'auoide the rash assault and wrathful stowre
Of his fires foe, him to a tree applies,
And when him ronning in full course he spies,
He slips aside; the whiles that furious beast
His precious horn, sought of his enimye
Strikes in the stock, ne thence can be releast,
But to the mighty victor yields a bounteous feast.
With such fair slight him Guyon often fayld,
Till at the last all breathless, weary, faint
Him spying, with fresh onsett he assayld,
And kindling new his courage seeming queint,
Struck him so hugely, that through grear constraint
He made him stoup perforce unto his knee,
And do unwilling worship to the Saint,
That on his shield depainted he did see;
Such homage till that instant never learned he.
Whom Guyon seeing stoup, poursewed fast
The present offer of fair victory,
And soon his dreadful blade about he cast,
Wherewith he smote his haughty crest so hye,
That straight on grownd made him full low to lie;
Then on his breast his victor foot he thrust,
With that he cryde, Mercy, do me not dye,
Ne deem thy force by fortunes doom unjust,
That has (maugre her spite) thus low me laid in dust.
Eftsoons his cruel hand Sir Guyon stayed,
Tempring the passion with aduizement slow,
And maistring might on enemy dismayed:
For th'equall die of war he well did know.
Then to him said, Live and alleagaunce owe,
To him, that gives thee life and liberty,
And henceforth by this days ensample trow,
That hasty wroth, and heedlesse hazardry
Do breed repentance late, and lasting infamy.
So up he let him rise, who with grim look
And count'naunce stern vpstanding, began to grind
His grated teeth for great disdeigne, and shook
His sandy locks, long hanging down behind,
Knotted in blood and dust, for grief of mind,
That he in ods of arms was conquered;
Yet in himself some comfort he did find,
That him so noble knight had maystered,
Whose bounty more then might, yet both he wo^dered.
Which Guyon marking said, Be naught agrieu'd,
Sir knight, that thus ye now subdewed arre:
Was never man, who most conquestes atchieu'd
But sometimes had the worse, and lost by war,
Yet shortly gaynd, that loss exceeded far:
Loss is no shame, nor to be less then foe,
But to be lesser, then himself, does mar
Both loosers lot, and victours praise also.
Vain others overthrows, who self does overthrow.
Fly, O Pyrrhochles, fly the dreadful war,
That in thy self thy lesser parts do move,
Outrageous anger, and woe working jar,
Direful impatience, and hartmurdring love;
Those, those thy foes, those warriors far remove,
Which thee to endless bale captiued lead.
But since in might thou did my mercy prove,
Of courtesy to me the cause aread,
That thee against me drew with so impetuous dread.
Dreadlesse (said he) that shall I soon declare:
It was complaind, that thou had done great tort
Unto an aged woman, poor and bare,
And thralled her in chains with strong effort,
(...) of all succor and needful comfort:
That ill beseemes thee, such as I thee see,
To work such shame. Therefore I thee exhort,
To change thy will, and set occasion free,
And to her captive son yield his first (...).
Thereat Sir Guyon smylde, And is that all
(Said he) that thee so sore displeased has?
Great mercy sure, for to enlarge a thrall,
Whose freedom (...) thee turn to greatest scath.
Nath'lesse now quench thy (...) embayling wrath:
Lo there they be; to thee I yield them free.
Thereat he wondrous glad, out of the path
Did lightly leap, where he them bound did see,
And began to break the bands of their captiuitee.
Soon as Occasion felt her self vntyde,
Before her son could well assoyled be,
She to her use returned, and straight defyde
Both Guyon and (...): the one (said he)
Because he (...); the other because he
Was won: So matter did she make of naught,
To stir up strife, and garre them disagree:
But soon as Furor was enlargd, she sought
To kindle his (...) fire, and thousand causes wrought.
It was not long, ere she (...) him so,
That he would algates with Pyrrhochles fight,
And his redeemer chalengd for his foe,
Because he had not well mainteind his right,
But yielded had to that same stranger knight:
Now began Pyrrhochles wex as wood, as he,
And him affronted with impatient might:
So both together fires engrasped be,
Whiles Guyon standing by, their uncouth strife does see.
Him all that while Occasion did provoke
Against Pyrrhochles, and new matter framed
Upon the old, him stirring to be wroke
Of his late wrongs, in which she often him blamed
For suffering such abuse, as knighthood shamed,
And him dishabled (...). But he was wise,
Ne would with vain occasions be inflamed;
Yet others she more urgent did devise:
Yet nothing could him to impatience entise.
Their fell contention still increased more,
And more thereby increased Furors might,
That he his foe has hurt, and wounded sore,
And him in blood and dirt deformed quight.
His mother eke, more to augment his spite,
Now brought to him a (...) fire brond,
Which she in Stygian lake (...) burning bright
Had kindled: that she gave into his hond,
That armd with fire, more hardly he mote him withsto^d
Tho began that villein (...) so fires and strong,
That nothing might (...) his furious forse;
He cast him down to ground, and all along
Drew him through dirt and mire without remorse,
And fowly battered his comely corse,
That (...) much disdeignd so loathly sight.
At last he was compeld to cry perforse,
Help, O Sir Guyon; help most noble knight,
To ridd a wretched man from hands of hellish wight.
The knight was greatly moved at his playnt,
And began him (...) to succor his distress,
Till that the Palmer, by his grave restraynt,
Him stayed from yielding pitiful redress;
(...) said, Dear son, thy causeless ruth repress,
Ne let thy stout heart melt in pity vain:
He that his (...) sought through wilfulness,
And his foe fettred would release again,
Deserves to taste his (...) fruit, repented pain.
Guyon obayd; So him away he drew
From needless trouble of (...) fight
Already fought, his voyage to (...).
But rash (...) varlett, Atin hight,
When late he saw his Lord in heavy plight,
Under Sir Guyons puissaunt stroke to fall,
Him deeming dead, as then he seemd in sight,
Fledd fast away, to tell his funeral
Unto his brother, whom Cymochles men did call.
He was a man of rare redoubted might,
Famous throughout the world for warlike praise,
And glorious spoils, purchased in perilous fight:
Full many doughtie knights he in his days
Had done to death, (...) in (...),
Whose (...), for (...) of his name,
Of fowls and beasts he made the (...) prays,
And hong their conquered arms for more defame
On gallow trees, in honor of his dearest Dame.
His dearest Dame is that Enchaunteresse,
The vile (...), that with vain delights,
And idle pleasures in her Bower of Bliss,
Does charm her lovers, and the feeble sprightes
Can call out of the bodies offraile wightes:
Whom then she does tra^sforme to monstrous hewes,
And horribly misshapes with ugly sightes,
Captived eternally in iron mewes,
And darksom dens, where Titan his face never shows.
There Atin fownd (...) soiourning,
To serve his (...) love for he by kind,
Was given all to dust and loose living,
When ever his fires hands he free mote find:
And now he has pourd out his idle mind
In dainty delices, and lavish joys,
Having his warlike weapons cast behynd,
And flows in pleasures, and vain pleasing toys,
Mingled emongst loose Ladies and lsciuious boys.
And over him, art stryuing to compayre,
With nature, did an Arber green disored,
Framed of want on Yuie, flouring fair,
Through which the fragrant Eglantine did spread
His prickling arms, entrayld with roses red,
Which dainty odours round about them threw,
And all within with flowers was garnished,
That when myld Zephyrus emongst them blew,
Did breath out bounteous smells, and painted colors show
And fast beside, there trickled softly down
A gentle stream, whose murmuring wave did play
Emongst the pumy stones, and made a sown,
To (...) him (...) a sleep, that by it lay;
The weary Traueiler, wandering that way,
Therein did often quench his thristy heat,
And then by it his weary limbs display,
Whiles creeping slomber made him to forget
His former pain, and wypt away his toilsom sweat.
And on the other side a pleasant grove
Was shot up high, full of the stately tree,
That dedicated is to Olympic Jove,
And to his son Alcides, whenas he
In Netmus gained goodly victoree;
Therein the merry birds of every sort
Chaunted alowd their cheerful (...):
And made emongst them felues a sweet consort,
That quickened the dull spright with musical comfort.
There he him found all carelessly displaid,
In secret shadow from the sunny ray,
On a sweet bed of lillies softly laid,
Amidst a flock of Damzelles fresh and gay,
That rownd about him dissolute did play
Their wanton follies, and light meriment;
Every of which did loosely disaray
Her upper parts of meet habiliments,
And showed them naked, decked with many or naments.
And every of them strove, with most delights,
Him to aggrate, and greatest pleasures show;
Some framd fair looks, glancing like evening lights
Others sweet words, dropping like honny dew;
Some bathed kisses, and did soft embrew
The sugared licour through his melting lips:
One boastes her beauty, and does yield to view
Her dainty limbs above her tender hips;
Another her out boastes, and all for try all strips.
He, like an Adder, lurking in the weeds,
His wandering thought in deep desire does steep,
And his frail eye with spoil of beauty feeds;
Sometimes he falsely faines himself to sleep,
Whiles through their lids his wanton eyes do peep,
To steal a snatch of amorous conceit,
Whereby close fire into his heart does creep:
So, he them deceiues, deceiud in his deceit,
Made drunk with drugs of dear voluptuous receipt.
Attin arriving there, when him he spyde,
Thus in still waves of deep delight to wade,
Fiercely approaching, to him lowdly cryde,
Cymochles; oh no, but Cymochles shade,
In which that manly person late did fade,
What is become of great Acrates son?
Or where has he hong up his mortal blade,
That has so many haughty conquests won?
Is all his force forlorn, and all his glory done?
Then pricking him with his sharp pointed dart,
He said; up, up, thou womanish weak knight,
That here in Ladies lap entombed art,
Unmindful of thy praise and prowest might,
And weetlesse eke of lately wrought despite,
Whiles sad Pyrrhochles lies on senseless ground,
And groneth out his utmost grudging spright,
Through many a stroke, and many a streaming wound,
Calling thy help in vain, that here in joys art dround.
Suddeinly out of his delightful dream
The man a woke, and would have questiond more;
But he would not endure that woeful theme
For to dilate at large, but urged sore
With percing words, and pitiful implore,
Him hasty to arise. As one affright
With hellish feends, or Furies mad uproar,
He then vprose, inflamd with fell despite,
And called for his arms; for he would algates fight.
They beney brought; he quickly does him dight,
And lightly mounted, passes on his way,
Ne Ladies loves, ne sweet entreaties might
Appease his heat, or hasty passage stay,
For he has vowed, to been auengd that day,
(That day it self him seemed all too long:)
On him, that did Pyrrhochles dear dismay:
So proudly pricketh on his courser strong,
And Attin ay him pricks with spurs of shame and wrong.
Cant. VI.
Guyon is of immodest Merth,
led into loose desire,
Fights with Cymochles, whiles his bro
there burns in furious fire.
AHarder lesson, to learn Continence
In joyous pleasure, then in grievous pain:
For sweetness does allure the weaker sense
So strongly, that vneathes it can refrain
From that, which feeble nature couets feign;
But grief and wrath, that be her enemies,
And foes of life, she better can abstain;
Yet virtue vauntes in both her victories,
And Guyon in them all shows goodly maysteries.
Whom bold Cymochles traueiling to find,
With cruel purpose bent to wreake on him
The wrath, which Atin kindled in his mind,
Came to a river, by whose utmost brim
Waiting to pass, he saw whereas did swim
A long the shore, as swift as glaunce of eye,
A little Gondelay, bedecked trim
With boughs and arbours wouen cunningly,
That like a little forest seemed outwardly.
And therein sat a Lady fresh and fair,
Making sweet solace to herself alone;
Sometimes she song, as loud as lark in air,
Sometimes she laughed, as merry as Pope Ione,
Yet was there not with her else any one,
That to her might move cause of meriment:
Matter of merth enough, though there were none
She could deuife, and thousand ways invent,
To feed her foolish humor, and vain iolliment.
Which when far of Cymochles heard, and saw,
He lowdly called to such, as were abord,
The little bark unto the shore to draw,
And him to ferry over that deep ford:
The merry mariner unto his word
Soon hearkened, and her painted bote streightway
Turned to the shore, where that same warlike Lord
She in received; but Atin by no way
She would admit, albe the knight her much did pray.
Eftsoons her shallow ship away did slide,
More swift, then (...) sheres the liquid sky,
Withouten oar or Pilot it to guide,
Or winged canuas with the wind to fly,
Only she turned a pin, and by and by
It cut away upon the yielding wave,
Ne cared she her course for to apply:
For it was taught the way, which she would have,
And both from rocks and flats it self could wisely save.
And all the way, the wanton Damsel found
New merth, her passenger to entertain:
For she in pleasant purpose did abound,
And greatly ioyed merry tales to feign,
Of which a storehouse did with her remain,
Yet seemed, nothing well they her became;
For all her words she drowned with laughter vain,
And wanted grace in vtt'ring of the same,
That turned all her pleasaunce to ascoffing game.
And other whiles vain toys she would deuize,
As her fantastic wit did most delight,
Sometimes her head she fondly would aguize
With gaudy girlonds, or fresh flowrets dight
About her neck, or rings of rushes plight;
Sometimes to do him laugh, she would assay
To laugh at shaking off the leaves light,
Or to behold the water work, and play
About her little frigot, therein making way.
Her light behavior, and loose dalliaunce
Gave wondrous great contentment to the knight,
That of his way he had no souenaunce,
Nor care of vowed revenge, and cruel fight,
But to weak wench did yield his martial might.
So easy was to quench his flamed mind
With one sweet drop of sensual delight.
So easy is, to appease the stormy wind
Of malice in the calm of pleasant womankind.
Diverse discourses in their way they spent,
Among which Cymochles of her questioned,
Both what she was, and what that usage meant,
Which in her cott she daily practiced.
Vain man (said she) that would be reckoned
A stranger in thy home, and ignorant
Of Phaedria (for so my name is red)
Of Phaedria, thine own fellow servant;
For thou to serve Acrasia thy self do vaunt.
In this wide Inland sea, that hight by name
The Idle lake, my wandering ship I row,
That knows her port, and thither sails by aim,
Ne care, ne fear I, how the wind do blow,
Or whether swift I wend, or whether slow:
Both slow and swift a like do serve my turn,
Ne swelling Neptune, ne loud thundering Jove
Can change my cheer, or make me ever mourn;
My little boat can safely pass this perilous bourne.
Whiles thus she talked, and whiles thus she toyd,
They were far past the passage, which he spoke,
And come unto an Island, waste and void,
That floted in the midst of that great lake,
There her small Gondelay her port did make,
And that gay pair issewing on the shore
Disburdned her. Their way they forward take
Into the land, that lay them fair before,
Whose pleasaunce she him showed, and plentiful great store.
It was a chosen plott of fertile land,
Emongst wide waves set, like a little nest,
As if it had by Natures cunning hand,
Been choycely picked out from all the rest,
And laid forth for ensample of the best:
No dainty flower or herb, that grows on grownd,
No arborett with painted blossoms dressed,
And smelling sweet, but there it might be fownd
To bud out fair, and throw her sweet smells al arownd.
No tree, whose branches did not bravely spring;
No branch, whereon a fine bird did not sit:
No bird, but did her shrill notes sweetly sing;
No song but did contain a lovely ditt:
Trees, branches, birds, and songs were framed fit,
For to allure frail mind to careless ease.
Careless the man soon woxe, and his weak wit
Was overcome of thing, that did him please;
So pleased, did his wrathful purpose fair appease.
Thus when she had his eyes and senses fed
With false delights, and filled with pleasures vayn,
Into a shady dale she soft him led,
And laid him down upon a grassy plain;
And her sweet self without dread, or disdayn,
She set beside, laying his head disarmd
In her loose lap, it softly to sustayn,
Where soon he slumbred fearing not be harmd,
The whils with a love lay she thus him sweetly charmd.
Behold, O man, that toilesome pains do take
The flowrs, the fields, and all that pleasant grows,
How they them selves do thine ensample make,
Whiles nothing envious nature them forth throws
Out of her fruitful lap; how noman knows,
They spring, they bud, they blossom fresh and fair,
And deck the world with their rich po^pous shows;
Yet no man for them takes pains or care,
Yet no man to them can his careful pains compare.
The lilly, Lady of the flowring field,
The flower deluce, her lovely Paramoure,
Bid thee to them thy fruitless labors yield,
And soon leave off this toylsome weary stoure;
Lo lo how brave she decks her bounteous boure,
With silkin curtens and gold couerletts,
Therein to shroud her sumptuous Belamoure,
Yet nether spinnes nor cards, ne cares nor fretts,
But to her mother Nature all her care she letts.
Why then do thou, O man, that of them all
Art Lord, and eke of nature Sovereign,
Wilfully make thy self a wretched thrall,
And waste thy joyous hours in needelesse pain,
Seeking for danger and adventures vain?
What boots it al to have, and nothing use?
Who shall him rue, that swimming in the maine,
Will die for thrist, and water does refuse?
Refuse such fruitless toil, and present pleasures choose.
By this she had him lulled fast a sleep,
That of no wordly thing he care did take;
Then she with liquors strong his eyes did steep,
That nothing should him hastily awake:
So she him left, and did her self betake
Unto her boat again, with which she clefte
The slothful wave of that great griesy lake;
Soon she that Island far behind her left,
And now is come to that same place, where first she wefte.
By this time was the worthy Guyon brought
Unto the other side of that wide strond,
Where she was rowing, and for passage sought:
Him needed not long call, she soon to hond
Her ferry brought, where him she byding fond,
With his sad guide; him self she took a board,
But the Black Palmer suffered still to stond,
Ne would for price, or prayers once afford,
To ferry that old man over the perlous foord.
Guyon was loath to leave his guide behind,
Yet being entered, might not back retire;
For the flitt bark, obaying to her mind,
Forth launched quickly, as she did desire,
Ne gave him leave to bid that aged sire
Adieu, but nimbly ran her wonted course
Through the dull billows thick as troubled mire,
Whom nether wind out of their seat could forse,
Nor timely tides did drive out of their sluggish sourse.
And by the way, as was her wonted guize,
Her merry fit she freshly began to rear,
And did of joy and iollity deuize,
Her self to cherish, and her guest to cheer:
The knight was courteous, and did not forbear
Her honest merth and pleasaunce to partake;
But when he saw her toy, and gibe, and gear,
And pass the bonds of modest merimake,
Her dalliaunce he despisd, and follies did forsake.
Yet she still followed her former style,
And said, and did all (...) him delight,
Till they arrived in that pleasant I Will,
Where sleeping late she left her other knight.
But whenas Guyon of that land had fight,
He wist him self amiss, and angry said;
Ah Dame, perdy ye have not done me right,
Thus to mislead me, whiles I you obaid:
Me little needed from my right way to have straid.
Fair Sir (quoth. she) be not displeasd at all;
Who fares on sea, may not command his way,
Ne wind and weather at his pleasure call:
The sea is wide, and easy for to stray;
The wind unstable, and does never stay.
But here a while ye may in safety rest,
Till season serve new passage to assay;
Better safe port, then be in seas distressed.
Therewith she laughed, and did her earnest end in jest.
But he half discontent, (...) nathelesse
Himself appease, and issewd forth on shore:
The joys whereof, and happy fuitfulnesse,
Such as he saw, she began him lay before,
And all though pleasant, yet she made much more:
The fields did laugh, the flowers did freshly spring,
The trees did bud, and early blossoms bore,
And all the quire of birds did sweetly sing,
And told that gardins pleasures in their caroling.
And she more sweet, then any bird on bough,
Would oftentimes emongst them bear a part,
And strive to pass (as she could well enough)
Their native music by her skilful art:
So did she all, that might his constant heart
Withdraw from thought of warlike enterprise,
And drown in dissolute delights apart,
Where noise of arms, or view of martial guize
Might not revive desire of knightly exercize.
But he was wise, and wary of her will,
And ever held his hand upon his heart:
Yet would not seem so rude, and thewed ill,
As to despise so courteous seeming part,
That gentle Lady did to him impart,
But fairly tempring fond desire subdewd,
And ever her desired to depart.
She list not hear, but her disports poursewd,
And ever bad him stay, till time the tide renewd.
And now by this, Cymochles hour was spent,
That he awoke out of his idle dreme,
And shaking off his drowsy dreriment,
Began him auize, how ill did him beseme,
In slothful sleep his molten heart to steme,
And quench the brond of his conceived ire.
Tho up he started, stird with shame extreme,
Ne stayed for his Damsel to inquire,
But marched to the Strond, their passage to require.
And in the way he with Sir Guyon met,
Accompanyde with Phaedria the fair,
Eftsoons he began to rage, and inly frett,
Crying, Let be that Lady debonaire,
Thou recreaunt knight, and soon thy self prepaire
To batteile, if thou mean her love to gayn:
Lo, lo already, how the fowls in air
Do flock, awaiting shortly to obtayn
Thy carcas for their pray, the guerdon of thy pain.
And therewith all he fiersly at him flew,
And with importune outrage him assayld;
Who soon prepared to field, his sword forth drew,
And him with equal value counteruayld:
Their mighty strokes their haberieons dismayld,
And naked made each others manly spalles;
The mortal steel despiteously entayld
Deep in their flesh, quite through the iron walls,
That a large purple stream adown their giambeux falls.
Cymocles, that had never met before,
So puissant foe, with envious despite
His proud presumed force increased more,
Disdeigning to be held so long in fight;
Sir Guyon grudging not so much his might,
As those vnknightly ray linges, which he spoke,
With wrathful fire his courage kindled bright,
Thereof devising shortly to be wroke,
And doubling all his powers, redoubled every stroke.
Both of them high attonce their hands enhaunst,
And both attonce their huge blows down did sway;
Cymochles sword on Guyons shield yglaunst,
And there of nigh one quarter sheard away;
But Guyons angry blade so fires did play
On the others helmett, which as Titan shone,
That quite it cloue his plumed crest in tway,
And bared all his head unto the bone;
Wherewith astonished, still he stood, as senseless stone.
Still as he stood, fair Phaedria, that beheld
That deadly danger, soon atweene them ran;
And at their feet her self most humbly feld,
Crying with pitteous voice, and countenance wan;
Ah well away, most noble Lords, how can
Your cruel eyes endure so pitteous sight,
To shed your lives on ground? woe worth the man,
That first did teach the cursed steel to bight
In his own flesh, and make way to the living spright.
If ever love of Lady did empierce
Your iron breasts, or pity could find place,
Withhold your bloody hands from battaill fierce,
And since for me ye fight, to me this grace
Both yield, to stay your deadly strife a space.
They stayed a while: and forth she began proceed:
Most wretched woman, and of wicked race,
That am the author of this heinous deed,
And cause of death between two doughtie knights do breed.
But if for me ye fight, or me will serve,
Not this rude kind of battaill, nor these arms
Are meet, the which do men in bale to sterue,
And doolefull sorrow heap with deadly harms:
Such cruel game my scarmoges disarmes:
Another war, and other weapons I
Do love, where love does give his sweet Alarmes,
Without bloodshed, and where the enemy
Does yield unto his foe a pleasant victory.
Debatefull strife, and cruel enmity
The famous name of knighthood fowly shend;
But lovely peace, and gentle amity,
And in Amors the passing hours to spend,
The mighty martial hands do most commend;
Of love they ever greater glory bore,
Then of their arms: Mars is Cupidoes friend,
And is for Venus loves renowned more,
Then all his wars and spoils, the which he did of yore.
Therewith she sweetly smyld. They though full bent,
To prove extremities of bloody fight,
Yet at her speech their rages began relent,
And calm the sea of their tempestuous spite,
Such power have pleasing words: such is the might
Of courteous clemency in gentle heart.
Now after all was ceast, the Faery knight
Besought that Damzell suffer him depart,
And yield him ready passage to that other part.
She no less glad, then he desirous was
Of his departure thence; for of her joy
And vain delight she saw he light did pas,
A foe of folly and immodest toy,
Still solemn sad, or still disdainful coy,
Delighting all in arms and cruel war,
That her sweet peace and pleasures did annoy,
Troubled with terror and unquiet jar,
That she well pleased was thence (...) amoue him far.
Tho him she brought abord, and her swift bote
Forthwith directed to that further strand;
The which on the dull waves did lightly flote
And soon arrived on the shallow sand,
Where gladsome Guyon salied forth to land,
And to that Damsel thanks gave for reward.
Upon that shore he spyed Atin stand,
Thereby his master left, when late he fared
In Phaedrias flitt barck over that perlous shard.
Well could he him remember, since of late
He with (...) sharp debatement made;
Straight began he him reuyle, and bitter rate,
As Shepherds curre, that in dark eueninges shade
Has tracted forth some saluage beasts trade;
Vile Miscreaunt (said he) whether do thou fly
The shame and death, which will thee soon invade?
What coward hand shall do thee next to dye,
That art thus fowly fledd from famous enemy?
With that he stiffly shook his steelhead dart:
But sober Guyon, hearing him so rail,
Though somewhat moved in his mighty heart,
Yet with strong reason maistred passion frail,
And passed fayrely forth. He turning tail,
Back to the strond retyrd, and there still stayed,
Awaiting passage, which him late did fail;
The whiles Cymochles with that wanton maid
The hasty heat of his auowd revenge delayed
Whylest there the varlet stood, he saw from far
An armed knight, that toward him fast ran,
He ran on foot, as if in lucklesse war
His forlorn steed from him the victour wan;
He seemed breathless, hartlesse, faint, and wan,
And all his armor sprinkled was with blood,
And soyld with durtie gore, that no man can
Discern the hew thereof. He never stood,
But bent his hasty course toward the idle flood.
The varlett saw, when to the flood he came,
How without stop or stay he fiersly lept,
And deep him self beducked in the same,
That in the lake his lofty crest was stepped,
Ne of his safety seemed care he kept,
But with his raging arms he rudely flasht,
The waves about, and all his armor swept,
That all the blood and filth away was washed,
Yet still he bet the water, and the billows dashed.
Atin drew nigh, to weet, what it mote be;
For much he wondered at that uncouth sight;
Whom should he, but his own dear Lord, (...),
His own dear Lord Pyrrhochles, in sad plight,
Ready to drown him self for fell despite.
Harrow now out, and well away, he cryde,
What dismal day has lent but this his cursed light,
To see my Lord so deadly damnifyde
Pyrrhochles, O Pyrrhochles, what is thee betyde?
I burn, I burn, I burn, then loud he cryde,
O how I burn with implacable fire,
Yet naught can quench mine inly flaming side,
Nor sea of licour cold, nor lake of mire,
Nothing but death can do me to respyre.
Ah be it (said he) from Pyrrhochles far
After pursewing death once to require,
Or think, that ought those puissant hands may mar
Death is for wretches borne under unhappy star.
Perdye, then is it fit for me (said he)
That am, I ween, most wretched man alive,
Burning in flames, yet no flames can I see,
And dying daily, daily yet revive:
O Atin, help to me last death to give.
The varlet at his plaint was grieved so sore,
That his deep wounded heart in two did riue,
And his own health remembering now no more,
Did follow that ensample, which he blamed before.
Into the lake he lept, his Lord to aid,
(So Love the dread of danger does despise)
And of him catching hold him strongly stayed
From drowning. But more happy he, then wise
Of that seas nature did him not auise.
The waves thereof so slow and sluggish were,
Engrost with mud, which did them foul agrise,
That every weighty thing they did vpbeare,
Ne ought mote ever sinck down to the bottom there.
Whiles thus they strugled in that idle wave,
And strove in vain, the one him self to drown,
The other both from drowning for to save,
Lo, to that shore one in an ancient gown,
Whose hoary locks great gravity did crown,
Holding in hand a goodly arming sword,
By fortune came, ledd with the troublous sown:
Where drenched deep he fownd in that dull ford
The careful servant, stryuing with his raging Lord.
Him Atin spying, knew right well of yore,
And lowdly called, Help help, O Archimage,
To save my Lord, in wretched plight forlore;
Help with thy hand, or with thy counsel sage:
Weak hands, but counsel is most strong in age.
Him when the old man, saw he woundred sore,
To see Pyrrhochles there so rudely rage:
Yet since help, he saw, he needed more
Then pity, he in have approached to the shore.
And called, Pyrrhochles, what is this, I see?
What hellish fury has at erst thee hent?
Furious ever I thee knew to be,
Yet never in this strange astonishment.
These flames, these flames (he cryde) do me torment.
What flames (quoth. he) when I thee present see,
In danger rather to be drent, then brent?
Harrow, the flames, which me consume (said he)
Ne can be quenched, within my secret bowelles be.
That cursed man, that cruel feend of hell,
Furor, oh Furor has me thus bedight:
His deadly wounds within my livers swell,
And his whott fire burns in mine entralles bright,
Kindled through his infernal brond of spite,
Since late with him I batteill vain would boste,
That now I ween Jove's dreaded thunder light
Does scorch not half so sore, nor damned ghost
In flaming Phlegeton does not so felly roste.
Which when as Archimago heard, his grief
He knew right well, and him attonce disarmd:
Then searched his secret wounds, and made a priefe
Of every place, that was with bruzing harmd,
Or with the hidden fire inly warmd.
Which done, he balmes and herbs thereto applyde,
And evermore with mighty spells them charmd,
That in short space he has them qualifyde,
And him restored to health, that would have algates did.
Cant. VII.
Guyon finds Mamon in a delue,
sunning his threasure hoar:
Is by him tempted, and led down,
To see his secret store.
AS Pilot well expert in perilous wave,
That to a steadfast star his course has bent,
When foggy mistes, or cloudy tempests have
The faithful light of that fair lamp yblent,
And covered heaven with hideous dreriment,
Upon his card and compass firmes his eye,
The masters of his long experiment,
And to them does the steady helm apply,
Bidding his winged vessel fairly forward fly.
So Guyon having lost his trusty guide,
Late left beyond that Idle lake, proceeds
Yet on his way, of none accompanyde;
And evermore himself with comfort feeds,
Of his own virtues, and praise-worthie deeds.
So long he yode, yet no adventure found,
Which fame of her shrill trompet worthy reeds:
For still he traueild through wide wastfull ground,
That naught but desert wilderness showed all around.
At last he came unto a gloomy glade,
Covered with boughs and shrubs from heavens light,
Whereas he sitting found in secret shade
An uncouth, saluage, and uncivil wight,
Of griesly hew, and foul ill favored sight;
His face with smoke was tand and eyes were bleard
His head and beard with sout were ill bedight,
His cole-blacke hands did seem to have been seard
In smythes fire-spitting forge, and nails like claws appeard.
His iron cote all ouergrowne with rust,
Was underneath enueloped with gold,
Whose glistring gloss darkened with filthy dust,
Well yet appeared, to have been of old
A work of rich entayle, and curious mould,
Wouen with antickes and wyld ymagery:
And in his lap a mass of coin he told,
And turned vpside down, to feed his eye
And covetous desire with his huge threasury.
And round about him lay on every side
Great heaps of gold, that never could be spent:
Of which some were rude owre, not purifide
Of Malcibers devouring element;
Some others were new driven, and distent
Into great Ingowes, and to wedges square;
Some in round plates withouten moniment:
But most were stamped, and in their metal bare
The antique shapes of kings and (...) straung and rare.
Soon as he Guyon saw, in great affright
And haste he rose, for to remove aside
Those precious hills from strangers envious sight,
And down them poured through an hole full wide,
Into the hollow earth, them there to hide.
But Guyon lightly to him leaping, stayed
His hand, that trembled, as one terrifyde;
And though him self were at the sight dismayed,
Yet him perforce restraynd, and to him doubtful said.
What art thou man, (if man at all thou art)
That here in desert have thine habitaunce,
And these rich hills of wealth do hide apart
From the worlds eye, and from her right vsaunce?
Thereat with staring eyes fixed askaunce,
In great disdain, he answered, Hardy Elfe,
That dare view my direful countenance,
I read thee rash, and heedlesse of thy self,
To trouble my still seat, and heaps of precious pelf.
God of the world and worldlings I me call,
Great Mammon, greatest god below the sky,
That of my plenty pour out unto all,
And unto none my graces do envy:
Riches, renown, and principality,
Honor, estate, and all this worlds good,
For which men swinck and sweat incessantly,
Fro me do flow into an ample flood,
And in the hollow earth have their eternal brood.
Wherefore if me thou deigne to serve and (...),
At thy command lo all these mountains be;
Or if to thy great mind, or greedy view
All these may not suffice, there shall to thee
Ten times so much be nombred francke and free.
Mammon (said he) thy godheads vaunt is vain,
And idle offers of thy golden fee;
To them, that covet such eye-glutting gain,
Proffer thy gifts, and fitter servant entertain.
Me ill besits, that in derdoing arms,
And honors suit my vowed days do spend,
Unto thy bounteous baytes, and pleasing charms,
With which weak men thou witchest, to attend:
Regard of worldly mucke does fowly blend,
And low abase the high heroicke spright,
That joys for crowns and kingdoms to contend;
Fair shields, gay steedes, bright arms be my delight:
Those be the riches fit for an aduent'rous knight.
Vain glorious Elfe (said he) do not thou weet,
That money can thy wantes at will supply?
Sheilds, steeds, and arms, and all things for thee meet
It can purvay in twinkling of an eye;
And crowns and kingdoms to thee multiply.
Do not I kings create, and throw the crown
Sometimes to him, that low in dust does ly?
And him that raignd, into his rowme thrust down,
And whom I lust, do heap with glory and renown?
All otherwise (said he) I riches read,
And deem them root of all disquietnesse;
First got with guile, and then preserved with dread,
And after spent with pride and lavishness,
Leaving behind them grief and heaviness.
Infinite mischiefs of them do arize,
Strife, and debate, bloodshed, and bitterness,
Outrageous wrong, and hellish couetize,
That noble heart in great dishonor does despize.
Ne thine be kingdoms, ne the scepters thine;
But realms and rulers thou do both confound,
And loyal truth to treason do incline;
Witness the guiltless blood pourd often on ground,
The crowned often slain, the slayer cround,
The sacred Diadem in pieces rent,
And purple robe gored with many a wound;
Castles surprizd, great cities sacked and brent:
So make thou kings, and gaynest wrongful government.
Long were to tell the troublous storms, that toss
The private state, and make the life unsweet:
Who swelling sails in Caspian sea does cross,
And in frail wood on Adrian gulf does fleet,
Does not, I ween, so many evils meet.
Then Mammon wexing wroth, And why then, said,
Are mortal men so fond and indiscreet,
So evil thing to seek unto their aid,
And having not complain, and having it upbraid?
Indeed (quoth he) through foul intemperaunce,
Frail men are often captived to couetise:
But would they think, with how small allowaunce
Untroubled Nature does her self suffice,
Such superfluities they would despise,
Which with sad cares empeach our native joys:
At the well head the purest streams arise:
But mucky filth his braunching arms annoyes,
And with uncomely weeds the gentle wave accloyes.
The antique world, in his first flowring youth,
Fownd no defect in his Creators grace,
But with glad thanks, (...) unreproved truth,
The gifts of sovereign bounty did embrace:
Like Angels life was then men's happy case;
But later ages pride, like corn-fed steed,
Abusd her plenty, and fat swollen encreace
To all licentious lust, and began exceed
The measure of her mean, and natural first need.
Then began a cursed hand the quiet womb
Of his great Grandmother with steel to wound,
And the hid treasures in her sacred tomb,
With Sacrilege to dig. Therein he fownd
Fountains of gold and silver to abownd,
Of which the matter of his huge desire
And pompous pride estsoones he did compownd;
Then avarice began through his veins (...)
His greedy flames, and kindled life-deuouring fire.
Son (said he then) let be thy bitter scorn,
And leave the rudeness of that antique age
To them, that lived therein in state forlorn;
Thou that do live in later times, must wage
Thy works for wealth, and life for gold engage.
If then thee list my offered grace to use,
Take what thou please of all this surplusage;
If thee list not, leave have thou to refuse:
But thing refused, do not afterward accuse.
Me list not (said the Elfin knight) receive
Thing offered, till I know it well be got,
Ne wot I, but thou did these goods bereave
From rightful owner by unrighteous lot,
Or that bloodguiltnesse or guile them blott.
Perdy (quoth. he) yet never eye did view,
Ne tongue did tell, ne hand these handled not,
But safe I have them kept in secret mew,
From heuens sight, and power of al which the^ poursew.
What secret place (quoth. he) can (...) hold
So huge a mass, and hide from heavens eye?
Or where have thou thy won, that so much gold
Thou can preserve from wrong and robbery?
Come thou (quoth. he.) and see. So by and by.
Through that thick covert he him led, and fownd
A darkesome way, which no man could descry,
That deep descended through the hollow grownd,
And was with dread and horror compassed arownd.
At length they came into a larger space,
That stretched it self into an ample plain,
Through which a beaten broad high way did trace,
That straight did lead to Plutoes griesly rain:
By that ways side, there sat internal Pain,
And fast beside him sat tumultuous Strife:
The one in hand an iron whip did strain,
The other (...) a bloody knife,
And both did gnash their teeth, and both did threten life.
On the other side in one consort there sat,
Cruel Revenge, and rancorous Despite,
Disloyal Treason, and hart-burning Hate,
But gnawing Gealosy out of their sight
Sitting alone, his bitter lips did bight,
And trembling Fear still to and fro did fly,
And found no place, where safe he shroud him might,
Lamenting Sorrow did in darkness lie.
And shame his ugly face did hide from living eye.
And over them sad horror with grim hew,
Did always sore, beating his iron wings;
And after him Owls and Night-rauens flew,
The hateful messengers of heavy things,
Of death and dolor telling sad tidings;
Whiles sad Celeno, sitting on a clifte,
A song of bale and bitter sorrow sings,
That heart of flint a sonder could have rifte:
Which having ended, after him she flies swifte.
All these before the gates of Pluto lay,
By whom they passing, spoke unto them naught.
But th'Elfin knight with wonder all the way
Did feed his eyes, and filled his inner thought.
At last him to a little door he brought,
That to the gate of Hell, which gaped wide,
Was next adjoining, ne them (...) naught:
Betwtxt them both was but a little stride,
That did the house of Richesse from hellmouth divide.
Before the door sat selfe-consuming Care,
Day and night keeping wary watch and ward,
For fear least Force or Fraud should unaware
Break in, and spoil the treasure there in guard:
Ne would he suffer Sleep once thether-ward
Approach, albe his drowsy den were next;
For next to death is Sleep to be compard:
Therefore his house is unto his annexed;
Here Sleep, there Richesse, and Helgate the^ both betwext.
So soon as Mammon there arriud, the door
To him did open, and affoorded way;
Him followed eke Sir Guy on evermore,
Ne darkness him, ne danger might dismay.
Soon as he entered was, the door straight way
Did shutt, and from behind it forth there lept
An ugly feend, more foul then dismal day,
The which with monstrous stalk behind him stepped,
And ever as he went, dew watch upon him kept.
Well hoped he, ere long that hardy guest,
If ever covetous hand, or lustful eye,
Or lips he laid on thing, that likte him best,
Or ever sleep his eiestrings did untie,
Should be his pray. And therefore still on hye
He over him did hold his cruel claws,
Threatening with greedy gripe to do him (...)
And rend in pieces with his ravenous paws,
If ever he transgrest the fatal Stygian laws.
That houses form within was rude and strong,
Like an huge cave, hewne out of rocky clifte,
From whose rough vaut the ragged breaches hong,
Embost with massy gold of glorious guifte,
And with rich metal loaded every rifte,
That heavy ruin they did seem to threatt;
And over them Arachne high did lift
Her cunning web, and spread her subtle nett,
Enwrapped in foul smoke and clouds more black then Iett.
Both roof, and floor, and walls were all of gold,
But ouergrowne with dust and old decay,
And hid in darkness, that none could behold
The hew thereof: for view of cherefull day
Did never in that house it self display,
But a faint shadow of uncertain light;
Such as a lamp, whose life does fade away:
Or as the Moon clothed with clowdy night,
Does show to him, that walks in fear and sad affright.
In all that rowme was nothing to be seen,
But huge great iron chests and coffers strong,
All bard with double bends, that none could ween
Them to efforce by violence or wrong:
On every side they placed were along.
But all the grownd with sculs was scattered,
And dead men's bones, which round about were flo^g,
Whose lives, it seemed, whilome there were shed,
And their vile carcases now leftvnburied.
They forward pass, ne Guyon yet spoke word,
Till that they came unto an iron door,
Which to them opened of his own accord,
And showed of richesse such exceeding store,
As eye of man did never see before,
Ne ever could within one place be fownd,
Though all the wealth, which is, or was of yore,
Could gathered be through all the world arownd,
And that above were added to that under grownd.
The charge thereof unto a covetous Spright
Commanded was, who thereby did attend,
And warily awaited day and night,
From other covetous feends it to defend,
Who it to rob and ransacke did intend.
Then Hammon turning to that warrior, said;
Lo here the worlds blis, lo here the end,
To which al men do aim, rich to be made:
Such grace now to be happy, is before thee laid.
Certes (said he) I n'ill thine offered grace,
Ne to be made so happy do intend:
Another blis before mine eyes I place,
Another happiness, another end.
To them, that list, these base regardes I lend:
But I in arms, and in atchieuements brave,
Do rather choose my flitting hours to spend,
And to be Lord of those, that riches have,
Then them to have my self, and be their servile sclaue.
Thereat the feend his gnashing teeth did grate,
And grieved, so long to lack his greedy pray;
For well he weened, that so glorious bayte
Would tempt his guest, to take thereof assay:
Had he so done, he had him snatched away,
More light then Culuer in the Faulcons fist.
Eternal God thee save from such decay.
But when as Mammon saw his purpose mist,
Him to entrap unawares another way he wist.
Thence forward he him ledd, and shortly brought
Unto another rowme, whose door forthright,
To him did open, as it had been taught:
Therein an hundred raunges weren pight,
And hundred fournaces all burning bright;
By every fournace many feendes did bide,
Deformed creatures, horrible in sight,
And every feend his busy pains applyde.
To melt the golden metal, ready to be tryde.
One with great bellows gathered filling air,
And with forced wind the fuel did inflame;
Another did the dying bronds repair
With dying tongs, and sprinkled often the same
With liquid waves, fires Vulcans rage to tame,
Who maystring them, renewd his former heat;
Some scumd the dross, that from the metal came.
Some stird the molten owre with ladles great;
And every one did swincke, and every one did sweat.
But when an earthly wight they present saw,
Glistring in arms and battailous array,
From their whot work they did themselves withdraw
To wonder at the sight: for till that day,
They never creature saw, that came that way.
Their staring eyes sparckling with fervent fire,
And ugly shapes did nigh the man dismay,
That were it not for shame, he would retire,
Till that him thus bespake their sovereign Lord and sire.
Behold, thou Faeries son, with mortal eye,
That living eye before did never see:
The thing, that thou did crave so earnestly,
To weet, whence all the wealth late showed by me,
Proceeded, lo now is reueald to thee.
Here is the fountain of the worlds good:
Now therefore, if thou will enriched be,
Auise thee well, and change thy wilful mood,
Least thou perhaps hereafter wish, and be withstood.
Suffice it then, thou Money God (quoth. he)
That all thine idle offers I refuse.
All that I need I have; what needs me
To covet more, then I have cause to use?
With such vain shows thy worldlinges vile abuse:
But give me leave to follow mine emprise.
Mammon was much displeasd, yet no'te he choose,
But bear the rigor of his bold mesprise,
And thence him forward ledd, him further to entise.
He brought him through a darksom narrow strayt,
To a broad gate, all built of beaten gold:
The gate was open, but therein did wayt
A fturdie villein, stryding stiff and bold,
As if the highest God defy he would;
In his right hand an iron club he held,
And he himself was all of iron mould,
Yet had both life and sense, and well could weld
That cursed weapon, when his cruel foes he queld.
Disdain he called was, and did disdain
To be so called, and who so did him call:
Stern was his look, and full of stomach vain,
His portaunce terrible, and stature tall,
Far passing th'hight of men terrestrial;
Like an huge Giant of the Titans race,
That made him scorn all creatures great and small,
And with his pride all others power deface:
More fit emongst black fiendes, then men to have his place.
Soon as those glitterand arms he did espy,
That with their brightness made that darkness light,
His harmefull club he began to hurtle hye,
And threaten batteill to the Faery knight;
Who likewise began himself to batteill dight,
Till Mammon did his hasty hand with hold,
And counseld him abstain from perilous fight:
For nothing might abash the villein bold,
Ne mortal steel emperce his miscreated mould.
So having him with reason pacifyde,
And the fires Carle commanding to forbear,
He brought him in. The rowme was large and wide,
As it some Gyeld or solemn Temple wear:
Many great golden pillours did vpbeare
The massy roof, and riches huge sustain,
And every pillour decked was full dear
With crowns and Diademes, and titles vain,
Which mortal Princes wore, whiles they on earth did (...).
A route of people there assembled were,
Of every sort and nation under sky,
Which with great uproar preaced to draw nere
To th'vpper part, where was advanced hye
A stately siege of sovereign majesty,
And thereon satt a woman gorgeous gay,
And richly cladd in robes of royaltye,
That never earthly Prince in such array
His glory did enhaunce and pompous pride display.
Her face right wondrous fair did seem to be,
That her broad beauties beam great brightness threw
Through the dim shade, that all men might it see:
Yet was not that same her own native hew,
But wrought by art and counterfetted show,
Thereby more lovers unto her to call;
Nath'lesse most heavenly fair in deed and view
She by creation was, till she did fall,
The^ceforth she sought for helps to (...) crimewithall.
There as in glistring glory she did sit,
She held a great gold chain ylincked well,
Whose upper end to highest heaven was knitt,
And lower part did reach to lowest Hell,
And all that preace did rownd about her swell,
To catchen hold of that long chain, thereby
To climb aloft, and others to excel:
That was Ambition, rash desire to sty,
And every linck thereof a step of dignity.
Some thought to raise themselves to high degree,
By riches and unrighteous reward,
Some by close shouldring, some by flatteree;
Others through friends, others for base regard;
And all by wrong ways for themselves prepared.
Those that were up themselves, kept others low,
Those that were low themselves held others hard,
Ne suffered them to rise or greater grow,
But every one did (...) his fellow down to throw.
Which whenas Guyon saw, he began inquire,
What meant that preace about that Ladies (...),
And what she was that did so high aspyre,
Him Mammon answered, That goodly one,
Whom all that folk with such contention,
Doeflock about, my dear my daughter is,
Honor and dignity from her alone,
Derived are, and all this worlds blis
For which ye men do strive: few get, but many mis.
And fair Philotime she rightly hight,
The fairest wight that wonneth under sky,
But that this darksom nether world her light
Does dim with horror and deformity,
Worthy of heaven and hye felicity,
From whence the gods have her for envy thrust:
But since thou have found favor in mine eye,
Thy spouse I will her make, if that thou lust,
That she may thee advance for works and merits just.
Gramercy Mammom (said the gentle knight)
For so great grace and offered high estate,
But I, that am frail flesh and earthly wight,
Unworthy match for such immortal mate,
My self well wot, and mine unequal fate,
And were I not, yet is my troth yplight,
And love (...) to other Lady late,
That to remove the same I have no might:
To (...) love causeless is reproach to warlike knight
(...) emmoued was with inward wrath;
Yet forcing it to feign, him forth thence ledd
Through griesly shadows by a beaten path,
Into a gardin goodly garnished
With herbs and fruits, whose kinds mote not be redd.
Not such, as earth out of her fruitful woomb
Throws forth to men sweet and well savored,
But direful deadly black both leaf and bloom,
Fit to adorn the dead and deck the drery toombe.
There mournful Cypress grew in greatest store,
And trees of bitter Gall, and Heben sad,
Dead sleeping Poppy, and black Hellebore,
Cold Coloquintida, and Tetra mad,
Mortal Samnitis, and Cicuta bad,
Which with th'vniust Atheniens made to die
Wise Socrates, who thereof quaffing glad
Pourd out his life, and last Philosophy
To the fair Critias his dearest Belamy.
The Gardin of Proserpina this hight;
And in the midst thereof a silver seat,
With a thick Arber goodly ouerdight,
In which she often vsd from open heat
Her self to shroud, and pleasures to entreat.
Next thereunto did grow a goodly tree,
With branches broad dispredd and body great,
Clothed with leaves, that none the wood mote see
And laden all with fruit as thick as it might be.
Their fruit were golden apples glistring bright,
That goodly was their glory to behold,
On earth like never grew, ne living wight
Like ever saw, but they from hence were sold;
For those, which Hercules with conquest bold
Got from great Atlas daughters, hence began,
And planted there, did bring forth fruit of gold
And those, with which the Eubaean young man wan
Swift Atalanta, when through craft he her out ran.
Here also sprung that goodly golden fruit,
With which Acontius got his lover true,
Whom he had long time sought with fruitless suit:
Here eke that famous golden Apple grew,
The which amongst the Gods false Ate threw:
For which the Idaean Ladies disagreed,
Till partial Paris dempt it Venus dew,
And had of her, fair Helen for his meed,
That many noble Greeks and Trojans made to bleed.
The warlike Elfe, much wondered at this tree,
So fair and great, that shadowed all the ground,
And his broad branches, laden with rich fee,
Did stretch themselves without the utmost bound
Of this great gardin, compast with a mound,
Which ouer-hanging, they themselves did steep,
In a black flood which flowed about it round,
That is the river of Cocytus deep,
In which full many souls do endless wayle and weep.
Which to behold, he clomb up to the bancke,
And looking down, saw many damned wightes,
In those sad waves, which direful deadly stancke,
Plonged continually of cruel Sprightes,
That with their piteous cries, and yelling shrightes,
They made the further shore resounden wide:
Emongst the rest of those same ruefull sightes,
One cursed creature, he by chance espide,
That drenched lay full deep, under the Garden side.
Deep was he drenched to the vpmost chin,
Yet gaped still as coveting to drink,
Of the cold liquour which he waded in,
And stretching forth his hand, did often think
To reach the fruit which grew upon the brincke:
But both the fruit from hand, and flood from mouth
Did fly abacke, and made him vainly swincke:
The whiles he steru'd with hunger, and with drouth
He daily did, yet never thoroughly dyen couth.
The knight him seeing labor so in vain,
Asked who he was, and what he meant thereby:
Who groaning deep, thus answered him again;
Most cursed of all creatures under sky,
Lo Tantalus, I here tormented lie:
Of whom high Jove wont whylome feasted be,
Lo here I now for want of food do dye:
But if that thou be such, as I thee see,
Of grace I pray thee, give to eat and drink to me.
Nay, nay, thou greedy Tantalus (quoth he)
Abide the fortune of thy present fate,
And unto all that live in high degree,
Ensample be of mind more temperate,
To teach them how to use their present state.
Then began the cursed wretch alowd to cry,
Accusing highest Jove and gods ingrate,
And eke blaspheming heaven bitterly,
As author of injustice, there to let him dye.
He looked a little further, and espyde
Another wretch, whose carcas deep was drent
Within the river, which the same did hyde:
But both his hands most filthy feculent,
Above the water were on high extent,
And faynd to wash themselves incessantly,
Yet nothing cleaner were for such intent,
But rather fowler seemed to the eye,
So lost his labor vain and idle industry.
The knight him calling, asked who he was,
Who lifting up his head, him answered thus:
I Pilate am the falsest Judge, alas,
And most unjust that by unrighteous
And wicked doom to Jews despiteous,
Delivered up the Lord of life to dye,
And did acquit a murdrer felonous,
The whiles my hands I washed in purity,
The whiles my soul was soyld with foul iniquity.
Infinite more, tormented in like pain
He there beheld, too long here to be told:
Ne Mammon would there let him long remain,
For terror of the tortures manifold,
In which the damned souls he did behold,
But roughly him bespake. Thou fearful fool
Why take not of that same fruit of gold,
Ne sit down on that same silver stool,
To rest thy weary person, in the shadow cool.
All which he did, to do him deadly fall,
In frail intemperaunce through sinful bayt,
To which if he inclyned had at all,
That dreadful feend, which did behind him wayt,
Would him have rent in thousand peecesstrayt:
But he was wary wise in all his way,
And well perceived his deceiptfull (...),
Ne (...) lust his safety to betray;
So goodly did beguile the Guyler of his pray.
And now he has so long remained theare,
That vital powers began wexe both weak and wan,
For want of food, and sleep, which two vpbeare,
Like mighty pillours, this frail life of man,
That none without the same enduren can.
For now three days of men were full outwrought,
Since he this hardy enterprise began:
For thy great Mammon fayrely he besought,
Into the world to guide him back, as he him brought.
The God, though loath, yet was constraynd t'obay,
For longer time, then that, no living wight
Below the earth, might suffered be to stay:
So back again, him brought to living light.
But all so soon as his enfeebled spright,
Began suck this vital air into his breast,
As overcome with too exceeding might,
The life did flit away out of her nest,
And all his senses were with deadly fit oppressed.
Cant. VIII.
Sir Guyon laid in swowne is by
Acrates sons despoyld,
Whom Arthure soon has reske wed
And Paynim brethren foyld.
ANd is there care in heaven? and is their love
In heavenly spirits to these creatures bace,
That may compassion of their euilles move?
There is: else much more wretched were the case
Of men then beasts. But O th'exceeding grace
Of highest God, that loves his creatures so,
And all his works with mercy does embrace,
That blessed Angels, he sends to and fro,
To serve to wicked man, to serve his wicked foe.
How often do they, their silver bowers leave,
To come to succor us, that succor want,
How often do they with golden pineons, cleave
The flitting skies, like flying Pursuiuant,
Against foul feendes to aid us militant:
They for us fight, they watch and dewly ward,
And their bright Squadrons round about us plant,
And all for love, and nothing for reward:
O why should heavenly God to men have such regard.
During the while, that Guyon did abide
In Mamons house, the Palmer, whom whyleare
That wanton Maid of passage had denide,
By further search had passage found elsewhere,
And being on his way, approached near,
Where Guyon lay in trance, when suddeinly
He heard a voice, that called loud and clear,
Come hither, come hither, O come hastily;
That all the fields resounded with the ruefull cry.
The Palmer lent his (...) unto the noyce,
To weet, who called so importunely:
Again he heard a more efforced voice,
That bad him come in haste. He by and by
His feeble feet directed to the cry;
Which to that shady delue him brought at last,
Where Mammon erst did sun his threasury:
There the good Guyon he found slumbring fast
In senceles dream; which sight at first him sore aghast.
Beside his head there satt a fair young man,
Of wondtous beauty, and of freshest years,
Whose tender bud to blossom new began,
And flourish fair above his equal pears;
His snowv front curled with golden hears,
Like Phoebus face adornd with sunny rays,
Divinely shone, and two sharp winged sheares,
Decked with diverse plumes, like painted Iayes,
Were fixed at his back, to cut his ayery ways.
Like as Cupido on Idaean hill,
When having laid his cruel bow away,
And mortal arrows, wherewith he does fill
The world with murdrous spoils and bloody pray,
With his fair mother he him dights to play,
And with his goodly sisters, Graces three;
The Goddess pleased with his wanton play,
Suffers her self through sleep beguild to be,
The whiles the other Ladies mind their merry (...).
Whom when the Palmer saw, abasht he was
Through fear and wonder, that he naught could say,
Till him the child bespoke, Long lackt, alas,
Has been thy faithful aid in hard assay,
Whiles deadly fit thy pupil does dismay;
Behold this heavy sight, thou reverend Sire,
But dread of death and dolordoe away;
For life ere long shall to her home retire,
And he that breathless seems, shall courage bold respire.
The charge, which God does unto me arrett,
Of his dear safety, I to thee commend;
Yet will I not forgo, ne yet forgett
The care thereof my self unto the end,
But evermore him succor, and defend
Against his foe and mine: watch thou I pray;
For evil is at hand him to offend.
So having said, eftsoons he began display
His painted nimble wings, and (...) quite away.
The Palmer seeing his left empty place,
And his slow eyes beguiled of their sight,
Woxe sore afraid, and standing still a space,
Gazed after him, as foul escapt by flight;
At last him turning to his charge behight,
With trembling hand his troubled pulse began try,
Where finding life not yet dislodged quight,
He much reioyst, and courd it tenderly,
As chicken newly hatched, from dreaded destiny.
At last he spide, where toward him did pace
Two Paynim knights, al armd as bright as sky,
And them beside an aged Sire did trace,
And far before a light-foote Page did fly,
That breathed strife and troublous enmity;
Those were the two sons of Acrates old,
Who meeting (...) with Archimago sly,
Foreby that idle strond, of him were told,
That he, which erst them combatted, was Guyon bold.
Which to avenge on him they (...) vowed,
Where ever that on ground they (...) him find;
False Archimage provoked their courage proud,
And stryful Atin in their stubborn mind
Coals of contention and whot (...) tind.
Now benethey come whereas the (...),
Keeping that slombred corse to him assind;
Well knew they both his person, since of late
With him in bloody arms they rashly did debate.
Whom when Pyrochles saw, inflamed with rage,
That sire he fowl bespake, Thou dotard vile,
That with thy brutenesse (...) thy comely age,
Abandon soon, I read, the caytiue spoil
Of that same outcast carcas, that ere (...)
Made it felfe famous through false treachery,
And crowned his coward crest with knightly style;
Lo where he now inglorious does lie,
To prove he lived il, that did thus fowly dye.
To whom the Palmer fearlesse answered,
Certes, Sir knight, ye been too much to blame,
Thus for to blott the honor of the dead,
And with foul cowar dize his carcas shame,
Whose living hands immortalizd his name.
Vile is the vengeance on the ashes cold,
And envy base, to bark at sleeping fame:
Was never wight, that treason of him told;
Your self his prowess proud and found him fires and bold.
Then said Cymochles, Palmer, thou do dote,
Ne can of prowess, ne of knighthood deem,
Save as thou see (...) hearst. But well I wot,
That of his puissaunce try all made extreme;
Yet gold al is not, that does golden seem,
Ne all good knights, that shake well spear and shield:
The worth of all men by their end esteem,
And then dew praise, or dew reproach them yield;
Bad therefore I him deem, that thus lies dead on field.
Good or bad, began his brother fires reply,
What do I recke, since that he did entire?
Or what does his bad death now satisfy,
The greedy (...) of reuen ging ire,
Since (...) hand (...) not her own desire?
Yet since no way is left to wreake my spite,
I will him reaue of arms, the victors hire,
And of that shield, more worthy of good knight;
For (...) should a dead dog be (...) in arm (...) bright?
Fair Sir, said then the Palmer suppliaunt,
For knighthoods love, do not so foul a deed,
Ne blame your honor with so shame full vaunt
Of vile revenge. To spoil the dead of weed
Is sacrilege, and does all sins exceed;
But leave these relics of his living might,
To deck his herce, and trap his (...).
What herce or steed (said he) should he have dight,
But be entombed in the raven or the (...)
With that rude hand upon his shield he laid,
And the other brother began his (...) unlace,
Both fiercely (...) to have him (...) aid;
Till that they spyde, where toward them did pace
An armed knight, of bold and bounteous grace,
Whose squire bore after him an (...) lance,
And couerd shield. Well kond him so (...) space
Th'enchaunter by his arms and (...),
When under him he saw his Lybian steed to praunce.
And to those brethren said, Rise rise by live,
And unto (...) do yourselues address;
For (...) comes the prowest knight alive,
Prince Arthur, flower of grace and nobilesse,
That has to Paynim knights wrought great distress.
And thousand (...) done to dye.
That word so deep did in their hearts impresse,
That both eftsoons (...),
And began themselves prepare to batteill greedily.
But fires (...), lacking his own sword,
The want thereof now greatly began to plain,
And Archimage besought, him that afford,
Which he had brought for Braggadochio vain.
So would I (said th'enchaunter) glad and feign
Beteeme to you this sword, you to defend,
Or ought that else your honor might maintain,
But that this weapons power I well have kend,
To be contrary to the work, which ye intend.
For that same knights own sword this is of yore,
Which Merlin made by his almighty art,
For that his noursling, when he knighthood swore,
There with to (...) his foes eternal smart.
The metal first he mixed with (...),
That no enchauntment from his dint might (...);
Then it in flames of (...) wrought apart,
And seven times dipped in the bitter wave
Of hellish Styx, which hidden virtue to it gave.
The virtue is, that nether steel, nor stone
The stroke there of from entrance may defend;
Ne ever may be (...) by his fone,
Ne forced his rightful owner to offend,
Ne ever will it break, ne ever bend.
Wherefore Morddure it rightfully is hight.
In vain therefore, Pyrhochles, should I lend
The same to thee, against his lord to fight,
For sure yt would deceive thy labor, and thy might.
Foolish old man, said then the Pagan wroth,
That weenest words or charms may force withstond:
Soon shall thou see, and then believe for troth,
That I can (...) with this inchaunted brond
His Lords own flesh. Therewith out of his hond
That virtuous steel he rudely snatched away,
And Guyons shield about his wrest he bond;
So ready dight, fierce battle to assay,
And match his brother proud in battailous array.
By this that stranger knight in presence came,
And goodly salued them; who naught again
Him answered, as courtesy became,
But with stern looks, and stomachous disdain,
Gave signs of grudge and coffeehouse vain:
Then turning to the Palmer, he began spy
Where at his feet, with sorrowful demayne
And deadly hew, an armed corse did lie,
In whose dead face he (...) great magnanimity.
Said he then to the Palmer, Reverend sire,
What great misfortune has be tidd this knight?
Or did his life her (...) date expyre,
Or did he fall by treason, or by fight?
How ever, sure I rue his pitteous plight.
Not one, nor other, said the Palmer grave,
Has him befalne, but clouds of deadly night
A while his heavy eylids covered have,
And all his senses drowned in deep senseless wave.
Which, those same foes, that stand hereby,
Making advantage, to revenge their spite,
Would him disarme, and treaten shamefully,
Unworthy usage of redoubted knight.
But you, fair Sir, whose honorable sight
Does promise hope of help, and timely grace,
(...) I beseech to succor his sad plight,
And by your power protect his feeble (...).
First praise of knighthood is, foul outrage to deface.
Palmer, (said he) no (...) so rude, I ween,
As to done outrage to a sleeping ghost:
Ne was there ever noble courage seen,
That in advantage would his puissaunce bost:
Honor is least, where odds appears most.
May be, that better reason will aswage,
The rash reuengers heat. Words well (...)
Have secret power, to appease inflamed rage:
If not, leave unto me thy knights last patronage.
Tho turning to those brethren, thus bespoke,
Ye warlike pair, whose valorous great might
It seems, just wrongs to vengeance do provoke,
To wreake your wrath on this dead seeming knight,
Mote ought allay the storm of your despite,
And settle patience in so furious heat?
Not to debate the challenge of your right,
But for this carkas pardon I entreat,
Whom fortune has already laid in lowest seat.
To whom Cymochles said, For what art thou,
That make thy self his dayes-man, to prolong
The vengeance pressed? Or who shall let me now,
On this vile body from to wreak my wrong,
And make his carkas as the outcast dong?
Why should not that dead carrion satisfye
The guilt, which if he lived had thus long,
His life for dew revenge should dear abye?
The trespass still does live, albee the person dye.
Indeed, then said the Prince, the evil done
Dies not, when breath the body first does leave,
But from the (...) to the Nephews son,
And all his seed the curse does often cleave,
Till vengeance utterly the guilt bereave:
So straightly God does judge. But gentle knight,
That does against the dead his hand vpreare,
His honor stains with rancour and despite,
And great disparagment makes to his former might.
Pyrrhochles began reply the second time,
And to him said, Now felon sure I read,
How that thou art partaker of his crime:
Therefore by Termagaunt thou shall be dead.
With that his hand, more sad then lomp of lead,
Vplifting high, he weened with Morddure,
His own good sword Morddure, to cleave his head.
The faithful steel such treason no'uld endure,
But swaruing from the (...), his Lords life did assure.
Yet was the force so furious and so fell,
That horse and man it made to reele aside;
Nath'lesse the Prince would not forsake his sell:
For well of yore he learned had to ride,
But full of anger fiersly to him cryde;
False traitor miscreaunt, thou broken have
The law of arms, to strike foe vndefide.
But thou thy treasons fruit, I hope, shall taste
Right sour, and feel the law, the which thou have defast
With that his balefull spear, he fiercely bent
Against the Pagons breast, and therewith thought
His cursed life out of her lodge have rent:
But ere the point arrived, where it ought,
That seven fold shield, which he from Guyon brought
He cast between toward the bitter stownd:
Through all those foldes the steelehead passage wrought
And through his shoulder perst; where with to ground
He groueling fell, all gored in his gushing wound.
Which when his brother saw, fraught with great grief
And wrath, he to him leaped furiously,
And fowly said, By Mahoune, cursed thief,
That direful stroke thou dearly shall aby.
Then hurling up his harmefull blade on hy,
Smote him so hugely on his haughty crest,
That from his saddle forced him to fly:
Else mote it needs down to his manly breast
Have cleft his head in twain, and life thence dispossessed
Now was the Prince in dangerous distress,
Wanting his sword, when he on foot should fight:
His single spear could do him small redress,
Against two foes of so exceeding might,
The least of which was match for any knight.
And now the other, whom he erst did daunt,
Had reard him self again to cruel fight,
Three times more furious, and more puissaunt,
Unmindful of his wound, of his fate ignorant.
So both attonce him charge on either side,
With hideous strokes, and importable power,
That forced him his ground to trauerse wide,
And wisely watch to ward that deadly stowre:
For in his shield, as thick as stormy shower,
Their strokes did rain, yet did he never quail,
Ne backward shrink, but as a steadfast tower,
Whom foe with doubly battry does assail,
Them on her bulwark bears, and bids them naught avail.
So stoutly he withstood their strong assay,
Till that at last, when he advantage spyde,
His poynant spear he thrust with puissant sway
At proud Cymochles, whiles his shield was wide,
That through his thigh the mortal steel did gryde:
He swaruing with the force, within his flesh
Did break the lance, and let the head abide:
Out of the wound the redblood flowed fresh,
That underneath his feet soon made a purple plesh.
Horribly then he began to rage, and rail,
Cursing his Gods, and him self damning deep:
Als when his brother saw the redblood rail
Adowne so fast and all his armor steep,
For very felnesse loud he began to weep,
And said, Caytiue, curse on thy cruel hond,
That twice has spedd, yet shall it not thee keep
From the third brunt of this my fatal brond:
Lo where the dreadful Death behynd thy back does stond.
With that he struck, and the other struck withal,
That nothing seemd mote bear so monstrous might:
The one upon his covered shield did fall,
And glauncing down would not his owner byte:
But the other did upon his (...) smite,
Which hewing quite a sunder, further way
It made, and on his hacqueton did lyte,
The which (...) with importune sway,
It seizd in his right side, and there the dint did stay.
Wide was the wound, and a large lukewarm flood,
Red as the Rose, thence gushed grievously,
That when the Paynym spyde the streaming blood,
Gave him great heart, and hope of victory.
On the other side, in huge perplexity,
The Prince now stood, having his weapon broke;
Naught could he hurt, but still at ward did ly:
Yet with his troncheon he so rudely stroke
Cymochles twice, that twice him forced his foot revoke.
Whom when the Palmer saw in such distress,
Sir Guyons sword he lightly to him raught,
And said, fair Son, great god thy right hand bless,
To use that sword so well, as he it ought.
Glad was the knight, and with fresh courage fraught,
When as again he armed felt his hond;
Then like a Lion, which has long time saught
His robbed whelps and at the last them fond
Emongst the shepeheard swaynes, then wexeth wood and yond.
So fierce he laid about him, and dealt blows
On either side, that neither mayle could hold,
Ne shield defend the thunder of his throws:
Now to Pyrrhochles many strokes he told;
Eft to Cymochles twice so many fold:
Then back again turning his busy hond,
Them both atonce compeld with courage bold,
To yield wide way to his hart-thrilling brond;
And though they both stood stiff, yet could not both withstond.
As saluage Bull, whom two fierce mastiues bayt,
When rancour does with rage him once engore,
Forgets with wary ward them to awayt,
But with his dreadful horns them drives before,
Or flings aloft or treades down in the flore,
Breathing out wrath, and bellowing disdain,
That all the forest quakes to hear him rore:
So raged Prince Arthur twixt his foemen twain,
That neither could his mighty puissaunce sustain.
But ever at Pyrrhochles when he smitt,
Who Guyons shield cast ever him before.
Whereon the Faery Queens pourtract was writ,
His hand relented, and the stroke forbore,
And his dear heart the picture began adore,
Which often the Paynim saved from deadly stowre.
But him henceforth the same can save no more;
For now arrived is his fatal hour,
That no'te avoided be by earthly skill or power.
For when Cymochles saw the foul reproach,
Which them appeached, pricked with guilty shame,
And inward grief, he fiercely began approach,
Resolved to put away that loathly blame,
Or dye with honor and desert of fame;
And on the haubergh stroke the Prince so sore,
That quite disparted all the linked frame,
And pierced to the skin, but bit not thore,
Yet made him twice to reele, that never moved before.
Whereat renfierst with wrath and sharp regret,
He stroke so hugely with his borrowd blade,
That it empiest the Pagans burganet,
And cleaving the hard steel, did deep invade
Into his head, and cruel passage made
Quite through his brain. He tombling down on ground,
Breathd out his ghost, which to the infernal shade
Fast flying, there eternal torment found,
For all the sins, wherewith his lewd life did abound.
Which when his german saw, the stony fear,
Ran to his heart, and all his sense dismayed,
Ne thenceforth life ne courage did appear,
But as a man, whom hellish feendes have frayd,
Long trembling still he stood: at last thus said,
Traitor what have thou done? how ever may
Thy cursed hand so cruelly have swayd
Against that knight: Horrow and well away,
After so wicked deed why live thou longer day?
With that all desperate as loathing light,
And with revenge desyring soon to dye,
Assembling all his force and utmost might,
With his own swerd he fierce at him did fly,
And struck, and foynd, and lasht outrageously,
Withouten reason or regard. Well knew
The Prince, with patience and sufferaunce sly
So hasty heat soon cooled to subdew:
Tho when this breathless woxe, that batteil began renew.
As when a windy tempest blows hye,
That nothing may withstand his stormy stowre,
The clouds, as things affrayd, before him fly;
But all so soon as his outrageous power
Is laid, they fiercely then begin to shower,
And as in scorn of his spent stormy spite,
Now all attonce their malice forth do pour;
So did Sir Guyon bear himself in fight,
And suffered rash Pyrrhochles waste his idle might.
At last when as the Sarazin perceived,
How that strange sword refusd, to serve his need,
But when he stroke most strong, the dint deceived,
He flong it from him, and deuoyd of dreed,
Upon him lightly leaping without heed,
Twixt his two mighty arms engrasped fast,
Thinking to overthrow and down him tred:
But him in strength and skill the Prince surpast,
And through his nimble slight did under him down cast
Naught booted it the Paynim then to strive;
For as a Bittur in the Eagles clawe,
That may not hope by flight to escape alive,
Still waytes for death with dread and trembling aw,
So he now fubiect to the victours law,
Did not once move, nor upward cast his eye,
For vile disdain and rancour, which did gnaw
His heart in twain with sad melancholy,
As one that loathed life, and yet despysd to dye.
But full of princely bounty and great mind,
The Conqueror naught cared him to slay,
But casting wrongs and all revenge behind,
More glory thought to give life, then decay,
And said, Paynim, this is thy dismal day;
Yet if thou will renounce thy miscreaunce,
And my true liegeman yield thy self for ay,
Life will I grant thee for thy valiaunce,
And all thy wrongs will wipe out of my souenaunce.
Fool (said the Pagan) I thy gift defye,
But use thy fortune, as it does befall,
And say, that I not overcome do dye,
But in despite of life, for death do call.
Wroth was the Prince, and sorry yet withal,
That he so wilfully refused grace;
Yet since his fate so cruelly did fall,
His shining Helmet he began soon unlace,
And left his headless body bleeding all the place.
By this Sir Guyon from his trance awakt,
Life having maystered her senseless foe;
And looking up, when as his shield he lakt,
And sword saw not, he wexed wondrous woe:
But when the Palmer, whom he long ygoe
Had lost, he by him spyde, right glad he grew,
And said, Dear sir, whom wandering to and fro
I long have lackt, I joy thy face to view;
Firm is thy faith, whom danger never fro me drew.
But read, what wicked hand has robbed me
Of my good sword and shield? The Palmer glad,
With so fresh hew vprysing him to see,
Him answered; fair son, be no whit sad
For want of weapons, they shall soon be had.
So began he to discourse the whole debate,
Which that strange knight for him sustained had.
And those two Sarazins confounded late,
Whose carcases on ground were horribly prostrate.
Which when he heard, and saw the tokens true,
His heart with great affection was embayd,
And to the Prince bowing reverence dew,
As to the Patron of his life, thus said;
My Lord, my liege, by whose most gracious aid
I live this day, and see my foes subdewd,
What may (...), to be for meede repayd
Of so great graces, as ye have me showed,
But to be ever bound
To whom the Infant thus, Fair Sir, what need
Good turns be counted, as a servile bond,
To bind their dooers, to receive their meed?
Are not all knights by oath bound, to withstond
Oppreslours power by arms and puissant hond?
Suffice, that I have done my dew in place.
So goodly purpose they together fond,
Of kindness and of courteous aggrace;
The whiles false Archimage and Atin fled apace.
Cant. IX.
The house of Temperance, in which
does sober Alma dwell,
Besiegd of many foes, whom stranger
knights to flight compel.
OF all Gods works, which do this world adorn,
There is no one more fair and excellent,
Then is man's body both for power and form,
Whiles it is kept in sober government;
But none then it, more foul and incedent,
Distempred through misrule and passions bace:
It grows a Monster, and incontinent
Does loose his dignity and native grace.
Behold, who list, both one and other in this place.
After the Paynim brethren conquered were,
The Briton Prince recou'ring his stolen sword,
And Guyon his lost shield, they both yfere
Forth (...) on their way in fair accord,
Till him the Prince with gentle court did board;
Sir knight, mote I of you this court'sy read,
To weet why on your shield so goodly scord
Bear ye the picture of that Ladies head?
Full lively is the semblaunt, though the substance dead.
Fair Sir (said he) if in that picture dead
Such life ye read, and virtue in vain show,
What mote ye ween, if the true liuely-head
Of that most glorious visage ye did view?
But if the beauty of her mind ye knew,
That is her bounty, and imperial power,
Thousand times fairer then her mortal hew,
O how great wonder would your thoughts devour,
And infinite desire into your spirit ponre.
She is the mighty Queen of Faery,
Whose fair retraitt I in my shield do bear;
She is the flower of grace and ehastity,
Throughout the world renowned far and near,
My liefe, my liege, my Sovereign, my dear,
Whose glory shines as the morning star,
And with her light the earth enlumines clear;
Far reach her mercies, and her praises far,
As well in state of peace, as puissaunce in war.
Thrice happy man, (said then the Briton knight)
Whom gracious lot, and thy great valiaunce
Have made thee soldier of that Princess bright,
Which with her bounty and glad countenance
Does bless her servant, and them high (...).
How may strange knight hope ever to aspire,
By faithful service, and meet amenaunce,
Unto such bliss? sufficient were that hire
For loss of thousand lives, to die at her desire.
Said Guyon, Noble Lord, what meed so great,
Or grace of earthly Prince so sovereign,
But by your wondrous worth add (...) feat
Ye well may hope, and easily attain?
But were your will, her sold to entertain,
And numbered be among knights of Maydenhcd,
Great guerdon, well I wore, should you remain,
And in her favor high be reckoned,
As Arthogall, and Sophy now been honored.
Certes (then said the Prince) I God auow,
That since I arms and knighthood first did plight,
My whole desire has been, and yet is now,
To serve that Queen with all my power and might.
Seven times the Sun with his lamp-burning light,
Has walkte about the world, and I no less,
Since of that Goddess I have sought the sight,
Yet no where can her find: such happiness
Heaven does to me envy, and fortune fauourlesse.
Fortune, the foe of famous cheuisaunce
Seldom (said Guyon) yields to virtue aid,
But in her way throws mischief and mischaunce,
Whereby her course is stopped, and passage staid.
But you, fair Sir, be not herewith dismayed,
But constant keep the way, in which ye stand;
Which were it not, that I am else delaid
With hard adventure, which I have in hand,
I labor would to guide you through al Fary land.
Gramercy Sir (said he) but mote I wot,
What strange adventure do ye now pursew?
Perhaps my succor, or (...) meet
Mote stead you much your purpose to subdew.
Then began Sir Guyon all the story show
Of false Acrasia, and her wicked wiles,
Which to avenge, the Palmer him forth drew
From Faery court. So talked they, the whiles
They wasted had much way, and measurd many miles.
And now fair Phoebus began decline in haste
His weary wagon to the Western vale,
Whenas they spide a goodly castle, plaste
Foreby a river in a pleasant dale,
Which choosing for that euenings hospitale,
They thither marched: but when they came in sight,
And from their sweaty Coursers did auale,
They found the gates fast barred long ere night,
And every loup fast locked, as fearing foes despite.
Which when they saw, they weened foul reproach
Was to them done, their entrance to forstall,
Till that the Squire began migher to approach,
And wind his horn under the castle wall,
That with the noise it shook; as it would fall.
Eftsoons forth looked from the highest spire
The watch, and loud unto the knights did call,
To weete, what they so rudely did require.
Who gently answered, They entrance did desire.
Fly fly, good knights, (said he) fly fast away
If that your lives yeloue, as meet ye should;
Fly fast, and save your selves from near decay,
Here may ye not have entrance, though we would:
We would and would again, if that we could;
But thousand enemies about us rave,
And with long siege us in this castle hold:
Seven years this wize they us besieged have,
And many good knights slain, that have us sought to save.
Thus as he spoke, lo with outrageous cry
A thousand villeins rownd about them swarmd
Out of the rocks and (...) adjoining nigh,
Vile caitiue wretches, ragged, rude, deformd,
All threaning death, all in strange manner armd,
Some with unwieldy clubs, some with long spears,
Some rusty knifes, some staves in fire warmd.
Stern was their look, like wild amazed steares,
Staring with hollow eyes, and stiff vpstanding hears.
Fiersly at first those knights they did assail,
And drove them to recoile: but when again
They gave fresh charge, their forces began to fail,
Unable their encounter to sustain;
For with such puissaunce and impetuous maine
Those Champions broke on them, that forced the^ fly,
Like scattered Sheep, whenas the Shepherds swain
A Lion and a Tigre does espy,
With greedy pace forth rushing from the forest nigh.
A while they fled, but soon retournd again
With greater fury, then before was fownd;
And evermore their cruel Captain
Sought with his rascal routs t'enclose them rownd,
And ouerro^ne to tread them to the grownd.
But soon the knights with their bright-burning blades
Broke their rude troops, and orders did confownd,
Hewing and slashing at their idle shades;
For though they bodies seem, yet substance from them fades.
As when a swarm of Gnats at euentide
Out of the fennes of Allan do arise,
Their murmuring small (...) sownden wide,
Whiles in the air their clustring army flies,
That as a cloud does seem to dim the skies;
Ne man nor beast may rest, or take repast,
For their sharp wounds, and noyous injuries,
Till the fierce Northern wind with blustering blast
Does blow them quite away, and in the Ocean cast.
(...) when they had that troublous rout dispersed,
Unto the castle gate they come again,
And entrance craved, which was denied erst.
Now when report of that their perlous pain,
And combrous conflict, which they did sustain,
Came to the Ladies ear, which there did dwell,
She forth issewed with a goodly train
Of Squires and Ladies equipaged well,
And entertained them right fairly, as befell.
Alma she called was, a virgin bright;
That had not yet felt Cupides wanton rage,
Yet was she wooed of many a gentle knight,
And many a Lord of noble parentage,
That sought with her to lincke in marriage:
For she was fair, as fair mote ever be,
And in the flower now of her freshest age;
Yet full of grace and goodly modestee,
That even heaven rejoiced her sweet face to see.
In robe of lilly white she was arayd,
That from her shoulder to her heel down raught,
The train where of loose far behind her strayd,
Braunched with gold and perle, most richly wrought,
And borne of two fair Damsels, which were taught
That service well. Her yellow golden hear
Was trimly wouen, and in tresses wrought,
Ne other tire she on her head did wear,
But crowned with a garland of sweet Rosiere.
Goodly she entertaind those noble knights,
And brought them up into her castle hall;
Where gentle court and gracious delight
She to them made, with mildness virginal,
Showing her self both wise and liberal:
Then when they rested had a season dew,
They her besought of favor special,
Of that fair Castle to afford them view;
She granted, and them leading forth, the same did show.
First she him led up to the Castle wall,
That was so high, as foe might not it clime,
And all so fair, and sensible withal,
Not built of brick, ne yet of stone and lime,
But of thing like to that Egyptian slime,
Where of king Nine whilome built Babell tower,
But O great pity, that no longer a time
So goodly workmanship should not endure:
Soon it must turn to earth; no earthly thing is sure.
The frame thereof seemd partly circulare,
And part triangulare, O work divine;
Those two the first and last proportions are,
The one imperfect, mortal, foeminine;
The Other immortal, perfect, masculine,
And twixt them both a quadrate was the base,
Proportioned equally by seven and nine;
Nine was the circle set in heavens place,
All which compacted made a goodly Dyapase.
Therein two gates were placed seemly well:
The one before, by which all in did pas,
Did the other far in workmanship excel;
For not of wood, nor of enduring bras,
But of more worthy substance framed it was;
Doubly disparted, it did lock and close,
That when it locked, none might thorough pas,
And when it opened, no man might it close,
Still open to their friends, and closed to their foes.
Of hewn stone the porch was fayrely wrought,
Stone more of value, and more smooth and fine,
Then Iett or Marble far from Ireland brought;
Over the which was cast a wandering vine,
Enchaced with a wanton yuie twine.
And over it a fair Portcullis hong,
Which to the gate directly did incline,
With comely compass, and compacture strong,
Nether unseemly short, nor yet exceeding long.
Within the Barbican a Porter sat,
Day and night duly keeping watch and ward,
Nor wight, nor word mote pass out of the gate,
But in good order, and with dew regard;
Vtterers of secrets he from thence debard,
Bablers of folly, and blazers of crime.
His larumbell might loud and wide be hard,
When cause requyrd, but never out of time;
Early and late it rong, at evening and at prime.
And rownd about the porch on every side.
Twice sixteen warders satt, all armed bright,
In glistring steel, and strongly fortifyde:
Tallyeomen seemed they, and of great might,
And were enraunged ready, still for fight.
By them as Alma passed with her guestes,
They did obeysaunce, as beseemed right,
And then again returned to their restes:
The Porter eke to her did lout with humble gestes.
Thence she them brought into a stately Hall,
Wherein were many tables fair dispred,
And ready dight with drapets festival,
Against the viaundes should be ministered.
At the upper end there sat, yclad in red
Down to the ground, a comely personage,
That in his hand a white rod menaged,
He Steward was hight Diet; ripe of age,
And in demeanure sober, and in counsel sage.
And through the Hall there walked to and fro
A jolly yeoman, Marshall of the same,
Whose name was Appetite; he did bestow
Both guestes and meat, when ever in they came,
And knew them how to order without blame,
As him the Steward badd. They both atone
Did dewty to their Lady, as became;
Who passing by, forth ledd her guestes anon
Into the kitchen rowme, nespard for niceness none.
It was a vaut ybuilt for great dispense,
With many raunges reard along the wall;
And one great chimney, whose long tonnell thence,
The smoke forth threw. And in the midst of all
There placed was a caudron wide and tall,
Upon a mighty furnace, burning whott,
More whott, then Aetn', or flaming Mongiball:
For day and night it brent, ne ceased not,
So long as any thing it in the caudron got.
But to delay the heat, least by mischaunce
It might break out, and set the whole on fire,
There added was by goodly ordinance,
An huge great pair of bellows, which did styre
Continually, and cooling breath inspyre.
About the Caudron many Cooks accoyld,
With hooks and ladles, as need did require;
The whiles the viaundes in the vessel boyld
They did about their business sweat, and sorely toyld.
The master Cook was called (...),
A careful man, and full of comely guyse:
The kitchen clerk, that hight Digestion,
Did order all th'Achates in seemly wise,
And set them forth, as well he could devise.
The rest had several offices assynd,
Some to remove the scum, as it did rise;
Others to bear the same away did mind;
And others it to use according to his kind.
But all the liquour, which was foul and waste,
Not good nor serviceable else for ought,
They in another great rownd vessel plaste,
Till by a conduit pipe it thence were brought:
And all the rest, that noyous was, and naught,
By secret ways, that none might it espy,
Was close conuaid, and to the backgate brought,
That cleped was Port Esquiline, whereby
It was avoided quite, and thrown out privily.
Which goodly order, and great workmans skill
Whenas those knights beheld, with rare delight,
And gazing wonder they their minds did fill;
For never had they seen so strange a sight.
Thence back again fair Alma led them right,
And soon into a goodly Parlour brought,
That was with royal arras richly dight,
In which was nothing pourtrahed, nor wrought,
Not wrought, nor pourtrahed, but easy to be thought.
And in the midst thereof upon the flower,
A lovely beuy of fair Ladies sat,
Courted of many a jolly Paramoure,
The which them did in modest wise amate,
And each one sought his Lady to aggrate:
And eke emongst them little Cupid played
His wanton sportes, being returned late
From his fierce wars, and having from him laid
His cruel bow, wherewith he thousands has dismayed.
Diverse delights they fownd them selves to please;
Some song in sweet consort, some laughed for joy,
Some played with strawes, some ydly satt at ease,
But other some could not abide to toy,
All pleasaunce was to them grief and annoy:
This frou^d, that faund, the third for shame did blush,
Another seemed envious, or coy,
Another in her teeth did gnaw a rush:
But at these strangers presence every one did hush.
Soon as the gracious Alma came in place,
They all attonce out of their seats arose,
And to her homage made, with humble grace:
Whom when the knights beheld, they began dispose
Themselves to court, and each a damzell chose:
The Prince by chance did on a Lady light,
That was right fair and fresh as morning rose,
But somewhat sad, and solemn eke in sight,
As if some pensive thought co^straind her gentle spright
In a long purple pall, whose skirt with gold,
Was fretted all about, she was arayd;
And in her hand a Poplar branch did hold:
To whom the prince in courteous manner said,
Gentle Madame, why been ye thus dismayed,
And your fair beauty do with sadness spill?
Lives any, that you has thus ill apayd?
Or done your love, or done you lack your will?
What ever be the cause, it sure beseemes you ill.
Fair Sir, said she half in disdainefull wise,
How is it, that this word in me ye blame,
And in your self do not the same advise.
Him ill beseemes, another fault to name,
That may unawares be blotted with the same:
Pensive I yield I am, and sad in mind,
Through great desire of glory and of fame;
Ne ought I ween are ye therein behynd,
That have three years sought one, yet no where can her find.
The Prince was inly moved at her speech,
Well weeting true, what she had rashly told,
Yet with fair semblaunt sought to hyde the breach,
Which change of color did perforce unfold,
Now seeming flaming whott, now stony cold.
Tho turning soft aside, he did inquyre
What wight she was, that Poplar branch did hold:
It answered was, her name was Praysdesire,
That by well doing sought to honor to aspyre.
The whiles, the Faery knight did entertayne
Another Damsel of that gentle crew,
That was right fair, and modest of demayne,
But that too often she chaung'd her native hew:
Strange was her tire, and all her garment blew,
Close rownd about her tuckt with many a plight:
Upon her fist the bird, which shonneth view
And keeps in couerts close from living wight,
Did sit, as yet ashamd, how rude Pan did her dight.
So long as Guyon with her commoned,
Unto the grownd she cast her modest eye,
And ever and anon with rosy red
The bashful blood her snowy cheeks did dye,
That her became, as polisht yuory,
Which cunning Craftesman hand has ouerlayd
With fair vermilion or pure lastery
Great wonder had the knight, to see the maid
So straungely passioned, and to her gently said.
Fair Damzell, seems, by your troubled clear,
That either me too bold ye ween, this wise
You to molest, or other ill to fear
That in the secret of your heart close lies,
From whence it does, as cloud from sea arise.
If it be I, of pardon I you pray;
But if ought else that I more not deuyse,
I will, if please you it discure, assay,
To ease you of that ill, so wisely as I may.
She answered naught, but more abasht for shame,
Held down her head, the whiles her lovely face,
The flashing blood with blushing did inflame,
And the strong passion mard her modest grace,
That Guyon meruayld at her uncouth case;
Till Alma him bespake, why wonder ye
Fair Sir at that, which ye so much embrace?
She is the fountain of your modestee;
You shamefast are, but Shamefastnes it self is she.
Thereat the Elfe did blush in priuitee,
And turned his face away; but she the same
Dissembled fair, and faynd to ouersee.
Thus they awhile with court and goodly game,
Themselves did solace each one with his Dame,
Till that great Lady thence away them sought,
To view her Castles other wondrous frame.
Up to a stately Turret she them brought,
Ascending by ten steps of Alablaster wrought.
That Turrets frame most admirable was,
Like highest heaven compassed around,
And lifted high above this earthly mass,
Which it suruewd, as hills done lower ground;
But not on ground (...) like to this be found,
Not that, which antique Cadmus whylome built
In Thebes, which Alexander did confound;
Nor that proud tower of Troy, though richly guilt,
From which young Hector's blood by cruel Greeks was spilt.
The roof hereof was arched over head,
And decked with flowers and herbars daintily;
Two goodly Beacons, set in watches stead,
Therein gave light, and flamd continually:
For they of living fire most subtly,
Were made, and set in silver sockets bright,
Covered with lids deuiz'd of substancesly,
That readily they shut and open might.
O who can tell the praises of that makers might?
Ne can I tell, ne can I stay to tell
This parts great workmanship, and wondrous power,
That all this other worlds work does excel,
And likest is unto that heavenly tower,
That God has built for his own blessed bower.
Therein were diverse rowmes, and diverse stages,
But three the chiefest, and of greatest power,
In which there dwelt three honorable sages,
The wisest men, I ween, that lived in their ages.
Not he, whom Greece, the Nourse of all good arts,
By Phoebus doom, the wisest thought alive,
Might be compared to this by many parts:
Nor that sage Pylian sire, which did survive
Three ages, such as mortal men contriue,
By whose advise old Priams city fell,
With these in praise of policies mote strive.
These three in these three rowmes did sundry dwell,
And counseled fair Alma, how to govern well.
The first of them could things to come foresee:
The next could of things present best aduize;
The third things past could keep in memoree,
So that no time, nor reason could arize,
But that the same could one (...) these comprize.
For thy the first did in the forepart sit,
That naught mote hinder his quick (...):
He had a sharp foresight, and working wit,
That never idle was, ne once would rest a whit.
His chamber was dispainted all with in,
With sundry colors, in the which were writ
Infinite shapes of things dispersed thin;
Some such as in the world were never yet,
Ne can deuized be of mortal wit;
Some daily seen, and known by their names,
Such as in idle fantasies do flit:
Infernal Hags, (...), feendes, Hippodames,
Apes, Lions, Aegles, Owls, fools, lovers, children, Dames.
And all the chamber filled was with flies,
Which buzzed all about, and made such sound,
That they encombred all men's ears and eyes,
Like many swarms of Bees assembled round,
After their hiues with honny do (...):
All those were idle thoughts and fantasies,
Devices, dreams, opinions unsound,
Shows, visions, sooth-sayes, and prophesies;
And all that fained is, as leasings, tales, and lies.
Emongst them all sat he, which wonned there,
That hight Phantastes by his nature true,
A man of years yet fresh, as (...) appear,
Of swarth-complexion, and of crabbed hew,
That him full of melancholy did show;
Bent hollow beetle brows, sharp staring eyes,
That mad or foolish seemd: one by his view
Mote deem him borne with ill disposed skies,
When oblique Saturn sat in the house of agonyes.
Whom Alma having showed to her guestes,
Thence brought the^ to the second rowme, whose walls
Were painted fair with memorable gestes,
Of famous Wisards, and with picturals
Of Magistrates, of courts, of tribunals,
Of commen wealths, of states, of policy,
Of laws, of judgments, and of decretals;
All arts, all science, all Philosophy,
And all that in the world was ay thought wittily.
Of those that rowme was full, and them among
There sat a man of ripe and perfect age,
Who did them meditate all his life long,
That through continual practice and usage,
He now was grown right wise, and wondrous sage.
Great pleasure had those stranger knights, to see
His goodly reason, and grave personage,
That his disciples both desyrd to be;
But Alma thence the^ led to th'hindmost rowme of three.
That chamber seemed ruinous and old,
And therefore was removed far behind,
Yet were the walls, that did the same uphold,
Right firm and strong, though somewhat they declind;
And therein sat an old oldman, half blind,
And all decrepit in his feeble corse,
Yet lively vigor rested in his mind,
And recompenst him with a better scorse:
Weak body welis changed for minds redoubled forse.
This man of infinite remembrance was,
And things foregone through many ages held,
Which he recorded still, as they did pas,
Ne suffered them to perish through long eld,
As all things else, the which this world does weld,
But laid them up in his immortal scrine,
Where they for ever incorrupted dweld:
The wars he well remembered of king Nine,
Of old Assaracus, and Inachus divine.
The years of Nestor nothing were so his,
Ne yet Mathusalem though longest lived;
For he remembered both their infancis:
Ne wonder then, if that he were deprived
Of native strength now, that he them suruiu'd.
His chamber all was hanged about with rolls,
And old records from ancient times deriud,
Some made in books, some in long parchment scrolls,
That were all worm-eaten, and full of canker holes.
Amidst them all he in a chair was set,
Tossing and turning them withouten end;
But for he was unable them to fett,
A little boy did on him still attend,
To reach, when ever he for ought did send;
And often when things were lost, or laid amiss,
That boy them sought, and unto him did lend.
Therefore he Anamnestes cleped is,
And that old man Eumnestes, by their propertis.
The knights there entering, did him reverence dew
And wondered at his endless exercise,
Then as they began his Library to view,
And antique Regesters for to auise,
There chanced to the Princes hand to rize,
An ancient book, hight Briton moniments,
That of this lands first conquest did deuize,
And old division into Regiments,
Till it reduced was to one man's gouernements.
Sir Guyon chaunst eke on another book,
That hight, Antiquitee of Faery land.
In which when as he greedily did look,
Th'ofspring of Elues and Faryes there he fond,
As it delivered was from hond to hond:
Whereat they burning both with fervent fire,
Their countries auncestry to understand;
Craved leave of Alma, and that aged sire,
To read those books; who gladly granted their desire.
Cant. X.
A chronicle of Briton kings,
From Brute to Uthers rain.
And rolls of Elfin Emperors,
Till time of Gloriane.
WHo now shall give unto me words and sound,
Equal unto this haughty enterprise?
Or who shall lend me wings, with which from ground
My lowly verse may loftily arise,
And lift it self unto the highest skies?
More ample spirit, then hitherto was wount,
Here needs me, whiles the famous auncestryes
Of my most dreaded Sovereign I recount,
By which all earthly Princes she does far surmount.
Ne under Sun, that shines so wide and fair,
Whence all that lives, does borrow life and light,
Lives ought, that to her lineage may compaire,
Which though from earth it be derived right,
Yet does it self stretch forth to heuens hight,
And all the world with wonder ouerspred;
A labor huge, exceeding far my might:
How shall frail pen, with fear disparaged,
Conceive such sovereign glory, and great bountyhed?
Argument worthy of Moeonian quill,
Or rather worthy of great Phoebus rote,
Whereon the ruins of great Ossa hill,
And triumphs of Phlegraean Jove he wrote,
That all the Gods admird his lofty note.
But if some relish of that heavenly lay
His learned daughters would to me report,
To deck my song withal, I would assay,
Thy name, O sovereign Queen, to blazon far away.
Thy name O sovereign Queen, thy realm and race,
From this renowned Prince derived arre,
Whom mightily vpheld that royal mace,
Which now thou bear, to thee descended far
From mighty kings and conquerours in war,
Thy fathers and thy great Grandfathers of gold,
Whose noble deeds above the Northern star
Immortal fame for ever has enrold;
As in that old man's book they were in order told.
The land, which warlike Britons now possess,
And therein have their mighty empire raysd,
In antique times was saluage wilderness,
Unpeopled, vnmannurd, vnproud, vnpraysd,
Ne was it Island then, ne was it paysd
Amid the Ocean waves, ne was it sought
Of merchaunts far, for profits therein praysd,
But was all desolate, and of some thought
By sea to have been from the Celticke mayn-land brought.
Ne did it then deserve a name to have,
Till that the venturous Mariner that way
Learning his ship from those white rocks to save,
Which all along the Southern seacoast lay,
Threatening vnheedy wrecke and rash decay,
For safety that same his sea-marke made,
And namd it Albion. But later day
Finding in it fit ports for fishers trade,
Began more the same frequent, and further to invade.
But far in land a saluage nation dwelt,
Of hideous Giaunts, and half beastly men,
That never tasted grace, nor goodness felt,
But like wild beasts lurking in loathsome den,
And flying fast as Roebucke through the fen,
All naked without shame, or care of cold,
By hunting and by spoiling liueden;
Of stature huge, and eke of courage bold,
That sons of men amazd their sternesse to behold.
But whence they sprung, or how they were begott,
Uneath is to assure, uneath to wene
That monstrous error, which does some assott,
That Dioclesians fifty daughters shene
Into this land by chance have driven been,
Where companing with feends and filthy Sprights
Through vain illusion of their lust unclean,
They brought forth Geaunts and such dreadful wights,
As far exceeded men in their immeasurd mights.
They held this land, and with their filthiness
Polluted this same gentle soil long time:
That their own mother loathd their beastliness,
And began abhor her broods unkindly crime,
All were they borne of her own (...) slime;
Until that Brutus anciently derived
From royal stock of old Assaracs line,
Driven by fatal error, here arrived,
And them of their unjust possession deprived.
But ere he had established his throne,
And spread his empire to the utmost shore,
He fought great batteils with his saluage fone;
In which he them defeated evermore,
And many (...) left on groaning (...),
That well can witness yet unto this day
The western Hogh, besprincled with the gore
Of mighty Goemot, whom in stout fray
Corineus conquered, and cruelly did slay.
And eke that ample Pit, yet far renownd,
For the large leap, which Debon did compel
(...) to make, being eight lugs of grownd;
Into the which retourning back, he fell,
But those three monstrons stones do most excel
Which that huge son of hideous Albion,
Whose father Hercules in France did quell,
Great Codmer threw, in fierce contention,
At bold Canutus; but of him was slain anon.
In meed of these great conquests by them got,
Corineus had that Province utmost west,
To him assigned for his worthy lot,
Which of his name and memorable gest
He called Gornwaile, yet so called best:
And Debons shayre was, that is Deuonshyre:
But (...) had his portion from the rest,
The which he called Ganutium, for his hyre;
Now Gantium, which Kent we comenly inquyre.
Thus Brute this Realm unto his rule subdewd,
And reigned long in great felicity,
Loved of his friends, and of his foes eschewd,
He left three sons, his famous progeny,
Borne of fair (...) of Italy;
Among whom he (...) his imperial state,
And Locrine left chief Lord of Britany.
At last ripe age bad him surrender late
His life, and long good fortune unto final fate.
Locrine was left the sovereign Lord of all;
But Albanact had all the Northern part,
Which of him self Albania he did call;
And Camber did possess the Western quart,
Which (...) now from Logris does depart:
And each his portion peaceably enjoyed,
Ne was there outward breach, nor grudge in heart,
That once their quiet government annoyd,
But each his pains to others profit still employed.
Until a nation straung, with visage swart,
And courage fierce, that all men did affray,
Which through the world the swarmd in every part,
And ouerflow'd all countries far away,
Like Noyes great flood, with their importune sway,
This land invaded with like violence,
And did themselves through all the North display:
Until that (...) for his Realms defense,
Did head against them make, and strong munificence.
He them encountered, a confused rout,
Foreby the River, that whylome was hight
The ancient Abus, where with courage stout
He them defeated in victorious fight,
And chaste so fiercely after fearful flight,
That forced their Chiefetain, for his safeties sake,
(Their Chiefetain Humber named was aright,)
Unto the mighty (...) him to betake,
Where he an end of batteill, and of life did make.
The king returned proud of victory,
And insolent wox through unwonted case,
That shortly he forgot the ieopardy,
Which in his land he lately did appease,
And fell to vain voluptuous disease:
He loved (...) Lady (...), (...) loved,
Whose wanton pleasures him too much did please,
That quite his heart from Guendolene removed,
From Guendolene his wife, though always faithful proved.
The noble daughter of Corineus
Would not endure to be so vile disdaind,
But gathering force, and courage valorous,
Encountered him in batteill well ordaind,
In which him vanquished she to fly constraind:
But she so fast pursewd, that him she took,
And threw in bands, where he till death remaind
Als his fair Leman, flying through a brook,
She ouerhent, naught moved with her piteous look.
But both her self, and eke her daughter dear,
Begotten by her kingly Paramoure,
The fair Sabrina almost dead with fear,
She there attached, far from all succoure;
The one she (...) upon the present flower,
But the sad virgin innocent of all,
Adowne the rolling river she did pour,
Which of her name now Seuerne men do call:
Such was the end, that to disloyal love did fall.
Then for her son, which she to Locrin bore,
Madan was young, unmeet the rule to sway,
In her own hand the crown she kept in store,
Till ryper years he raught, and stronger stay:
During which time her power she did display
Through all this realm, the glory of her sex,
And first taught men a woman to obey:
But when her son to man's estate did wex,
She it surrendered, ne her self would longer vex.
Tho Madan raignd, unworthy of his race:
For with all shame that sacred throne he filled:
Next Memprise, as unworthy of that place,
In which being consorted with Manild,
For thirst of single kingdom him he killed.
But Ebranck salued both their infamies
With noble deeds, and warreyd on Brunchild
In (...), where yet of his victories
Brave moniments remain, which yet that land enuies.
An happy man in his first days he was,
And happy father of fair progeny:
For all so many weeks, as the year has,
So many children he did multiply;
Of which were twenty sons, which did apply,
Their minds to praise, and cheualrous desire:
Those germans did subdew all Germany,
Of whom it hight; but in the end their Sire
With foul repulse from France was forced to retire,
Which blott his son succeeding in his seat,
The second Brute, the second both in name,
And eke in semblaunce of his puissaunce great,
Right well recur'd, and did away that blame
With recompense of everlasting fame.
He with his victour sword first opened,
The bowels of wide France, a forlorn Dame,
And taught her first how to be conquered;
Since which, with sondrie spoils she has been ransacked.
Let Scaldis tell, and let tell Hania,
And let the marsh of Estham bruges tell,
What color were their waters that same day,
And all the moore twixt Eluersham and Dell,
With blood of Henalois, which therein fell.
How often that day did sad Brunchildis see
The green shield did in dolorous vermell?
That not Seuith guiridh he mote seem to be.
But rather y Seuith gogh, sign of sad crueltee.
His son king Leill by fathers labor long,
Enjoyed an heritage of lasting peace,
And built Cairleill, and built Cairleon strong.
Next Huddibras his realm did not increase,
But taught the land from weary wars to cease.
Whose footsteps Bladud following, in arts
Excelled at Athens all the learned preace,
From whence he brought them to these saluage parts
And with sweet science mollifide their stubborn hearts.
Ensample of his wondrous faculty,
Behold the boiling Bathes at Cairbadon,
Which sees with secret fire eternally,
And in their entrailles, full of quick Brimston,
Nourish the flames, which they are warmd upon,
That to her people wealth they forth do well,
And health to every forreyne nation:
Yet he at last contending to excel
The reach of men, through flight into fond mischieffell.
Next him king Leyr in happy peace long raynd,
But had no issue male him to succeed,
But three fair daughters, which were well vptraind,
In all that seemed fit for kingly seed:
Among whom his realm he equally decreed
To have divided. Tho when feeble age
Nigh to his utmost date he saw proceed,
He called his daughters; and with speeches sage
(...), which of them most did love her parentage.
The eldest Gonorill began to protest,
That she much more then her own life him loved:
And Regan greater love to him professed,
Then all the world, when ever it were proou'd;
But Cordeill said she loved him, as behoou'd:
Whose simple answer, wanting colors fair
To paint it forth,, him to displeasaunce moved,
That in his crown he counted her no hair,
But twixt the other twain his kingdom whole did shayre.
So wedded the one to Maglan king of Scotts,
And the other to the king of Cambria,
And twixt them shayrd his realm by equal lottes:
But without dowre the wise Cordelia,
Was sent to Aggannip of Celtica
Their aged Sire, thus eased of his crown,
A private life ledd in Albania,
With Gonorill, long had in great renown,
That naught him grieved to been from rule deposed down.
But true it is that when the oil is spent,
The light goes out, and week is thrown away;
So when he had resignd his regiment,
His daughter began despise his drouping day,
And weary wax of his continual stay.
Tho to his daughter Regan he repayrd,
Who him at first well used every way;
But when of his departure she despayrd,
Her bounty she abated, and his cheer empayrd.
The wretched man began then auise to late,
That love is not, where most it is professed,
Too truly tryde in his extremest state;
At last resolved likewise to prove the (...),
He to Cordelia him self addressed,
Who with entyre affection him received,
As for her Sire and king her seemed best;
And after all au army strong she leau'd,
To war on those, which him had of his realm bereaved
So to his crown she him restord again,
In which he did, made ripe for death by eld,
And after wild, it should to her remain:
Who peaceably the same long time did weld:
And all men's hearts in dew obedience held:
Till that her sisters children, woxen strong,
Through proud ambition against her rebeld,
And ouercommen kept in prison long,
Till weary of that wretched life, her self she hong.
Then began the bloody brethren both to rain:
But fierce Cundah began shortly to envy
His brother Morgan, pricked with proud disdain,
To have a pere in part of souerainty,
And kindling coals of cruel enmity,
Raisd war, and him in batteill overthrew:
Whence as he to those woody hills did fly,
Which hight of him Glamorgan, there him slew:
Then did he reign alone, when he none equal knew.
His son Riuall' his dead rowme did supply,
In whose sad time blood did from heaven rain:
Next great Gurgustus, then fair Coecily,
In constant peace their kingdoms did contain,
After whom Lago, and Kinmarke did rain;
And Gorbogud, till far in years he grew:
Then his Ambitious sons unto them twain,
Arraught the rule, and from their father drew,
Stout Ferrex and stern Porrex him in prison threw.
But O, the greedy thirst of royal crown,
That knows no kindred, nor regardes no right,
Stird Porrex up to put his brother down;
Who unto him assembling foreign might,
Made war on him, and fell him self in fight:
Whose death t'auenge, his mother (...),
Most merciless of women, Wyden hight,
Her other son fast sleeping did oppress,
And with most cruel hand him murdered pitiless.
Here ended Brutus sacred progeny,
Which had seven hundred years this scepter borne,
With high renown, and great felicity;
The noble branch from th'antique stock was torn
Through discord, and the royal throne forlorn:
Thenceforth this Realm was into factions rent,
Whilst each of Brutus boasted to be borne,
That in the end was left no moniment
Of Brutus, nor of Britons glory ancient.
Then up arose a man of matchless might,
And wondrous wit to menage high affairs,
Who stird with pity of the stressed plight
Of this sad realm, cut into sundry shayres
By such, as claymd themselves Brutes rightful hayres,
Gathered the Princes of the people loose,
To taken counsel of their common cares;
Who with his wisdom won, him straight did choose
Their king, and swore him fealty to win or loose.
Then made he head against his enemies,
And Ymner slew, of Logris miscreate;
Then Ruddoc and proud Stater, both allies,
This of Albany newly nominate,
And that of Cambry king confirmed late,
He overthrew through his own valiaunce;
Whose countries he redus'd to quiet state,
And shortly brought to civil governance,
Now one, which erst were many, made through variaunce.
Then made he sacred laws, which some men say
Were unto him reueald in vision,
By which he freed the Traueilers high way,
The Churches part, and Ploughmans portion,
Restraining stealth, and strong extortion;
The gracious Numa of great Britany:
For till his days, the chief dominion
By strength was wielded without policy;
Therefore he first wore crown of gold for dignity.
Donwallo did (for what may live for ay?)
And left two sons, of pearelesse prowess both;
That sacked Rome too dearly did assay,
The recompense of their perjured oath,
And ransackt Greece well tryde, when they were wroth;
Besides subjected France, and Germany,
Which yet their praises speak, all be they (...),
And inly tremble at the memory
Of Brennus and Belinus, kings of Britany.
Next them did Gurgiunt, great Belinus son
In rule succeed and eke in fathers praise;
He Easterland subdewd, and Denmark won,
And of them both did (...) and tribute raise,
The which was dew in his dead fathers days:
He also gave to fugitives of Spain,
Whom he at sea found wandering from their ways,
A seat in Ireland safely to remain,
Which they should hold of him, as subject to Britayne.
After him reigned Guitheline his hair,
The iustest man and trewest in his days,
Who had to wife Dame Mertia the fair,
A woman worthy of immortal praise,
Which for this Realm found many goodly lays,
And wholesome Statutes to her husband brought:
Her many deemd to have been of the Fayes,
As was Aegerie, that Numa tought:
Those yet of her be Mertia^ laws both named and thought.
Her son Sifillus after her did rain,
And then Kimarus, and then Danius;
Next whom Morindus did the crown sustain,
Who, had he not with wrath outrageous,
And cruel rancour dimmed his valorous
And mighty deeds, should matched have the best:
As well in that same field victorious
Against the foreign Morands he expressed;
Yet lives his memory, though carcas sleep in rest.
Five sons he (...) begotten of one wife,
All which successively by turns did rain;
First Gorboman a man of virtuous life;
Next Archigald, who for his proud disdain,
Deposed was from princedome sovereign,
And pitteous Elidure put in his sted;
Who shortly it to him restord again,
Till by his death he it recovered;
But Peridure and Vigent him disthronized.
In wretched prison long he did remain,
Till they outraigned had their utmost date,
And then therein reseized was again,
And ruled long with honorable state,
Till he surrendered Realm and life to fate.
Then all the sons of these five brethren raynd
By dew success, and all their Nephews late,
Even thrice eleven descents the crown retaynd,
Till aged Hely by dew heritage it gaynd.
He had two sons, whose eldest called Lud
Left of his life most famous memory,
And endless moniments of his great good:
The ruined walls he did reaedifye
Of Troynouant, against force of enemy,
And built that gate, which of his name is hight,
By which he lies entombed solemnly.
He left two sons, too young to rule aright,
Androgeus and Tenantius, pictures of his might.
Whilst they were young, Cassibalane their Eme
Was by the people chosen in their sted,
Who on him took the royal Diadem,
And goodly well long time it governed,
Till the proud Romans him disquieted,
And warlike Caesar, tempted with the name
Of this sweet Island, never conquered,
And envying the Britons blazed fame,
(O hideous hunger of dominion) hither came.
Yet twice they were repulsed back again,
And twice renforst, back to their ships to fly,
The whiles with blood they all the shore did stain,
And the gray Ocean into purple die:
Ne had they footing found at last perdie,
Had not Androgeus, false to native soil,
And envious of Uncles soueraintie,
Betrayed his country unto foreign spoil:
Naught else, buttreason, from the first this land did foil
So by him Caesar got the victory,
Through great bloodshed, and many a sad assay,
In which himself was charged heavily
Of hardy Nennius, whom he yet did slay,
But lost his sword, yet to be seen this day.
Thenceforth this land was tributarie made
T'ambitious Rome, and did their rule obey,
Till Arthur all that reckoning defrayd;
Yet often the Briton kings against them strongly swayd.
Next him Tenantius raignd, then Kimbeline,
What time the eternal Lord in fleshly slime
Enwombed was, from wretched Adams line
To purge away the guilt of sinful crime:
O joyous memory of happy time,
That heavenly grace so plenteously displayed;
(O too high ditty for my simple rhyme.)
Soon after this the Romans him warrayd;
For that their tribute he refusd to let be paid.
Good Claudius, that next was Emperor,
An army brought, and with him batteile fought,
In which the king was by a Treachetour
Disguised slain, ere any thereof thought:
Yet ceased not the bloody fight for ought;
For Aruirage his brothers place supplyde,
Both in his arms, and crown, and by that draught
Did drive the Romans to the weaker side,
That they to peace agreed. So all was pacifyde.
Was never king more highly magnifide,
Nor dredd of Romans, then was Aruirage,
For which the Emperor to him allide
His daughter Genuiss' in marriage:
Yet shortly he renounst the vassallage
Of Rome again, who hither hastly sent
Vespasian, that with great spoil and rage
Forwasted all, till Gen^uissa gent
Persuaded him to cease, and her lord to relent.
He did; and him succeeded Marius,
Who ioyd his days in great tranquillity.
Then Coyll, and after him good Lucius,
That first received Christianity,
The sacred pledge of Christ's Euangely:
Yet true it is, that long before that day
Hither came Joseph of Arimathy,
Who brought with him the holy grayle, (they say)
And preached the truth; but since it (...) did decay.
This good king shortly without issew did,
Whereof great trouble in the kingdom grew,
That did herself in sundry parts divide,
And with her power her own self overthrew,
Whilst Romans daily did the weak subdew:
Which seeing stout Bunduca, up arose,
And taking arms, the Britons to her drew;
With whom she marched straight against her foes,
And them unawares besides the Seuerne did enclose.
There she with them a cruel batteill tryde,
Not with so good success, as she deserved;
By reason that the Captains on her side,
Corrupted by Paulinus, from her sweru'd:
Yet such as were through former flight preserved,
Gathering again, her Host she did renew,
And with fresh courage on the victor served:
But being all defeated, save a few,
Rather then fly, or becaptiu'd, her self she slew.
O famous moniment of women's praise,
Matchable either to Semiramis,
Whom antique history so high does raise,
Or to Hypsiphil', or to Thomiris:
Her Host two hundred thousand numbered is;
Who whiles good fortune favored her might,
Triumphed often against her enemis;
And yet though overcome in hapless fight,
She triumphed on death, in enemies despite.
Her relics Fulgent having gathered,
Fought with Seuerus, and him overthrew;
Yet in the chase was slain of them, that fled:
So made them victors, whom he did subdew.
Then began Carausius tirannize anew,
And against the Romans bent their proper power,
But him Allectus treacherously slew,
And took on him the robe of Emperor:
Nath'lesse the same enjoyed but short happy hour:
For Asclepiodate him overcame,
And left inglorious on the vanquished plain,
Without or robe, or rag, to hide his shame.
(...) afterward he in his stead did reign;
But shortly was by Coyll in batteill slain:
Who after long debate, since Lucies time,
Was of the Britons first crowned Sovereign:
Then began this Realm renew her passed prime;
He of his name Coylchester built of stone and lime.
Which when the Romans heard, they hither sent
Constantius, a man of mickle might,
With whom king Coyll made an agreement,
And to him gave for wife his daughter bright.
Fair Helena, the fairest living wight;
Who in all godly thewes, and goodly praise,
Did far excel, but was most famous hight
For skill in Music of all in her days,
As Well in curious instruments as cunning lays.
Of whom he did great Constantine begett,
Who afterward was Emperor of Rome;
To which whiles absent he his mind did set,
Octauius here lept into his room,
And it usurped by unrighteous doom:
But he his title iustifide by might,
Slaying Traherne, and having overcome
The Roman legion in dreadful fight:
So settled he his kingdom, and confirmd his right.
But wanting yssew male, his daughter dear,
He gave in wedlock to Maximian,
And him with her made of his kingdom heir,
Who soon by means thereof the Empire wan,
Till murdered by the friends of Gratian,
Then began the Hunnes and Picts invade this land,
During the reign of Maximinian;
Who dying left none heir them to withstand.
But that they ouerran all parts with easy hand.
The weary Britons, whose war-hable youth
Was by Maximian lately ledd away,
With wretched miseryes, and woeful ruth,
Were to those Pagans made an open pray,
And daily spectacle of sad decay:
Whom Roman wars, which now fowr hundred years,
And more had wasted, could no whit dismay;
Til by consent of Commons and of Pears,
They crowned the second Constantine with joyous tears,
Who having often in batteill vanquished
Those spoylefull Picts, and swarming Easterlings,
Long time in peace his realm established,
Yet often annoyd with sundry bordragings.
Of neighbor Scots, and foreign Scatterlings,
With which the world did in those days abound:
Which to outbarre, with painful pyonings
From sea to sea he heapt a mighty mound,
Which from Alcluid to Panwelt did that border bownd.
Three sons he dying left, all under age;
By means whereof, their uncle Vortigere
Usurped the crown, during their pupillage;
Which th'Infants tutors gathering to fear,
Them closely into Armorick did bear:
For dread of whom, and for those Picts annoyes,
He sent to Germany, strange aid to rear,
From whence eftsoons arrived here three hoyes
Of Saxons, whom he for his safety imployes.
Two brethren were their Capitayns, which hight
Hengist and Horsus, well approved in war,
And both of them men of renowned might;
Who making vantage of their civil jar,
And of those forreyners, which came from far,
Grew great, and got large portions of land,
That in the Realm ere long they stronger arre,
Then they which sought at first their helping hand,
And Vortiger have forced the kingdom to aband.
But by the help of Vortimere his son,
He is again unto his rule restord,
And Hengist seeming sad, for that was done,
Received is to grace and new accord,
Through his fair daughters face, and flattring word,
Soon after which, three hundred Lords he slew
Of British blood,, all sitting at his board;
Whose doleful moniments who list to rue,
The Eternal marks of treason may at Stonheng view.
By this the sons of Constantine, which fled,
Ambrose and Other did ripe years attain,
And here arriving, strongly challenged
The crown, which Vortiger did long detayne:
Who flying from his guilt, by them was slain,
And Hengist eke soon brought to shameful death.
Thenceforth Aurelius peaceably did rain,
Till that through poison stopped was his breath;
So now entombed lies at Stoneheng by the heath.
After him Other, which Pendragon hight,
Succeeding There abruptly it did end,
Without full point, or other Cesure right,
As if the rest some wicked hand did rend,
Or The Author self could not at least attend
To finish it: that so untimely breach
The Prince him self half seemed to offend,
Yet secret pleasure did offense empeach,
And wonder of antiquity long stopped his speech.
At last quite ravished with delight, to hear
The royal Offspring of his native land,
Cryde out, Dear country, O how dearly dear
Ought thy remembrance, and perpetual band
Be to thy foster Child, that from thy hand
Did commun breath and nouriture receive?
How brutish is it not to understand,
How much to her we owe, that all us gave,
That gave unto us all, what ever good we have.
But Guyon all this while his book did read,
Ne yet has ended: for it was a great
And ample volume, that does far excead
My leisure, so long leaves here to repeat:
It told, how first Prometheus did create
A man, of many parts from beasts deryu'd,
And then stole fire from heaven, to animate
His work, for which he was by Jove depryu'd
Of life him self, and hart-strings of an Aegle ryu'd.
That man so made, he called Elfe, to weet
Quick, the first author of all Elfin kind:
Who wandering through the world with weary feet,
Did in the gardins of Adonis find
A goodly creature, whom he deemd in mind
To be no earthly wight, but either Spright,
Or-Angell, th'authour of all woman kind;
Therefore a Fay he her according hight,
Of whom all Faryes spring, and fetch their lignage right.
Of these a mighty people shortly grew,
And puissant kings, which all the world warrayd,
And to them selves all Nations did subdew:
The first and eldest, which that scepter swayd,
Was Elfin; him all India obayd,
And all that now America men call:
Next him was noble Elfinan, who laid
Cleopolis foundation first of all:
But Elfiline enclosd it with a golden wall.
His son was Elfinell, who overcame
The wicked Gobbelines in bloody field:
But Elfant was of most renowned fame,
Who all of Crystal did Panthea build:
Then Elfar, who two brethren gyauntes killed,
The one of which had two heads, the other three:
Then Elfinor, who was in magic skild;
He built by art upon the glassy See
A bridge of bras, whose sound heue^s thunder seemed to be.
He left three sons, the which in order raynd,
And all their Offspring, in their dew descents,
Even seven hundred Princes, which maintaynd
With mighty deeds their sundry governments;
That were too long their infinite contents
Here to record, ne much material:
Yet should they be most famous moniments,
And brave ensample, both of martial,
And civil rule to kings and states imperial.
After all these Elficleos did rain,
The wise Elficleos in great Majesty,
Who mightily that scepter did sustain,
And with rich spoils and famous victory,
Did high advance the crown of Faery:
He left two sons, of which fair Elferon
The eldest brother did untimely die;
Whose empty place the mighty Oberon
Doubly supplide, in spousall, and dominion.
Great was his power and glory over all,
Which him before, that sacred seat did fill,
That yet remains his wide memorial:
He dying left the fairest Tanaquill,
Him to succeed therein, by his last will:
Fairer and nobler lives none this hour,
Ne like in grace, ne like in learned skill;
Therefore they Glorian call that glorious flower,
Long may thou Glorian live, in glory and great power.
Beguyld thus with delight of novelties,
And natural desire of countries state,
So long they redd in those antiquities,
That how the time was fled, they quite forgate,
Till gentle Alma seeing it so late,
Perforce their studies broke, and them besought
To think, how supper did them long awaite.
So half unwilling from their books them brought,
And fayrely feasted, as so noble knights she ought.
Cant XI
The enemies of T emperaunce
besiege her dwelling place:
Prince Arthure them repelles, and foul
Maleger does deface.
WHat war so cruel, or what siege so sore,
As that, which strong affections do apply
Against the forte of reason evermore,
To bring the soul into captivity:
Their force is fiercer through infirmity
Of the frail flesh, relenting to their rage,
And exercise most bitter tyranny
Upon the parts, brought into their bondage:
No wretchedness is like to sinful vellenage.
But in a body which does freely yield
His parts to reasons rule obedient,
And lets her that ought the scepter weeld,
All happy peace and goodly government
Is settled there in sure establishment,
There Alma like a virgin Queen most bright,
Does flourish in all beauty excellent:
And to her guestes does bounteous banquet dight,
Attempred goodly well for health and for delight.
Early before the Morn with cremosin ray,
The windows of bright heaven opened had,
Through which into the world the dawning day
Might look, that makes every creature glad,
Vprose Sir Guyon, in bright armor clad,
And to his purposd journey him prepared:
With him the Palmer eke in habit sad,
Him self addressed to that adventure hard:
So to the rivers side they both together fared.
Where them awaited ready at the ford
The Ferriman, as Alma had behight,
With his well rigged bore: They go abord,
And he eftsoons began launch his bark forthright.
Ere long they rowed were quite out of sight,
And fast the land behynd them fled away.
But let them pas, whiles wind and wether (...)
Do serve their turns: here I a while must stay,
To see a cruel fight done by the prince this day.
For all so soon, as (...) thence was gone
Upon his voyage with his trusty guide,
That wicked band of villeins fresh begone
That castle to assail on every side,
And lay strong siege about it far and wide.
So huge and infinite their numbers were,
That all the land they under them did hyde;
So foul and ugly, that exceeding fear
Their visages impressed, when they approached near.
Them in twelve troops their Captein did dispart,
And round about in fittest steades did place,
Where each might best offend his proper part,
And his contrary object most deface,
As every one seemed meetest in that case.
Seven of the same against the Castle gate,
In strong entrenchments he did closely place,
Which with incessaunt force and endless hate,
They battred day and night, and entrance did awate.
The other fine, five sundry ways he set,
Against the five great Bulwarks of that pyle,
And unto each a Bulwark did arrett,
T'assayle with open force or hidden guyle,
In hope thereof to win victorious spoil.
They all that charge did fervently apply,
With greedy malice and importune toil,
And planted there their huge artillery,
With which they daily made most dreadful battery.
The first troop was a monstrous rablement
Of foul misshapen wightes, of which some were
Headed like Owls, with beckes uncomely bent,
Others like Dogs, others like Gryphons dreare,
And some had wings, and some had claws to tear,
And every one of them had Lynces eyes,
And every one did bow and arrows bear:
All those were lawless lusts, corrupt enuyes,
And covetous aspects, all cruel enimyes.
Those same against the bulwark of the Sight
Did lay strong siege, and battailous assault,
Ne once did yield it respitt day nor night,
But soon as Titan began his head exault,
And soon again as he his light withhault,
Their wicked engines they against it bent:
That is each thing, by which the eyes may fault,
But two then all more huge and violent,
Beauty, and money they against that Bulwark lent.
The second Bulwark was the Hearing sense,
Against which the second troop assignment makes,
Deformed creatures, in strange difference,
Some having heads like Hearts, some like to Snakes,
Some like wild Bores late rouzd out of the brakes,
Slanderous reproaches, and foul infamies,
Leasinges, backbytinges, and vaineglorious crakes,
Bad counsels, praises, and false flatteries,
All those against that fort did bend their batteries.
Likewise that same third Fort, that is the Smell
Of that third troop was cruelly assayd:
Whose hideous shapes were like to feendes of hell,
Some like to hounds, some like to Apes, dismayed,
Some like to Puttockes, all in plumes arayd:
All shaped according their conditions,
For by those ugly forms weren pourtrayd,
Foolish delights and fond abusions,
Which do that sense besiege with light illusions.
And that fourth band which cruel battry bent,
Against the fourth Bulwark, that is the Taste,
Was as the rest a grysie rablement,
Some mouthed like greedy Oystriges, some fast
Like loathly Toades, some fashioned in the waste
Like swine; for so deformd is luxury,
Surfeat, misdiet, and unthrifty waste,
Vain feasts, and idle superfluity:
All those this senses Fort assail incessantly.
But the fifth troop most horrible of hew,
And ferce of force, is dreadful to report:
For some like Snailes, some did like spyders show,
And some like ugly Vrchins thick and short:
Cruelly they assayed that fifth Fort,
Armed with darts of sensual delight,
With stinges of carnal lust, and strong effort
Of feeling pleasures, with which day and night
Against that same fifth bulwark they continued fight.
Thus these twelve troops with dreadful puissaunce
Against that Castle restless siege did lay,
And evermore their hideous Ordinance
Upon the Bulwarks cruelly did play,
That now it began to threaten near decay.
And evermore their wicked Capitayn
Provoked them the breaches to assay,
Sometimes with threats, sometimes with hope of gayn,
Which by the ransack of that piece they should attayn.
On the other side, th'assieged Castles ward
Their steadfast stonds did mightily maintain,
And many bold repulse, and many hard
Atchieuement wrought with peril and with pain,
That goodly frame from ruin to sustain:
And those two brethren Gyauntes did defend
The walls so stoutly with their sturdie main,
That never entrance any durst pretend,
But they to direful death their groaning ghosts did send.
The noble Virgin, Lady of the Place,
Was much dismayed with that dreadful sight:
For never was she in so evil case,
Till that the Prince seeing her woeful plight,
Began her recomfort from so sad affright,
Offering his service, and his dearest life
For her defense, against that Carle to fight,
Which was their chief and th'authour of that strife:
She him remercied as the Patron of her life.
Estsoones himself in glitterand arms he dight,
And his well proved weapons to him hent;
So taking courteous conge he behight,
Those gates to be vnbar'd, and forth he went.
Fair mote he thee, the prowest and most gent,
That ever brandished bright steel on hye:
Whom soon as that unruly rablement,
With his gay Squyre issewing did espy,
They reard a most outrageous dreadful yelling cry.
And therewithal attonce at him let fly
Their fluttring arrows, thick as flakes of snow,
And round about him Hocke impetuously,
Like a great water flood, that tombling low
From the high mountains, threats to ouerflow
With suddein fury all the fertile plain,
And the sad husbandmans long hope does throw,
A down the stream and all his vows make vain,
Nor bounds nor banks his headlong ruin may sustain.
Upon his shield their heaped hayle he bore,
And with his sword dispersed the rascal flocks,
Which fled a sonder, and him fell before,
As withered leaves drop from their dried stocks,
When the wroth Western wind does reaue their locks,
And under neath him his courageous steed,
The fierce Spumador trod them down like docks,
The fierce Spumador borne of heavenly seed:
Such as Laomedon of Phoebus race did breed
Which suddeine horror and confused cry,
When as their Captain heard, in haste he yode,
The cause to weet, and fault to remedy,
Upon a Tygre swift and fierce he rode,
That as the wind ran underneath his lode,
Whiles his long legs nigh raught unto the ground,
Full large he was of limb, and shoulders broad,
But of such subtle substance and unsound,
That like a ghost he seemed, whose graue-clothes were unbound.
And in his hand a bended bow was seen,
And many arrows under his right side,
All deadly dangerous, all cruel keen,
Headed with flint, and feathers bloody did,
Such as the Indians in their quiuers hide,
Those could he well direct and straight as line,
And bid them strike the mark, which he had eyde,
Ne was their salve ne was their medicine,
That mote recure their wounds: so inly they did tine.
As pale and wan as ashes was his look,
His body lean and meagre as a rake,
And skin all withered like a dried rooke,
Thereto as cold and drery as a Snake,
That seemd to tremble evermore, and quake:
All in a canuas thin he was bedight,
And girded with a belt of twisted brake,
Upon his head he wore an Helmet light,
Made of a dead man's skull, that seemd a ghastly sight.
Maleger was his name, and after him,
There followed fast at hand two wicked Hags,
With hoary locks all loose, and visage grim;
Their feet unshod, their bodies wrapped in rags,
And both as swift on foot, as chased Stags,
And yet the one her other leg had lame,
Which with a staff, all full of little snags
She did support, and Impotence her name:
But the other was Impatience, armed with raging flame.
Soon as the Carle from far the Prince espyde,
Glistring in arms and warlike ornament,
His Beast he felly pricked on either side,
And his mischievous bow full ready bent,
With which at him a cruel shaft he sent:
But he was wary, and it warded well
Upon his shield, that it no further went,
But to the ground the idle quarrel fell:
Then he another and another did expel.
Which to prevent, the Prince his mortal spear
Soon to him raught, and fierce at him did ride,
To be avenged of that shot whyleare:
But he was not so hardy to abide
That bitter stownd, but turning quick aside
His light-foot beast, fled fast away for fear:
Whom to poursue, the Infant after hide,
So fast as his good Courser could him bear,
But labor lost it was, to ween approach him near.
For as the winged wind his Tigre fled,
That view of eye could scarce him overtake,
Ne scarce his feet on ground were seen to tred;
Through hills and dales he speedy way did make,
Ne hedge ne ditch his ready passage brake,
And in his flight the villein turned his face,
(As wonts the Tartar by the Caspian lake,
When as the Russian him in fight does chase)
Unto his Tygres tail, and shot at him apace.
Apace he shot, and yet he fled apace,
Still as the greedy knight nigh to him drew,
And oftentimes he would relent his pace,
That him his foe more fiercely should poursew:
But when his uncouth manner he did view,
He began auize to follow him no more,
But keep his standing, and his shaftes eschew,
Until he quite had spent his perlous store,
And then assail him fresh, ere he could shift for more.
But that lame Hag, still as abroad he strew
His wicked arrows, gathered them again,
And to him brought fresh batteill to renew:
Which he espying, cast her to restrain
From yielding succor to that cursed Swain,
And her attaching, thought her hands to tie;
But soon as him dismounted on the plain,
That other Hag did far away espy
Binding her sister, she to him ran hastily.
And catching hold of him, as down he lent,
Him backward overthrew, and down him stayed
With their rude hands and gryesly graplement,
Till that the villein coming to their aid,
Upon him fell, and lode upon him laid;
Full little wanted, but he had him slain,
And of the battle balefull end had made,
Had not his gentle Squire beheld his pain,
And commen to his reskew, ere his bitter bane.
So greatest and most glorious thing on ground
May often need the help of weaker hand;
So feeble is man's state, and life unsound,
That in assurance it may never stand,
Till it dissolved be from earthly band.
Proof be thou Prince, the prowest man alive,
And noblest borne of all in Britom land,
Yet thee fierce Fortune did so nearely drive,
That had not grace thee blessed, thou should not revive.
The Squyre arriving, fiercely in his arms
Snatched first the one, and then the other Jade,
His chiefest letts and authors of his harms,
And them perforce withheld with threatened blade,
Least that his Lord they should behind invade;
The whiles the Prince pricked with reprochful shame,
As one awakte out of long slombring shade,
Reuiuyng thought of glory and of fame,
United all his powers to purge him self from blame.
Like as a fire, the which in hollow cave
Has long been vnderkept, and down suppressed,
With murmurous disdain does inly rave,
And grudge, in so straight prison to be pressed,
At last breaks forth with furious infest,
And strives to mount unto his native seat;
All that did erst it hinder and molest,
Yt now deuoures with flames and scorching heat,
And carries into smoke with rage and horror great.
So mightily the Briton Prince him rouzd
Out of his hold, and broke his caytiue bands,
And as a Bear whom angry curres have touzd,
Having off-shakt them, and escapt their hands,
Becomes more fell, and all that him with stands
Treads down and overthrows. Now had the Carle
Alighted from his Tigre, and his hands
Discharged of his bow and deadly quar'le,
To seize upon his foe flatt lying on the marle.
Which now him turned to disauantage dear,
For neither can he fly, nor other harm,
But trust unto his strength and manhood meare,
Since now he is far from his monstrous swarm,
And of his weapons did him self disarme.
The knight yet wrothfull for his late disgrace,
Fiercely aduaunst his valorous right arm,
And him so sore smott with his iron mace,
That groueling to the ground he fell, and filled his place.
Well weened he, that field was then his own,
And all his labor brought to happy end,
When suddein up the villeine overthrown,
Out of his swowne arose, fresh to contend,
And began him self to second battaill bend,
As hurt he had not been. Thereby there lay
An huge great stone, which stood upon one end,
And had not been removed many a day;
Some land-marke seemd to be, or sign of sundry way.
The same he snatched, and with exceeding sway
Threw at his foe, who was right well aware
To shonne the engine of his meant decay;
It booted not to think that throw to bear,
But grownd he gave, and lightly lept areare:
Efte fierce retourning, as a faulcon fair
That once has failed of her souse full near,
Remounts again into the open air,
And unto better fortune does her self prepayre.
So brave retourning, with his brandisht blade,
He to the Carle him self again addressed,
And struck at him so sternely, that he made
An open passage through his riuen breast,
That half the steel behind his back did rest;
Which drawing back, he looked ever more
When the heart blood should gush out of his chest,
Or his dead corse should fall upon the flore;
But his dead corse upon the flore fell nathemore.
Ne drop of blood appeared shed to be,
All were the wownd so wide and wondrous,
That through his carcas one might plainly see:
Half in amaze with horror hideous,
And half in rage, to be deluded thus,
Again through both the sides he struck him quight,
That made his spright to groan full piteous:
Yet nathemore forth fled his groaning spright,
But freshly as at first, prepared himself to fight.
Thereat he smitten was with great affright,
And trembling terror did his heart apall,
Ne wist he, what to think of that same sight,
Ne what to say, ne what to do at all;
He doubted, least it were some magical
Illusion, that did beguile his sense,
Or wandering ghost, that wanted funeral,
Or aerie spirit under false pretense,
Or hellish feend raysd up through devilish science.
His wonder far exceeded reasons reach,
That he began to doubt his dazeled sight,
And often of error did him self appeach:
Flesh without blood, a person without spright,
Wounds without hurt, a body without might,
That could do harm, yet could not harmed be,
That could not die, yet seemd a mortal wight,
That was most strong in most infirmitee;
Like did he never hear, like did he never see.
A while he stood in this astonishment,
Yet would he not for all his great dismay
Give over to effect his first intent,
And the utmost means of victory assay,
Or the utmost yssew of his own decay.
His own good sword Mordure, that never fayld
At need, till now he lightly threw away,
And his bright shield, that naught him now auayld,
And with his naked hands him forcibly assayld.
Twixt his two mighty arms him up he snatched,
And crushed his carcas so against his breast,
That the disdainful soul he thence dispatched,
And th'ydle breath all utterly expressed:
Tho when he felt him dead, (...) he kest
The lumpish corse unto the senseless grownd,
Adowne he kest it with so (...) wrest,
That back again it did (...) rebownd,
And gave against his mother earth a gronefull sownd.
As when Jove's harnesse-bearing Bird from hye
Stoupes at a flying heron with proud disdain,
The stone-dead quarrey falls so forciblye,
That yt rebownds against the lowly plain,
A second fall redoubling back again.
Then thought the Prince all peril sure was past,
And that he victor only did remain;
No sooner thought, then that the Carle as fast
Began heap huge strokes on him, as ere he down was cast.
Nigh his wits end then woxe the amazed knight,
And thought his labor lost and travel vain,
Against his lifelesse shadow so to fight:
Yet life he saw, and felt his mighty main,
That whiles he (...) still, did still him pain:
For thy he began some other ways aduize,
How to take life from that dead-liuing swayne,
Whom still he marked freshly to arize
From the earth, and from her womb new spirits to reprize.
He then remembered well, that had been said,
How The Earth his mother was, and first him bore,
She eke so often, as his life decayed,
Did life with usury to him restore,
And reysd him up much stronger then before,
So soon as he unto her womb did fall;
Therefore to grownd (...) would him cast no more,
Ne him committ to grave terrestrial,
But bear him far from hope of succor usual.
Tho up he caught him twixt his puissant hands,
And having (...) out of his carrion corse
The (...) full life, now loofd from sinful bands,
Upon his shoulders carried him perforse
Above three (...), taking his full course,
Until he came unto a standing lake;
Him thereinto he threw without remorse,
Ne stird, till hope of life did him forsake;
So end of that Carles days, and his own pains did make.
Which when those wicked Hags from far did spy,
Like two mad dogs they ran about the lands,
And the one of them with dreadful yelling cry,
Throwing away her broken chains and bands,
And (...) quenched her burning fire brands,
Hedlong her (...) did (...) into that lake;
But Impotenee with her own wilful hands,
One of Malegers cursed darts did take,
So ryu'd her trembling heart, and wicked end did make.
Thus now alone he conqueror remains;
Tho cumming to his Squyre, that kept his steed,
Thought to have mounted, but his feeble veins
Him faild thereto, and served not his need,
Through loss of blood, which from his wounds did bleed,
That he began to faint, and life decay:
But his good Squyre him helping up with speed,
With steadfast hand upon his horse did stay,
And led him to the Castle by the beaten way.
Where many Grooms and Squyres ready were,
To take him from his steed full tenderly,
And eke the fairest Alma met him there
With balm and wine and costly spicery,
To comfort him in his infirmity;
Eftesoones she causd him up to be conuayd,
And of his arms despoyled easily,
In sumptuons bed she made him to be laid,
And all the while his wounds were dressing, by him stayed
Cant. XII.
Guyon through Palmers governance,
through passing perilles great,
Does overthrow the Bower of blis,
and Acrasy defeat.
NOw ginnes this goodly frame of Temperaunce
Fayrely to rise, and her adorned head
To prick of highest praise forth to advance,
Formerly grounded, and fast setteled
On firm foundation of true bountyhed;
And this brave knight, that for this virtue fightes,
Now comes to point of that same perilous sted,
Where Pleasure dwelles in sensual delights,
Among thousand dagers, and ten thousand Magic mights.
Two days now in that sea he sailed has,
Ne ever land beheld, ne living wight,
Ne ought save peril, still as he did pas:
Tho when appeared the third Morrow bright,
Upon the waves to spread her trembling light,
An hideous roaring far away they heard,
That all their senses filled with affright,
And straight they saw the raging surges reard
Up to the skies, that them of drowning made affeard.
Said then the Boteman, Palmer stere aright,
And keep an even course; for yonder way
We needs must pas (God do us well acquight,)
That is the Gulf of Greediness, they say,
That deep engorgeth all this worlds pray:
Which having swallowd up excessiuely,
He soon in vomit up again does lay,
And belcheth forth his superfluity,
That all the seas for fear did seem away to fly.
On the other side an hideous Rock is pight,
Of mighty Magnes stone, whose craggie clift
Depending from on high, dreadful to sight,
Over the waves his rugged arms does lift,
And threatens down to throw his ragged rift,
On whosoever comes nigh; yet nigh it draws
All passengers, that none from it can shift:
For whiles they fly that Gulfes devouring jaws,
They on this Rock are rent, and sunck in helples wawes.
Forward they pass, and strongly he them rows,
Until they nigh unto that Gulf arryue,
Where stream more violent and greedy grows:
Then he with all his puisaunce does strive
To strike his oars, and mightily does drive
The hollow vessel through the threatfull wave,
Which gaping wide, to swallow them alive,
In th'huge abyss of his engulfing grave,
Does rore at them in vain, and with great terror rave.
They passing by, that grisely mouth did see,
Sucking the seas into his entralles deep,
That seemd more horrible then hell to be,
Or that dark dreadful hole of Tartare steep,
Through which the damned ghosts done often creep
Back to the world, bad livers to torment:
But naught that falls into this direful deep,
Ne that approaches nigh the wide descent,
May back return, but is condemned to be drent.
On the other side, they saw that perilous Rock,
Threatening it self on them to ruinate,
On whose sharp cliftes the ribs of vessels broke,
And shiuered ships, which had been wrecked late,
Yet stuck, with carcases exanimate
Of such, as having all their substance spent
In wanton joys, and lusts intemperate,
Did after wards make shipwreck violent,
Both of their life, and fame for ever fowly blent.
For thy this hight The Rock of vile Reproach,
A dangerous and detestable place,
To which nor fish nor foul did once approach,
But yelling Meawes, with Seagulles hoars and bace,
And Cormoyraunts, with birds of ravenous race,
Which still sat weiting on that wastfull clift,
For spoil of wretches, whose unhappy case,
After lost credit and consumed thrift,
At last them driven has to this despairefull drift,
The Palmer seeing them in safety past,
Thus said, behold th'ensamples in our sightes,
Of lustful luxury and thriftlesse wast:
What now is left of miserable wightes,
Which spent their looser days in lewd delights,
But shame and sad reproach, here to be red,
By these rent relics, speaking their ill plightes?
Let all that live, hereby be counseled,
To shun Rock of Reproach and it as death to dread.
So forth they rowed, and that Ferryman
With his stiff oars did brush the sea so strong,
That the hoare waters from his frigotran,
And the light bubles daunced all along,
Whiles the salt brine out of the billows sprung.
At last far off they many Islandes spy,
On every side floting the floodes among:
Then said the knight, Lo I the land descry,
Therefore old Sire thy course do thereunto apply.
That may not be, said then the Ferryman
Least we vnweeting hap to be fordonne:
For those same Islands, seeming now and than,
Are not firm land, nor any certain won,
But straggling plots, which to and fro do run
In the wide waters: therefore are they hight
The wandering Islands. Therefore do them shonne;
For they have often drawn many a wandering wight
Into most deadly danger and distressed plight.
Yet well they seem to him, that far does view,
Both fair and fruitful, and the grownd dispred,
With grassy green of delectable hew,
And the tall trees with leaves appareled,
Are decked with blossoms did in white and red,
That mote the passengers thereto allure;
But whosoever once has fastened
His foot thereon, may never it recure,
But wandreth ever more uncertain and unsure.
As th'Isle of Delos whylome men report
Amid the (...) sea long time did stray,
Ne made for shipping any certain port,
Till that Latona traueiling that way,
Flying from Iunoes wrath and hard assay,
Of her fair twins was there delivered,
Which afterward did rule the night and day;
Thenceforth it firmly was established,
And for Apolloes temple highly her ried.
They to him hearken, as beseems meet,
And pass on forward: so their way does ly,
That one of those same Islands, which do fleet
In the wide sea, they needs must passen by,
Which seemd so sweet and pleasant to the eye,
That it would tempt a man to touchen there:
Upon the banck they sitting did espy
A dainty damsel, dressing of her hear,
By whom a little skippet floting did appear.
She them espying, loud to them can call,
Bidding them nigher draw unto the shore;
For she had cause to busy them withal;
And therewith lowdly laughed: But nathemore
Would they once turn, but kept on as before:
Which when she saw, she left her locks vndight,
And running to her boat wihtouten ore,
From the departing land it launched light,
And after them did drive with all her power and might.
Whom ouertaking, she in merry sort
Them began to board, and purpose diversely,
Now faining dalliaunce and wanton sport,
Now throwing forth lewd words immodestly;
Till that the Palmer began full bitterly
Her to rebuke, for being loose and light:
Which not abiding, but more scornfully
Scoffing at him, that did her justly wite,
She turned her bote about, and from them rowed quite.
That was the wanton Phoedria, which late
Did ferry him over the Idle lake:
Whom naught regarding, they kept on their (...),
And all her vain allurements did forsake,
When them the wary Boteman thus bespake;
Here now behooves us well to auyse,
And of our safety good heed to take;
For here before a perlous passage lies,
Where many Mermayds haunt, making false melodies.
But by the way, there is a great Quicksand,
And a whirlepoole of hidden ieopardy,
Therefore, Sir Palmer, keep an even hand;
For twixt them both the narrow way does ly.
Scarce had he said, when hard at hand they spy
That quicksand nigh with water covered;
But by the checked wave they did descry
It plain, and by the sea discolored:
It called was the quickesand of Vnthriftyhed.
They passing by, a goodly Ship did see,
Laden from far with precious merchandise,
And bravely furnished, as ship might be,
Which through great disauenture, or mesprize,
Her self had run into that hazardize;
Whose mariners and merchants with much toil,
Labored in vain, to have recur'd their prize,
And the rich wares to save from pitteous spoil,
But neither toil nor traueill might her back recoyle.
On the other side they see that perilous Poole,
That called was the Whirlepoole of decay,
In which full many had with hapless doole
Been suncke, of whom no memory did stay:
Whose circled waters rapt with whirling sway,
Like to a restless wheel, still (...) round,
Did covet, as they passed by that way,
To draw their bote within the utmost bound
Of his wide Labyrinth, and then to have them dround.
But th'earnest Boteman strongly forth did stretch
His brawnie arms, and all his body strain,
That the utmost sandy breach they shortly fetch,
Whiles the dredd danger does behind remain.
Suddeine they see from midst of all the Maine,
The surging waters like a mountain rise,
And the great sea puffed up with proud disdain,
To swell above the measure of his guise,
As threatening to devour all, that his power despise.
The waves come rolling, and the billows rore
Outragiously, as they enraged were,
Or wrathful Neptune did them drive before
His whirling charet, for exceeding fear:
For not one puff of wind there did appear,
That all the three thereat woxe much afraid,
Vnweeting, what such horror strange did rear.
(...) they saw an hideous host arrayd,
Of huge Sea monsters, such as living sense dismayed.
Most ugly shapes, and horrible aspects,
Such as Dame Nature self mote fear to see,
Or shame, that ever should so foul defects
From her most cunning hand escaped be;
All dreadful (...) of deformitee:
Spring-headed Hydres, and sea-shouldring Whales,
Great whirlpooles, which all fishes make to flee,
Bright Scolopendraes, armed with silver scales,
Mighty Monoceros, with immeasured tails.
The dreadful Fish, that has deserved the name
Of Death, and like him looks in dreadful hew,
The griesly Wasserman, that makes his game
The flying ships with swiftnes to pursew,
The horrible Sea-satyre, that does show
His fearful face in time of greatest storm,
Huge Ziffius, whom Mariners eschew
No less, then rocks, (as travelers inform,)
And greedy Rosmarines with visages deforme.
All these, and thousand thousands many more,
And more deformed Monsters thousand fold,
With dreadful noise, and hollow rombling rore,
Came rushing in the fomy waves enrold,
Which seemed to fly for fear, them to behold:
Ne wonder, if these did the knight appall;
For all that here on earth we dreadful hold,
Be but as bugs to fearen babes withal,
Compared to the creatures in the seas entrall.
Fear naught, then said the Palmer well auiz'd;
For these same Monsters are not these in deed,
But are into these fearful shapes disguised
By that same wicked witch, to work us dreed,
And draw from on this journey to proceed.
Tho lifting up his virtuous staff on hye,
He smote the sea, which calmed was with speed,
And all that dreadful Army fast began fly
Into great Tethys bosom, where they hidden lie.
Quit from that danger, forth their course they kept,
And as they went, they heard a ruefull cry
Of one, that wayld and pitifully wept,
That through the sea the resounding plaints did fly:
At last they in an Island did espy
A seemly Maiden, sitting by the shore,
That with great sorrow and sad agony,
Seemed some great misfortune to deplore,
And loud to them for succor called evermore.
Which Guyon hearing, straight his Palmer bad,
To stere the boat toward that doleful Maid,
That he might know, and ease her sorrow sad:
Who him auizing better, to him said;
Fair Sir, be not displeasd if disobayd:
For ill it were to hearken to her cry;
For she is inly nothing ill apayd,
But only womanish fine forgery,
Your stubborn heart t'affect with frail infirmity.
To which when she your courage has inclind
Through foolish pity, then her guilefull bayt
She will embosome deeper in your mind,
And for your ruin at the last awayt.
The Knight was ruled, and the Boteman strayt
Held on his course with stayed steadfastness,
Ne ever shroncke, ne ever sought to bayt
His tired arms for toylesome weariness,
But with his oars did sweep the watery wilderness.
And now they nigh approached to the sted,
Where as those Mermayds dwelt: it was a still
And calmy bay, on the one side sheltered
With the broad shadow of an hoarie hill,
On the other side an high rock toured still,
That twixt them both a pleasant port they made,
And did like an half Theater fulfill:
There those five sisters had continual trade,
And vsd to bath themselves in that deceiptfull shade.
They were fair Ladies, till they fondly strived
With the Heliconian maids for maystery;
Of whom they ouer-comen, were deprived
Of their proud beauty, and the one moyity
Transformd to fish, for their bold surquedry,
But th'vpper half their hew retained still,
And their sweet skill in wonted melody;
Which ever after they abusd to ill,
T'allure weak traueillers, whom gotten they did kill.
So now to Guyon, as he passed by,
Their pleasant tunes they sweetly thus applyde;
O thou fair son of gentle Faery,
That art in mighty arms most magnifyde
Above all knights, that ever batteill tryde,
O turn thy rudder hetherward a while:
Here may thy storme-bett vessel safely ride;
This is the Port of rest from troublous toil,
The worlds sweet In, from pain and wearisome turmoyle.
With that the rolling sea resounding soft,
In his big base them fitly answered,
And on the rock the waves breaking aloft,
A solemn Mean unto them measured,
The whiles sweet Zephyrus loud whisteled
His treble, a strange kind of harmony;
Which Guyons senses softly tickeled,
That he the boteman bad row easily,
And let him hear some part of their rare melody.
But him the Palmer from that vanity,
With temperate advice discounselled,
That they it past, and shortly began descry
The land, to which their course they leueled;
When suddeinly a gross fog over spread
With his dull vapor all that desert has,
And heavens cheerful face enueloped,
That all things one, and one as nothing was,
And this great Universe seemd one confused mas.
Thereat they greatly were dismayed, ne wist
How to direct their way in darkness wide,
But feared to wander (...) that wastefull mist,
For tombling into mischief vnespide.
Worse is the danger hidden, then descride.
Suddeinly an innumerable flight
Of harmefull fowls about them fluttering, cride,
And with their wicked wings them often did smight,
And sore annoyed, groping in that griesly night.
Even all the nation of unfortunate
And fatal birds about them flocked were,
Such as by nature men abhor and hate,
The ill-faste Owl, deaths dreadful messengere,
The hoars Night-rauen, trump of doleful drere,
The lether-winged Batt, days enemy,
The ruefull Strich, still waiting on the bear,
The whistler shrill, that who so hears, does die,
The hellish Harpyes, prophets of sad destiny.
All those, and all that else does horror breed,
About them flew, and filled their sails with fear:
Yet stayed they not, hut forward did proceed,
Whiles the one did row, and the other stiffly steare;
Till that at last the weather began to clear,
And the fair land it self did plainly sheow.
Said then the Palmer Lo where does appear
The sacred soil, where all our perils grow;
Therefore, Sir knight, your ready arms about you throw.
He hearkened, and his arms about him took,
The whiles the nimble bote so well her sped,
That with her crooked keele the land she struck,
Then forth the noble Guyou sallied,
And his sage Palmer, that him governed;
But the other by his bote behind did stay.
They marched fayrly forth, of naught ydred,
Both firmly armd for every hard assay,
With constancy and care, against danger and dismay.
Ere long they heard an hideous bellowing
Of many beasts, that roard outrageously,
As if that hungers point, or Venus sting
Had them enraged with fell surquedry;
Yet naught they feared, but past on hardily,
Until they came in view of those wild beasts:
Who all attonce, gaping full greedily,
And rearing fercely their vpstaring crests,
Ran toward, to devour those unexpected guests.
But soon as they approcht with deadly threat,
The Palmer over them his staff vpheld,
His mighty staff, that could all charms defeat:
Eftesoones their stubborn corages were queld,
And high advanced crests down meekely feld,
Instead of fraying, they them selves did fear,
And trembled, as them passing they beheld:
Such wondrous power did in that staff appear,
All monsters to subdew to him, that did it bear.
Of that same wood it framed was cunningly,
Of which Caduceus whilome was made,
Caduceus the rod of Mercury,
With which he wonts the Stygian realms invade,
Through ghastly horror, and eternal shade;
The Infernal feends with it he can assuage,
And Orcus tame, whom nothing can persuade,
And rule the Furyes, when they most do rage:
Such virtue in his staff had eke this Palmer sage.
Thence passing forth, they shortly do arryue,
Whereas the Bower of Bliss was situate;
A place picked out by choice of best alive,
That natures work by art can imitate:
In which what ever in this worldly state
Is sweet, and pleasing unto living sense,
Or that may dayntest fantasy aggrate,
Was poured forth with plentiful dispense,
And made there to abound with lavish affluence.
Goodly it was enclosed rownd about,
As Well iheir entered guestes to keep within,
As those unruly beasts to hold without;
Yet was the fence thereof but weak and thin;
Naught feared their force, that fortilage to win,
But wisdoms power, and temperaunces might,
By which the migtest things efforced bin:
And eke the gate was wrought of substance light,
Rather for pleasure, then for battery or fight.
Yt framed was of precious yuory,
That seemd a work of admirable wit;
And therein all the famous history
Of Jason and Medaea was ywritt;
Her mighty charms, her furious loving fit,
His goodly conquest of the golden fleece,
His falsed faith, and love too lightly flitt,
The wondered Argo, which in venturous piece
First through the Euxine seas bore all the flowr of Greece.
Ye might have seen the frothy billows fry
Under the ship, as thorough them she went,
That seemd the waves were into yuory,
Or yuory into the waves were sent;
And otherwhere the snowy substance sprent
With vermell, like the boys blood therein shed,
A piteous spectacle did represent,
And otherwhiles with gold besprinkeled;
Yt seemd then chaunted flame, which did Creusa wed.
All this, and more might in that goodly gate
Be red; that ever open stood to all,
Which thither came: but in the Porch their sat
A comely personage of stature tall,
And semblaunce pleasing, more then natural,
That traueilers to him seemd to entize;
His looser garment to the ground did fall,
And flew about his heels in wanton wize,
Not fit for speedy pace, or manly exercize.
They in that place him Genius did call:
Not that celestial power, to whom the care
Of life, and generation of all
That lives, perteines in charge particulare,
Who wondrous things concerning our welfare,
And strange phantomes does let us often forsee,
And often of secret ill bids us beware:
That is our Self, whom though we do not see,
Yet each does in him self it well perceive to be.
Therefore a God him sage Antiquity
Did wisely make, and good Agdistes call:
But this same was to that quite contrary,
The foe of life, that good enuyes to all,
That secretly does us procure to fall,
Through guilefull semblants, which he makes us see.
He often his Gardin had the gouernall,
And Pleasures porter was deuizd to be,
Holding a stafle in hand for more formalitee
With diverse flowers he daintily was decked,
And strowed rownd about, and by his side
A mighty Mazer bowl of wine was set,
As if it had to him been sacrifide;
Wherewith all new-come guests he gratyfide:
So did he eke Sir Guyon passing by:
But he his idle courtesy defide,
And overthrew his bowl disdainfully;
And broke his staff, with which he charmed semblantssly.
Thus being entered, they behold arownd
A large and spacious plain, on every side
Strowed with pleasauns, whose fair grassy grownd
Mantled with green, and goodly beautifide
With all the (...) of Floraes pride,
Wherewith her mother Art, as half in scorn
Of niggard Nature, like a pompous bride
Did deck her, and too lauishly adorn,
When forth from virgin bowte she comes in the early morn.
Therewith (...) Heavens always Iouiall,
Lookte on them lovely, still in steadfast state,
Ne fuffred storm nor frost on them to fall,
Their tender buds or leaves to violate,
Nor scorching heat, nor cold intemperate
T'afflict the creatures, which therein did dwell,
But the mild air with season moderate
Gently attempred, and disposd so well,
That still it breathed forth sweet spirit and holesom smell.
More sweet and wholesome, then the pleasant hill
Of Rhodope, on which the Nimphe, that bore
A gyaunt babe, her self for grief did kill:
Or the Thessalian Tempe, where of yore
Fair Daphne Phoebus heart with love did gore;
Or Ida, where the Gods loved to repair,
When ever they their heavenly bowres forlore;
Or sweet Parnasse, the haunt of Muses fair;
Or Eden self, if ought with Eden mote compayre.
Much wondered Guyon at the fair aspect
Of that sweet place, yet suffered no delight
To sincke into his sense, nor mind affect,
But passed forth, and looked still forward right,
Brydling his will, and maystering his might:
Till that he came unto another gate,
No gate, but like one, being goodly dight
With bows and branches, which did broad dilate
Their clasping arms, in wanton wreathings intricate.
So fashioned a Porch with rare device,
Archt over head with an embracing vine,
Whose bounches hanging down, seemd to entice
All passers by, to taste their lushious wine,
And did them selves into their hands incline,
As freely offering to be gathered:
Some deep empurpled as the Hyacine,
Some as the Rubine, laughing sweetly red,
Some like fair Emeraudes, not yet well ripened.
And them amongst, some were of burnisht gold,
So made by art, to beautify the rest,
Which did themselves emongst the leaves enfold,
As lurking from the view of covetous guest,
That the weak boughs, with so rich load oppressed,
Did bow adowne, as ouerburdened.
Under that Porch a comely dame did rest,
Clad in fair weeds, but foul disordered,
And garments loose, that seemd unmeet for womanhed.
In her left hand a Cup of gold she held,
And with her right the riper fruit did reach,
Whose sappy liquor, that with fullness sweld,
Into her cup she scruzd, with dainty breach
Of her fine fingers, without foul empeach,
That so fair winepresse made the wine more sweet:
Thereof she vsd to give to drink to each,
Whom passing by she happened to meet:
It was her guise, all Strangers goodly so to greet.
So she to Guyon offered it to taste,
Who taking it out of her tender hond,
The cup to ground did violently cast,
That all in pieces it was broken fond,
And with the liquor stained all the land:
Whereat Excess exceedinly was wroth,
Yet no'te the same amend, ne yet withstond,
But suffered him to pass, all were she loath;
Who naught regarding her displeasure forward goth.
There the most dainty Paradise on ground,
It self does offer to his sobcr eye,
In which all pleasures plenteously abownd,
And none does others happiness ennye:
The painted flowers, the trees vpshooting hye,
The dales for shade, the hills for breathing space,
The trembling groves, the christ all running by;
And that, which all fair works does most aggrace,
The art, which all that wrought, appeared in no place.
One would have thought, (so cunningly, the rude
And scorned parts were mingled with the fine,)
That nature had for wantonness ensude
Art, and that Art at nature did repine;
So striving each the other to undermine,
Each did the others work more beautify;
So differing both in wills, agreed in fine:
So all agreed through sweet diversity,
This Gardin to adorn with all variety.
And in the midst of all, a fountain stood,
Of richest substance, that on earth might be,
So pure and shiny, that the silver flood
Through every channel running one might see;
Most goodly it with curious ymageree
Was ouerwrought, and shapes of naked boys,
Of which some seemd with lively iollitee,
To fly about, playing their wanton toys,
Whylest others did them selves embay in liquid joys,
And over all, of purest gold was spread,
A trayle of yuie in his native hew:
For the rich metal was so colored,
That wight, who did not well auis'd it view.
Would surely deem it to be yuie true:
Low his lascivious arms adown did creep,
That themselves dipping in the silver dew,
Their fleecy flowers they fearfully did steep,
Which drops of Crystal seemd for wantones to weep.
Infinitstreames continually did well
Out of this fountain, sweet and fair to see,
The which into an ample lauer fell,
And shortly grew to so great quantity,
That like a little lake it seemd to be;
Whose depth exceeded not three cubits hight,
That through the waves one might the bottom see,
All pau'd beneath with Iaspar shining bright,
That seemd the fountain in that sea did sail upright.
And all the margent round about was set,
With shady Laurel trees, thence to defend
The sunny beams, which on the billows bett,
And those which therein bathed, mote offend:
As Guyon happened by the same to wend,
Two naked Damzelles he therein espyde,
Which therein bathing, seemed to contend,
And wrestle wantonly, ne cared to hyde,
Their dainty parts from view of any, which them eyd.
Sometimes the one would lift the other quight
Above the waters, and then down again
Her plong, as over maystered by might,
Where both awhile would covered remain,
And each the other from to rise restrain;
The whiles their snowy limbs, as through a vele,
So through the crystal waves appeared plain:
Then suddeinly both would themselves vnhele,
And th'a marous' sweet spoils to greedy eyes reuele.
As that fair Star, the messenger of morn,
His deawy face out of the sea does rear:
Or as the Cyprian goddess, newly borne
Of The Oceans fruitful froth, did first appear:
Such seemed they, and so their yellow hear
Christalline humor dropped down apace.
Whom such when Guyon saw, he drew him near,
And some what (...) relent his earnest pace;
His stubborn breast began sccret pleasaunce to embrace.
The wanton Maidens him espying, stood
Gazing a while at his unwonted guise;
Then the one her self low ducked in the flood,
Abasht, that her a stranger did avise:
But the other rather higher did arise,
And her two lilly paps aloft displayed,
And all, that might his melting heart entyse
To her delights, she unto him bewrayd:
The rest hidd underneath, him more desirous made.
With that, the other likewise up arose,
And her fair locks, which formerly were bownd
Up in one knott, she low adowne did lose:
Which flowing long and thick, her clothed arownd,
And th'yuorie in golden mantle gownd:
So that fair spectacle from him was reft,
Yet that, which reft it, no less fair was fownd:
So hidd in locks and waves from lookers theft,
Naught but her lovely face she for his looking left.
Withal she laughed, and she blushed withal,
That blushing to her laughter gave more grace,
And laughter to her blushing, as did fall:
Now when they spyde the knight to slack his pace,
Them to behold, and in his sparkling face
The secret signs of kindled lust appear,
Their wanton meriments they did encreace,
And to him beckned, to approach more near,
And showed him many sights, that courage cold could rear.
On which when gazing him the Palmer saw,
He much rebukt those wandering eyes of his,
And counseld well, him forward thence did draw.
Now are they come nigh to the Bower of blis
Of her fond favorites so named amiss:
When thus the Palmer, Now Sir, well auise;
For here the end of all our traueill is:
Here wonnes (...), whom we must surprise,
Else she will slip away, and all our drift despise.
Eftsoons they heard a most melodious sound,
Of all that more delight a dainty ear,
Such as attonce might not on living ground,
Save in this Paradise, be heard elsewhere:
Right hard it was, for wight, which did it hear,
To read, what manner music that mote be:
For all that pleasing is to living ear,
Was there consorted in one harmonee,
Birds, voices, instruments, winds, waters, all agree.
The joyous birds shrouded in cheerful shade,
Their notes unto the voice attempred sweet;
Th'Angelicall soft trembling voices made
To th'instruments divine respondence meet:
The silver sounding instruments did meet
With the base murmr of the waters fall:
The waters fall with difference discreet,
Now soft, now loud, unto the wind did call:
The gentle warbling wind low answered to all.
There, whence that Music seemed heard to be,
Was the fair Witch her self now solacing,
With a new Lover, whom through sorceree
And witchcraft, she from far did thither bring:
There she had him now laid a slombering,
In secret shade, after long wanton joys:
Whilst round about them pleasauntly did sing
Many fair Ladies, and lascivious boys,
That ever mixed their song with light licentious toys.
And all that while, right over him she hong,
With her false eyes fast fixed in his sight,
As seeking medicine, whence she was stong,
Or greedily depasturing delight:
And often inclining down with kisses light,
For fear of waking him, his lips bedewd,
And through his humid eyes did suck his spright,
Quite molten into lust and pleasure lewd;
Wherewith she sighed soft, as if his case she rewd.
The whiles some one did chaunt this lovely lay;
Ah see, who so fair thing do feign to see,
In springing flower the image of thy day;
Ah see the Virgin Rose, how sweetly she
Does first peep forth with bashful modestee,
That fairer seems, the less ye see her may;
Lo see (...) after, how more bold and free
Her bared bosom she does broad display;
Lo see soon after, how she fades, and falls away.
So passes, in the passing of a day,
Of mortal life the leaf, the bud, the flower,
Ne more does flourish after first decay,
That erst was sought to deck both bed and bower,
Of many a Lady, and many a Paramowre:
Gather therefore the Rose, whilst yet is prime,
For soon comes age, that will her pride deflowre:
Gather the Rose of love, whilst yet is time,
Whilst loving thou may loved be with equal crime.
He ceast, and then began all the quire of birds
Their diverse notes t'attune unto his lay,
As in approuaunce of his pleasing words.
The constant pair heard all, that he did say,
Yet swarued not, but kept their forward way,
Through many covert groves, and thickets close,
In which they creeping did at last display
Thot wanton Lady, with her lover lose,
Whose sleepie head she in her lap did soft dispose.
Upon a bed of Roses she was laid,
As faint through heat, or dight to pleasant sin,
And was arayd, or rather disarayd,
All in a uele of silk and silver thin,
That hid no whit her alablaster skin,
But rather showed more white, if more might be:
More subtle web Arachne cannot spin,
Not the fine nets, which often we wouen see
Of scorched deaw, do not in the air more lightly flee.
Her snowy breast was bare to ready spoil
Of hungry eyes, which n'ote therewith be filled,
And yet through languour of her late sweet toil,
Few drops, more clear then Nectar, forth distild,
That like pure Orient perles adowne it trild,
And her fair eyes sweet smyling in delight,
Moystened their fiery beams, with which she thrild
Frail hearts, yet quenched not; like starry light
Which sparckling on the silent waves, does seem more bright.
The young man sleeping by her, seemd to be
Some goodly swayne of honorable place,
That certes it great pity was to see
Him his nobility so foul deface;
A sweet regard, and amiable grace,
Mixed with manly sternesse did appear
Yet sleeping, in his well proportiond face,
And on his tender lips the downy hear
Did now but freshly spring, and silken blossoms bear.
His warlike Arms, the idle instruments
Of sleeping praise, were hong upon a tree,
And his brave shield, full of old moniments,
Was fowly ra'st; that none the signs might see,
Ne for them, ne for honor cared he,
Ne ought, that did to his advancement tend,
But in lewd loves, and wastfull luxuree,
His days, his goods, his body he did spend:
O horrible enchantment, that him so did blend.
The noble Elfe, and careful Palmer drew
So nigh them, minding naught, but (...) game,
That suddein forth they on them rusht, and threw
A subtle net, which only for that same
The skillful Palmer formally did frame.
So held them under fast, the whiles the rest
Fled all away for fear of fowler shame.
The fair Enchauntresse, so unawares oppressed,
Tryde all her arts, and all her sleights, thence out to wrest.
And eke her lover strove: but all in vain;
For that same net so cunningly was wound,
That neither guile, nor force might it distraine.
They took them both, and both them strongly bound
In captive bands, which there they ready found:
But her in chains of adamant he tide;
For nothing else might keep her safe and sound;
But Verdant (so he hight) he soon vntyde,
And counsel sage in steed thereof to him applyde,
But all those pleasant bowres and Palace brave,
Guyon broke down, with rigor pitiless;
Ne ought their goodly workmanship might save
Them from the tempest of his wrathfulnesse,
But that their bliss he turned to balefulnesse:
Their groves he feld, their gardins did deface,
Their arbers spoil, their Cabinets suppress,
Their banquet houses burn, their buildings race,
And of the fairest late, now made the fowlest place.
Then led they her away, and cke that knight
They with them led, both sorrowful and sad:
The way they came, the same retourn'd they right,
Till they arrived, where they lately had
Charmed those wild-beasts, that raged with fury mad.
Which now awaking, fierce at them began fly,
As in their mistress reskew, whom they lad;
But them the Palmer soon did pacify.
Then Guyon asked, what meant those beasts, which there didly.
Said he, these seeming beasts are men indeed,
Whom this Enchauntresse has transformed thus,
Whylome her lovers, which her lusts did feed,
Now turned into figures hideous,
According to their minds like monstrous.
Sad end (quoth he) of life intemperate,
And mournful meed of joys delicious:
But Palmer, if it mote thee so aggrate,
Let them returned be unto their former state.
Straight way he with his virtuous staff them struck,
And straight of beasts they comely men became;
Yet being men they did unmanly look,
And stared ghastly, some for inward shame,
And some for wrath, to see their captive Dame:
But one above the rest in special,
That had an hog been late, hight Grylle by name,
Repyned greatly, and did him miscall,
That had from hoggish form him brought to natural.
Said Guyon, See the mind of beastly man,
That has so soon forgot the excellence
Of his creation, when he life began,
That now he chooses, with vile difference,
To be a beast, and lack intelligence.
To whom the Palmer thus, The donghill kind
Delights in filth and foul incontinence:
Let Gryll be Gryll, and have his hoggish mind;
But let us hence depart, whilst wether serves and wind.
The third Book of the Faerie Queen. Containing The Legend of Britomartis.
OR Of Chastity.
IT falls me here to write of Chastity.
The fairest virtue, far above the rest;
For which what needs me fetch from Faery
Foreign ensamples, it to have expressed?
Since it is shrined in my Soueraines breast,
And formd so lively in each perfect part,
That to all Ladies, which have it professed,
Need but behold the pourtraict of her heart,
If pourtrayd it might be by any living (...).
But living art may not least part express,
Nor life-resembling pencill it can paynt,
All were it Zeuxis or Praxitcles:
His daedale hand would fail, and greatly faint,
And her perfections with his error taynt:
Ne Poets wit, that passes Painter far
In picturing the parts of beauty daynt,
So hard a workmanship adventure darre,
For fear through want of words her excellence to mar.
How then shall I, Apprentice of the skill,
That whilome in diuinest wits did rain,
Presume so high to stretch mine humble quill?
Yet now my luckelesse lot does me constrayne
Hereto perforce. But O dredd Sovereign
Thus far forth pardon, since that choicest wit
Cannot your glorious pourtraict figure plain,
That I in colored shows may shadow itt,
And antique praises unto present persons fit.
But if in living colors, and right hew,
Thy self thou covet to see pictured,
Who can it do more lively, or more true,
Then that sweet verse, with Nectar sprinckeled,
In which a gracious servant pictured
His Cynthia, his heavens fairest light?
That with his melting sweetness ravished,
And with the wonder of her beams bright,
My senses lulled are in slomber of delight.
But let that same delitious Poet lend
A little leave unto a rusticke Muse
To sing his mistress praise, and let him mend,
If ought amiss her liking may abuse:
Ne let his fairest Cynthia refuse,
In mirrours more then one her self to see,
But either Glorian a let her choose,
Or in Belphoebe fashioned to be:
In the one her rule, in the other her rare chastitee.
Cant. I.
Guyon encountreth Britomart,
Fair Florimell is chaced:
Duessaes trains and Materastaes
champions are defaced.
THe famous Briton Prince and Faery knight,
After long ways and perilous pains endured,
Having their weary limbs to perfect plight
Restord, and sorry wounds right well recur'd,
Of the fair Alma greatly were procured,
To make there longer soiourne and abode;
But when thereto they might not be allured,
From seeking praise, and deeds of arms abroad,
They courteous conge took, and forth together yode.
But the captived Acrasia he sent,
Because of traueill long, a nigher way,
With a strong guard, all reskew to prevent,
And her to Faery court safe to convey,
That her for witness of his hard assay,
Unto his Faery Queen he might present:
But he him self betook another way,
To make more trial of his hardiment,
And seek adventures, as he with Prince Arthure went.
Long so they traueiled through wastefull ways,
Where dangers dwelt, and perils most did won,
To hunt for glory and renowned praise;
Full many Countries they did ouerronne,
From the vprising to the setting Sun,
And many hard adventures did atchieue;
Of all the which they honor ever won,
Seeking the weak oppressed to relieve,
And to recover right for such, as wrong did (...).
At last as through an open plain they (...),
They spide a knight, that toward pricked fair,
And him beside an aged Squire there rode,
That seemd to couch under his shield three-square,
As if that age badd him that burden spare,
And yield it those, that stouter could it wield:
He them espying, began him self prepare,
And on his arm address his goodly shield
That bore a Lion passant in a golden field.
Which seeing good Sir Guyon, dear besought
The Prince of grace, to let him run that turn.
He granted: then the Faery quickly raught
His poynant spear, and sharply began to spurn
His fomy steed, whose fiery feet did burn
The verdant gras, as he thereon did tread;
Ne did the other back his foot return,
But fiercely forward came withouten dread,
And bent his dreadful spear against the others head.
They been ymett, and both their points arrived,
But Guyon drove so furious and fell,
That seemd both shield and plate it would have riu'd;
Nathelesse it bore his foe not from his sell,
Rut made him stagger, as he were not well:
But Guyon self, ere well he was aware,
Nigh a (...) length behind his crouper fell,
Yet in his fall so well him self he bare,
That mischievous mischau^ce his (...) and limbs did spare.
Great shame and sorrow of that fall he took;
For never yet, since warlike arms he bore,
And shiuering spear in bloody field first shook,
He fownd him self dishonored so sore.
Ah gentlest knight, that ever armor bore,
Let not the grieve dismounted to have been,
And brought to grownd, that never wast before;
For not thy fault, but secret power unseen,
That spear enchaunted was, which laid thee on the green.
But weenedst thou, what wight thee overthrew,
Much greater grief and shamefuller regrett
For thy hard fortune then thou would renew,
That of a single damzell thou were met
On equal plain, and there so hard besett;
Even the famous Britomart it was,
Whom strange aduentnre did from Britayne fett,
To seek her lover (love far sought alas,)
Whose image she had seen in Venus looking glass.
Full of disdainefull wrath, he fierce vprose,
For to revenge that foul reprochefull shame,
And snatching his bright sword began to close
With her on foot, and stoutly forward came;
Dye rather would he, then endure that same.
Which when his Palmer saw, he began to fear
His toward peril and untoward blame,
Which by that new rencounter he should rear:
For death sat on the point of that enchaunted spear.
And hasting toward him began fair persuade,
Not to provoke misfortune, nor to ween
His spears default to mend with cruel blade;
For by his mighty Science he had seen
The secret virtue of that weapon keen,
That mortal puissaunce mote not withstond:
Nothing on earth mote always happy been.
Great hazard were it, and adventure fond,
To loose long gotten honor with one evil hond.
By such good means he him discounselled,
From prosecuting his revenging rage;
And eke the Prince like treaty handeled,
His wrathful will with reason to aswage,
And laid the blame, not to his carriage,
But to his starting steed, that swaru'd aside,
And to the ill purueyaunce of his page,
That had his furnitures not firmly tide:
So is his angry courage fayrly pacifyde.
Thus reconcilement was between them knitt,
Through goodly temperaunce, and affection chaste,
And either vowed with all their power and wit,
To let not others honor be defaste,
Offriend or foe, who ever it embaste,
Ne arms to bear against the others side:
In which accord the Prince was also plaste,
And with that golden chain of concord tide.
So goodly all agreed, they forth yfere did ride,
O goodly usage of those antique times,
In which the sword was servant unto right;
When not for malice and contentious crimes,
But all for praise, and proof of manly might,
The martial brood accustomed to fight:
Then honor was the meed of victory,
And yet the vanquished had no despite:
Let later age that noble use envy,
Vile rancor to avoid, and cruel surquedry.
Long they thus traueiled in friendly wise,
Through countries waste, and eke welledifyde,
Seeking adventures hard, to exercise
Their puissaunce, whylome full dernly tryde:
At length they came into a forest wide,
Whose hideous horror and sad trembling sownd
Full griesly seemd: Therein they long did ride,
Yet tract of living creature none they fownd,
Save Bears, Lions, and Bulls, which romed them arownd.
All suddenly out of the thickest brush,
Upon a milkwhite Palfrey all alone,
A goodly Lady did foreby them rush,
Whose face did seem as clear as Crystal stone,
And eke through fear as white as whales bone:
Her garments all were wrought of beaten gold,
And all her steed with tinsell trappings shone,
Which fledd so fast, that nothing mote him hold,
And scarce them leisure gave, her passing to behold.
Still as she fledd, her eye she backward threw,
As fearing evil, that poursewd her fast;
And her fair yellow locks behind her flew,
Loosely dispersed with puff of every blast:
All as a blazing star does far outcast
His hearie beams, and flaming locks dispredd,
At sight whereof the people stand aghast:
But the sage wisard tells, as he has redd,
That it importunes death and doleful dreryhedd.
So as they gazed after her a while,
Lo where a griesly foster forth did rush,
Breathing out beastly lust her to defyle:
His tyreling Jade he fiersly forth did push,
Through thick and thin, both over banck and bush
In hope her to attain by hook or crook,
That from his gory sides the blood did gush:
Large were his limbs, and terrible his look,
And in his clownish hand a sharp bore spear he shook.
Which outrage when those gentle knights did see,
Full of great envy and fell gealosy,
They stayed not to auise, who first should be,
But all spurd after fast, as they mote fly,
To reskew her from shameful villainy.
The Prince and Guyon equally byliue
Her self pursewd, in hope to win thereby
Most goodly meede, the fairest Dame alive:
But after the foul foster Timias did strive.
The whiles fair Britomart, whose constant mind,
Would not so lightly follow beauties chase,
Ne reckt of Ladies Love, did stay behynd,
And them awayted there a certain space,
To weet if they would turn back to that place:
But when she saw them gone, she forward went,
As lay her journey, through that perlous Pace,
With steadfast courage and stout hardiment;
Ne evil thing she feared, ne evil thing she meant.
At last as nigh out of the wood she came,
A stately Castle far away she spyde,
To which her steps directly she did frame.
That Castle was most goodly edifyde,
And plaste for pleasure nigh that forest side:
But fair before the gate a spacious plain,
Mantled with green, it self did spredden wide,
On which she saw six knights, that did darrayne
Fires battaill against one, with cruel might and main.
Mainely they all attonce upon him laid,
And sore beset on every side arownd,
That nigh he breathless grew, yet naught dismayed,
Ne ever to them yielded foot of grownd
All had he lost much blood through many a wownd,
But stoutly dealt his blows, and every way
To which he turned in his (...) stownd,
Made them recoile, and fly from dredd decay,
That none of all the six before, him durst assay.
Like dastard Curres, that having at a bay
The saluage beast embost in weary chase,
Dare not adventure on the stubborn pray,
Ne byte before, but rome from place to place,
To get a snatch, when turned is his face.
In such distress and doubtful ieopardy,
When Britomart him saw, she ran apace
Unto his reskew, and with earnest cry,
Badd those same six forbear that single enemy.
But to her cry they list not lenden ear,
Ne ought the more their mighty strokes surceasse,
But gathering him rownd about more near,
Their direful rancour rather did encreasse;
Till that she rushing through the thickest preasse,
Perforce disparted their compacted gyre,
And soon compeld to hearken unto peace:
Tho began she myldly of them to inquyre
The cause of their dissension and outrageous ire.
Whereto that single knight did answer frame;
These six would me enforce by odds of might,
To change my liefe, and love another Dame,
That death me liefer were, then such despite,
So unto wrong to yield my wrested right:
For I love one, the truest one on grownd,
Ne list me change; she the Errant damzell hight,
For whose dear sake full many a bitter stownd,
I have endurd, and tasted many a bloody wownd.
Certes (said she) then been ye six to blame,
To ween your wrong by force to justify:
For knight to leave his Lady were great shame,
That faithful is, and better were to die.
All loss is less, and less the infamy,
Then loss of love to him, that loves but one;
Ne may love be compeld by maistery;
For soon as maistery comes, sweet love anon
Takes his nimble wings, and soon away is gone.
Then spoke one of those six, There dwells here
Within this castle wall a Lady fair,
Whose sovereign beauty has no living pere,
Thereto so bounteous and so debonayre,
That never any mote with her compayre.
She has ordaind this law, which we approve,
That every knight, which does this way repair,
In case he have no Lady, nor no love,
Shall do unto her service never to remove.
But if he have a Lady or a Love,
Then must he her forgo with foul defame,
Or else with us by dint of sword approve,
That she is fairer, then our fairest Dame,
As did this knight, before ye hither came.
Perdy (said Britomart) the choice is hard:
But what reward had he, that overcame?
He should advanced be to high regard,
(Said they) and have our Ladies love for his reward.
Therefore a read Sir, if thou have a love.
Love have I sure, (quoth she) but Lady none;
Yet will I not fro mine own love remove,
Ne to your Lady will I service done,
But wreake your wrongs wrought to this knight alone,
And prove his cause. With that her mortal spear
She mightily auentred toward one,
And down him smot, ere well aware he wear,
Then to the next she rode, and down the next did bear.
Ne did she stay, till three on ground she laid,
That none of them himself could rear again;
The fourth was by that other knight dismayed,
All were he weary of his former pain,
That now there do but two of six remain;
Which two did yield, before she did them smight.
Ah (said she then) now may ye all see plain,
That truth is strong, and true love most of might,
That for his trusty servant does so strongly fight,
Too well we see, (said they) and prove too well
Our faulty weakness, and your matchless might:
For thy, fair Sir, yours be the Damozell,
Which by her own law to your lot does light,
And we your liegemen faith unto you plight.
So underneath her feet their swords they shard,
And after her besought, well as they might,
To enter in, and reap the dew reward:
She granted, and then in they all together fared.
Long were it to describe the goodly frame,
And stately port of Castle Ioyeous,
(For so that Castle hight by commun name)
Where they were entertaynd with courteous
And comely glee of many gracious
Fair Ladies, and of many a gentle knight,
Who through a Chamber long and spacious,
Eftsoons them brought unto their Ladies sight,
That of them cleeped was the Lady of delight.
But for to tell the sumptuous array
Of that great chamber, should be labor lost:
For living wit, I ween, cannot display
The royal riches and exceeding cost,
Of every pillour and of every post;
Which all of purest bullion framed were,
And with great perles and precious stones embost,
That the bright glister of their beams clear
Did sparckle forth great light, and glorious did appear.
These stranger knights through passing, forth were led
Into an inner rowme, whose royaltee
And rich purueyance might uneath be red;
Mote Princes place be seem so decked to be.
Which stately manner when as they did see,
The image of superstuous riotize,
Exceeding much the state of mean degree,
They greatly wondered, whence so sumpteous guize
Might be maintaynd, and each began diuersely deuize.
The walls were round about appareiled
With costly clothes of Arras and of Toure,
In which with cunning hand was pourtrahed
The love of Venus and her Paramoure,
The fair Adonis, turned to a flower,
A work of rare device, and wondrous wit.
First did it show the bitter balefull stowre,
Which her assayd with many a fervent fit,
When first her tender heart was with his beauty smit.
Then with what sleights and sweet allurements she
Entyst the Boy, as well that art she knew,
And wooed him her Paramoure to be;
Now making girlonds of each flower that grew,
To crown his golden locks with honor dew;
Now leading him into a secret shade
From his Beauperes, and from bright heavens view,
Where him to sleep she gently would persuade,
Or bathe him in a fountain by some covert glade.
And whilst he slept, she over him would spread
Her mantle, colored like the starry skies,
And her soft arm lay underneath his head,
And with ambrosiall kisses bathe his eyes;
And whilst he bathed, with her two crafty spies,
She secretly would search each dainty lim,
And throw into the well sweet Rosemaryes,
And fragrant violets, and Paunces trim,
And ever with sweet Nectar she did sprinkle him.
So did she steal his heedelesse heart away,
And ioyd his love in secret vnespyde.
But for she saw him bent to cruel play,
To hunt the saluage beast in forest wide,
Dreadful of danger, that mote him betyde,
She often and often aduiz'd him to refrain
From chase of greater beasts, whose brutish pride
Mote breed him scath unawares: but all in vain;
For who can shun the chance, that dest'ny does ordain?
Lo, where beyond he lies languishing,
Deadly engored of a great wild Bore,
And by his side the Goddess groueling
Makes for him endless moan, and evermore
With her soft garment wipes away the gore,
Which staynes his snowy skin with hateful hew:
But when she saw no help might him restore,
Him to a (...) flower she did transmew,
Which in that cloth was wrought, as if it lively grew.
So was that chamber clad in goodly wize,
And rownd about it many beds were dight,
As whylome was the antique worlds guize,
Some for untimely ease, some for delight,
As pleased them to use, that use it might:
And all was full of Damzels, and of (...),
Dancing and reueling both day and night,
And swimming deep in sensual desires,
And Cupid still amongst them kindled lustful fyres.
And all the while sweet Music did divide
Her looser notes with Lydian harmony;
And all the while sweet birds thereto applide
Their dainty lays and dulcet melody,
Ay caroling of love and iollity,
That wonder was to hear their (...) consort.
Which when those knights beheld, with scornful eye,
They sdeigned such lascivious disport,
And loathed the loose demeanure of that wanton sort.
Thence they were brought to that great Ladies view,
Whom they found sitting on a sumptuous bed,
That glistred all with gold and glorious show,
As the proud Persian Queens accustomed:
She seemd a woman of great bountihed,
And of rare beauty, saving that askaunce
Her wanton eyes, ill signs of womanhed,
Did roll too highly, and too often glaunce,
Withoutregard of grace, or comely amenaunce.
Long work it were, and needless to deuize
Their goodlv entertainment and great glee:
She caused them be led in courteous wize
Into a bower, disarmed for to be,
And cheared well with wine and spicerce:
The Redcrosse Knight was soon disarmed there,
But the brave Maid would not disarmed be,
But only vented up her vmbriere,
And so did let her goodly visage to appear.
Asn when fair Cynthia, in darkesome night,
Is in a noyous cloud enueloped,
Where she may find the substance thin and light,
Breaks forth her silver beams, and her bright head
Discouers to the world discomfited;
Of the poor traueiler, that went astray,
With thousand blessings she is heried;
Such was the beauty and the shining ray,
With which (...) Britomart gave light unto the day.
And eke those six, which lately with her fought,
Now were disarmd, and did them selves present
Unto her view, and company unsought;
For they all seemed courteous and gent,
And all six brethren, borne of one parent,
Which had them traynd in all ciuilitee,
And goodly taught to tilt and turnament;
Now were they liegmen to this Lady free,
And her knights service ought, to hold of her in see.
The first of them by name Gardante hight,
A jolly person, and of comely view;
The second was Parlante, a bold knight,
And next to him Iocante did ensew;
Basciante did him self most courteous show;
But fierce Bacchante seemd too fell and keen;
And yett in arms Noctante greater grew:
All were fair knights, and goodly well beseene,
But to fair Britomart they all but shadows been.
For she was full of amiable grace,
And manly terror mixed therewithal,
That as the one stird up affections bace,
So the other did men's rash desires apall,
And hold them back, that would in error fall;
As he, that has espide a vermeill Rose,
To which sharp thorns and breres the way forstall,
Dare not for dread his hardy hand expose,
But wishing it far off, his idle wish does lose.
Whom when the Lady saw so fair a wight.
All ignorant of her contrary sex,
(For she her weend a fresh and lusty knight)
She greatly began enamoured to wex,
And with vain thoughts her falsed fancy vex:
Her fickle heart conceived hasty fire,
Like sparks of fire, that fall in sclender flex,
That shortly brent into extreme desire,
And ransackt all her veins with passion entyre.
Eftsoons she grew to great impatience
And into terms of open outrage brust,
That plain discovered her incontinence,
Ne reckt she, who her meaning did mistrust;
For she was given all to fleshly lust,
And poured forth in sensual delight,
That all regard of shame she had discust,
And meet respect of honor putt to flight:
So shameless beauty soon becomes a loathly sight.
Fair Ladies, that to love captiued arre,
And chaste desires do nourish in your mind,
Let not her fault your sweet affections mar,
Ne blott the bounty of all womankind;
Amongst thousands good one wanton Dame to find:
Emongst the Roses grow some wicked weeds;
For this was not to love, but lust inclind;
For love does always bring forth bounteous deeds,
And in each gentle heart desire of honor breeds.
Naught so of love this looser Dame did skill,
But as a cole to kindle fleshly flame,
Giving the bridle to her wanton will,
And treading under foot her honest name:
Such Jove is hate, and such desire is shame.
Still did she roue at her with crafty glaunce
Of her false (...), that at her heart did aim,
And told her meaning in her countenance;
But Britomart dissembled it with ignorance.
Supper was shortly dight and down they satt,
Where they were served with all sumptuous fare,
Whiles fruitful Ceres, and Lyaeus fatt
Pourd out their plenty, without spite or spare:
Naught wanted there, that dainty was and rare;
And aye the cups their bancks did ouerflow,
And aye between the cups, she did prepare
Way to her love, and secret darts did throw;
But Britomart would not such guilfull message know.
So (...) they slaked had the fervent heat
Of appetite with meats of every sort,
The Lady did fair Britomart entreat,
Her to disarme, and with delightful sport
To loose her warlike limbs and strong effort,
But when she mote not thereunto be won,
(For she her sex under that strange (...)
Did use to hide, and plain apparaunce shonne:)
In playner wise to (...) her grieuaunce she begone.
And all attonce discovered her desire
With sighs, and sobs, and plaints, and piteous griese
The outward sparks (...) her (...) burning fire;
Which spent in vain, at last she told her brief,
That but if she did lend her short relief,
And do her comfort, she mote (...) dye.
But the chaste damzell, that had never priefe
Of such malengine and fine (...),
Did easily believe her strong extremity.
Full easy was for her to have belief,
Who by self-feeling of her feeble sex,
And by long trial of the inward grief,
Where with imperious love her heart did vex,
Could judge what pains do loving hearts (...).
Who means no guile, be-guiled (...) shall,
And to fair semblaunce does light faith annexe;
The (...), that knows not the faise fowlers call,
Into his hidden nett full easily does fall.
For thy she (...) not in discourteise (...),
Scorn the saire offer of good will (...);
For great rebuke it is, lone to despise,
Or rudely fdeigne a gentle hearts request;
But with (...), as beseemed (...),
Her entertaynd; nath 'lesse she inly deemd
Her love too light, to woo a wandering guest:
Which she (...), thereby esteemd
That from like inward fire that outward smoke had steemd.
Therewith a while she her flit fancy fedd,
Till she mote win fit time for her desire,
But yet her wound still inward freshly bledd,
And through her bones the false instilled fire
Did spread it self, and venime close inspire.
Tho were the tables taken all away,
And every knight, and every gentle Squire
Began choose his dame with (...) gay,
With whom he meant to make his sport and courtly play.
Some fell to dance, some fell to hazardry,
Some to make love, some to make meryment,
As diverse wits to (...) things apply;
And all the while fair Malecasta bent
Her crafty engines to her close intent.
By this the eternal lamps, wherewith high Jove
Does light the lower world, were half yspent,
And the moist daughters of huge Atlas strove
Into the Ocean deep to drive their weary drove.
High time it seemed then for every wight
Them to betake unto their kindly rest;
Eftesoones long waxen torches weren light,
Unto their bowres to guyden every guest:
Tho when the Britonesse saw all the rest
Avoided quite, she began her self despoile,
And safe committ to her soft fethered nest,
Where through long watch, and late days weary toil,
She soundly slept, and careful thoughts did quite assoile.
Now whenas all the world in silence deep
Y shrouded was, and every mortal wight
Was drowned in the depth of deadly sleep,
Fair Malecasta, whose engrieued spright
Could find no rest in such perplexed plight,
Lightly arose out of her weary bed,
And under the black vele of guilty Night,
Her with a scatlott mantle covered,
That was with gold and Ermines fair enueloped.
Then panting soft, and trembling every joint,
Her fearful feet toward the bower she moved.
Where she for secret purpose did appoint
To lodge the warlike maid unwisely loou'd,
And to her bed approaching, first she proou'd,
Whether she slept or (...), with her soft hand
She softely felt, if any member moved,
And lent (...) weary ear to understand,
If any puff of breath, or sign of sense she fond.
Which whenas none she fond, with easy shifte,
For fear least her unawares she should abrayd,
Th'embroderd quilt she lightly up did lift,
And by her side her self she softly laid,
Of every finest fingers touch affrayd;
Ne any noise she made, ne word she spoke.
But inly sighed. At last the royal Maid
Out of her quiet slomber did awake,
And chaungd her weary side, the better ease to take.
Where feeling one close couched by her side,
She lightly lept out of her filed bed,
And to her weapon ran, in mind to gride
The loathed leachour. But the Dame half dedd
Through suddein fear and ghastly drerihedd,
Did shrieke alowd, that through the house it rong,
And the whole family there with adredd,
Rashly (...) of their rouzed couches sprung,
And to the troubled chamber all in arms did throng.
And those six knights that ladies Champions,
And eke the Redcrosse knight ran to the stownd,
Half armd and half unarmed, with them (...):
Where when confusedly they came, they fownd
Their lady lying on the senseless grownd;
On the other side, they saw the warlike Maid
Al in her snow-white smock, with locks vnbownd,
Threatening the point of her auenging blaed,
That with so troublous terror they were all dismayed.
About their Lady first they flockt arownd,
Whom having laid in comfortable couch,
Shortly they reard out of her frosen swownd;
And after wards they began with foul reproach
To stir up strife and troublous contecke broch:
But by ensample of the last days loss,
None of them rashly durst to her approach,
Ne in so glorious spoil themselves embosse,
Her succourd eke the Champion of the bloody Cross.
But one of those six knights, Gardante hight,
Drew out a deadly bow and arrow keen,
Which forth he sent with felonous despite,
And fell (...) against the virgin sheene:
The mortal steel stayed not, till it was seen
To gore her side, yet was the wound not deep,
But lightly rased her soft silken skin,
That drops of purple blood thereout did weep,
Which did her lilly smock with stains of vermeil steep.
Where with enraged, she fiercely at them flew,
And with her flaming sword about her laid,
That none of them foul mischief could eschew,
But with her dreadful strokes were all dismayed:
Here, there, and every where about her swayd
Her wrathful steel, that none mote it abide;
And eke the Redcrosse knight gave her good aid,
Ayioyning foot to foot, and side to side,
That in short space their foes they have quite terrifyde.
Tho whenas all were put to shameful flight,
The noble Britomartis her arayd,
And her bright arms about her body dight:
For nothing would she longer there be stayed,
Where so loose life, and so vngende trade
Was vsd of knighcs and Ladies seeming gent:
So early ere the gross Earthes gryesy shade,
Was all dispersed out of the firmament,
They took their steeds, and forth upon their journey went
Cant. II.
The Redcrosse knight to Britomart
describes Artegall:
The wondrous myrrhour, by which she
in love with him did fall.
HEre have I cause in men just blame to find,
That in their proper praise too partial be,
And not indifferent to woman kind,
To whom no share in arms and cheualree,
They do impart, ne maken memoree
Of their brave gestes and prowess martial;
Scarce do they spare to one or two or three,
Rowme in their writtes; yet the same writing small
Does all their deeds deface, and dims their glories all,
But by record of antique times I find,
That women wont in wars to bear most sway,
And to all great exploites them selves inclind:
Of which they still the girlond bore away,
Till envious Men fearing their rules decay,
Began coin straight laws to curb their liberty,
Yet since they warlike arms have laid away,
They have excelled in arts and policy,
That now we foolish men that praise gin eke t'enuy.
Of warlike puissaunce in ages spent,
Be thou fair Britomart, whose praise I write,
But of all wisdom be thou precedent,
O sovereign Queen, whose praise I would endyte,
Endite I would as dewtie does excyte;
But ah my rymes to rude and rugged arre,
When in so high an object they do lyte,
And striving, fit to make, I fear do mar:
Thy self thy praises tell, and make them known far.
She traueiling with Guyon by the way,
Of sundry things fair purpose began to find,
T'abridg their journey long, and lingering day;
Among which it fell into that Fairies mind,
To ask this Briton Maid, what uncouth wind,
Brought her into those parts, and what inquest
Made her dissemble her disguised kind:
Fair Lady she him seemd, like Lady dressed,
But fairest knight alive, when armed was her breast.
Thereat she sighing softly, had no power
To speak a while, ne ready answer make,
But with hart-thrilling throbs and bitter stowre,
As if she had a fever fit, did quake,
And every dainty limb with horror shake,
And ever and anon the rosy red,
Flasht through her face, as it had been a flake
Of lightning, through bright heaven fulmined;
At last the passion past she thus him answered.
Fair Sir, I let you weete, that from the hour
I taken was from nourses tender pap,
I have been trained up in warlike stowre,
To tossen spear and shield, and to affrap
The warlike ryder to his most mishap;
Sithence I loathed have my life to lead,
As Ladies wont, in pleasures wanton lap,
To finger the fine needle and nyce thread,
Me lever were with point of foemans spear be dead.
All my delight on deeds of arms is set,
To hunt out perilles and adventures hard,
By sea, by land, where so they may be met,
Only for honor and for high regard,
Without respect of richesse or reward.
For such intent into these parts I came,
Withouten compass, or withouten card,
Far fro my native soil, that is by name
The greater Brytayne, here to seek for praise and fame.
Fame blazed has, that here in Faery land
Do many famous knights and Ladies won,
And many strange adventures to be fond,
Of which great worth and worship may be won;
Which to prove, I this voyage have begone.
But mote I weet of you, right courteous knight,
Tidings of one, that has unto me done
Late foul dishonor and reproachful spite,
The which I seek to wreake, and Arthegall he hight.
The word gone out, she back again would call,
As her repenting so to have missayd,
But that he it vptaking ere the fall,
Her shortly answered; Fair martial Maid
Certes ye misauised been, t'vpbrayd,
A gentle knight with so vnknightly blame:
For weet ye well of all, that ever played
At tilt or tourney, or like warlike game,
The noble Arthegall has ever borne the name.
For thy great wonder were it, if such shame
Should ever enter in his bounteous thought,
Or ever do, that mote deseruen blame:
The noble courage never weeneth ought,
That may unworthy of itself be thought.
Therefore, fair Damzell, be ye well aware,
Least that too far ye have your sorrow sought:
You and your country both I wish welfare,
And honor both; for each of other worthy are.
The royal Maid woxeinly wondrous glad,
To hear her Love so highly magnifyde,
And ioyd that ever she affixed had,
Her heart on knight so goodly glorifyde,
How ever finely she it faind to hyde:
The loving mother, that nine months did bear,
In the dear closett of her painful side,
Her tender babe, it seeing safe appear,
Does not so much rejoice, as she rejoiced theare.
But to occasion him to further talk,
To feed her humor with his pleasing style,
Her list in stryfull terms with him to balke,
And thus replyde, How ever, Sir, ye fyle
Your courteous tongue, his praises to compyle,
It ill beseemes a knight of gentle sort,
Such as ye have him boasted, to beguyle
A simple maid, and work so heinous tort,
In shame of knighthood, as I largely can report.
Let be therefore my vengeance to dissuade,
And read, where I that faytour false may find.
Ah, but if reason fair might you persuade,
To slake your wrath, and mollify your mind,
(Said he) perhaps ye should it better find:
For hardy thing it is, to ween by might,
That man to hard conditions to bind,
Or ever hope to match in equal fight,
Whose prowess paragone saw never living (...).
Ne soothlich is it easy for to read,
Where now on earth, or how he may be fownd;
For he ne wonneth in one certain stead,
But restless walks all the world arownd,
Ay doing things, that to his fame redownd,
Defending Ladies cause, and Orphans right,
Where so he hears, that any does confownd
Them comfortless, through tyranny or might;
So is his sovereign honor raisde to heuens hight.
His feeling words her feeble sense much pleased,
And softly sunck into her molten heart;
Heart that is inly hurt, is greatly eased
With hope of thing, that may allegge his smart,
For pleasing words are like to Magic art,
That does the charmed Snake in slomber lay:
Such secret ease felt gentle Britomart,
Yet list the same efforce with faind gainesay;
So dischord often in Music makes the sweeter lay.
And said, Sir knight, these idle terms forbear,
And since it is uneath to find his haunt,
Tell me some marks, by which he may appear,
If chance I him encounter parauaunt;
For perdy one shall other slay, or daunt:
What shape, what (...), what arms, what steed, what stedd,
And what so else his person most may vaunt?
All which the Redcrosse knight to point aredd,
And him in every part before her fashioned.
Yet him in every part before she knew,
How ever list her now her knowledge feign,
Since him whylome in Brytayne she did view,
To her revealed in a mirrhour plain,
Whereof did grow her first engraffed pain,
Whose root and stalk so bitter yet did taste,
That but the fruit more sweetness did contain,
Her wretched days in dolor she mote waste,
And yield the pray of love to loathsome death at last.
By strange occasion she did him behold,
And much more straungely began to love his sight,
As it in books has written been of old.
In Deheubarth that now South Wales is hight,
What time king Ryence reigned, and dealed right,
The great Magitien Merlin had deuiz'd,
By his deep science, and hell-dreaded might,
A looking glass, right wondrously aguiz'd,
Whose virtues through the wide world soon were solemnized.
It virtue had, to show in perfect sight,
What ever thing was in the world contaynd,
Betwixt the lowest earth and heuens hight,
So that it to the looker appertaynd;
What ever foe had wrought, or friend had faynd,
Therein discovered was, ne ought mote pas,
Ne ought in secret from the same remaynd;
For thy it round and hollow shaped was,
Like to the world it self, and seemd a world of glass.
Who wonders not, that reads so wondrous work?
(...) who does wonder, that has red the Tower,
Wherein th'Aegyptian Phao long did lurk
From all men's view, that none might her discoure,
Yet she might all men view out of her bower?
Great Ptolomaee it for his lemans sake
Ybuilded all of glass, by Magic power,
And also it impregnable did make;
Yet when his love was false, he with a peaze it brake.
Such was the glassy globe that Merlin made,
And gave unto king Ryence for his guard,
That never foes his kingdom might invade,
But he it knew at home before he hard
Tidings thereof, and so them still debarred.
It was a famous Present for a Prince,
And worthy work of infinite reward,
That treasons could bewray and foes convince;
Happy this Realm, had it remained ever since.
One day it fortuned, fair Britomart
Into her fathers closet to repair;
For nothing he from her reserved apart,
Being his only daughter and his hair:
Where when she had espyde that mirrhour fair,
Her self awhile therein she vewd in vain;
Tho her auizing of the virtues rare,
Which thereof spoken were, she began again
Her to bethink of, that (...) to her self pertain.
But as it falls, in the gentlest hearts
Imperious Love has highest set his throne,
And tyrannizeth in the bitter smarts
Of them, that to him buxome are and prone:
So thought this Maid (as maidens use to done)
Whom fortune for her husband would allot,
Not that she lusted after any one;
For she was pure from blame of sinful blot,
Yet wist her life at last must lincke in that same knot.
Eftsoons there was presented to her eye
A comely knight, all armed in complete wize,
Through whose bright ventayle lifted up on hye
His manly face, that did his foes agrize,
And friends to terms of gentle truce entize,
Looked forth, as Phoebus face out of the (...),
Betwixt two shady mountains does arize;
Portly his person was, and much increast
Through his Heroicke grace, and honorable gest.
His crest was covered with a couchant Hownd,
And all his armor seemd of antique mould,
But wondrous massy and assured sownd,
And round about yfretted all with gold,
In which there written was with cyphres old,
Achilles arms, which Arthogall did win.
And on his shield enueloped seuenfold
He bore a crowned little Ermilin,
That decked the azure field with her fair pouldred skin.
The Damzell well did view his Personage,
And liked well, ne further fastened not,
But went her way; ne her (...) age
Did ween, unawares, that her unlucky lot
Lay hidden in the (...) of the pot;
Of hurt vnwist most danger does redound:
But the false Archer, which that arrow shot
So slyly, that she did not feel the wound,
Did smyle full smoothly at her weetlesse woeful stound.
Thenceforth the fether in her lofty crest,
Ruffed of love, began lowly to avail,
And her proud portaunce, and her princely gest,
With which she erst tryumphed, now did quail:
Sad, solemn, sour, and full of fancies frail
She woxe; yet wist she nether how, nor why,
She wist not, silly Maid, what she did aile,
Yet wist, she was not well at ease perdy,
Yet thought it was not love, but some melancholy.
So soon as Night had with her pallid hew
Defaste the beauty of the shyning sky,
And reft from men the worlds desired view,
She with her Nourse adowne to sleep did lie;
But sleep full far away from her did fly:
In stead thereof sad sighs, and sorrows deep
Kept watch and ward about her warily,
That naught she did but wayle, and often steep
Her dainty couch with tears, which closely she did (...).
And if that any drop of slombring rest
Did chance to still into her weary spright,
When feeble nature felt her self oppressed,
Straight way with dreams, and with fantastic sight
Of dreadful things the same was put to flight,
That often out of her bed she did astart,
As one with view of ghastly feends affright:
Tho began she to renew her former smart,
And think of that fair visage, written in her heart.
One night, when she was tossed with such unrest,
Her aged Nourse, whose name was Glauce hight,
Feeling her leap out of her loathed nest,
Betwixt her feeble arms her quickly keight,
And down again her in her warm bed dight,
Ah my dear daughter, ah my dearest dread,
What uncouth fit (said she) what evil plight
Has thee oppressed, and with sad dreary head
Changed thy lively cheer, and living made thee dead?
For not of naught these suddein ghastly fears
All night afflict thy natural repose,
And all the day, when as thine equal pears
Their fit disports with fair delight do chose,
Thou in dull corners do thy self enclose,
Ne tastest Princes pleasures, ne do spread
Abroad thy fresh youths fairest flower, but lose
Both leaf and fruit, both too untimely shed,
As one in wilful bale for ever buried.
The time, that mortal men their weary cares
Do lay away, and all wild beasts do rest,
And every river eke his course forbeares,
Then does this wicked evil thee infest,
And riue with thousand throbs thy thrilled breast;
Like an huge Aetn' of deep engulfed gryefe,
Sorrow is heaped in thy hollow chest,
Whence forth it breaks in sighs and anguish ryfe,
As smoke and sulphur mingled with confufed strife.
Ay me, how much I fear, least love it be,
But if that love it be, as sure I read
By known signs and passions, which I see,
Be it worthy of thy race and royal sead,
Then I auow by this (...) sacred head
Of my dear foster child, to ease thy grief,
And win thy will: Therefore away do dread;
For death nor danger from thy dew relief
Shall me debar. tell me therefore my liefest liefe.
So having said, her twixt her arms twain
She straightly straynd, and colled tenderly,
And every trembling joint, and every vain
She softly felt, and rubbed busily,
To do the frosen cold away to fly;
And her fair deawy eyes with kisses dear
She often did bathe, and often again did dry;
And ever her importund, not to fear
To let the secret of her heart to her appear.
The Damzell (...), and then thus fearfully;
Ah Nurse, what needs thee to eke my pain?
Is not enough, that I alone do dye.
But it must doubled be with death of twain?
For naught for me, but death there does remain.
O daughter dear (said she) despeire no whit,
For never sore, but might a salve obtain:
That blinded God, which has ye blindly smit,
Another arrow has your lovers heart to hit.
But mine is not (quoth she) like other wownd;
For which no reason can find remedy.
Was never such, but (...) the like be fownd,
(Said she) and though no reason may apply
Salve to your sore, yet love can higher stye,
Then reasons reach, and often has wonders done.
But neither God of love, nor God of sky
Can do (said she) that, which cannot be done.
Things often impossible (quoth she) seem ere begone.
These idle words (said she) do naught aswage
My stubborn (...), but more annoiaunce breed.
For no no usual fire, no usual rage
Yt is, O Nourse, which on my life does feed,
And sucks the blood, which from my heart does bleed.
But since thy faithful zele lets me not hyde
My crime, (if crime it be) I will it reed.
Nor Prince, nor pere it is, whose love has gryde
My feeble breast of late, and launched this wound wide.
Nor man it is, nor other living wight;
For then some hope I might unto me draw,
But the only shade and semblant of a knight,
Whose shape or person yet I never saw,
Has me subjected to loves (...) law:
The same one day, as me misfortune led,
I in my fathers wondrous mirrhour saw,
And pleased with that seeming goodly-hed,
Unawares the hidden hook with bait I swallowed.
Since it has infixed faster hold
Within my bleeding bowels, and so sore
Now ranckleth in this same frail fleshly mould,
That all mine entrails flow with poisnous gore,
And th'vlcer grows daily more and more;
Ne can my ronning sore find remedee,
Other then my hard fortune to deplore,
And languish as the leaf fallen from the tree,
Till death make one end of my (...) and miseree.
Daughter (said she) what needye be dismayed,
Or why make ye such Monster of your mind?
Of much more uncouth thing I was affrayd;
Of filthy lust, contrary unto kind:
But this affection nothing (...) I fi nde;
For who with reason can you aye reprove,
To love the semblaunt pleasing most your mind,
And yield your heart, whence ye cannot remove?
No guilt in you, but in the tyranny of love.
Not so the Arabian Myrrh did set her mind,
Not so did Biblis spend her pining heart,
But loved their native flesh against al kind,
And to their purpose used wicked art:
Yet played Pasiphae a more monstrous part,
That loved a Bull, and learnd a beast to be;
Such shameful lusts who loathes not, which depart
From course of nature and of (...)?
Sweet love such lewdnes bands from his fair co^panee.
But thine my Dear (welfare thy heart my dear)
Though strange beginning had, yet fixed is
On one, that worthy may perhaps appear;
And certes seems bestowed not amiss:
Joy there of have thou and eternal blis.
With that vpleaning on her elbow weak,
Her alablaster breast she soft did kis,
Which all that while she felt to pant and quake,
As it an Earthquake were, at last she thus bespake.
Beldame, your words do work me little ease;
For though my love be not so lewdly bent,
As those ye blame, yet may it naught appease
My raging smart, ne ought my flame relent,
But rather does my helpelesse grief augment.
For they, how ever shameful and unkind,
Yet did possess their horrible intent:
Short end of sorrows they thereby did find;
So was their fortune good, though wicked were their mind.
But wicked fortune mine, though mind be good,
Can have no end, nor hope of my desire,
But feed on shadows, whiles I die for food,
And like a shadow wexe, whiles with entire
Affection, I do languish and expire.
I fonder, then Cephisus foolish child,
Who having vewed in a fountain shere
His face, was with the love thereof beguyld;
I fonder love a shade, the body far exyld.
Naught like (quoth she) for that same wretched boy
Was of him self the idle Paramoure;
Both love and lover, without hope of joy,
For which he faded to a watery flower.
But better fortune thine, and better hour,
Which love the shadow of a warlike knight;
No shadow, but a body has in power:
That body, wheresoever that it light,
May learned be by ciphers, or by Magic might.
But if thou may with reason yet repress
The growing evil, ere it strength have got,
And thee abandond wholly do possess,
Against it strongly strive, and yield thee not,
Til thou in open field adowne be smott.
But if the passion master thy frail might,
So that needs love or death must be thy lot,
Then I auow to thee, by wrong or right
To compass thy desire, and find that loved knight.
Her cheerful words much cheard the feeble spright
Of the sick virgin, that her down she laid
In her warm bed to sleep, if that she might;
And the old-woman carefully displayed
The clothes about her round with busy aid,
So that at last a little creeping sleep
Surprisd her sense: She therewith well apayd,
The dronken lamp down in the oil did steep,
And set her by to watch, and set her by to weep.
Early the morrow next, before that day
His joyous face did to the world reuele,
They both vprose, and took their ready way
Unto the Church, their prayers to appele,
With great devotion, and with little zel e:
For the fair Damzel from the holy hearse
Her loue-sicke heart to other thoughts did steal;
And that old Dame said many an idle verse,
Out of her daughters heart fond fancies to reuerse.
Returned home, the royal Infant (...)
Into her former fit; for why no power,
Nor guidaunce of her self in her did dwell.
But th'aged Nourse her calling to her bower,
Had gathered Rue, and Sauine, and the flower
Of Camphora, and Calamint, and Dill,
All which she in a (...) Pot did pour,
And to the brim with Colt wood did it fill,
And many drops of milk and blood through it did spill.
Then taking thrice three hears from of her head,
Then trebly breaded in a threefold (...),
And round about the Pots mouth, bound the thread,
And after having whispered a space
Certain sad words, with hollow voice and bace,
She to the virgin said; thrice said she itt;
Come daughter come, come; spit upon my face,
Spitt thrice upon me, thrice upon me spitt;
Th'vneuen number for this business is most fit.
That said, her rownd about she from her turned,
She turned her contrary to the Sun,
Thrife she her turned contrary, and returned,
All contrary, for she the right did shun,
And ever what she did, was straight undone.
So thought she to undo her daughters love:
But love, that is in gentle breast begone,
No idle charms so lightly may remove,
That well can witness, who by trial it does prove.
Ne ought it mote the noble Maid avail,
Ne slake the fury of her cruel flame,
But that she still did waste, and still did wayle,
That through long languour, and hart-burning brame
She shortly like a pyned ghost became,
Which long has waited by the Stygian strond.
That when old Glauce saw, for fear least blame
Of her miscarriage should in her be fond,
She wist not how t'amend, nor how it to withstond.
Cant. III.
Merlin bewrayes to Britomart,
The state of Arthegall.
And shows the famous Progeny
Which from them springen shall.
MOst sacred fire, that burnest mightily
In living breasts, ykindled first above,
Emongst the eternal spheres and lamping sky,
And thence pourd into men, which men call Love;
Not that same, which does base affections move
In brutish minds, and filthy Just inflame,
But that sweet fit, that does true beauty love,
And choseth virtue for his dearest Dame.
Whence spring all noble deeds and never dying same:
Well did Antiquity a God thee deem,
That over mortal minds have so great might,
To order them, as best to thee does seem,
And all their actions to direct aright;
The fatal purpose of divine foresight,
Thou do effect in destined descents,
Through deep impression of thy secret might,
And stirredst up th'Heroes high intents,
Which the late world admyres for wo^drous monime^ts
But thy dredd darts in none do triumph more,
Ne brauer proof in any, of thy power
Shew'dst thou, then in this royal Maid of yore,
Making her seek an unknown Paramoure,
From the worlds end, through many a bitter stowre:
From whose two loins thou afterward did raise
Most famous fruits of matrimonial bower,
Which through the earth have spredd their living praise,
That fame in tromp of gold eternally displayes.
Begin then, O my dearest sacred Dame,
Daughter of Phoebus and of Memory,
That do ennoble with immortal name
The warlike Worthies, from antiquitye,
In thy great volume of Eternitye:
Begin, O Clio, and recount from hence
My glorious Soueraines goodly auncestrye,
Till that by dew degrees and long protense,
Thou have it lastly brought unto her Excellence.
Full many ways within her troubled mind,
Old Glauce cast, to cure this Ladies grief:
Full many ways she sought, but none could find,
Nor herbs, nor charms, nor counsel that is chief,
And choicest medicine for sick hearts relief:
For thy great care she took, and greater fear,
Least that it should her turn to foul repriese,
And sore reproach, when so her father dear
Should of his dearest daughters hard misfortune hear.
At last she her auisde, that he, which made
That mirrhour, wherein the sick Damsel
So straungely vewed her strange lovers shade,
To weet, the learned Merlin, well could tell,
Under what coast of heaven the man did dwell,
And by what means his love might best be wrought:
For though beyond the Africa Ismael,
Or th'Indian Peru he were, she thought
Him forth through infinite endeavor to have sought.
Forth with them selves disguising both in strange
And base atyre, that none might them bewray,
To Maridunum, that is now by change
Of name Cayr-Merdin called, they took their way:
There the wise Merlin whylome wont (they say)
To make his won, low underneath the ground,
In a deep delue, far from the view of day,
That of no living wight he mote be found,
When so he cou^seld with his sprights enco^past round.
And if thou ever happen that same way
To traueill, go to see that dreadful place:
It is an hideous hollow cave (they say)
Under a Rock that lies a little space
From the swift, Barry, tombling down apace,
Emongst the woody hills of Dyneuowre:
But dare thou not, I charge, in any case,
To enter into that same balefull Bower,
For fear the cruel Feendes should thee unawares deuowre.
But standing high aloft, low lay thine ear,
And there such ghastly noise of iron chains,
And brazen Caudrons thou shall rombling hear,
Which thousand sprights with long enduring pains
Do toss, that it will stonn thy feeble brains,
And oftentimes great groans, and grievous stownds,
When too huge toil and labor them constraines:
And oftentimes loud strokes, and ringing sowndes
From under that deep Rock most horribly rebowndes.
The cause some say is this: A little while
Before that Merlin did, he did intend,
A brazen wall in compass to compyle
About Cairmardin, and did it commend
Unto these Sprights, to bring to perfect end.
During which work the Lady of the Lake,
Whom long he loved, for him in have did send,
Who thereby forced his workmen to forsake,
Them bownd till his return, their labor not to slake.
In the mean time through that false Ladies train,
He was surprisd, and buried under bear,
Ne ever to his work returned again:
Nath'lesse those feends may not their work forbear,
So greatly his commandment they fear,
But there do toil and traueile day and night,
Until that brazen wall they up do rear:
For Merlin had in Magic more insight,
Then ever him before or after living wight.
For he by words could call out of the sky
Both Sun and Moon, and make them him obey:
The Land to sea, and sea to maineland dry,
And darksom night he eke could turn to day:
Huge hosts of men he could alone dismay,
And hosts of men of meanest things could frame,
When so him list his enemies to fray:
That to this day for terror of his fame,
The feends do quake, when any him to them does name.
And sooth, men say that he was not the son
Of mortal Sire, or other living wight,
But wondrously begotten, and begone
By false illusion of a guilefull Spright,
On a fair Lady Nonne, that whilome hight
Matilda, daughter to Pubidius,
Who was the Lord of Mathraual by right,
And coosen unto king Ambrosius:
Whence he endued was with skill so merueilous.
They here ariuing, staid a while without,
Ne durst adventure rashly in to wend,
But of their first intent began make new dout
For dread of danger, which it might portend:
Until the hardy Maid (with love to friend)
First entering, the dreadful Mage there fownd
Deep busied bout work of wondrous end,
And writing strange characters in the grownd,
With which the stubborn seendes he to his service bownd.
He naught was moved at their entrance bold:
For of their coming well he wist before,
Yet list them bid their business to unfold,
As if ought in this world in secret store
Were from him hidden, or unknown of yore.
Then Glauce thus, let not it thee offend,
That we thus rashly through thy darksom door,
Unawares have pressed: for either fatal end,
Or other mighty cause us two did hither send.
He bad tell on; And then she thus began.
Now have three Moons with borrowd brothers light,
Thrice shined fair, and thrice seemd dim and wan,
Since a sore evil, which this virgin bright
Tormenteth, and does plonge in doleful plight,
First rooting took; but what thing it mote be,
Or whence it sprung, I can not read aright:
But this I read, that but if remedee,
Thou her afford, full shortly I her dead shall see.
Therewith th'Enchaunter softly began to smyle
At her smooth speeches, weeting inly well,
That she to him dissembled (...) guyle,
And to her said, Beldame, by that ye tell,
More need ofleach-crafte has your Damozell,
Then of my skill: who help may have elsewhere,
In vain seeks wonders out of Magic spell.
The Old woman wox half blanck, those words to hear;
And yet was loath to let her purpose plain appear.
And to him said, If any leaches skill,
Or other learned means could have redrest
This my dear daughters deep engraffed ill,
Certes I should be loath thee to molest:
But this sad evil, which does her infest,
Does course of natural cause far exceed,
And housed is within her hollow breast,
That either seems some cursed witches deed,
Or evil spright, that in her does such torment breed.
The wisard could no longer bear her board,
But brusting forth in laughter, to her said;
Glauce, what needs this colorable word,
To cloak the cause, that has it self bewrayd?
Ne ye fair Britomartis, thus arayd,
More hidden are, then Sun in cloudy vele;
Whom thy good fortune, having fate obayd,
Has hither brought, for succor to appele:
The which the powers to thee are pleased to reuele.
The doubtful Maid, seeing her self descryde,
Was all abasht, and her pure yuory
Into a clear Carnation suddeine did;
As fair Aurora rising hastily,
Does by her blushing tell, that she did lie
All night in old Tithonus frosen bed,
Whereof she seems ashamed inwardly.
But her old Nourse was naught dishartened,
But vauntage made of that, which Merlin had ared.
And said, Since then thou know all our grief,
(For what do not thou know?) of grace I pray,
Pity our playnt, and yield us meet relief.
With that the Prophet still awhile did stay,
And then his spirit thus began forth display;
Most noble Virgin, that by fatal lore
Have learned to love, let no whit thee dismay
The hard begin, that meets thee in the door,
And with sharp fits thy tender heart oppresses sore.
For so must all things excellent begin,
And eke enrooted deep must be that Tree,
Whose big embodied branches shall not lin,
Till they to heuens hight forth stretched be.
For from thy womb a famous Progenee
Shall spring, out of the ancient Trojan blood,
Which shall revive the sleeping memoree
Of those same antique Peers, the heuens brood,
Which Greek and Asian rivers stained with their blood.
Renowned kings, and sacred Emperors,
Thy fruitful Offspring, shall from thee descend;
Brave Captains, and most mighty warriors,
That shall their conquests through all lands extend,
And their decayed kingdoms shall amend:
The feeble Britons, broken with long war,
They shall vpreare, and mightily defend
Against their foreign foe, that commes from far,
Till universal peace compound all civil jar.
It was not, Britomart, thy wandering eye,
Glauncing unawares in charmed looking glass,
But the straight course of heavenly destiny,
Led with eternal providence, that has
Guyded thy glaunce, to bring his will to pas:
Ne is thy fate, ne is thy fortune ill,
To louc the prowest knight, that ever was.
Therefore submit thy ways unto his will,
And do by all'dew means thy destiny fulfill.
But read (said Glauce) thou Magitian
What means shall she out seek, or what ways take?
How shall she know, how shall she find the man?
Or what needs her to toil, since fates can make
Way for themselves, their purpose to partake?
Then Merlin thus, Indeed the fates are firm,
And may not shrinck, though all the world do (...):
Yet ought men's good endeavors them confirm,
And guide the heavenly causes to their constant term.
The man whom heavens have ordaynd to be
The spouse of Britomart, is Arthegall:
He wonneth in the land of Fayeree,
Yet is no Fary borne, ne sib at all
To Elfes, but sprung of seed terrestrial,
And whylome by false Faries stolen away,
Whiles yet in infant cradle he did crall;
Ne other to himself is known this day,
But that he by an Elfe was gotten of a Fay.
But sooth he is the son of Gorlois,
And brother unto Cador Cornish king,
And for his warlike feats renowned is,
From where the day out of the sea does spring,
Until the closure of the Evening.
From thence, him firmly bound with faithful band,
To this his native soil thou back shall bring,
Strongly to aid his country, to withstand
The power of foreign Paynims, which invade thy land.
Great aid thereto his mighty puissaunce,
And dreaded name shall give in that sad day:
Where also proof of thy prow valiaunce
Thou then shall make, to increase thy lovers pray.
Long time ye both in arms shall bear great sway,
Till thy wombes burden thee from them do call,
And his last fate him from thee take away,
Too rathe cut off by practice criminal,
Of secret foes, that him shall make in mischief fall.
With thee yet shall he leave for memory
Of his late puissaunce, his image dead,
That living him in all actiuity
To thee shall represent. He from the head
Of his coosen Constantius without dread
Shall take the crown, that was his fathers right,
And therewith crown himself in the others stead:
Then shall he issew forth with dreadful might,
Against his Saxon foes in bloody field to fight.
Like as a Lion, that in drowsy cave
Has long time slept, himself so shall he shake,
And coming forth, shall spread his banner brave
Over the troubled South, that it shall make
The warlike Mertians for fear to quake:
Thrice shall he fight with them, and twice shall win,
But the third time shall fair accordaunce make:
And if he then with victory can lin,
He shall his days with peace bring to his earthly In.
His son, hight Vortipore, shall him succeed
In kingdom, but not in felicity;
Yet shall he long time war with happy speed,
And with great honor many batteills try:
But at the last to th importunity
Of froward fortune shall be forced to yield.
But his son Malgo shall full mightily
Avenge his fathers loss, with spear and shield,
And his proud foes discomfit in victorious field.
Behold the man, and tell me Britomart,
If ay more goodly creature thou did see;
How like a Gyaunt in each manly part
Bears he himself with portly maiestee,
That one of the old Heroes seems to be:
He the six Islands, comprouinciall
In ancient times unto great Britainee,
Shall to the same reduce, and to him call
Their sundry kings to do their homage several.
All which his son Careticus awhile
Shall well defend, and Saxons power suppress,
Until a stranger king from unknown soil
Arriving, him with multitude oppress;
Great Gormond, having with huge mightiness
Ireland (...), and therein fixed his throne,
Like a swift Otter, fell through emptiness,
Shall ouerswim the sea with many one
Of his Norueyses, to assist the Britons fone.
He in his fury all shall ouerronne,
And holy Church with faithless hands deface,
That thy sad people utterly fordonne,
Shall to the utmost mountains fly apace:
Was never so great waste in any place,
Nor so foul outrage done by living men:
For all thy Cities they shall sack and race,
And the green grass, that grows, they shall bren,
That even the wild beast shall die in starued den.
Whiles thus thy Britons (...) in languour pine,
Proud Etheldred shall from the North arise,
Serving the ambitious will of Augustine,
And passing Dee with hardy enterprise,
Shall back repulse the valiant Brockwell twice,
And Bangor with massacred Martyrs fill;
But the third time shall rue his foolhardise:
For Cadwan pitying his peoples ill,
Shall stoutly him defeat, and thousand Saxons kill.
But after him, Cadwallin mightily
On his son Edwin all those wrongs shall wreake;
Ne shall avail the wicked sorcery
Of falfe (...), his purposes to break,
But him shall slay, and on a gallows bleak
Shall give th'enchaunter his unhappy hire:
Then shall the Britons, late dismayed and weak,
From their long vassallage gin to respire,
And on their Paynim foes avenge their ranckled ire.
Ne shall he yet his wrath so mitigate,
Till both the sons of Edwin he have slain,
Offricke and Osricke, twins unfortunate,
Both slain in battle upon Layburne plain,
Together with the king of Louthiane,
Hight Adin, and the king of Orkeny,
Both joint partakers of their fatal pain:
But Penda, fearful of like desteny,
Shall yield him self his liegeman, and swear fealty.
Him shall he make his fatal Instrument,
T'afflict the other Saxons (...);
He marching forth with fury insolent
Against the good king Oswald, who indewd
With heavenly power, and by Angels reskewd,
Al holding crosses in their hands on hye,
Shall him defeat (...) blood imbrewd:
Of which, that field for endless memory,
Shall Hevenfield be called to all posterity.
Whereat Cadwallin wroth, shall forth issew,
And an huge host into Northumber lead,
With which he godly Oswald shall subdew,
And crown with martiredome his sacred head.
Whose brother Oswin, daunted with like dread,
With price of silver shall his kingdom buy,
And Penda seeking him adowne to tread,
Shall tread adowne, and do him fowly dye,
But shall with guists his Lord Cadwallin pacify.
Then shall Cadwallin die, and then the rain
Of Britons eke with him attonce shall dye;
Ne shall the good Cadwallader with pain,
Or power, be hable it to remedy,
When the full time prefixed by destiny,
Shall Be expird of Britons regiment.
For heaven it self shall their success envy,
And them with plagues and murrins pestilent
Consume, till all their warlike puissaunce be spent.
Yet after all these sorrows, and huge hills
Of dying people, during eight years space,
Cadwallader not yielding to his ills,
From Armoricke, where long in wretched case
He lived, retourning to his native place,
Shall Be by vision staide from his intent:
Forth'heauens have decreed, to displace
The Britons, for their sins dew punishment,
And to the Saxons ouer-give their government.
Then woe, and woe, and everlasting woe,
Be to the Briton babe, that shall be borne,
To live in thraldom of his fathers foe;
Late king, now captive, late lord, now forlorn,
The worlds reproach, the cruel victors scorn,
Banished from princely bower to wasteful wood:
O who shall help me to lament, and mourn
The royal seed, the antique Trojan blood,
Whose empire longer here, then ever any stood.
The Damzell was full deep empassioned,
Both for his grief, and for her peoples sake,
Whose future woes so plain he fashioned,
And sighing sore, at length him thus bespake;
Ah but will heuens fury never slake,
Nor vengeance huge relent it self at last?
Will not long misery late mercy make,
But shall their name for ever be defaste,
And quite from the earth their memory be raste?
Nay but the term (said he) is limited,
That in this thraldom Britons shall abide,
And the just revolution measured,
That they as Strangers shall be notifide.
For twice four hundredth years shall be supplide,
Ere they unto their former rule restored shall be.
And their importune fates all satisfide:
Yet during this their most obscuritee,
Their beams shall often break forth, that men the^ fair may see.
For Rhodcricke, whose surname shall be Great,
Shall of him self a brave ensample show,
That Saxon kings his friendship shall entreat;
And Howell Dha shall goodly well indew
The saluage minds with skill of just and true;
Then Griffyth Conan also shall up rear
His dreaded head, and the old sparks renew
Of native courage, that his foes shall fear,
Least back again the kingdom he from them should bear.
Ne shall the Saxons selves all peaceably
Enjoy the crown, which they from Britons won
First ill, and after ruled wickedly:
For ere two hundred years be full outronne,
There shall a Raven far from rising Sun,
With his wide wings upon them fiercely fly,
And bid his faithless chickens oueronne
The fruitful plains, and with fell cruelty,
In their avenge, tread down the victors surquedry.
Yet shall a third both these, and thine subdew;
There shall a Lion from the sea-bord wood
Of Neustria come roaring, with a crew
Of (...) whelps, his battailous bold brood,
Whose claws were newly dipped in cruddy blood,
That from the Daniske Tyrants head shall rend
Th'vsurped crown, as if that he were wood,
And the spoil of the country conquered
Emongst his young ones shall divide with bountyhed.
Tho when the term is full accomplishid,
There shall a spark of fire, which has long-while
Been in his ashes raked up, and hid,
Be freshly kindled in the fruitful I Will
Of Mona, where it lurked in exile;
Which shall break forth into bright burning flame,
And reach into the house, that bears the style
Of royal majesty and sovereign name;
So shall the Briton blood their crown again reclame.
(...) eternal union shall be made
Between the nations different before,
And sacred Peace shall lovingly persuade
The warlike minds, to learn her goodly lore,
And civil arms to exercise no more:
Then shall a royal Virgin rain, which shall
Stretch her white rod over the Belgicke shore,
And the great Castle smite so sore with all,
That it shall make him shake, and shortly learn to fall.
But yet the end is not. There Merlin stayed,
As ouercomen of the spirits power,
Or other ghastly spectacle dismayed,
That secretly he saw, yet note discoure:
Which suddein fit, and half extatick stoure
When the two fearful women saw, they grew
Greatly confused in behaueoure;
At last the fury past, to former hew
She turned again, and cheerful looks did show.
Then, when them selves they well instructed had
Of all, that needed them to be inquird,
They both conceiving hope of comfort glad,
With lighter hearts unto their home retird;
Where they in secret counsel close conspird,
How to effect so hard an enterprise,
And to possess the purpose they desird:
Now this, now that twixt them they did deuize,
And diverse plots did frame, to mask in strange disguise.
At last the Nourse in her foolhardy wit
Conceiud abold devise, and thus bespake;
Daughter, I deem that counsel aye most fit,
That of the time does dew advantage take;
Ye see that good king Other now does make
Strong war upon the Paynim brethren, hight
Octa and Oza, whom he lately brake
Beside Cayr Verolame, in victorious fight,
That now all Britany does burn in arms bright.
That therefore naught our passage may empeach,
Let us in feigned arms our selves disguize,
And our weak hands (need makes good scholars) teach.
The dreadful spear and shield to exercize:
Ne certes daughter that same (...) wize
I ween, would you misseeme; for ye been tall,
And large of limb, t'atchieue an hard emprize,
Ne ought ye want, but skill, which practice small
Will bring, and shortly make you a maid Martial.
And sooth, it ought your courage much inflame,
To hear so often, in that royal house,
From whence to none inferior ye came:
Bards tell of many women valorous,
Which have full many feats aduenturous,
Performd, in paragone of proudest men:
The bold Bunduca, whose victorious
Exployts made Rome to quake, stout Guendolen,
Renowned Martia, and redoubted Emmilen.
And that, which more then all the rest may sway
Late days ensample, which these eyes beheld,
In the last field before Meneuia
Which Other with those foreign Pagans held,
I saw a Saxon Virgin, the which feld
Great Vlfin thrice upon the bloodly plain,
And had not Carados her hand withheld
From rash revenge, she had him surely slain,
Yet Carados himself from her escapt with pain.
Ah read, (quoth Britomart) how is she hight?
Fair Angela (quoth she) men do her call,
No whit less fair, then terrible in fight:
She has the leading of a Martial
And mighty people, dreaded more then all
The other Saxons, which do for her sake
And love, themselves of her name Angles call.
Therefore fair Infant her ensample make
Unto thy self, and equal courage to thee take.
Her hearty words so deep into the mind
Of the young Damzell sunk, that great desire
Of warlike arms in her forth with they tynd,
And generous stout courage did inspyre,
That she (...), vnweeting to her Sire,
Aduent'rous knighthood on her self to don,
And counseld with her Nourse, her Maids attire
To turn into a massy habergeon,
And bad her all things put in readiness anon.
The Old woman naught, that needed, did omit;
But all things did conveniently puruay:
It fortuned (so time their turn did fit)
A band of Britons ryding on forray
Few days before, had gotten a great pray
Of Saxon goods, emongst the which was seen
A goodly Armor, and full rich array,
Which longed to Angela, the Saxon Queen,
All fretted round with gold, and goodly well beseene.
The same, with all the other ornaments,
King Ryence caused to be hanged (...)
In his chief Church, for endless moniments
Of his success and gladfull victory:
Of which her self auising readily,
In th'euening late old Glauce thither led
Fair Britomart, and that same Armory
Down taking, her therein appareled,
Well as she might, and with brave bauldrick garnished.
Beside those arms there stood a mighty spear,
Which Bladud made by Magic art of yore,
And vsd the same in batteill aye to bear;
Since which it had been here preserved in store,
For his great virtues proved long before:
For never wight so fast in sell could sit,
But him perforce unto the ground it bore:
Both spear she took, and shield, which hong by it;
Both spear and shield of great power, for her purpose fit
Thus when she had the virgin all arayd,
Another harness, which did hang thereby,
About her self she dight, that the young Maid
She might in equal arms accompany,
And as her Squyre (...) her carefully:
Tho to their ready Steedes they clombe full light,
And through back ways, that none might the^ espy,
Covered with secret cloud of silent night,
Themselves they forth conuaid, and passed forward right.
Ne rested they, till that to Faery land
They came, as Merlin them directed late:
Where meeting with this Redcrosse knight, she fond
Of diverse things discourses to dilate,
But most of Arthegall, and his estate.
At last their ways so fell, that they mote part:
Then each to other well affectionate,
Friendship professed with unfeigned heart,
The Redcrosse knight diuerst, but forth rode Britomart.
Cant. IIII.
Bold Marinell of Britomart,
Is thrown on the Rich strond:
Fair Florimell of Arthure is
Long followed, but not fond.
WHere is the Antique glory now become,
That whylome wont in women to appear?
Where be the brave atchieuements done by some?
Where be the batteilles, where the shield and spear,
And all the conquests, which them high did rear,
That matter made for famous Poets verse,
And boastfull men so often abasht to hear?
Been they all dead, and laid in doleful hearse?
Or done they only sleep, and shall again reuerse?
If they be dead, then woe is me therefore:
But if they sleep, O let them soon awake:
For all too long I burn with envy sore,
To hear the warlike feats, which Homere spoke
Of bold Penthesilee, which made a lake
Of Greekish blood so often in Trojan plain;
But when I read, how stout Debora struck
Proud Sisera, and how Camill' has slain
The huge Orsilochus, I swell with great disdain.
Yet these, and all that else had puissaunce,
Cannot with noble Britomart compare,
As Well for glory of great valiaunce,
As for pure chastity and virtue rare,
That all her goodly deeds do well declare.
Well worthy stock, from which the branches sprung,
That in late years so fair a blossom bare,
As thee, O Queen, the matter of my song,
Whose lignage from this Lady I derive along.
Who when through speeches with the Redcrosse knight,
She learned had the estate of Arthegall,
And in each point her self informd aright,
A friendly league of love perpetual
She with him bound, and Conge took withal.
Then he forth on his journey did proceed,
To seek adventures, which mote him befall,
And win him worship through his warlike deed,
Which always of his pains he made the chiefest meed
But Britomart kept on her former course,
Ne ever dofte her arms, but all the way
Grew pensive through that amarous discourse,
By which the Redcrosse knight did erst (...)
Her lovers shape, and cheualrous array;
A thousand thoughts she fashiond in her mind,
And in her seigning fancy did pourtray
Him such, as fittest he for love could find,
Wife, warlike, personable, courteous, and kind.
With such selfe-pleasing thoughts her wound she fedd,
And thought so to beguile her grievous smart;
But so her smart was much more grievous bredd,
And the deep wound more deep engord her heart,
That naught but death her dolor mote depart.
So forth she rode without repose or rest,
Searching all lands and each remotest part,
Following the guy dance of her blinded guest,
Till that to the seacoast at length she her addressed.
There she alighted from her light-foot beast,
And sitting down upon the rocky shore,
Badd her old Squyre unlace her lofty creast;
Tho having vewd a while the surges hoar,
That against the craggy clifts did loudly rore,
And in their raging surquedry disdaynd,
That the fast earth affronted them so sore,
And their devouring couetize restraynd,
Thereat she sighed deep, and after thus complaynd.
Huge sea of sorrow, and tempestuous grief,
Wherein my feeble bark is tossed long,
Far from the hoped haven of relief,
Why do thy cruel billows beat so strong,
And thy moist mountains each on others throng,
Threatening to swallow up my fearful life?
O do thy cruel wrath and spightfull wrong
At length allay, and stint thy stormy strife,
Which in thy troubled bowels reigns, and rages ryfe.
For else my feeble vessel crazd, and cracked
Through thy strong buffets and outrageous blows,
Cannot endure, but needs it must be wrackt
On the rough rocks, or on the sandy shallowes,
The whiles that love it steres, and fortune rows;
Love my lewd Pilott has a restless mind
And fortune Boteswaine no assurance knows,
But sail withouten stars, against tide and wind:
How can they other do, since both are bold and blind?
Thou God of winds, that raignest in the seas,
That raignest also in the Continent,
At last blow up some gentle gale of ease,
The which may bring my ship, ere it be rent,
Unto the gladsome port of her intent:
Then when I shall my self in safety see,
A table for eternal moniment
Of thy great grace, and my great ieopardee,
Great Neptune, I avow to hallow unto thee.
Then sighing softly sore, and inly deep,
She shut up all her plaint in privy grief;
For her great courage would not let her weep,
Till that old Glauce began with sharp repriefe,
Her to restrain, and give her good relief,
Through hope of those, which Merlin had her told
Should of her name and nation be chief,
And fetch their being from the sacred mould
Of her immortal womb, to be in heaven enrold.
Thus as she her recomforted, she spyde,
Where far away one all in armor bright,
With hasty gallop toward her did ride;
Her dolor soon she ceast, and on her dight
Her Helmet, to her Courser mounting light:
Her former sorrow into suddein wrath,
Both coosen passions of distroubled spright,
Converting, forth she beats the dusty path;
Love and despite attonce her courage kindled has.
As when a foggy mist has ouercast
The face of heaven, and the clear air engroste,
The world in darkness dwells, till that at last
The watery Southwinde from the seabord cost
Vpblowing, does disperse the vapor lo'ste,
And poures it self forth in a stormy shower;
So the fair Britomart having disclo'ste
Her clowdy care into a wrathful stowre,
The mist of grief dissolved, did into vengeance power.
Eftsoons her goodly shield addressing fair,
That mortal spear she in her hand did take,
And unto battaill did her self prepayre.
The knight approaching, sternely her bespake;
Sir knight, that do thy voyage rashly make
By this forbidden way in my despite,
Ne do by others death ensample take,
I read thee soon retire, whiles thou (...) might,
Least afterward it be too late to take thy flight.
Ythrild with deep disdain of his proud threat,
She shortly thus; Fly they, that need to fly;
Words fearen babes. I mean not thee entreat
To pass; but maugre thee will pass or die.
Ne longer stayed forth'other to reply,
But with sharp spears the rest made dearly known.
Strongly the strange knight ran, and sturdily
Struck her full on the breast, that made her down
Decline her head, and touch her crouper with her crown.
But she again him in the shield did smite
With so fierce fury and great puissaunce,
That through his three square scuchin percing quite,
And through his may (...) hauberque, by mischaunce
The wicked steel through his left side did glaunce;
Him so transfixed she before her bore
Beyond his croupe, the length of all her lance,
Till sadly soucing on the sandy shore,
He tombled on an heap, and wallowd in his gore.
Like as the sacred Ox, that careless stands,
With gilden horns, and flowery girlonds crowned,
Proud of his dying honor and dear bands,
Whiles th'altars fume with frankincense (...),
All suddeinly with mortal stroke astownd,
Does groueling fall, and with his streaming gore
Distaines the pillours, and the holy grownd,
And the fair flowers, that decked him asore;
So fell proud Marinell upon the precious shore.
The martial Maid stayed not him to lament,
But forward rode, and kept her ready way
Along the strond, which as she ouer-went,
She saw bestrowed all with rich array
Of pearls and precious stones of great assay,
And all the gravel mixed with golden owre;
Whereat she wondered much, but would not stay
For gold, or perles, or precious stones an hour,
But them despised all; for all was in her power.
Whiles thus he lay in deadly stonishment,
Tidings hereof came to his mothers ear;
His mother was the blacke-browd Cymocnt,
The daughter of great Nereus, which did bear
This warlike son unto an earthly pear,
The famous Dumarin; who on a day
Finding the Nymph a sleep in secret wheare,
As he by chance did wander that same way,
Was taken with her love, and by her closely lay.
There he this knight of her begot, whom borne
She of his father Marinell did name,
And in a rocky cave as wight forlorn,
Long time she fostred up, till he became
A mighty man at arms, and mickle fame
Did get through great adventures by him done:
For never man he suffered by that same
Rich strond to travel, whereas he did won,
But that he must do battle with the Sea-nymphes son
An hundred knights of honorable name
He had subdew'd, and them his vassals made,
That through all Farie land his noble fame
Now blazed was, and fear did all invade,
That none durst passen through that perilous glade.
And to advance his name and glory more,
Her Sea-god sire she dearly did persuade,
T'endow her son with threasure and rich store,
Boue all the sons, that were of earthly wombesybore.
The God did grant his daughters dear demand,
To done his Nephew in all riches flow;
Eftsoons his heaped waves he did command,
Out of their hollow bosom forth to throw
All the huge threasure, which the sea below
Had in his greedy gulf devoured (...),
And him enriched through the overthrow
And wreckes of many wretches, which did weep,
And often wayle their wealth, which he from them did keep.
Shortly upon that shore there heaped was,
Exceeding riches and all precious things,
The spoil of all the world, that it did pas
The wealth of The East, and pomp of Persian kings;
Gold, amber, yuorie, perles, owches, rings,
And all that else was precious and dear,
The sea unto him voluntary brings,
That shortly he a great Lord did appear,
As was in all the land of Faery, or else wheare.
Thereto he was a doughty dreaded knight,
Tryde often to the scath of many Dear,
That none in equal arms him matchen might,
The which his mother seeing, began to fear
Least his too haughty hardines might rear
Some hard mishap, in hazard of his life:
For thy she often him counseld to forbear
The bloody batteill, and to stir up strife,
But after all his war, to rest his weary knife.
And for his more assurance, she inquired
One day of Proteus by his mighty spell,
(For Proteus was with prophecy inspired)
Her dear sons destiny to her to tell,
And the sad end of her sweet Marinell.
Who through foresight of his eternal skill,
Bad her from womankind to keep him well:
For of a woman he should have much ill,
A virgin strange and stout him should dismay, or kill.
For thy she gave him warning every day,
The love of women not to entertain;
A lesson too too hard for living clay,
From love in course of nature to refrain:
Yet he his mothers lore did well retain,
And ever from fair Ladies love did fly;
Yet many Ladies fair did often complain,
That they for love of him would algates die:
Die, who so list for him, he was loves enemy.
But ah, who can deceive his destiny,
Or ween by warning to avoid his fate?
That when he sleeps in most security,
And safest seems, him soonest does amate,
And finds dew effect or soon or late.
So feeble is the power of fleshy arm.
His mother bad him wemens love to hate,
For she of woman's force did fear no harm;
So weening to have armed him, she did quite disarme.
This was that woman, this (...) deadly wownd,
That Proteus prophecide should him dismay,
The which his mother vainly did expownd,
To be hart-wown ding love, which should assay
To bring her son unto his last decay.
So ticle be the tetmes of mortal state,
And full of subtle so phismes, which do play
With double senses, and with false debate,
T approve the unknown purpose of eternal fate.
Too true the famous Marinell it fownd,
Who through late trial, on that wealthy Strond
Inglorious now lies in senseless swownd,
Through heavy stroke of Britomartis hond.
Which when his mother dear did understand,
And heavy tidings heard, whereas she played
Amongst her watery sisters by a pond,
Gathering sweet daffadillyes, to have made
Gay girlonds, from the Sun their forheads fair to shade.
Eftesoones both flowers and girlonds far away
She flong, and her fair deawy locks yrent,
To sorrow huge she turned her former play,
And gameson merth to grievous dreriment:
She threw her self down on the Continent,
Ne word did speak, but lay as in aswownd,
Whiles al her sisters did for her lament,
With yelling outcries, and with (...) sown;
And every one did tear her gitlond from her crown.
Soon as she up out of her deadly fit
Arose, she bad her charett to be brought,
And all her sisters, that with her did sit,
Bad eke attonce their charetts to be sought;
Tho full of bitter grief and pensife thought,
She to her wagon clombe; clombe all the rest,
And forth together went, with sorrow fraught.
The waves obedient to their beheast,
Them yielded ready passage, and their rage surceast.
Great Neptune stood amazed at their sight,
Whiles on his broad rownd back they softly slid
And eke him self mournd at their mournful plight,
Yet wist not what their wailing meant, yet did
For great compassion of their sorrow, bid
His mighty waters to them buxome be:
Estesoones the roaring billows still abid,
And all the griesly Monstes of the Sea
Stood gaping at their gate, and wondered them to see.
A teme of Dolphins raunged in array,
Drew the smooth charett of sad Cymoent;
They were all taught by Triton, to obey
To the long raynes, at her commandment:
As swifte as swallows, on the waves they went,
That their broad flaggy finnes no foam did rear,
Ne bubling rowndell they behind them sent;
The rest of other fishes drawn wear,
Which with (...) finny oars the swelling sea did sheare.
Soon as they been arrived upon the brim
Of the Rich strond, their charets they forlore,
And let their temed fishes softly swim
Along the margent of the fomy shore,
Least they their finnes should bruze, and surbate sore
Their tender feet upon the stony grownd:
And coming to the place, where all in gore
And cruddy blood enwallowed they fownd
The lucklesse Marinell, lying in deadly swownd;
His mother swowned thrice, and the third time
Could scarce recovered be out of her pain;
Had she not been (...) of mortal slime,
She should not then have been relyu'd again;
But soon as life recovered had the rain,
She made so piteous moan and dear wayment,
That the hard rocks could scarce from tears refrain,
And all her sister Nymphs with one consent
Supplide her sobbing breaches with sad complement.
Dear image of my self, (she said) that is,
The wretched (...) of wretched mother borne,
Is this thine high advancement, O is this
The Immortal name, with which thee yet unborn
Thy Gransire Nereus promised to adorn?
Now lie thou of life and honor refte;
Now lie thou a lump of earth forlorn,
Ne of thy late life memory is left,
Ne can thy irreuocable desteny be wefte?
Fond Proteus, father of false prophecis,
And they more fond, that credit to thee give,
Not this the work of woman's hand ywis,
That so deep wound through these dear members drive.
I feared love: but they that love do live,
But they that dye, do nether love nor hate.
Nath'lesse to thee thy folly I forgive,
And to myself, and to accursed fate
The guilt I do ascribe: dear wisdom bought too late.
O what auailes it of immortal seed
To been ybredd and never borne to dye?
Far better I it deem to die with speed,
Then waste in woe and waylfull miserye.
Who dies the utmost dolor does abye,
But who that lives, is left to wail his loss:
So life is loss, and death felicity.
Sad life worse then glad death: and greater cross
To see friends grave, the^ dead the grave self to engrosse.
But if the heavens did his days envy,
And my short blis malign, yet mote they well
Thus much afford me, ere that he did die
That the dim eyes of my dear Marinell
I mote have closed, and him bed farewell,
Since other offices for mother meet
They would not grant.
Yett maulgre them farewell, my sweetest sweet;
Farewell my sweetest son, till we again may meet.
Thus when they all had sorowed their fill,
They softly began to search his griesly wownd:
And that they might him handle more at will,
They him disarmd, and spredding on the grownd
Their watcher mantles frindgd with silver rownd,
They softly wipt away the gelly blood
From th'orifice; which having well vpbownd,
They pourd in sovereign balm, and Nectar good,
Good both for erthly medicine, and for heavenly food.
Tho when the lilly handed Liagore,
(This Liagore whilome had learned skill
In leaches craft, by great Appolloes lore,
Since her whilome upon high Pindus hill,
He loved, and at last her womb did fill
With heavenly seed, whereof wise Paeon sprung)
Did feel his pulse, she knew their stayed still
Some little life his feeble sprites among;
Which to his mother told, despeyre she from her flong.
Tho up him taking in their tender hands,
They easily unto her charett bear:
Her teme at her commandment quiet stands,
Whiles they the corse into her wagon rear,
And strowe with flowers the lamentable bear:
Then all the rest into their coches clim,
And through the brackish waves their passage shear;
Upon great Neptunes neck they softly swim,
And to her watery chamber swiftly carry him.
Deep in the bottom of the sea, her bower
Is built of hollow billows heaped hye,
Like to thick clouds, that threat a stormy shower,
And vauted all within, like to the Sky,
In which the Gods do dwell eternally:
There they him laid in easy couch well dight;
And sent in haste for Tryphon, to apply
Salues to his wounds, and medicines of might:
For Tryphon of sea gods the sovereign leach is hight.
The whiles the Nymphs sit all about him rownd,
Lamenting his mishap and heavy plight;
And often his mother vewing his wide wownd,
Cursed the hand, that did so deadly smight
Her dearest son, her dearest hearts delight.
But none of all those curses ouertooke
The warlike Maid, th'ensample of that might,
But fairly well she thryud, and well did brook
Her noble deeds, ne her right course for ought forsook.
Yet did false Archimage her still pursew,
To bring to pass his mischievous intent,
Now that he had her singled from the crew
Of courteous knights, the Prince, and Fary gent,
Whom late in chase of beauty excellent
She left, pursewing that same foster strong;
Of whose foul outrage they impatient,
And full of fiery zele, him followed long,
To reskew her from shame, and to revenge her wrong.
Through thick and thin, through mountains and through playns,
Those two great cha^pions did attonce pursew
The fearful damzell, with incessant payns:
Who from them fled, as light-foot hare from view
Of hunter swifte, and sent of howndes true.
At last they came unto a double way,
Where, doubtful which to take, her to reskew,
Themselves they did dispart, each to assay,
Whether more happy were, to win so goodly pray.
But Timias, the Princes gentle Squyre,
That Ladies love unto his Lord forlent,
And with proud envy, and indignant ire,
After that wicked foster fiercely went.
So been they three three sundry ways ybent.
But fairest fortune to the Prince befell,
Whose chance it was, that soon he did repent,
To take that way, in which that Damozell
Was fledd before, afraid of him, as feend of hell.
At last of her far of he gained view:
Then began he freshly prick his fomy (...),
And ever as he nigher to her drew,
So evermore he did increase his speed,
And of each turning still kept wary heed:
Alowd to her he oftentimes did call,
To do away vain doubt, and needless dreed:
Full myld to her he spoke, and often let fall
Many meek words, to stay and comfort her withal.
But nothing might relent her hasty flight;
So deep the deadly fear of that foul swain
Was erst impressed in her gentle spright:
Like as a fearful Dove, which through the rain,
Of the wide air her way does cut amain,
Having far off espyde a Tassell gent,
Which after her his nimble wings does strain,
Doubleth her have for fear to be for-hent,
And with her pineons cleaues the liquid firmament.
With no less have, and eke with no less dreed,
That fearful Lady fledd from him, that meant
To her no evil thought, nor evil deed;
Yet former fear of being fowly shent,
Carried her forward with her first intent:
And though often looking backward, well she vewde,
Her self freed from that foster insolent,
And that it was a knight, which now her sewde,
Yet she no less the knight feared, then that villein rude.
His uncouth shield and strange arms her dismayed,
Whose like in Faery land were seldom seen,
That fast she from him fledd, no less afraid,
Then of wild beasts if she had chased been:
Yet he her followd still with courage keen,
So long that now the golden Hesperus
Was mounted high in top of heaven sheene,
And warnd his other brethren ioyeous,
To light their blessed lamps in (...) eternal house.
All suddeinly dim wox the dampish air,
And griesly shadows covered heaven bright,
That now with thousand stars was decked fair;
Which when the Prince beheld, a lothfull sight,
And that perforce, for want of longer light,
He motesurceasse his suit, and lose the hope
Of his long labor, he began fowly wit
His wicked fortune, that had turned aslope,
And cursed night, that reft from him so goodly scope.
Tho when her ways he could no more descry,
But to and fro at disauenture strayd;
Like as a ship, whose Lodestar suddeinly
Covered with clouds, her Pilott has dismayed,
His wearisome pursuit perforce he stayed,
And from his lofty steed dismounting low,
Did let him forage. Down himself he laid
Upon the grassy ground, to sleep a throw;
The cold earth was his couch, the hard steel his pillow.
But gentle Sleep enuyde him any rest;
In stead thereof sad sorrow, and disdain
Of his hard hap did vex his noble breast,
And thousand fancies bett his idle brain
With their light wings, the sights of semblants vain:
Often did he wish, that Lady fair mote be
His faery Queen, for whom he did complain:
Or that his Faery Queen were such, as she:
And ever hasty Night he blamed bitterly.
Night thou foul Mother of annoyaunce sad,
Sister of heavy death, and nourse of woe,
Which wast be got in heaven, but for thy bad
And brutish shape thrust down to hell below,
Where by the grim flood of Cocytus slow
Thy dwelling is, in Herebus black house,
(Black Herebus thy husband is the foe
Of all the Gods) where thou ungracious,
Half of thy days do lead in horror hideous.
What had the eternal Maker need of thee,
The world in his continual course to keep,
That do all things deface, ne let see
The beauty of his work? Indeed in sleep
The slothful body, that does love to steep
His lustlefse limbs, and drown his baser mind,
Does praise thee often, and often from Stygian deep
Calls thee, his goddess in his error blind,
And great Dame Natures handmaide, chearing every kind.
But well I wot, that to an heavy heart
Thou art the root and nourse of bitter cares,
Breeder of new, renewer of old smarts:
In stead of rest thou lendest railing tears,
In stead of sleep thou sendest troublous fears,
And dreadful visions, in the which alive
The dreary image of sad death appears:
So from the weary spirit thou do drive
Desired rest, and men of happiness deprive.
Under thy mantle black there hidden lie,
Light-shonning theft, and traitorous intent,
Abhorred bloodshed, and vile felony,
Shameful deceit, and danger imminent;
Foul horror, and eke hellish dreriment:
All these I wot in thy protection be,
And light do shonne, for fear of being shent:
For lighty like is loathed of them and thee,
And all that lewdness love, do hate the light to see.
For day discouers all dishonest ways,
And shows each thing, as it is in deed:
The praises of high God he fair displayes,
And his large bounty rightly does areed.
The children of day be the blessed seed,
Which darkness shall subdue, and heaven win:
Truth is his daughter; he her first did breed,
Most sacred virgin, without spot of sin.
Our life is day, but death with darkness does begin.
O when will day then turn to me again,
And bring with him his long expected light?
O Titan, have to rear thy joyous waine:
Speed thee to spread abroad thy beams bright?
And chase away this too long lingering night,
Chase her away, from whence she came, to hell.
She, she it is, that has me done despite:
There let her with the damned spirits dwell,
And yield her to wme to day, that can it govern well.
Thus did the Prince that weary night outweare,
In restless anguish and unquiet pain:
And early, ere the morrow did vpreare
His deawy head out of the Ocean maine,
He up arose, as half in great disdain,
And clombe unto his steed. So forth he went,
With heavy look and lumpish pace, that plain
In him bewraid great grudge and maltalent:
His steed eke seemd t'apply his steps to his intent.
Cant. V.
Prince Arthur hears of Florimell:
three fosters Timias wound,
Belphebe finds him almost dead,
and reareth out of sownd.
WOnder it is to see, in diverse minds,
How diversely love does his pageaunts play,
And shows his power in variable kinds:
The baser wit, whose idle thoughts always
Are wont to cleave unto the lowly clay,
It stirs up to sensual desire,
And in lewd sloth to wast his careless day:
But in brave sprite it kindles goodly fire,
That to all high desert and honor does aspire.
Ne suffers it uncomely idleness,
In his free thought to build her sluggish nest:
Ne suffers it thought of ungentleness,
Ever to creep into his noble breast,
But to the highest and the worthiest
Lifts it up, that else would lowly fall:
It lettes not fall, it lettes it not to rest:
It lettes not scarce this Prince to breath at all,
But to his first poursuit him forward still does call.
Who long time wandered through the forest wide,
To find some issue thence, till that at last
He met a Dwarf, that seemed terrifyde
With some late peril, which he hardly past,
Or other accident, which him aghast;
Of whom he asked, whence he lately came,
And whether now he traueiled so fast:
For sore he swat, and ronning through that same
Thick forest, was bescracht, and both his feet nigh lame.
Panting for breath, and almost out of heart,
The Dwarf him answered, Sir, ill (...) I stay
To tell the same. I lately did depart
From Faery court, where I have many a day
Served a gentle Lady of greatsway,
And high account through out all Elfin land,
Who lately left the same, and took this way:
Her now I seek, and if ye understand
Which way she fared has, good Sir tell out of hand.
What mister wight, (said he) and how arayd?
Royally clad (quoth he) in cloth of gold,
As meetest may beseem a noble maid;
Her fair locks in rich circlet be enrold,
A fayrer wight did never Sun behold,
And on a Palfrey rydes more white then snow,
Yet she her self is whiter manifold:
The surest sign, whereby ye may her know,
Is, that she is the fairest wight alive, I trow.
Now certes swain (said he) such one I ween,
Fast flying through this forest from her fo,
A foul ill favored foster, I have seen;
Her self, well as I might, I reskewd tho,
But could not stay; so fast she did foregoe,
Carried away with wings of speedy fear.
Ah dearest God (quoth he) that is great woe,
And wondrous ruth to all, that shall it hear.
But can ye read Sir, how I may her find, or where.
Perdy me lever were to weeten that,
(Said he) then ransom of the richest knight,
Or all the good that ever yet I gat:
But froward fortune, and too forward Night
Such happiness did, maulgre, to me spite,
And fro me reft both life and light atone.
But Dwarf aread, what is that Lady bright,
That through this forest wandreth thus alone;
For of her error strange I have great ruth and moan.
That Lady is (quoth he) where so she be,
The bountiest virgin, and most debonaire,
That ever living eye I ween did see;
Lives none this day, that may with her compare
In steadfast chastity and virtue rare,
The goodly ornaments of beauty bright;
And is ycleped Florimell the fair,
Fair Florimell beloved of many a knight,
Yet she loves none but one, that Marinell is hight.
A Sea-nymphes son, that Marinell is hight,
Of my dear Dame is loved dearly well;
In other none, but him, she sets delight,
All her delight is set on Marinell;
But he sets naught at all by Florimell:
For Ladies love his mother long ygoe
Did him, they say, forwarne through sacred spell.
But fame now flies, that of a foreign foe
He is yslaine, which is the ground of all our woe.
Five days there be, since he (they say) was slain,
And four, since Florimell the Court forwent,
And vowed never to return again,
Till him alive or dead she did invent.
Therefore, fair Sir, for love of knighthood gent,
And honor of true Ladies, if ye may
By your good counsel, or bold hardiment,
Or succor her, or me direct the way,
Do one, or other good, I you most humbly pray.
So may ye gain to you full great renown,
Of all good Ladies through the world so wide,
And happily in her heart find highest rowme,
Of whom ye seek to be most magnifide:
At least eternal meede shall you abide.
To whom the Prince; Dwarf, comfort to thee take,
For till thou tidings learn, what her betide,
I here auow thee never to forsake.
Ill wears he arms, that nill them use for Ladies sake.
So with the Dwarf he back retourn'd again,
To seek his Lady, where he mote her find;
But by the way he greatly began complain
The want of his good Squire late left behind,
For whom he wondrous pensive grew in mind,
For doubt of danger, which mote him betide;
For him he loved above all mankind,
Having him true and faithful ever tried,
And bold, as ever Squyre that waited by knights side.
Who all this while full hardly was assayd
Of deadly danger, which to him betidd;
For whiles his Lord pursewd that noble Maid,
After that foster foul he fiercely ridd,
To been avenged of the shame, he did
To that fair Damzell: Him he chaced long
Through the thick woods, wherein he would have hid
His shameful head from his auengement strong,
And often him threatened death for his outrageous wrong.
Nathlesse the villein sped himself so well,
Whether through swiftness of his speedy beast;
Or knowledge of those woods, where he did dwell,
That shortly he from danger was releast,
And out of fight escaped at the least;
Yet not escaped from the dew reward
Of his bad deeds, which daily he increast,
Ne ceased not, till him oppressed hard
The heavy plague, that for such leachours is prepared.
For soon as he was vanished out of sight,
His coward courage began emboldned be,
And cast t'auenge him of that foul despite,
Which he had borne of his bold enimee.
Tho to his brethren came: for they were three
Ungracious children of one graceless sire,
And unto them complained, how that he
Had used been of that foolehardie Squyre;
So them with bitter words he stird to bloody ire.
Forthwith themselves with their sad instruments
Of spoil and murder they began arm byliue,
And with him forth into the forest went,
To wreake the wrath, which he did erst revive
In their stern breasts, on him which late did drive
Their brother to reproach and shameful flight:
For they had vowed, that never he alive
Out of that forest should escape their might;
Vile rancour their rude hearts had filled with such despite
Within that wood there was a covert glade,
Foreby a narrow foord, to them well known,
Through which it was uneath for wight to made,
And now by fortune it was overflowed:
By that same way they knew that Squyre unknown
Mote algates pass; for thy themselves they set
There in await, with thick woods over grown,
And all the while their malice they did whet
With cruel threats, his passage through the ford to let.
It fortuned, as they deuized had,
The gentle Squyre came ryding that same way,
Vnweeting of their wile and treason bad,
And through the ford to passen did assay;
But that fierce foster, which late fled away,
Stoutly forth stepping on the further shore,
Him boldly bad his passage there to stay,
Till he had made amends, and full restore
For all the damage, which he had him done before.
With that at him a quiu'ring dart he threw,
With so fell force and villeinous despite,
That through his haberieon the forkehead flew,
And through the linked mayles empierced quite,
But had now power in his soft flesh to bite:
That stroke the hardy Squire did sore displease,
But more that him he could not come to smite;
For by no means the high bank he could sease,
But labored long in that deep ford with vain disease.
And still the foster with his long bore-speare
Him kept from landing at his wished will,
Anon one sent out of the thicket near
A cruel shaft, headed with deadly ill,
And fethered with an unlucky quill;
The wicked steel stayed not, till it did light
In his left thigh, and deeply did it thrill:
Exceeding grief that wound in him empight,
But more that with his foes he could not come to fight.
At last through wrath and vengeance making way,
He on the bancke arryud with mickle pain,
Where the third brother him did sore assay,
And drove at him with all his might and main
A forest bill, which both his hands did strain,
But warily he did avoid the blow,
And with his spear requited him again,
That both his sides were thrilled with the throw,
And a large stream of flood out of the wound did flow.
He tombling down, with gnashing teeth did bite
The bitter earth, and bad to let him in
Into the balefull house of endless night,
Where wicked ghosts do wail their former sin.
Tho began the battle freshly to begin;
For nathemore for that spectacle bad,
Did the other two their cruel vengeance blin,
But both attonce on both sides him bestad,
And load upon him laid, his life for to have had.
Tho when that villayn he auiz'd, which late
Affrighted had the fairest Florimell,
Full of fires fury, and indignant hate,
To him he turned, and with rigor fell
Smote him so rudely on the Pannikell,
That to the chin he clefte his head in twain:
Down on the ground his carkas groueling fell;
His sinful soul with desperate disdain,
Out of her fleshly ferme fled to the place of pain.
That seeing now the only last of three,
Who with that wicked shafte him wounded had,
Trembling with horror, as that did foresee
The fearful end of his auengement sad,
Through which he follow should his brethren bad,
His bootelesse bow in feeble hand vpcaught,
And therewith shot an arrow at the lad;
Which fayntly fluttring, scarce his helmet raught,
And glauncing fell to ground, but him annoyed naught.
With that he would have fled into the wood;
But Timias him lightly ouerhent,
Right as he entering was into the flood,
And struck at him with force so violent,
That headless him into the foord he sent:
The carcas with the stream was carried down,
Butch'head fell backward on the Continent.
So mischief fell upon the meaners crown;
They three be dead with shame, the Squire lives with renown.
He lives, but takes small joy of his renown;
For of that cruel wound he bled so sore,
That from his steed he fell in deadly swowne;
Yet still the blood forth gusht in so great store,
That he lay wallowd all in his own gore.
Now God thee keep, thou gentlest squire alive,
Else shall thy loving Lord thee see no more,
But both of comfort him thou shall deprive,
And eke thy self of honor, which thou did atchiue.
Providence heavenly passes living thought,
And does for wretched men's relief make way;
For (...) great grace or fortune thither brought
Comfort to him, that comfortless now lay.
In those same woods, ye well remember may,
How that a noble hunteresse did won,
She, that base Braggadochio did affray,
And made him fast out of the forest run;
Belphoebe was her name, as fair as Phoebus sun.
She on a day, as she pursewd the chase
Of some wild beast, which with her arrows keen
She wounded had, the same along did trace
By tract of blood, which she had freshly seen,
To have besprinckled all the grassy green,
By the great pursue, which she there perceau'd,
Well hoped she (...) beast engor'd had been,
And made more haste, the life to have bereaved:
But ah, het expectation greatly was deceau'd.
Shortly she came, whereas that woeful Squire
With blood deforwed; lay in deadly swownd:
In whose fair eyes, like lamps of quenched fire,
The Crystal humor stood congealed rownd;
His locks, like faded leaves fallen to grownd,
Knotted with blood, in bounches rudely ran,
And his sweet lips, on which before that stownd
The bud of youth to blossom fair began,
Spoild of their rosy red, were woxen pale and wan.
Saw never living eye more heavy sight,
That could have made a rock of stone to rue,
Or riue in twain: which when that Lady bright
Besides all hope with melting eyes did view,
All suddeinly abasht she changed hew,
And with stern horror backward began to start:
But when she bitter him beheld she grew
Full of sofe passion and unwonted smart:
The point of pity perced through her tender heart.
Meekely she bowed down, to weete if life
Yett in his frosen members did remain,
And feeling by his pulses beating rife,
That the weak soul her seat did yett retain,
She cast to comfort him with busy pain:
His double folded neck she reard upright,
And rubd his temples, and each trembling vain;
His mayled haberieon she did vndight,
And from his head his heavy burganet did light.
Into the woods thence forth in haste she went,
To seek for herbs, that mote him remedy;
For she of herbs had great in tendiment,
Taught of the Nymphe, which from her infancy
Her nourced had in true Nobility:
There, whether yt divine Tobacco were,
Or Panachaea, or Polygony,
She fownd, and brought it to her patient dear
Who all this while lay bleding out his hart-blood near.
The sovereign weed betwixt two marbles plain
She pownded small, and did in peeees bruze,
And then atweene her lilly hands twain,
Into his wound the juice thereof did scruze,
And round about, as she could well it vze,
The flesh therewith she suppled and did steep,
T'abate all spasme, and soke the swelling bruze,
And after having searched the intuse deep,
She with her scarf did bind the wou^d from cold to keep.
By this he had sweet life recur'd again,
And groaning inly deep, at last his eyes,
His watery eyes, drizling like (...) rain,
He up began lift toward the azure skies,
From whence descend all hopeless remedies;
Therewith he sighed, and turning him aside,
The goodly Maid full of diuinities,
And gifts of heavenly grace he by him spide,
Her bow and gilden quiver lying him beside.
Mercy dear Lord (said he) what grace is this,
That thou have showed to me sinful wight,
To send thine Angel from her bower of blis,
To comfort me in my distressed plight?
Angel, or Goddess do I call thee right?
What service may I do unto thee meet,
That have from darkness me returned to light,
And with thy heavenly salues and medicines sweet,
Have dressed my sinful wounds? I kiss thy blessed feet.
Thereat she blushing said, Ah gentle Squire,
Nor Goddess I, nor Angel, but the Maid,
And daughter of a woody Nymphe, desire
No service, but thy safety and aid,
Which if thou gain, I shall be well apayd.
We mortal wights, whose lives and fortunes (...)
To commun accidents still open laid,
Are bownd with commun bond of frailtee,
To succor wretched wights, whom we captiued see.
By this her Damzells, which the former chase
Had undertaken after her, arryu'd,
As did Belphoebe, in the bloody place,
And thereby deemd the beast had been deprived
Of life, whom late their ladies arrow ryu'd:
For thy the bloody tract they followd fast,
And every one to run the swiftest stryu'd;
But two of them the rest far ouerpast,
And where their Lady was, arrived at the last.
Where when they saw that goodly boy, wlth blood
Defowled, and their Lady dress his wownd,
They wondered much, and shortly understood,
How him in deadly case their Lady fownd,
And reskewed out of the heavy stownd.
Estsoones his warlike courser, which was strayd
Far in the woods, whiles that he lay in swownd,
She made those Damzels search, which being stayed,
They did him set thereon, and forth with them conuayd.
Into that forest far they thence him led,
Where was their dwelling, in a pleasant glade,
With mountains rownd about environed,
And mighty woods, which did the valley shade,
And like a stately Theater it made,
Spreading it self into a spacious plain.
And in the midst a little river plaide
Emongst the pumy stones, which seemd to plain
With gentle mnrmure, that their course they did (...)
Beside the same a dainty place there lay,
Planted with myrtle trees and laurells green,
In which the birds song many a lovely lay
Of gods high praise, and of their sweet loves teene,
As it an earthly Paradize had been:
In whose enclosed shadow there was pight
A fair Pauilion, scarcely to be seen,
The which was al within most richly dight,
That greatest Princes liking it mote well delight.
Thither they brought that wounded Squyre, and (...)
In easy couch his feeble limbs to rest,
He rested him a while, and then the Maid
His ready wound with better (...) new dressed,
Daily she dressed him, and did the best
His grievous hurt to guarish, that she might,
That shortly she his dolor has redrest.
And his foul sore reduced to fair plight:
It she reduced, but himself destroyed quight.
O foolish physic, and unfruitful pain,
That heales up one and makes another wound:
She his hurt thigh to him recurd again,
But hurt his heart, the which before was sound,
Through an unwary dart, which did rebownd
From her fair eyes and gracious countenance.
What boots it him from death to be vnbownd,
To be captiued in endless duraunce
Of sorrow and despeyre without aleggeaunce?
Still as his wound did gather, and grow hole,
So still his heart woxe sore, and health decayed:
Madness to save a part, and lose the whole.
Still whenas he beheld the heavenly Maid,
Whiles daily playsters to his wownd she laid,
So still his Malady the more increast,
The whiles her matchless beauty him dismayed.
Ah God, what other could he do at least,
But love so fair a Lady, that his life releast?
Long while he strove in his corageous breast,
With reason dew the passion to subdew,
And love for to dislodge out of his nest:
Still when her excellencies he did view,
Her sovereign bounty, and celestial hew,
The same to love he strongly was constraynd:
But when his mean estate he did renew,
He from such hardy boldness was restraynd,
And of his lucklesse lot and cruel love thus playnd.
Unthankful wretch (said he) is this the meed,
With which her souerain mercy thou do est quight?
Thy life she saved by her gracious deed,
But thou do est ween with villeinous despite,
To blott her honor, and her heavenly light.
Dye rather, dye, then so disloyally
Deem of her high desert, or seem so light:
Fair death it is to shonne more shame, to die:
Dye rather, die, then ever love disloyally.
But if to love disloyalty it be,
Shall I then hate her, that from deaths door
Me brought? ah far be such reproach fro me.
What can I less do, then her love therefore,
Since I her dew reward cannot restore:
Dye rather, dye, and dying do her serve,
Dying her serve, and living her adore;
Thy life she gave, thy life she does deserve:
Dye rather, dye, then ever from her service swerue.
But foolish boy, what boots thy service bace
To her, to whom the heuens do serve and sew?
Thou a mean Squyre, of meek and lowly place,
She heavenly borne, and of celestial hew.
How then? of all love takes equal view:
And does not highest God vouchsafe to take
The love and service of the basest crew?
If she will not, dye meekly for her sake;
Dye rather, dye, then ever so fair love forsake.
Thus warreid he long time against his will,
Till that through weakness he was forced at last,
To yield himself unto the mighty ill:
Which as a victour proud, began ransack fast
His inward parts, and all his entrayles wast,
That neither blood in face, nor life in heart
It left, but both did quite dry up, and blast;
As percing leuin, which the inner part
Of every thing consumes, and calcineth by art.
Which seeing fair (...), began to fear,
Least that his wound were inly well not heald,
Or that the wicked steel empoysned were:
Little she weend, that love he close conceald;
Yet still he wasted, as the snow congeald,
When the bright sun his beams thereon does beat;
Yet never he his heart to her reueald,
But rather chose to dye for sorrow great,
Then with dishonorable terms her to entreat.
She gracious Lady, yet no pains did spare,
To do him ease, or do him remedy:
Many Restoratiues of virtues rare,
And costly Cordialles she did apply,
To mitigate his stubborn malady:
But that sweet Cordial, which can restore
A loue-sick heart, she did to him envy;
To him, and to all th'vnworthy world forlore
She did envy that sovereign salve, in secret store.
That (...) Rose, the daughter of her Morn,
More dear then life she tendered, whose flower
The girlond of her honor did adorn:
Ne suffered she the Middayes scorching power,
Ne the sharp Northern wind thereon to shower,
But lapped up her silken leaves most chair,
When so the froward sky began to lowre;
But soon as calmed was the crystal air,
She did it fair dispred, and let to flourish fair.
Eternal God in his almighty power,
To make ensample of his heavenly grace,
In Paradize whylome did plant this flower;
Whence he it (...) out of her native place,
And did in stock of earthly flesh enrace,
That mortal men her glory should admyre
In gentle Ladies breast, and bounteous race
Of woman kind it fairest flower does spyre,
And bears fruit of honor and all chaste desire.
Fair ympes of beauty, whose bright shining beams
Adorn the world with like to heavenly light,
And to your wills both royalties and Reames
Subdew, through conquest of your wondrous might,
With this fair flower your goodly girlonds dight,
Of chastity and virtue virginal,
That shall embellish more your beauty bright,
And crown your heads with heavenly coronall,
Such as the Angels were before Gods tribunal.
To your fair selves a fair ensample frame,
Of this fair virgin, this Belphebe fair,
To whom in perfect love, and spotless fame
Of chastity, none living may compayre:
Ne poysnous Envy justly can empayre
The praise of her fresh flowring May denhead;
For thy she stands on the highest stayre
Of th'honorable stage of womanhead,
That Ladies all may follow her ensample dead.
In so great praise of steadfast chastity,
Nathlesse she was so courteous and kind,
Tempred with grace, and goodly modesty,
That seemed those two virtues strove to find
The higher place in her Heroic mind:
So striving each did other more augment,
And both encreast the praise of woman kind,
And both encreast her beauty excellent;
So all did make in her a perfect complement;
Cant. VI.
The birth of fair Belphoebe and
Of Amorett is told.
The Gardins of Adonis fraught
With pleasures manifold.
WEll may I ween, fair Ladies, all this while
Ye wonder, how this noble Damozell
So great perfections did in her compile,
Since that in saluage forests she did dwell,
So far from court and royal Citadell,
The great schoolmaistresse of all courtesy:
Seems that such wild woods should far expel
All civil usage and gentility,
And gentle sprite deforme with rude rusticity.
But to this fair Belphoebe in her berth
The heuens so favorable were and free,
Looking with myld aspect upon the earth,
In the Horoscope of her natiuitee,
That all the gifts of grace and chastitee
On her they poured forth of plenteous horn;
Jove laughed on Venus from his sovereign see,
And Phoebus with fair beams did her adorn,
And all the Graces rockt her cradle being borne.
Her berth was of the womb of Morning dew,
And her conception of the joyous Prime,
And all her whole creation did her show
Pure and (...) from all loathly crime,
That is ingenerate in fleshly slime.
So was this virgin borne, so was she bred,
So was she trained up from time to time,
In all chaste virtue, and true bounti-hed
Till to her dew perfection she were ripened.
Her mother was the fair Chrysogonee,
The daughter of Amphisa, who by race
A Faerie was, yborne of high degree,
She bore Belphaebe, she bore in like case
Fair Amoretta in the second place:
These two were twins, and twixt them two did share
The heritage of all celestial grace.
That all the rest it seemd they robbed bare
Of bounty, and of beauty, and all virtues rare.
It were a goodly story, to declare,
By what strange accident fair Chrysogone
Conceived these infants, and how them she bore,
In this wild forest wandering all alone,
After she had nine months fulfild and gone:
For not as other wemens commune brood,
They were enwombed in the sacred throne
Of her chaste body, nor with commune food,
As other wemens babes, they sucked vital blood.
But wondrously they were begot, and bred
Through influence of th'heuens fruitful ray,
As it in antique books is mentioned.
It was upon a Summers (...) day,
When Titan fair his beams did display,
In a fresh fountain, (...) from all men's view,
She bathed her breast, the boiling heat t'allay;
She bathed with roses red, and violets blew,
And all the sweetest flowers, that in the forest grew.
Till faint through yrkesome wearines, adowne
Upon the grassy ground her self she laid
To sleep, the whiles a gentle slombring swowne
Upon her fell all naked bare displayed;
The sunbeames bright upon her body played,
Being through former bathing mollifide,
And pierst into her womb, where they embayd
With so sweet sense and secret power vnspide,
That in her pregnant flesh they shortly fructifide.
Miraculous may seem to him, that reads
So strange ensample of conception,
But reason teaches that the fruitful seades
Of all things living, through impression
Of the sunbeames in moist complexion,
Do life conceive and quickened are by kind:
So after Nilus inundation,
Infinite shapes of creatures men do find,
Informed in the mud, on which the Sun has shynd.
Great father he of generation
Is rightly called, th'authour of life and light;
And his fair sister for creation
Ministers matter fit, which tempred right
With heat and humor, breeds the living wight.
So sprung these twins in womb of Chrysogone,
Yet wist she naught thereof, but sore affright,
Wondered to see her belly so vpblone,
Which still increast, till she her term had full outgone.
Whereof conceiving shame and foul disgrace,
Albe her guiltless conscience her cleard,
She fled into the wilderness a space,
Till that vnweeldy burden she had reard,
And shund dishonor, which as death she feared:
Where weary of long traueill, down to rest
Her self she set, and comfortably cheard;
There a sad cloud of sleep her ouerkest,
And seized every sense with sorrow sore oppressed.
It fortuned, fair Venus having lost
Her little son, the winged god of love,
Who for some light displeasure, which him crossed,
Was from her fled, as flit as ayery Dove,
And left her blisfull bower of joy above,
(So from her often he had fled away,
When she for ought him sharply did reprove,
And wandered in the world in strange array,
Disguised in thousand shapes, that none might him bewray.)
Him for to seek, she left her heavenly house,
The house of goodly forms and fair aspects,
Whence all the world deriues the glorious
Features of beauty, and all shapes select,
With which high God his workmanship has decked;
And searched every way, through which his wings
Had borne him, or his tract she mote detect:
She promised kisses sweet, and sweeter things,
Unto the man, that of him tidings to her brings.
First she him sought in Court, where most he used
Whylome to haunt, but there she found him not;
But many there she found, which sore accused
His falsehood, and with foul infamous blot
His cruel deeds and wicked wyles did spot:
Ladies and Lords she every where mote hear
Complaining, how with his empoysned shot
Their woeful hearts he wounded had whyleare,
And so had left them languishing twixt hope and fear.
She then the Cities sought from gate to gate,
And every one did ask did he him see;
And every one her answered, that too late
He had him seen, and felt the crueltee
Of his sharp darts and whot artilleree;
And every one threw forth reproaches rife
Of his mischievous deeds, and said, That he
Was the disturber of all civil life,
The enemy of peace, and author of all strife.
Then in the country she abroad him sought,
And in the rural cottages inquired,
Where also many plaintes to her were brought,
How he their he (...) hearts with love had fired,
And his false venim through their veins inspired;
And eke the gentle Shepherd swaynes, which sat
Keeping their fleecy flocks, as they were hyr'd,
She sweetly heard complain, both how and what
Her son had to them done; yet she did smile thereat.
But when in none of all these she him got,
She began auize, where else he mote him hyde:
At last she her bethought, that she had not
Yet sought the saluage woods and forests wide,
In which full many lovely Nymphs abide,
Among whom might be, that he did closely lie,
Or that the love of some of them him tide:
For thy she thither cast her course t'apply,
To search the secret haunts of Dianes company.
Shortly unto the wastefull woods she came,
Whereas she found the Goddess with her crew,
After late chase of their embrewed game,
Sitting beside a fountain in a rue,
Some of them washing with the liquid dew
From of their dainty limbs the dusty sweat,
And soil which did deforme their lively hew,
Others lay shaded from the scorching heat;
The rest upon her person gave attendance great.
She having hong upon a bough on high
Her bow and painted quiver, had vnlaste
Her silver buskins from her nimble thigh,
And her lanck loins ungirt, and breasts vnbraste,
After her heat the breathing cold to taste;
Her golden locks, that late in tresses bright
Embreaded were for hindering of her haste,
Now loose about her shoulders hong vndight,
And were with sweet Ambrosia all besprinckled light.
Soon as she Venus saw behind her back,
She was ashamed to be so loose surpised
And woxe half wroth against her damzels slack,
That had not her there of before auiz'd,
But suffered her so carelessly disguised
Be overtaken. Soon her garments loose
Vpgath'ring, in her bosom she comprised,
Well as she might, and to the Goddess rose,
Whiles all her Nymphs did like a girlond her enclose.
Goodly she began fair Cytherea greet,
And shortly asked her, what cause her brought
Into that wilderness for her unmeet,
From her sweet bowres, and beds with pleasures fraught:
That suddein chaung she straung adventure thought.
To whom half weeping, she thus answered,
That she her dearest son Cupido sought,
Who in his frowardnes from her was fled;
That she repented sore, to have him angered.
Thereat Diana began to smile, in scorn
Of her vain playnt, and to her scoffing said;
Great pity sure, that ye be so forlorn
Of your gay son, that gives ye so good aid
To your disports: ill mote ye been apayd,
But she was more engrieued, and replide;
Fair sister, ill beseemes itto upbraid
A doleful heart with so disdainful pride;
The like that mine, may be your pain another tide.
As you in woods and wanton wilderness
Your glory set, to chase the saluage beasts,
So my delight is all in ioyfulnesse,
In beds, in bowres, in banckets, and in feasts:
And ill becomes you with your lofty creasts,
To scorn the joy, that Jove is glad to seek;
We both are bownd to follow heavens beheasts,
And tend our charges with obeisaunce meek:
Spare, gentle sister, with reproach my pain to eeke.
And tell me, if that ye my son have heard,
To lurk emongst your Nymphs in secret wize;
Or keep their cabins: much I am affeard,
Least he like one of them him self disguize,
And turn his arrows to their exercize:
So may he long him self full easy hide:
For he is fair and fresh in face and guize,
As any Nimphe (let not it be enuide.)
So saying every Nymph full narrowly she eide.
But Phoebe therewith sore was angered,
And sharply said, Go Dame, go seek your boy,
Where you him lately left, in Mars his bed;
He comes not here, we scorn his foolish joy,
Ne lend we leisure to his idle toy:
But if I catch him in this company,
By Stygian lake I vow, whose sad annoy
The Gods do dread, he dearly shall abye:
I Will clip his wanton wings, that he no more shall fly.
Whom whenas Venus saw so sore displeasd,
She inly sorry was, and began relent,
What she had said: so her she soon appeasd,
With sugared words and gentle blandishment,
From which a fountain from her sweet lips went,
And welled goodly forth, that in short space
She was well pleased, and forth her damzells sent
Thtough all the woods, to search from place to place.
If any tract of him or tidings they mote trace.
To search the God of love her Nymphs she sent,
Throughout the wandering forest every where:
And after them her self eke with her went
To seek the fugitive.
So long they sought, till they arrived were
In that same shady covert, whereas lay
Fair Crysogone in slombry trance whilere:
Who in her sleep (a wondrous thing to say)
Unawares had borne two babes, as fair as springing day.
Unawares she them conceiud, unawares she bore:
She bore withouten pain, that she conceived
Withouten pleasure: ne her need implore
Lucinaes aid: which when they both perceived,
They were through wonder nigh of sense bereu'd,
And gazing each on other, naught bespake:
At last they both agreed, her seeming grieved
Out of her heavy swowne not to awake,
But from her loving side the tender babes to take.
Up they them took, eachone a babe vptooke,
And with them carried, to be fostered;
Dame Phaebe to a Nymphe her babe betook,
To be vpbrought in perfect Maydenhed,
And of herself her name Belphoebe red:
But Venus hers thence far away conuayd,
To be vpbrought in goodly womanhed,
And in her little loves stead, which was strayd,
Her Amorettae called, to comfort her dismayed.
She brought her to her joyous Paradize,
Where most she wonnes, when she on earth does dwell.
So fair a place, as Nature can deuize:
Whether in Paphos, or Cytheron hill,
Or it in Gnidas be, I wot not well;
But well I wot by trial, that this same
All other pleasant places does excel,
And called is by her lost lovers name,
The Gardin of Adonis, far renowmd by fame.
In that same Gardin all the goodly slowres,
Wherewith dame Nature does her beautify,
And decks the girlonds of her Paramoures,
Are fetched: there is the first seminary
Of all things, that are borne to live and dye,
According to their kynds. Long work it were,
Here to account the endless progeny
Of all the weeds, that bud and blossom there;
But so much as does need, must needs be counted here.
It sited was in fruitful soil of old,
And girt in with two walls on either side;
The one of iron, the other of bright gold,
That none might thorough break, nor ouer-stride:
And double gates it had, which opened wide,
By which both in and out men moten pas;
The One fair and fresh, the other old and dride:
Old Genius the porter of them was,
Old Genius, the which a double nature has.
He lets in, he lets out to wend,
All that to come into the world desire;
A thousand thousand naked babes attend
About him day and night, which do require,
That he with fleshly weeds would them attire:
Such as him list, such as eternal fate
Ordained has, he clothes with sinful mire,
And sends forth to live in mortal state,
Till they again return back by the hinder gate.
After that they again returned been,
They in that Gardin planted be again;
And grow afresh, as they had never seen
Fleshly corruption, nor mortal pain.
Some thousand years so done they there remain,
And then of him are clad with other hew,
Orsent into the chaungefull world again,
Till thither they return, where first they grew:
So like a wheel arownd they run from old to new.
Ne needs there Gardener to set, or sow,
To plant or prune: for of their own accord
All things, as they created were, do grow,
And yet remember well the mighty word,
Which first was spoken by the Almighty lord,
That bad them to increase and multiply:
Ne do they need with water of the ford,
Or of the clouds to moysten their roots dry;
For in themselves eternal moisture they imply.
Infinite shapes of creatures there are bred,
And uncouth forms, which none yet ever knew,
And every sort is in a sundry bed
Set by it self, and ranckt in comely rue:
Some fit for reasonable sowlest'indew,
Some made for beasts, some made for birds to wear,
And all the fruitful spawne of fishes hew
In endless rancks along enraunged were,
That seemd the Ocean could not contain them there.
Daily they grow, and daily forth are sent
Into the world, it to replenish more,
Yet is the stock not lessened, nor spent,
But still remains in everlasting store,
As it at first created was of yore.
For in the wide womb of the world therelyes,
In hateful darkness and in deep horrore,
An huge eternal Chaos, which supplies
The substaunces of natures fruitful progenyes.
All things from thence do their first being fetch,
And borrow matter, where of they are made,
Which whenas form and feature it does ketch,
Becomes a body, and does then invade
The state of life, out of the griesly shade.
That substance is eterne, and bideth so,
Ne when the life decays, and form does fade,
Does it consume, and into nothing go,
But changed is, and often altered to and froe.
The substance is not chaungd, nor altered,
But the only form and outward fashion;
For every substance is conditioned
To change her hew, and sundry forms to don
Meet for her temper and complexion:
For forms are variable and decay,
By course of kind, and by occasion;
And that fair flower of beauty fades away,
As does the lilly fresh before the sunny ray.
Great enemy to it, and to all the rest,
That in the Gardin of Adonis springs,
Is wicked Time, who with his scyth addressed,
Does mow the flowring herbs and goodly things,
And all their glory to the ground down flings,
Where they do wither, and are fowly mard:
He flies about, and with his flaggy wings
Beats down both leaves and buds without regard,
Ne ever pity may relent his malice hard.
Yet pity often did the gods relent,
To see so fair things mard, and spoiled quight:
And their great mother Venus did lament
The loss of her dear brood, her dear delight:
Her heart was pierst with pity at the sight,
When walking through the Gardin, them she spyde,
Yet no'te she find redress for such despite:
For all that lives, is subject to that law:
All things decay in time, and to their end do draw.
But were it not, that Time their troubler is,
All that in this delightful Gardin grows,
Should happy be, and have immortal blis:
For here all plenty, and all pleasure flows,
And sweet love gentle fitts emongst them throws,
Without fell rancor, or fond gealosy;
Franckly each Paramor his leman knows,
Each bird his mate, ne any does envy
Their goodly meriment, and gay felicity.
There is continual Spring, and harvest there
Continual, both meeting at one time:
For both the boughs do laughing blossoms bear,
And with fresh colors deck the wanton Pryme,
And eke attonce the heavenly trees they clyme,
Which seem to labor under their fruits lode:
The whiles the joyous birds make their pastyme
Emongst the shady leaves, their sweet abode,
And their true loves without suspicion tell abroad.
Right in the midst of that Paradise,
There stood a stately Mount, on whose round top
A gloomy grove of myrtle trees did rise,
Whose shady boughs sharp steel did never lop,
Nor wicked beasts their tender buds did crop,
But like a girlond compassed the hight,
And from their fruitful sides sweet gum did drop,
That all the ground with precious deaw bedight,
Threw forth most dainty odours, and most sweet delight.
And in the thickest covert of that shade,
There was a pleasant Arbcr, not by art,
But of the trees own inclination made,
Which knitting their rank branches part to part,
With wanton yuie twyne entrayld athwart,
And Eglantine, and (...) among,
Fashiond above within their inmost part,
That nether Phoebus beams could through the^ thro^g,
Nor Aeolus sharp blast could work them any wrong.
And all about grew every sort of flower,
To which sad lovers were transformde of yore;
Fresh Hyacinihus, Phoebus paramoure,
Foolish (...), that likes the (...) shore,
Sad Amaranthus, made a flower but late,
Sad Amaranthus, in whose purple gore
Me seems I see Amyntas wretched fate,
To whom sweet Poets verse has given endless date.
There wont fair Venus often to enjoy
Her dear Adonis joyous company,
And reap sweet pleasure of the wanton boy:
There yet, some say, in secret he doesly,
Lapped in flowers and precious spycery,
By her hid from the world, and from the skill
Of Stygian Gods, which do her love envy;
But she her self, when ever that she will,
Possesses him, and of his sweetness takes her fill.
And sooth it seems they say: for he may not
For ever dye, and ever buried be
In balefull night, where all things are forgot;
All be he subject to mortality,
Yet is eterne in mutabilitie,
And by succession made perpetual,
Transformed often, and changed diversely:
For him the Father of all forms they call;
Therefore needs mote he live, that living gives to all.
There now he lives in eternal blis,
Ioying his goddess, and of her enjoyed:
Ne fears he henceforth that foe of his,
Which with his cruel tuske him deadly cloyd:
For that wild Bore, the which him once annoyd,
She firmly has emprisoned for ay,
That her sweet love his malice mote avoid,
In a strong rocky Cave, which is they say,
He wen underneath that Mount, that none him losen may.
There now he lives in everlasting joy,
With many of the Gods in company,
Which thither haunt, and with the winged boy
Sporting him self in safe felicity:
Who when he has with spoils and cruelty
Ransackt the world, and in the woeful hearts
Of many wretches set his triumphs hye,
Thither resortes, and laying his sad darts
Aside, with fair Adonis plays his wanton parts.
And his true love fair Psyche with him plays,
Fair Psyche to him lately reconcyld,
After long troubles and unmeet vpbrayes,
With which his mother Venus her reuyld,
And eke himself her cruelly exyld:
But now in steadfast love and happy state
She with him lives, and has him borne a child,
Pleasure, that does both gods and men aggrate,
Pleasure, the daughter of Cupid and Psyche late.
Hither great Venus brought this infant fair,
The younger daughter of Chrysogonee,
And unto Psyche with great trust and care
Committed her, yfostered to be,
And trained up in true feminitee:
Who no less carefully her tendered,
Then her own daughter Pleasure, to whom she
Made her companion, and her lessoned
In all the lore of love, and goodly womanhead.
In which when she to perfect ripenes grew,
Of grace and beauty noble Paragone,
She brought her forth into the worlds view,
To be th'ensample of true love alone,
And Lodestarre of all chaste affection,
To all fair Ladies, that do live on grownd.
To Faery court she came, where many one
Admyrd her goodly haueour, and fownd
His feeble heart wide launch with loves cruel wownd.
But she to none of them her love did cast,
Save to the noble knight Sir Scudamore,
To whom her loving heart she linked fast
In faithful love, to abide for evermore,
And for his dearest sake endured sore,
Sore trouble of an heinous enemy,
Who her would forced have to have for lore
Her former love, and sted fast loialty,
As ye may elsewhere read that ruefull history.
But well I ween, ye first desire to learn,
What end unto that fearful Damozell,
Which fledd so fast from that same foster stearne,
Whom with his brethren Timias slew, befell:
That was to weet, the goodly Florimell,
Who wandering for to seek her lover dear,
Her lover dear, her dearest Marinell,
Into misfortune fell, as ye did hear,
And from Prince Arthure fled with wings of idle fear.
Cant. VII.
The witches son loves Florimell:
She flies, he faines to die.
Satyrane saues the Sqnyre of Dames
From Gynunt, tyranny.
LIke as an Hynd forth singled from the heard,
That has escaped from a ravenous beast,
Yet flies away of her own feet afeard,
And every leaf, that shakes with the least
Murmr of wind, her terror has encreast;
So fledd fair Florimell from her vain fear,
Long after she from peril was releast:
Each shade she saw, and each noise he did hear,
Did seem to be the same, which she eseapt whileare.
All that same evening (...) in flying spent,
And all that night her course continewed:
Ne did shelet dull sleep once to relent,
Nor weariness to slack her have, but fled
Ever alike, as if her former dred
Were hard behind, her ready to arrest:
And her white Palfrey having conquered
The maistring raines out of her weary wrest,
Perforce her carried, where ever he thought best.
So long as breath, and hable puissaunce
Did native courage unto him supply,
His pace he freshly forward did advance,
And carried her beyond all ieopardy,
But naught that wants rest, can long aby.
He having through incessant traueill spent
His force, at last perforce adowne did ly,
Ne foot could further move: The Lady gent
Thereat was suddein struck with great astonishment.
And forced t'alight, on foot mote algates fare,
A traueiler unwonted to such way:
Need teaches her this lesson hard and rare,
That fortune all in equal lance does sway,
And mortal miseries does make her play.
So long she traueild, till at length she came
To an hills side, which did to her bewray
A little valley, subject to the same,
All couerd with thick woods, that quite it overcame.
Through the tops of the high trees she did descry
A little smoke, whose vapor thin and light,
Reeking aloft, vprolled to the sky:
Which, cheerful sign did send unto her sight,
That in the same did won some living wight.
Eftsoons her steps she thereunto applyd,
And came at last in weary wretched plight
Unto the place, to which her hope did guide,
To find some refuge there, and rest her weary side.
There in a gloomy hollow glen she found
A little cottage, built of sticks and reeds
In homely wize, and wald with sods around,
In which a witch did dwell, in loathly weeds,
And wilful want, all careless of her needs,
So choosing (...) to abide,
Far from all neighbors, that her devilish deeds
And hellish arts from people she might hide,
And hurt far off unknown, whom ever she envide.
The Damzell there arriving entered in;
Where sitting on the flore the Hag she found,
Busy (as seein'd) about some wicked gin:
Who soon as she beheld that suddein stound,
Lightly vpstarted from the dustie ground,
And with fell look and hollow deadly gaze
Stared on her awhile, as one astound,
Ne had one word to speak, for great amaze,
But showed by outward signs, that dread her sense did daze,
At last turning her fear to foolish wrath,
She asked, what devil had her thither brought,
And who she was, and what unwonted path
Had guided her, vnwelcomed, unsought.
To which the Damzell full of doubtful thought,
Her mildly answered; Beldame be not wroth
With silly Virgin by adventure brought
Unto your (...), ignorant and loath,
That crave but rowme to rest, while tempest ouerblo'th.
With that adowne out of her crystal eyne
Few trickling tears she softly forth let fall,
That like two orient perles, did purely shine
Upon her snowy cheek; and therewithal
She sighed soft, that none so bestiall,
Nor saluage heart, but ruth of her sad plight
Would make to melt, or pitteously appall;
And that vile Hag, all were her whole delight
In mischief, was much moved at so pitteous fight.
And began recomfort her in her rude wise,
With (...) compassion of her plaint,
Wiping the tears from her suffused eyes,
And bidding her sit down, to rest her faint
And weary limbs a while. She nothing quaint
Nors deignfull of so homely fashion,
Since brought she was now to so hard constraint,
Sat down upon the dusty ground anon,
As glad of that small rest, as Bird of tempest gone.
Tho began she gather up her garments rent,
And her loose locks to dight in order dew,
With golden wreath and gorgeous ornament;
Whom such whenas the wicked Hag did view,
She was astonished at her heavenly hew,
And doubted her to deem an earthly wight,
But or some Goddess, or of Dianes crew,
And thought her to adore with humble spright;
To Adore thing so divine as beauty, were but right.
This wicked woman had a wicked son,
The comfort of her age and weary days,
A laesy loord, for nothing good to done,
But stretched forth in idleness always,
Ne ever cast his mind to covet praise,
Or ply him self to any honest trade,
But all the day before the sunny rays
He used to slug, or sleep in slothful shade:
Such laesinesse both lewd and poor attonce him made.
He coming home at vndertime, there found
The fairest creature, that he ever saw,
Sitting beside his mother on the ground;
The sight whereof did greatly him adaw,
And his (...) thought with terror and with aw
So inly smot, that as one, which has gazed
On the bright Sun unawares, does soon withdraw
His feeble eyne, with too much brightness daz'd,
So stared he on her, and stood long while amazed.
Softly at last he began his mother ask,
What mister wight that was, and whence derived,
That in so strange disguizement there did mask,
And by what accident she there arrived:
But she, as one nigh of her wits deprived,
With naught but ghastly looks him answered,
Like to a ghost, that lately is revived
From Stygian shores, where late it wandered;
So both at her, and each at other wondered.
But the fair Virgin (...) so meek and myld,
That she to them (...) to embace
Her goodly port, and to their senses vyld,
Her gentle speech applyde, that in short space
She grew familiare in that desert place.
During which time, the Chorle through her so kind
And courteise use conceived affection bace,
And cast to love her in his brutish mind,
No love, but brutish lust, that was so beastly tind.
Closely the wicked flame his bowels brent,
And shortly grew into outrageous fire;
Yet had he not the heart, nor hardiment,
As unto her to utter his desire;
His caytiue thought durst not so high aspire,
But with soft sighs, and lovely semblaunces,
He ween'd that his affection entire
She should aread; many resemblaunces
To her he made, and many kind remembraunces.
Often from the forest wildings he did bring,
Whose sides empurpled were with (...),
And often young birds, which he had taught to sing
His maistresse praises, sweetly caroled,
Girlonds of flowers sometimes for her fair head
He fine would dight; sometimes the squirrell wild
He brought to her in bands, as conpuered
To be her thrall, his fellow servant vild;
All which, she of him took with countenance meek and mild.
But past awhile, when she fit season saw
To leave that desert mansion, she cast
In secret wize her self thence to withdraw,
For fear of mischief, which she did forecast
Might by the witch or by her son compast:
Her weary Palfrey closely, as she might,
Now well recovered after long repast,
In his proud furnitures she freshly dight,
His late miswandred ways now to remeasure right.
And early ere the dawning day appeard,
She forth issewed, and on her journey went;
She went in peril, of each noise affeard,
And of each shade, that did it self present;
For still she feared to be ouerhent,
Of that vile hag, or her uncivil son:
Who when too late awaking, well they kent,
That their fair guest was gone, they both begone
To make exceeding moan, as they had been undone.
But that lewd lover did the most lament
For her depart, that ever man did hear;
He knocked his breast with desperate intent,
And scratcht his face, and with his teeth did tear
His rugged flesh, and rent his ragged hear:
That his sad mother seeing his sore plight,
Was greatly woe begone, and began to fear,
Least his frail senses were emperisht quight,
And love to frenzy turned, since love is frantic hight.
All ways she sought, him to restore to plight,
With herbs, with charms, with counsel, and with tears,
But tears, nor charms, nor herbs, nor counsel might
Assuage the fury, which his entrails tears:
So strong is passion, that no reason hears.
Tho when all other helps she saw to fail,
She turned her self back to her wicked leares
And by her devilish arts thought to prevail,
To bring her back again, or work her final bale.
Estesoones out of her hidden cave she called
An hideous beast, of horrible aspect,
That could the stoutest courage have appald;
Monstrous, mishapt, and all his back was spect
With thousand spots of colors queint elect,
Thereto so swifte, that it all beasts did pas:
Like never yet did living (...) detect;
But likest it to an Hyena was,
That feeds on wemens flesh, as others feed on gras.
It forth she called, and gave it straight in charge,
Through thick and thin her to poursew apace,
Ne once to stay to rest, or breath at large,
Till her she had attaind, and brought in place,
Or quite deuourd her beauties (...) grace.
The Monster swifte as word, that from her went,
Went forth in haste, and did her footing trace
So sure and swiftly, through his perfect sent,
And passing speed, that shortly he her ouerhent.
Whom when the fearful Damzell nigh espide,
No need to bid her fast away to fly;
That ugly shape so sore her terrifide,
That it she shund no less, then dread to die,
And her flitt Palfrey did so well apply
His nimble feet to her conceived fear,
That whilst his breath did strength to him supply,
From peril free he her away did bear:
But when his force began fail, his pace began wex areare.
Which whenas she perceived, she was dismayed
At that same last extremity full sore,
And of her safety greatly grew afray d;
And now she began approach to the sea shore,
As it befell, that she could fly no more,
But yield her self to spoil of greediness.
Lightly she leaped, as a wight forlore,
From her dull horse, in desperate distress,
And to her feet betook her doubtful sickernesse.
Not half so fast the wicked Myrrha fled
From dread of her revenging fathers hond:
Nor half so fast to save her maydenhed,
Fled fearful Daphne on the AEgaean strond,
As Florimell fled from that Monster yond,
To reach the sea, ere she of him were raught:
For in the sea to drown her self she fond,
Rather then of the tyrant to be caught:
Thereto fear gave her wings, and need her courage taught.
It fortuned (high God did so ordain)
As she arrived on the roaring shore,
In mind to leap into the mighty maine,
A little bote lay hoving her before,
In which there slept a fisher old and pore,
The whiles his nets were drying on the (...):
Into the same she lept, and with the ore
Did thrust the shallop from the floting strand:
So safety fownd at sea, which she fownd not at land.
The Monster ready on the pray to sease,
Was of his forward hope deceived quight,
Ne durst assay to wade the (...) seas,
But greedily long gaping at the sight,
At last in vain was forced to turn his flight,
And tell the idle tidings to his Dame:
Yet to avenge his diuelishe despite,
He set upon her Palfrey (...) lame,
And slew him cruelly, (...) any reskew came.
And after having him embowelled,
To fill his hellish gorge, it chaunst a knight
To pass that way, as forth he traueiled;
Yt was a goodly Swain, and of great might,
As ever man that bloody field did fight;
But in vain sheows, that wont young knights bewitch,
And courtly services took no delight,
But rather ioyd to be, then seemen sich:
For both to be and seem to him was labor lich.
It was to weete the good Sir Satyrane,
That raungd abroad to seek adventures wild,
As was his wont in forest, and in plain;
He was all armd in rugged steel vnfilde,
As in the smoky forge it was compilde,
And in his (...) bore a Satyrs hedd:
He coming present, where the Monster vilde
Upon that milke-white (...) carcas fedd,
Unto his reskew ran, and greedily him spedd.
There well perceiud he, that it was the horse,
Whereon fair Florimell was wont to ride,
That of that feend was rent without remorse:
Much feared he, least ought did ill betide
To that fair Maid, the flower of (...) pride;
For her he dearly loved, and in all
His famous (...) highly magnifide:
Besides her golden girdle, which did fall
From her in flight, he fownd, that did him sore apall.
Full of sad fear, and doubtful agony,
Fiercely he flew upon that wicked feend,
And with huge strokes, and cruel battery
Him forced to leave his pray, for to attend
Him self from deadly danger to defend:
Full many wounds in his corrupted flesh
He did engraue, and much ell blood did spend,
Yet might not (...) him die, but aie more fresh
And fierce he still appeard, the more he did him thresh.
He wist not, how him to despoile of life,
Ne how to win the wished victory,
Since him he saw still stronger grow through strife,
And him self weaker through infirmity;
Greatly he grew enraged, and furiously
Hurling his sword away, he lightly lept
Upon the beast, that with great cruelty
Rored, and raged to be vnderkept:
Yet he perforce him held, and strokes upon him hept.
As he that strives to stop a suddein flood,
And in strong bancks his violence enclose,
Forces it swell above his wonted mood,
And largely ouerflow the fruitful plain,
That all the country seems to be a Maine,
And the rich furrows flote, all quite fordonne:
The woeful husbandman does loud complain,
To see his whole years labor lost so soon,
For which to God he made so many an idle boon.
So him he held, and did through might amate:
So long he held him, and him bett so long.
That at the last his (...) began (...),
And meekely stoup unto the victor strong:
Who to avenge the implacable wrong,
Which he supposed done to Florimell,
Sought by all means his dolor to prolong,
Since dint of steel his carcas could not quell:
His maker with her charms had framed him so well.
The golden ribband, which that virgin wore
About her sclender waste, he took in hand,
And with it bownd the beast. that loud did rore
For great despite of that unwonted band,
Yet dared not his victor to withstand,
But trembled like a lamb, fled from the pray,
And all the way him followd on the strand,
As he had long been learned to obey;
Yet never learned he such service, till that day.
Thus as he led the Beast along the way,
He spide far of a mighty Giauntesse,
Fast flying on a Courser dapled gray,
From a bold knight, that with great hardiness
Her hard pursewd, and sought for to suppress;
She bore before her lap a doleful Squire,
Lying athwart her horse in great distress,
Fast bounden hand and foot with cords of wire,
Whom she did mean to make the thrall of her desire.
Which whenas Satyrane beheld, in haste
He left his captive Beast at liberty,
And crossed the nearest way, by which he cast
Her to encounter, ere she passed by:
But she the way shund nathemore for thy,
But forward gallopt fast, which when he spyde,
His mighty spear he couched warily,
And at her ran: she having him descryde,
Her self to fight addressed, and threw her lode aside.
Like as a Goshauke, that in foot does bear
A trembling Culuer, having spide on hight
An Eagle, that with plumy wings does sheare
The subtle air, stouping with all his might,
The quarrey throws to ground with fell despite,
And to the batteill does her self prepare:
So ran the Geauntesse unto the fight;
Her fyrie eyes with furious sparks did stare,
And with blasphemous bannes high God in pieces tare
She caught in hand an huge great iron mace,
Wherewith she many had of life deprived;
But ere the stroke could seize his aimed place,
His spear amids her sun-brode shield arrived,
Yet nathemore the steel a sonder riu'd,
All were the beam in bigness like a mast,
Ne her out of the steadfast sadle driu'd,
But glauncing on the tempred metal, brast
In thousand shiuers, and so forth beside her past.
Her Steed did stagger with that puissaunt struck,
But she no more was moved with that might,
Then it had lighted on an aged Oak;
Or on the marble Pillour, that is pight
Upon the top of Mount Olympus hight,
For the brave youthly Champions to assay,
With burning charet wheels it night to smite:
But who that smites it, mars his joyous play,
And is the spectacle of ruinous decay.
Yet there with sore enraged, with stern regard
Her dreadful weapon she to him addressed,
Which on his helmet martelled so hard,
That made him low incline his lofty crest,
And bowd his battred visour to his breast:
Wherewith she was so stuned, that he n'ote ride
But reeled to and fro from east to west:
Which when his cruel enemy espyde,
She lightly unto him adjoined side to side;
And on his collar laying puissaunt hand,
Out of his wavering seat him plucked perforse,
Perforse him plucked, unable to withstand,
Or help himself, and laying thwart her horse,
In loathly wise like to a carrion corse,
She bore him fast away. Which when the knight,
That her pursewed, saw with great remorse,
He were was touched in his noble spright,
And began increase his speed, as she encreast her flight.
Whom when as nigh approaching she espyde,
She threw away her burden angrily;
For she list not the batteill to abide,
But made her self more light, away to fly:
Yet her the hardy knight pursewd so nigh
That almost in the back he often her struck:
But still when him at hand she did espy,
She turned, and semblaunce of fair fight did make;
But when he stayed, to flight again she did her take.
By this the good Sir Satyrane began wake
Out of his dream, that did him long entrance,
And seeing none in place, he began to make
Exceeding moan, and cursed that cruel chance,
Which reft from him so fair a cheuisaunce:
At length he spyde, whereas that woeful Squyre,
Whom he had reskewed from captiuaunce
Of his strong foe, lay tombled in the mire,
Unable to arise, or foot or hand to styre.
To whom approaching, well he more perceive
In that foul plight a comely personage,
And lovely face, made fit for to deceive
Frail Ladies heart with loves consuming rage,
Now in the blossom of his freshest age:
He reard him up, and loosd his iron bands,
And after began inquire his parentage,
And how he fell into the Gyaunts hands,
And who that was, which chaced her along the lands.
Then trembling yet through fear, the Squire bespake,
That Geauntesse Argante is behight,
A daughter of the Titans which did make
War against heaven, and heaped hills on hight,
To scale the skies, and put Jove from his right:
Her sire Typhoeus was, who mad through merth,
And drunk with blood of men, slain by his might,
Through incest, her of his own mother Earth
Whylome begot, being but half twin of that berth.
For at that berth another Babe she bore,
To weet the mighty Ollyphant, that wrought
Great wreake to many errant knights of yore,
Till him Child Thopas to confusion brought.
These twins, men say, (a thing far passing thought)
Whiles in their mothers womb enclosd they were,
Ere they into the lightsom world were brought,
In fleshly lust were mingled both yfere,
And in that monstrous wise did to the world appear.
So lived they ever after in like sin,
Against natures law, and good behaueoure:
But greatest shame was to that maiden twin,
Who not content so fowly to devour:
Her native flesh, and stain her brothers bower,
Did wallow in all other fleshly mire,
And suffered beasts her body to deflowre:
So whot she burned in that lustful fire,
Yet all that might not slake her sensual desire.
But over all the country she did raunge,
To seek young men, to (...) her (...) thrust,
And feed her fancy with delightful change:
Whom so she fittest finds to serve her lust,
Through her maine strength, in which she most does trust,
She with her bringes into a secret I Will,
Where in eternal bondage dye he must,
Orb the vassal of her pleasures vile,
And in all shameful sort him self with her defile.
Me seely wretch she so at vauntage caught,
After she long in wait for me did lie,
And meant unto her prison to have brought,
Her lothsom pleasure there to satisfye;
That thousand deaths me lever were to dye,
Then break the vow, that to fair Columbell
I plighted have, and yet keep steadfastly:
As for my name, it mistreth not to tell;
Call me the Squyre of Dames that me beseems well.
But that bold knight, whom ye pursuing saw
That Geauntesse, is not such, as she seemd,
But a fair virgin, that in martial law,
And deeds of arms above all (...) it deemd,
And above many knights is eke esteemd,
For her great worth; She Palladine is hight:
She you from death, you me from dread redeemd.
Ne any may that Monster match in fight,
But she, or (...) as she, that is so chaste a wight.
Her well beseemes that Quest (quoth Satyrane)
But read, thou Squyre of Dames, what vow is this,
Which thou upon thy self have lately taken,
That shall I you recount (quoth he) ywis,
So be ye pleased to pardon all amiss,
That gentle Lady, whom I love and serve,
After long suit and weary seruicis,
Did ask me, how I could her love deserve,
And how she might be sure, that I would never swerue.
I glad by any means her grace to gain,
Badd her command my life to save, or spill.
Eftsoons she badd me, with incessaunt pain
To wander through the world abroad at will,
And every where, where with my power or skill
I might do service unto gentle Dames,
That I the same should faithfully fulfill,
And at the twelve months end should bring their names
And pledges; as the spoils of my victorious games.
So well I to fair Ladies service did,
And found such favor in their loving hearts,
That ere the year his course had compassid,
Three hundred pledges for my good desartes,
And thrice three hundred thanks for my good parts
I with me brought, and did to her present:
Which when she saw, more bent to eke my (...),
Then to reward my trusty true intent,
She began for me devise a grievous punishment.
To weet, that I my traueill should resume,
And with like labor walk the world arownd,
Ne ever to her presence should presume,
Till I so many other Dames had fownd,
The which, for all the suit I could propownd,
Would me refuse their pledges to afford,
But did abide for ever chaste and sownd.
Ah gentle Squyre (quoth he) tell at one word,
How many (...) thou such to put in thy record?
In deed Sir knight (said he) one word may tell
All, that I ever fownd so wisely stayed;
For only three they were disposd so well,
And yet three years I now abroad have strayd,
To find them out. Mote I (then laughing said
The knight) inquire of thee, what were those three,
The which thy proffred courtesy denayd?
Or ill they seemed sure auizd to be,
Or brutishly brought up, that neu'r did fashions see.
The first which then refused me (said he)
Certes was but a common Courtisane,
Yet (...) refusd to have ado with me,
Because I could not give her many a Jane.
(Thereat full heartily laughed Satyrane)
The second was an holy Nun to chose,
Which would not let me be her Chappellane,
Because she knew, she said, I would disclose
Her counsel, if she should her trust in me repose.
The third a Damzell was of low degree,
Whom I in country cottage fownd by chance;
Full little weened I, that chastitee
Had lodging in so mean a maintenance,
Yet was she fair, and in her countenance
Dwelt simple truth in seemly fashion.
Long thus I wooed her with dew obseruaunce,
In hope unto my pleasure to have won,
But was as far at last, as when I first begone.
Safe her, I never any woman found,
That chastity did for it self embrace,
But were for other causes firm and sound,
Either for want of handsome time and place,
Or else for fear of shame and foul disgrace.
Thus am I hopeless ever to attain
My Ladies love, in such a desperate case,
But all my days am like to waste in vain,
Seeking to match the chaste with th'vnchaste Ladies train.
Perdy, (said Satyrane) thou Squyre of Dames,
Great labor fondly have thou hent in hand,
To get small thanks, and there with many blames,
That may emongst Alcides labors stand.
Thence bace returning to the former land,
Where late he left the Beast, he overcame,
He found him not; for he had broke his band,
And was returned again unto his Dame,
To tell what tidings of fair Florimell became.
Cant. VIII.
The Witch creates a snowy Lady,
like to Florimell,
Who wronged by Carle by Proteus saved,
is sought by Paridell.
SO often as I this history record,
My heart does melt with mere compassion,
To think, how causeless of her own accord
This gentle Damzell, whom I write upon,
Should plonged be in such affliction,
Without all hope of comfort or relief,
That sure I ween, the hardest heart of stone,
Would hardly find to aggrauate her grief;
For misery craves rather mercy, then repriefe.
But that accursed Hag, her hostess late,
Had so enranckled her malicious heart,
That she desyrd th'abridgement of her fate,
Or long enlargement of her painful smart.
Now when the Beast, which by her wicked art
Late forth she sent, she back retourning spyde,
Tide with her golden girdle, it a part
Of her rich spoils, whom he had erst destroyed,
She weend, and wondrous gladness to her heart applyde.
And with it ronning hast'ly to her son,
Thought with that sight him much to have reliu'd;
Who thereby deeming sure the thing as done,
His former grief with fury fresh revived,
Much more then erst, and would have algates riu'd
The heart out of his breast: for since her dedd
He surely dempt, himself he thought deprived
Quite of all hope, wherewith he long had fedd
His foolish malady, and long time had misledd.
With thought whereof, exceeding mad he grew,
And in his rage his mother would have slain,
Had she not fled into a secret mew,
Where she was wont her Sprightes to entertain
The masters of her art: there was she feign
To call them all in order to her aid,
And them conjure upon eternal pain,
To counsel her so carefully dismayed,
How she might heal her son, whose senses were decayed.
By their device, and her own wicked wit,
She there deuiz'd a wondrous work to frame,
Whose like on earth was never framed yet,
That even Nature self enuide the same,
And grudged to see the counterfeit should shame
The thing it self: In hand she boldly took
To make another like the former Dame,
Another Florimell, in shape and look
So lively and so like, that many it mistook.
The substance, whereof she the body made,
Was purest snow in massy mould congeald,
Which she had gathered in a shady glade
Of the Riphoean hills, to her reueald
By errant Sprights, but from all men conceald:
The same she tempred with fine Mercury,
And virgin wex, that never yet was sealed,
And mingled them with perfect vermily,
That like a lively sanguine it seemd to the eye.
In stead of eyes two burning lamps she set
In silver sockets, shyning like the skies,
And a quick moving Spirit did arret
To stir and roll them, like to women's eyes;
In stead of yellow locks she did deuyse,
With golden wyre to weaue her curled head;
Yet golden wyre was not so yellow thryse
As Florimells fair hear: and in the stead
Of life, she put a Spright to rule the carcas dead.
A wicked Spright yfraught with fawning guyle,
And fair resemblance above all the rest,
Which with the Prince of Darkness fell lome while;
From heavens blis and everlasting rest,
Him needed not instruct, which way were best
Him self to fashion likest Florimell,
Ne how to speak, ne how to use his gest,
For he in counterfesaunce did excel,
And all the wyles of wemens wits knew passing well.
Him shaped thus, she decked in garments gay,
Which Florimell had left behind her late,
That who so then her saw, would surely say,
It was her self, whom it did imitate,
Or fayrer then her self, if ought algate
Might fayrer be. And then she forth her brought
Unto her son, that lay in feeble state;
Who seeing her began straight vpstart, and thought
She was the Lady self, who he so long had sought.
Tho fast her clipping twixt his arms twain,
Extremely ioyed in so happy sight,
And soon forgot his former sickely pain;
But she, the more to seem such as she hight,
Coyly rebutted his embracement light;
Yet still with gentle countenance retained,
Enough to hold a fool in vain delight:
Him long she so with shadows entertained,
As her Creatresse had in charge to her ordained.
Till on a day, as he disposed was
To walk the woods with that his Idol fair,
Her to disport, and idle time to pas,
In the open freshnes of the gentle air,
A knight that way there chanced to repair;
Yet knight he was not, but a boastfull swain,
That deeds of arms had ever in despair,
Proud Braggadocchio, that in vaunting vain
His glory did repose, and credit did maintain.
He seeing with that Chorle so fair a wight,
Decked with many a costly ornament,
Much merueiled thereat, as well he might,
And thought that match a foul disparagement:
His bloody spear eftesoones he boldly bent
Against the silly clown, who dead through fear,
Fell straight to ground in great astonishment;
Villein (said he) this Lady is my dear,
Die, if thou it gainesay: I will away her bear.
The fearful Chorle durst not gainesay, nor do,
But trembling stood, and yielded him the pray;
Who finding little leisure her to woo,
On Tromparts steed her mounted without stay,
And without reskew led her quite away.
Proud man himself then Braggadochio deemed,
And next to none, after that happy day,
Being possessed of that spoil, which seemed
The fairest wight on ground, and most of men esteemed.
But when he saw him self free from poursute,
He began make gentle purpose to his Dame,
With terms of love and lewdness dissolute;
For he could well his glozing speeches frame
To such vain uses, that him best became:
But she thereto would lend but light regard,
As seeming sorry, that she ever came
Into his power, that used her so hard,
To reaue her honor, which she more then life prefard.
Thus as they two of kindness treated long,
There them by chance encountered on the way
An armed knight, upon a courser strong,
Whose trampling feet upon the hollow lay
Seemed to thunder, and did nigh affray
That Capons courage: yet he looked grim,
And faynd to cheer his lady in dismay,
Who seemd for fear to quake in every lim,
And her to save from outrage, meekely prayed him.
Fiercely that stranger forward came, and nigh
Approaching, with bold words and bitter threat,
Bad that same boaster, as he mote, on high
To leave to him that lady for excheat,
Or bide him batteill without further treat.
That challenge did too peremptory seem,
And filled his senses with abashment great;
Yet seeing nigh him ieopardy extreme,
He it dissembled well, and light seemd to esteem.
Saying, Thou foolish knight, that weenst with words
To steal away, that I with blows have won,
And brought through points of many perilous swords:
But if thee list to see thy Courser run,
Or prove thy self, this sad encounter shonne,
And seek else without hazard of thy hedd.
At those proud words that other knight begone
To wex exceeding wroth, and him aredd
To turn his steed about, or sure he should be dedd.
Since then (said Braggadochio) needs thou will
Thy days abridge, through proof of puissaunce,
Turn we our steeds, that both in equal tilt
May meet again, and each take happy chance.
This said they both a furlongs mountenaunce
Retird their steeds, to run in even race:
But Braggadochio with his bloody lance
Once having turned, no more returned his face,
But left his love to loss, and fled him self apace.
The knight him seeing fly, had no regard
Him to poursew, but to the lady rode,
And having her from Trompart lightly reard,
Upon his Courser set the lovely lode,
And with her fled away without abode.
Well weened he, that fairest Florimell
It was, with whom in company he yode,
And so her self did always to him tell;
So made him think him self in heaven, that was in hell.
But Florimell her self was far away,
Driven to great distress by fortune strange,
And taught the careful Mariner to play,
Since late mischaunce had her compeld to change
The land for sea, at randon there to raunge:
Yett there that cruel Queen auengeresse,
Not satisfyde so far her to estraunge
From courtly blis and wonted happiness,
Did heap on her new waves of weary wretchedness.
For being fled into the fishers bote,
For refuge from the Monsters cruelty,
Long so she on the mighty maine did flote,
And with the tide drove forward carelessly,
For the air was mild, and cleared was the sky,
And all his winds Dan Aeolus did keep,
From stirring up their stormy enmity,
As pitying to see her wail and weep;
But all the while the fisher did securely sleep.
At last when droncke with drowsinesse, he woke,
And saw his drouer drive along the stream,
He was dismayed, and thrice his breast he stroke,
For marueill of that accident extreme;
But when he saw, that blazing beauties beam,
Which with rare light his bote did beautifye,
He marueild more, and thought he yet did dream
Not well awakte, or that some extasye
Assotted had his sense, or dazed was his eye.
But when her well auizing, he peceiu'd
To be no vision, nor fantastic sight,
Great comfort of her presence he conceived,
And felt in his old courage new delight
To gin awake, and stir his frosen spright:
Tho rudely askte her, how she thither came.
Ah (said she) father I note read aright,
What hard misfortune brought me to this same;
Yet am I glad that here I now in fafety ame.
But thou good man, since far in sea we be,
And the great waters gin apace to swell,
That now no more we can the mayn-land see,
Have care, I pray, to guide the cock-bote well,
Least worse on sea then us on land befell,
Thereat the old man did naught but fondly grin,
And said, his boat the way could wisely tell:
But his deceiptfull eyes did never lin,
To look on her fair face, and mark her snowy skin.
The sight whereof in his congealed flesh,
Infixt such secret sting of greedy lust,
That the dry withered stock it began refresh,
And kindled heat, that soon in flame forth brust:
The driest wood is soonest burnt to dust.
Rudely to her he lept, and his rough hand
Where ill became him, rashly would have thrust,
But she with angry scorn him did withstond,
And shamefully reprou'd for his ru denes fond.
But he, that never good nor manners knew,
Her sharp rebuke full little did esteem;
Hard is to teach an old horse amble true.
The inward smoke, that did before but steeme,
Broke into open fire and rage extreme,
And now he strength began add unto his will,
Forcyng to do, that did him foul misseeme:
Beastly he threw her down, ne cared to spill
Her garments gay with scales of fish, that all did fill.
The silly virgin strove him to withstand,
All that she might, and him in vain reuild:
Sheestrugled strongly both with foot and hand,
To save her honor from that villain vilde,
And cride to heaven, from humane help exild.
O ye brave knights, that boast this Ladies love,
Where be ye now, when she is nigh defild
Of filthy wretch? well may she you reprove
Of falsehood or of sloth, when most it may behoue.
But if that thou, Sir Satyran, did weete,
Or thou, Sir Peridure, her sorry state,
How soon would ye assemble many a fleet,
To fetch from sea, that ye at land lost late;
Towers, cities, kingdoms ye would ruinate,
In your auengement and dispiteous rage,
Ne ought your burning fury mote abate;
But if Sir Calidore could it presage,
No living creature could his cruelty assuage.
But since that none of all her knights is nigh,
See how the heavens of voluntary grace,
And sovereign favor toward chastity,
Doesuccor send to her distressed case:
So much high God does innocence embrace.
It fortuned, whilst thus she stiffly strove,
And the wide sea importuned long space
With shrilling shriekes, Proteus abroad did roue,
Along the fomy waves driving his finny drove.
Proteus is Shepherd of the seas of yore,
And has the charge of Neptunes mighty heard,
An aged sire with head all frowy hoar,
And sprinkled frost upon his deawy beard:
Who when those pitiful outcries he heard,
Through all the seas so ruefully resownd,
His charett swifte in have he thither steard,
Which with a teeme of scaly Phocas bownd
Was drawn upon the waves, that fomed him arownd.
And coming to that Fishers wandering bote,
That (...) at will, withouten card or sail,
He therein saw that yrkesome sight, which smote
Deep indignation and compassion frail
Into his heart attonce: straight did he hayle
The greedy villein from his hoped pray,
Of which he now did very little fail,
And with his staff, that drives his heard astray,
Him bett fo sore, that life and sense did much dismay.
The whiles the pitteous Lady up did rise,
Ruffled and fowly raid with filthy soil,
And blubbred face with tears of her fair (...)
Her heart nigh broken was with weary toil,
To save her self from that outrageous spoil,
But when she looked up, to weet, what wight
Had her from so infamous fact assoyld,
For shame, but more for fear of his grim sight,
Down in her lap she hid her face, and lowdly shright.
Herself not saved yet from danger dredd
She thought, but chaung'd from one to other fear;
Like as a fearful partridge, that is fledd
From the sharp hawk, which her attached near,
And falls to ground, to seek for succor theare,
Whereas the hungry Spaniells she does spy,
With greedy jaws her ready for to tear;
In such distress and sad perplexity
Was Florimell, when Proteus she did see her by.
But he endeavored with speeches mild
Her to recomfort, and accourage bold,
Bidding her fear no more her foeman vilde,
Nor doubt himself; and who he was her told.
Yet all that could not from affright her hold,
Ne to recomfort her at all preuayld;
For her faint heart was with the frosen cold
Benumbd so inly, that her wits nigh fayld,
And all her senses with abashment quite were quayld.
Her up betwixt his rugged hands he reard,
And with his frory lips full softly kissed,
Whiles the cold ysickles from his rough beard,
Dropped adowne upon her yuory breast:
Yet he him self so busily addressed,
That her out of astonishment he wrought,
And out of that same fishers filthy nest
Removing her, into his charet brought,
And there with many gentle terms her fair besought.
But that old leachour, which with bold assault
That beauty durst presume to violate,
He cast to punish for his heinous fault;
Then took he him yet trembling since of late,
And tide behind his charet, to aggrate
The virgin, whom he had abusde so sore:
So dragged him through the waves in scornful state,
And after cast him up, upon the shore;
But Florimell with him unto his bower he bore.
His bower is in the bottom of the maine,
Under a mighty rock, against which do rave
The roaring billows in their proud disdain,
That with the angry working of the wave,
Therein is eaten out an hollow cave,
That seems rough Masons hand with engines keen
Had long while labored it to engraue:
There was his won, ne (...) wight was seen,
Save one old Nymph, high (...) to keep it clean.
Thither he brought the sorry Florimell,
And entertained her the best he might
And Panope her entertaind eke well,
As an immortal mote a mortal wight,
To win her liking unto his delight:
With flattering words he sweetly wooed her,
And offered fair guiftes, t'allure her sight,
But she both offers and the offerer
Despysde, and all the sawning of the flatterer.
Daily he tempted her with this or that,
And never suffered her to be at rest:
But evermore she him refused flat,
And all his fained kindness did detest.
So firmly she had sealed up her breast.
Sometimes he boasted, that a God he hight:
But she a mortal creature loved best:
Then he would make him self a mortal wight;
But then she said she loved none, but a Faery knight.
Then like a (...) knight him self he dressed;
For every shape on him he could endew:
Then like a king he was to her expressed,
And offered kingdoms unto her in view,
To be his Leman and his Lady true:
But when all this he nothing saw prevail,
With harder means he cast her to subdew,
And with sharp threats her often did assail,
So thinking for to make her stubborn courage quayle.
To dreadful shapes he did him self transform,
Now like a Gyaunt, now like to a feend,
Then like a Centaure, then like to a storm,
Raging within the waves: thereby he weend
Her will to win unto his wished eend.
But when with fear, nor favor, nor with all
He else could do, he saw him self esteemd,
Down in a Dongeon deep he let her fall,
And threatened there to make her his eternal thrall.
Eternal thraldom was to her more liefe,
Then loss of chastity, or change of love:
Dye had she rather in tormenting grief,
Then any should of falsenesse her reprove,
Or loosenes, that she lightly did remove.
Most virtuous virgin, glory be thy meed,
And crown of heavenly praise with Saints above,
Where most sweet hymmes of this thy famous deed
Are still emongst them song, that far my rymes exceed.
Fit song of Angels caroled to be,
But yet what so my feeble Muse can frame,
Shall be t'aduance thy goodly chastitee,
And to enroll thy memorable name,
In the heart of every honorable Dame,
That they thy virtuous deeds may imitate,
And be partakers of thy endless fame.
Yt yrkes me, leave thee in this woeful state,
To tell of Satyrane, where I him left of late.
Who having ended with that Squyre of Dames
A long discourse of his adventures vain,
The which himself, then Ladies more defames,
And finding not the Hyena to be slain,
With that same Squyre, returned back again
To his first way. And as they forward went,
They spyde a knight fair pricking on the plain,
As if he were on some adventure bent,
And in his port appeared manly hardiment.
Sir Satyrane him toward did address,
To weet, what wight he was, and what his quest:
And coming nigh, eftsoons he began to guess
Both by the burning heart, which on his breast
He bare, and by the colors in his crest,
That Paridell it was. Tho to him yode,
And him saluting, as beseemed best,
Began first inquire of tydinges far abroad;
And afterward, on what adventure now he rode.
Who thereto answering said, The tydinges bad,
Which now in Faery court all men do tell,
Which turned has great mirth, to mourning sad,
Is the late ruin of proud Marinell,
And suddein parture of fair Florimell,
To find him forth: and after her are gone
All the brave knights, that done in arms excel,
To sauegard her, ywandred all alone;
Emongst the rest my lot (vnworthy') is to be one.
Ah gentle knight (said then Sir Satyrane)
Thy labor all is lost, I greatly dread,
That have a thanklesse service on thee taken,
And offrest sacrifice unto the dead:
For dead, I surely doubt, thou may aread
Henceforth for ever Florimell to be,
That all the noble knights of Maydenhead,
Which her adored, may sore repent with me,
And all fair Ladies may for ever sorry be.
Which words when Paridell had heard, his hew
Began greatly chaung and seemd dismayed to be,
Then said, Fair Sir, how may I ween it (...),
That ye do tell in such vncerteintee?
Or speak ye of report, or did ye see
Just cause of dread, that makes ye doubt so sore?
For perdie else how mote it ever be,
That ever hand should dare for to engore
Her noble blood? the heuens such cruelty abhore.
These eyes did see, that they will ever rue
To have seen, (quoth he) when as a monstrous beast
The Palfrey, whereon she did travel, slew,
And of his bowels made his bloody feast:
Which speaking token shows at the least
Her certain loss, if not her sure decay:
Besides, that more suspicion encreast,
I found her golden girdle cast astray,
Distaynd with dirt and blood, as relic of the pray.
Ay me, (said Pauidell) the (...) be sadd,
And but God turn the same to good sooth say,
That Ladies safety is sore to be dradd:
Yet will I not forsake my forward way,
Till trial do more certain truth bewray.
Fair Sir (quoth. he) well may it you succed,
Ne long shall Satyrane behind you stay,
But to the rest, which in this Quest proceed
My labor add, and be partaker of their speed.
Ye noble knights (said then the Squyre of Dames)
Well may ye speed in so praise worthy pain:
But since the Sun now ginnes to slake his beams,
In deawy vapors of the western main,
And lose the teme out of his weary wayne,
Mote not mislike you also to abate
Your zealous have, till morrow next again
Both light of heaven, and strength of men relate:
Which if ye please, to yonder castle turn your gate.
That counsel pleased well; so all yfere
Forth marched to a Castle them before,
Where soon arryuing, they restrained were
Of ready entrance, which ought evermore
To errant knights be commune: wondrous (...)
Thereat displeasd they were, till that young Squyre
Began them inform the cause, why that same door
Was shut to all, which lodging did desire:
The which to let you weet, will further time require.
Cant. IX.
Malbecco will no strange knights host,
For peevish gealosy:
Paridell giusts with Britomart:
both show their auncestry.
REdoubted knights, and honorable Dames,
To whom I level all my labors end,
Right sore I fear, least with unworthy blames
This odious argument my rymes should shend,
Or ought your goodly patience offend,
Whiles of a wanton Lady I do write,
Which with her loose incontinence does blend
The shyning glory of your sovereign light;
And knighthood foul defaced by a faithless knight.
But never let th'ensample of the bad
Offend the good: for good by paragone
Of evil, may more notably be rad,
As white seems fayrer, macht with black attonce;
Ne all are shamed by the fault of one:
For lo in heaven, whereas all goodness is,
Emongst the Angels, a whole legione
Of wicked Sprightes did fall from happy blis;
What wonder then, if one of women all did mis?
Then listen Lordings, if ye list to weet
The cause, why (...) and Paridell
(...) not be entertaynd, as seemed meet,
Into that (...) (as that Squyre does tell.)
Therein a (...) crabbed Carle does dwell,
That has no skill of Court nor courtesy,
Ne cares, what men say of him ill or well;
For all his days he drownes in priuitie,
Yet has full large to live, and spend at liberty.
But all his mind is set on mucky pelf,
To hoord up heaps of evil gotten mass,
For which he others wrongs and wreckes himself;
Yet is he lincked to a lovely less,
Whose beauty does her bounty far surpass,
The which to him both far unequal years,
And also far unlike conditions has;
For she does joy to playemongst her pears,
And to be free from hard restraynt and gealous fears.
But he is old, and withered like hay,
Unfit fair Ladies service to supply,
The privy guilt whereof makes him always
Suspect her truth, and keep continual spy
Upon her with his other blincked eye;
Ne suffers he resort of living wight
Approach to her, ne keep her company,
But in close bower her mewes from all men's sight,
(...) of kindly joy and natural delight.
Malbecco he, and Hellenore she hight,
Unfitly yokt together in one teeme,
That is the cause, why never any knight
Is suffered here to enter, but he seem
Such, as no doubt of him he need misdeeme.
Thereat Sir Satyrane began smyle, and say;
Extremely mad the man I surely deem,
That weenes with watch and hard restraynt to stay
A woman's will, which is disposd to go astray.
In vain he fears that, which he cannot shonne:
For who wotes not, that woman's subtiltyes
Can guylen Argus, when she list disdonne?
It is not iron bands, nor hundred eyes,
Nor brazen walls, nor many wakefull spies,
That can withhold her wilful wandering feet,
But fast goodwill with gentle courtesyes,
And timely service to her pleasures meet
May her perhaps contain, that else would algates fleet.
Then is he not more mad (said Paridell)
That has himself unto such service sold,
In doleful thraldom all his days to dwell?
For sure a fool I do him firmly hold,
That loves his fetters, though they were of gold.
But why do we devise of others ill,
Whiles thus we suffer this same (...) old,
To keep us out, in scorn of his own will,
And rather do not ransack all, and him self kill?
Nay let us first (said Satyrane) entreat
The man by gentle means, to let us in,
And afterward affray with cruel threat,
Ere that we to efforce it do begin:
Then if all fail, we will by force it win,
And eke reward the wretch for his mesprise,
As may be worthy of his hayno us sin.
That counsel pleased: then Paridell did rise,
And to the Castle gate approcht in quiet wise.
Where at soft knocking, entrance he desyrd.
The good man self, which then the Porter played,
Him answered, that all were now retyrd
Unto their rest, and all the keys conuayd
Unto then master, who in bed was laid,
That none him durst awake out of his dreme;
And therefore them of patience gently prayed.
Then Paridell began to change his theme,
And threatened him with force and punishment extreme.
But all in vain; for naught mote him relent,
And now so long before the wicket fast
They waited, that the night was forward spent,
And the fair welkin fowly ouercast,
Began blown up a bitter stormy blast,
With shower and hayle (...) horrible and dred,
That this fair many were compeld at last,
To fly for succor to a little shed,
The which beside the gate for sivyne was ordered.
It fortuned, soon after they were gone,
Another knight, whom tempest thither brought,
Came to that Castle, and with earnest moan,
Like as the rest, late entrance dear besought;
But like so as the rest he prayed for naught,
For flatly he of entrance was refusd.
Sorely thereat he was displeasd, and thought
How to avenge himself so sore abusd,
And evermore the Carle of courtesy accusd.
But to avoid th'intollerable stowre,
He was compeld to seek some refuge near,
And to that shed, to shroud him from the shower,
He came, which full of guests he found whyleare,
So as he was not let to enter there:
Whereat he began to wex exceeding wroth,
And swore, that he would lodge with them yfere,
Or them dislodg, all were they liefe or loath;
And so defyde them each, and so desyde them both.
Both were full loath to leave that needful tent,
And both full loath in darkness to debate;
Yet both full liefe him lodging to have lent,
And both full liefe his boasting to abate;
But chiefly Paridell his heart did grate,
To hear him threaten so despightfully,
As if he did a dog in kenell rate,
That durst not bark; and rather had he die,
Then when he was defyde, in coward corner ly.
Tho hastily remounting to his steed,
He forth issew'd; like as a boystrous wind,
Which in th'earthes hollow caves has long ben hid,
And shut up fast within her prisons blind,
Makes the huge element against her kind
To move, and tremble as it were aghast,
Until that it an issew forth may find;
Then forth it breaks, and with his furious blast
Confounds both land and seas, and skies does ouercast.
Their steel-(...) spears they strongly coucht, and met
Together with impetuous rage and forse,
That with the terror of their fierce affret,
They rudely drove to ground both man and horse,
That each a while lay like a senseless corse.
But Paridell (...) bruised with the blow,
Could not arise, the counterchaunge to scorse,
Till that young Squyre him reared from below;
Then drew he his bright sword, and began about him throw
But Saiyrane forth stepping, did them stay
And with fair treaty pacifide their ire;
Then when they were accorded from the fray,
Against that Castles Lord they began conspire,
To heap on him dew vengeance for his hire.
They been agreed, and to the gates they go
To burn the same with unquenchable fire,
And that discourteous Carle their commune foe
To do foul death to die, or wrap in grievous woe.
Malbecco seeing them resolud in deed
To flame the gates, and hearing them to call
For fire in earnest, ran with fearful speed,
And to them calling from the castle wall,
Besought them humbly, him to bear with all,
As ignorant of servants bad abuse,
And slack attendaunce unto strangers call,
The knights were willing all things to excuse,
Though naught beleu'd, and entrau^ce late did not refuse.
They been ybrought into a comely bower,
And serud of all things that mote needful be;
Yet secretly their (...) did on them lowre,
And welcomde more for fear, then charitee;
But they dissembled, what they did notsee,
And welcomed themselves. Each began vndight
Their garments wett, and weary armor free,
To dry them selves by Vulcanes flaming light,
And eke their lately bruzed parts to bring in plight.
And eke that stranger knight emongst the rest;
Was for like need enforst to disaray:
Tho whenas veiled was her lofty crest,
Her golden locks, that were in tramells gay
Vpbounden, did them selves adowne display,
And raught unto her heels; like sunny beams,
That in a cloud their light did long time stay,
Their vapor vaded, show their golden gleames,
And through the (...) air shoot forth their azure (...).
She also (...) her heavy haberieon,
Which the fair feature of her limbs did hyde,
And her well plighted frock, which she did won
To tucke about her short, when she did ride,
She low let fall, that flowd from her lanck side
Down to her foot, with careless modestee.
Then of them all she plainly was espyde,
To be a woman wight, vnwist to be,
The fairest woman wight, that ever eye did see.
Like as Bellona, being late returned
From slaughter of the Giaunts conquered;
Where proud Encelade, whose wide nosethrils burnd
With breathed flames, like to a furnace redd,
Transfixed with her spear, down tombled dedd
From top of Hemus, by him heaped hye;
Has loosd her helmet from her lofty hedd,
And her Gorgonian shield gins to untie
From her left arm, to rest in glorious victory.
Which whenas they beheld, they smitten were
With great amazement of so wondrous sight,
And each on other, and they all on her
Stood gazing, as if suddein great affright
Had them surprizd. At last auizing right,
Her goodly personage and glorious hew,
Which they so much mistook, they took delight
In their first error, and yett still anew
With wonder of her beauty (...) their hongry view.
Yet note their hongry view be satisfide,
But seeing still the more desired to see,
And ever firmly fixed did abide
In contemplation of diuinitee:
But most they meruaild at her cheualree,
And noble prowess, which they had approved,
That much they faynd to know, who she mote be;
Yet none of all them her thereof amou'd,
Yet every one her likte, and every one her loved.
And Paridell though partly discontent
With his late fall, and foul indignity,
Yet was soon won his malice to relent,
Through gracious regard of her fair eye,
And knightly worth, which he too late did try,
Yet tried did adore. Supper was dight;
Then they Malbecco prayed of courtesy,
That of his lady they might have the sight,
And company at meat, to do them more delight.
But he to shifte their curious request,
Began causen, why she could not come in place;
Her crased health, her late recourse to rest,
And humid evening ill for sick folks case,
But none of those excuses could take place;
Ne would they eat, till she in presence came.
She came in presence with right comely, grace,
And fairly them saluted, as became,
And showed her self in all a gentle courteous Dame.
They sat to meat, and Satyrane his chance,
Was her before, and Paridell beside;
But he him self sat looking still askaunce,
Against Britomart, and ever closely eide
Sir Satyrane, with glaunces might not glide:
But his blind eye, that sided Paridell,
All his demeasnure from his sight did hide:
On her fair face so did he feed his fill,
And sent close messages of love to her at will.
And ever and anon, when none was ware,
With speaking looks, that close embassage bore,
He rou'd at her, and told his secret care:
For all that art he learned had of yore.
Ne was she ignorant of that lewd lore,
But in his eye his meaning wisely redd,
And with the like him aunswerd evermore:
She sent at him one fyrie dart, whose hedd
Empoisned was with privy lust, and gealous dredd.
He from that deadly throw made no defense,
But to the wound his weak heart opened wide;
The wicked engine through false influence,
Past through his eyes, and secretly did glyde
Into his heart, which it did sorely gryde.
But nothing new to him was that same pain,
Ne pain at all; for he so often had tryde
The power thereof, and loved so often in vain,
That thing of course he counted, love to entertain.
Thenceforth to her he sought to intimate
His inward grief, by means to him well known,
Now Bacchus sruit out of the silver plate
He on the table dashed, as overthrown,
Or of the fruitful liquor overflowed,
And by the dancing bubbles did divine,
Or therein write to let his love be shown;
Which well she redd out of the learned line,
A sacrament profane in mystery of wine.
And when so of his hand the pledge she raught,
The guilty cup she fained to mistake,
And in her lap did shed her idle draught,
Showing desire her inward flame to slake:
By such close signs they secret way did make
Unto their wills, and one eyes watch escape;
Two eyes him needs, for to watch and wake,
Who lovers will deceive. Thus was the ape,
By their fair handling, put into Malbeccoes cape.
Now when of meats and drinks they had their fill,
Purpose was moved by that gentle Dame,
Unto those knights aduenturous, to tell
Of deeds of arms, which unto them became,
And every one his kindred, and his name.
Then Paridell, in whom a kindly pride
Of gracious speech, and skill his words to frame
Abounded, being yglad osso fit tide
Him to commend to her, thus spoke, of al well eide.
Troy, that art now naught, but an idle name,
And in thine ashes buried low do lie,
Though whilome far much greater then thy fame,
Before that angry Gods, and cruel sky
Upon thee heapt a direful destiny,
What boots it boast thy glorious descent,
And fetch from heaven thy great genealogy,
Since all thy worthy praises being blent,
Their offspring has embaste, and later glory shent.
Most famous Worthy of the world, by whom
That war was kindled, which did Troy inflame,
And stately towers of Ilion whilome
Brought unto balefull ruin, was by name
Sir Paris far renowmd through noble (...),
Who through great prowesle and bold hardiness,
From Lacedaemon fetched the fairest Dame,
That ever Greece did boast, or knight possess,
Whom Venus to him gave for meed of worthiness.
Fair Helene, flower of beauty excellent,
And girlond of the mighty Conquerours,
That made many Ladies dear lament
The heavy loss of their brave Paramours,
Which they far off beheld from Trojan toures,
And saw the fields of fair (...) strowne
With carcases of noble warrioures,
Whose fruitless lives were under furrow sown,
And Xanthus sandy banks with blood all ouerslowne.
From him my lineage I derive aright,
Who long before the ten years siege of Troy;
Whiles yet on Ida he a shepeheard hight,
On fair Oenone got a lovely boy;
Whom for remembrance of her passed joy,
She of his Father Parius did name;
Who, after Greeks did Priams realm destroy,
Gathred the Trojan relics saved from flame,
And with them sailing thence, to th'Isle of Paros came.
That was by him called Paros, which before
Hight Nausa, there he many years did rain,
And built Nausicle by the Pontick shore,
The which he dying left next in remain
To Paridas his son.
From whom I Paridell by kin descend;
But for fair ladies love, and glories gain,
My native soil have left, my days to spend
In seewing deeds of arms, my lives and labors end.
Whenas the noble Britom art heard tell
Of Trojan wars, and Priams city sacked,
The ruefull story of Sir Paridell,
She was empassiond at that piteous act,
With zealous envy of Greeks cruel fact,
Against that nation, from whose race of old
She heard, that she was lineally extract:
For noble Britons sprung from Trojans bold,
And Troynouant was built of old Troyes ashes cold.
Then sighing soft awhile, at last she thus:
O lamentable fall of famous town,
Which raignd so many years victorious,
And of all Asie bore the sovereign crown,
In one sad night consumd, and thrown down:
What stony heart, that hears thy hapless fate,
Is not empierst with deep compassiowne,
And makes ensample of man's wretched state,
That flowers so fresh at morn, and fades at evening late?
Behold, Sir, how your pitiful complaint
Has fownd another partner of your pain:
For nothing may impresse so dear constraint,
As countries cause, and commune foes disdain.
But if it should not grieve you, back again
To turn your course, I would to hear desire,
What to Aeneas fell; since that men said
He was not in the cities woeful fire
Consumed, but did him self to safety retire.
Anchyses son begott of Venus fair,
Said he, out of the flames for safeguard fled,
And with a remnant did to sea repair,
Where he through fatal error long was led
Full many years, and weetlesse wandered
From shore to shore, emongst the Lybick sands,
Ere rest he fownd. Much there he suffered,
And many perilles past in foreign lands,
To faue his people (...) from victours vengefull hands.
At last in Latium he did arryue,
Where he with cruel war was entertaind
Of th'inland folk, which sought him back to drive,
Till he with old Latinus was constraind,
To contract wedlock: (so the fates ordaind.)
Wedlock contract in blood, and eke in blood
Accomplished, that many dear complaind:
The rival slain, the victour through the flood
Escaped hardly, hardly praisd his wedlock good.
Yet after all, he victour did survive,
And with Latinus did the kingdom. part.
But after, when both nations began to strive,
Into their names the title to conuart,
His son Iulus did from thence depart,
With all the warlike youth of Trojans blood,
And in long Alba plast his throne apart,
Where fair it flourished, and long time stoud,
Till Romulus renewing it, to Rome remoud.
There there (said Britomart) a fresh appoard
The glory of the later world to spring,
And Troy again out of her dust was reard,
To sit in second seat of sovereign king,
Of all the world under her governing.
But a third kingdom yet is to arise,
Out of the Trojans scattered of spring,
That in all glory and great enterprise,
Both first and second Troy shall dare to equalize.
It Troynouant is hight, that with the waves
Of wealthy Thamis washed is along,
Upon whose stubborn necks whereat he raues
With roaring rage, and sore him self does throng,
That all men fear to tempt his billows strong,
She fastened has her foot, which stands so hy,
That it a wonder of the world is song
In foreign lands, and all which passen by,
Beholding it from far, do think it threats the sky.
The Trojan Brute did first that city fownd,
And Hygate made the meare thereof by west,
And Ouert gate by North: that is the bownd
Toward the land; two rivers bownd the rest.
So huge a scope at first him seemed best,
To be the compass of his kingdoms seat:
So huge a mind could not in lesser rest,
Ne in small meares contain his glory great,
That Albion had conquered first by warlike feat.
Ah fairest Lady knight, (said Paridell)
Pardon I pray my heedlesse oversight,
Who had forgot, that whylome I hard tell
From aged Mnemon; for my wits been light.
Indeed he said (if I remember right,)
That of the antique Trojan stock, there grew
Another plant, that raught to wondrous hight,
And far abroad his mighty branches threw,
Into the (...) Angle of the world he knew.
For that same Brute, whom much he did advance
In all his speech, was Syluius his son,
Whom having slain, through luckles arrows glau^ce
He fled for fear of that he had misdonne,
Or else for shame, so foul reproach to shonne,
And with him ledd to sea an youthly train,
Where weary wandering they long time did won,
And many fortunes proved in the Ocean main,
And great adue^tures found, that now were long to said
At last by fatal course they driven were
Into an Island spacious and broad,
The furthest North, that did to them appear:
Which after rest they seeking far abroad,
Found it the fittest soil for their abode,
Fruitful of all things fit for living food,
But wholly waste, and void of peoples trod,
Save an huge nation of the Geaunts brood,
That fed on living flesh, and dronck men's vital blood.
Whom he through weary wars and labors long,
Subdewd with loss of many Britons bold:
In which the great Goemagot of strong
Corineus, and Coulin of Debon old
Were overthrown, and laid on the earth full cold,
Which quaked under their so hideous mass,
A famous history to be enrold
In everlasting moniments of brass,
That all the antique Worthies merits far did pass.
His work great Troynouant, his work is eke
Fair Lincoln, both renowned far away,
That who from East to West will endlong seek,
Cannot two fairer Cities find this day,
Except Cteopolis: so heard I say
Old Mnemon. Therefore Sir, I greet you well
Your country kin, and you entyrely pray
Of pardon for the strife, which late befell
Betwixt us both unknown. So ended Paridell.
But all the while, that he these speeches spent,
Upon his lips hong fair Dame Hellenore,
With vigilant regard, and dew attent,
Fashioning worlds of fancies evermore
In her frail wit, that now her quite forlore:
The whiles unawares away her wondering eye,
And greedy ears her weak heart from her bore:
Which he perceiving, ever privily
In speaking, many false belgardes at her let fly.
So long these knights discoursed diuerfly,
Of strange affairs, and noble hardiment,
Which they had past with mickle ieopardy,
That now the humid night was farforth spent,
And heavenly lamps were halfendeale ybrent:
Which the old man seeing well, who too long though:
Every discourse and every argument,
Which by the hours he measured, besought
Them go to rest. So all unto their bowres were brought.
Cant. X.
Paridell rapeth Hellenore:
Malbceco her poursewes:
Fynds emongst Satyrs, whence with him
To turn she does refuse.
THe morrow next, so soon as Phoebus Lamp
Bewrayed had the world with early light,
And fresh Aurora had the shady damp
Out of the goodly heaven amoued quight,
Fair Britomart and that same Faery knight
Vprose, forth on their journey for to wend:
But Paridell complaynd, that his late fight
With Britomart, so sore did him offend,
That ride he could not, till his hurts he did amend.
So forth they fared, but he behind them stayed,
Maulgre his host, who grudged griuously,
To house a guest, that would be needs obayd,
And of his own him left not liberty:
Might wanting measure moves surquedry.
Two things he feared, but the third was death;
That fires youngmans unruly maystery;
His money, which he loved as living breath;
And his fair wife, whom honest long he kept uneath.
But patience perforce he must abie,
What fortune and his fate on him will lay,
Fond is the fear, that finds no remedy;
Yet warily he watches every way,
By which he fears evil happen may:
So the evil thinks by watching to prevent;
Ne does he suffer her, nor night, nor day,
Out of his sight her self once to absent.
So does he punish her and eke himself torment.
But Paridell kept better watch, then he,
A fit occasion for his turn to find:
False love, why do men say, thou can not see,
And in their foolish fancy feign thee blind,
That with thy charms the sharpest sight do bind,
And to thy will abuse? Thou walk free,
And see every secret of the mind;
Thou see all, yet none at all sees thee;
All that is by the working of thy Deitee.
So perfect in that art was Paridell,
That he Malbeccoes halfen eye did wyle,
His halfen eye he wiled wondrous well,
And Hellenors both eyes did eke beguyle,
Both eyes and heart attonce, during the whylc
That he there soiourned his wounds to heal,
That Cupid self it seeing, close did smyle,
To weet how he her love away did steal,
And bad, that none their joyous treason should reveal.
The learned lover lost no time nor tide,
That least auantage mote to him afford,
Yet bore so fair a sail, that none espyde
His secret drift, till he herlayd abord.
When so in open place, and commune board,
He fortuned her to meet, with commune speech
He (...) her, yet bayted every word,
That his ungentle host n'ote him appeach
Of vile ungentleness, or hospitages breach.
But when apart (if ever her apart)
He found, then his false engines fast he plyde,
And all the fleights vnbosomd in his heart;
He sighed, he sobd, he swownd, he perdy did,
And cast himself on ground her fast beside:
Tho when again he him bethought to live,
He wept, and wayld, and false laments belyde,
Saying, but if she Mercy would him give
That he mote algates dye, yet did his death forgive.
And otherwhyles with amorous delights,
And pleasing toys he would her entertain,
Now singing sweetly, to surprise her sprights,
Now making lays of love and lovers pain,
Bransles, Ballads, virelayes, and verses vain;
Often purposes, often riddles he deuysd,
And thousands like, which flowed in his brain,
With which he sed her fancy, and entysd
To take with his new love, and leave her old despysd.
And every where he might, and every while
He did her service dewtifull, and sewd
At hand with humble pride, and pleasing guile,
So closely yet, that none but she it vewd,
Who well perceived all, and all indewd.
Thus finely did he his false nets dispred,
With which he many weak hearts had subdewd,
Of yore, and many had ylike misled:
What wonder then, if she were likewise carried?
No fort so fensible, no walls so strong,
But that continual battery will riue,
Or daily siege through dispuruayaunce long,
And lack of reskewes will to parley drive,
And Piece, that unto parley ear will give,
Will shortly yield it self, and will be made
The vassal of the victors will byliue:
That stratageme had oftentimes assayd
This crafty Paramoure, and now it plain displayed.
For through his trains he her intrapped has,
That she her love and hatt has wholly sold
To him, without regard of gain, or scath,
Or care of credit, or of husband old,
Whom she has vowed to dub a fair Cucquold.
Naught wants but time and place, which shortly she
Deuized has, and to her lover told,
It pleased well. So well they both agree;
So ready ripe to ill, ill wemens counsels be.
Dark was the Evening, fit for lovers stealth,
When chaunst Maelbecco busy be else where,
She to his closet went, where all his wealth
Lay hid: thereof she countlesse sums did rear,
The which she meant away with her to bear;
The rest she fyr'd for sport, or for despite;
As Hellene, when she saw aloft appear
The Troiane flames, and reach to heuens hight
Did clap her hands, and ioyed at that doleful sight.
This second Helene, fair Dame Hcllenore,
The whiles her husband ran with sorry haste,
To quench the flames, which she had tyn'd before.
Laughed at his foolish labor spent in waste;
And ran into her lovers arms right fast;
Where straight embraced, she to him did cry,
And call alowd for help, ere help were past,
For lo that Guest did bear her forcibly,
And meant to ravish her, that rather had to die.
The wretched man hearing her call for aid,
And ready seeing him with her to fly,
In his disquiet mind was much dismayed:
But when again he backward cast his eye,
And saw the wicked fire so furiously
Consume his heart, and scorch his Idols (...),
He was therewith distressed diuersely,
Ne wist he how to turn, nor to what place,
Was never wretched man in such a woeful case.
Ay when to him she (...), to her he turned,
And left the fire; love money overcame:
But when he marked, how his money burnd,
He left his wife; money did love disclame:
Both was he loath to loose his loved Dame,
And loath to leave his liefest pelf behind,
Yet since he n'ote save both, he (...) that same,
Which was the dearest to his dounghill mind,
The God of his desire, the (...) of misers blind.
Thus whilst all things in troublous uproar were,
And all men busy to suppress the flame,
The loving couple need no reskew fear,
But leisure had, and liberty to frame
Their purpost flight, free from all men's reclame;
And Night, the patroness of loue-stealth fair,
Gave them safe conduct, till to end they came:
So been they gone yfere, a wanton pair
Of lovers loosely knit, where list them to repair.
Soon as the cruel flames yslaked were,
Malbecco seeing, how his loss did lie,
Out of the flames, which he had quenched whylere
Into huge waves of grief and gealosye
Full deep emplonged was, and drowned nigh,
Twixt inward doole and felonous despite,
He rau'd, he wept, he stamped, he loud did cry,
And all the passions, that in man may light,
Did him attonce oppress, and vex his caytiue spright.
Long thus he chawd the cud of inward grief,
And did consume his gall with anguish sore,
Still when he mused on his late mischief,
So still the smart thereof increased more,
And seemd more grievous, then it was before:
At last when sorrow he saw booted naught,
Ne grief might not his love to him restore,
He began devise, how her he reskew might,
Ten thousand ways he cast in his confused thought.
At last resolving, like a Pilgrim pore,
To search her forth, where so she might be fond,
And bearing with him treasure in close store,
The rest he leaves in ground: So takes in hond
To seek her endlong, both by sea and land.
Long he her sought, he sought her far and nere,
And every where that he mote understand,
Of knights and ladies any meetings were,
And of eachone he met, he tidings did inquere.
But all in vain, his woman was too wise,
Ever to come into his clouch again,
And he too simple ever to surprise
The jolly Paridell, for all his pain.
One day, as he forpassed by the plain
With weary pace, he far away espide
A couple, seeming well to be his twain,
Which houed close under a forest side,
As if they lay in wait, or else them selves did hide.
Well weened he, that those the same more be,
And as he better did their shape auize,
Him seemed more their manner did agree;
For the one was armed all in warlike wize,
Whom, to be Paridell he did deuize;
And the other alyclad in garments light,
Discolourd like to womanish disguise,
He did resemble to his lady bright,
And ever his faint heart much earned at the sight.
And ever feign he toward them would go,
But yet durst not for dread approchen nie,
But stood aloof, vnweeting what to do,
Till that pricked forth with loves extremity,
That is the father of foul gealosy,
(...) closely nearer crept, the truth to weet:
But, as he nigher drew, he easily
Might scerne, that it was not his sweetest sweet,
Ne yet her (...), the partner of his sheet.
But it was scornful Braggadochio,
That with his servant Trompart houerd there,
Since late he fled from his too earnest foe:
Whom such whenas Malbecco spyed clear,
He turned back, and would have fled arere;
Till Trompart ronning hastily, him did stay,
And bad before his sovereign Lord appear:
That was him loath, yet durst he not gainesay,
And coming him before, low louted on the lay.
The Boaster at him sternely bent his browe,
As if he could have killed him with his look,
That to the ground him meekely made to bow,
And awful terror deep into him struck,
That every member of his body quooke.
Said he, thou man of naught, what do thou here,
(...) furnished with thy bag and book,
Where I expected one with shield and spear,
To prove some deeds of arms upon an equal pere.
The wretched man at his imperious speech,
Was all abasht, and low prostrating, said;
Good Sir, let not my rudenes be no breach
Unto your patience, ne be ill ypaid;
For I unawares this way by fortune straid,
A silly Pilgrim driven to distress,
That seek a Lady There he suddein staid,
And did the rest with grievous sighs suppress,
While tears stood in his eyes, few drops of bitterness.
What Lady, man? (said Trompart) take good heart,
And tell thy grief, if any hidden lie;
Was never better time to show thy smart,
Then now, that noble succor is thee by,
That is the whole worlds commune remedy.
That cheerful word his weak heart much did cheer,
And with vain hope his spirits (...) supply,
That bold he said, O most redoubted Pere,
Vouchsafe with mild regard a wretches case to hear.
Then sighing sore, It is not long (said he)
Since I enjoyed the gentlest Dame alive;
Of whom a knight, no knight at all perdee
But shame of all, that do for honor strive,
By treacherous deceit did me (...);
Through open outrage he her bore away,
And with foul force unto his will did drive,
Which al good knights, that arms do bear this day,
Are bownd for to revenge, and punish if they may:
And you most noble Lord, that can and dare
Redress the wrong of miserable wight,
Cannot employ your most victorious spear
In better quarrel, then defense of right,
And for a Lady against a faithless knight,
So shall your glory be advanced much,
And all fair Ladies magnify your might,
And (...) self, albee I simple such,
Your worthy pain shall well reward with guerdon rich.
With that out of his bouget forth he drew
Great store of treasure, therewith him to tempt;
But he on it looked (...) askew,
As much (...) to be so misdempt,
Or a war-monger to be basely nempt;
And said, thy offers base I greatly loath,
And eke thy words discourteous and unkempt;
I tread in dust thee and thy money both,
That, were it not for shame, So turned from him wroth.
But (...), that his (...) humor knew,
In lofty looks to hide an humble mind,
Was inly tickled with that golden view,
And in his ear him rownded close behind:
Yet stoupt he not, but lay still in the wind,
Waiting advantage on the pray to sease;
Till Trompart lowly to the grownd inclinde,
Besought him his great courage to appease,
And pardon simple man, that rash did him displease.
Big looking like a doughty Doucepere,
At last he thus, Thou clod of vilest clay,
I pardon yield, and that with rudenes bear;
But weete henceforth, that all that golden pray,
And all that else the vain world vaunten may,
I loath as doung, ne deem my dew reward:
Fame is my meed, and glory virtuous pray.
But minds of mortal men are muchell mard,
And moved amisle with massy mucks unmeet regard.
And (...), I grant to thy great misery
Gracious respect, thy wife shall back be sent,
And that vile knight, who ever that he be,
Which has thy lady rest, and knighthood shent,
By Sanglamort my sword, whose deadly dent
The blood has of so many thousands shedd,
I swear, ere long shall dearly it repent;
Ne he twixt heaven and earth shall hide his hedd,
But soon he shall be fownd, and shortly done be dedd.
The foolish man thereat woxe wondrous blithe,
As if the word so spoken, were half done,
And humbly thanked him a thousand since,
That had from death to life him newly won.
Tho forth the Boaster marching, brave begone
His stolen steed to thunder furiously,
As if he heaven and hell would oueronne,
And all the world confound with cruelty,
That much Malbecco ioyed in his iollity.
Thus long they three together traueiled,
Through many a wood, and many an uncouth way,
To seek his wife, that was far wandered:
But those two sought naught, but the present pray,
To weete the treasure, which he did bewray,
On which their eyes and hearts were wholly set,
With purpose, how they might it best betray,
For since the hour, that first he did them let
The same behold, therewith their keen desires were whett.
It fortuned as they together fared,
They spide, where Paridell came pricking fast
Upon the plain, the which him self prepared
To giust with that brave stranger knight a cast,
As on adventure by the way he past:
Alone he rode without his Paragone;
For having filcht her bells, her up he cast
To the wide world, and let her fly alone,
He nould be clogd. So had he served many one.
The gentle Lady. loose at randon left,
The greene-wood long did walk, and wander wide
At wild adventure, like a forlorn wefte,
Till on a day the Satyrs her espide
Straying alone withouten groom or guide;
Her up they took, and with them home her ledd,
With them as house wife ever to abide,
To milk their gotes, and make them cheese and bredd,
And every one as commune good her handeled.
That shortly she (...) has forgott,
And eke Sir (...), all were he dear;
Who from her went to seek another lot,
And now by fortune was arrived here,
Where those two guilers with Malbecco were:
Soon as the oldman saw Sir Paridell,
He fainted, and was almost dead with fear,
Ne word he had to speak, his grief to tell,
But to him louted low, and greeted goodly well.
And after asked him for Hellenore,
I take no keep of her (said Paridell)
She wonneth in the forest there before.
So forth he rode, as his adventure fell;
The whiles the Boaster from his lofty sell
Faynd to alight, something amiss to mend;
But the fresh Swayne would not his leisure dwell,
But went his way; whom when he passed kend,
He up remounted light, and after faind to wend.
Per die nay (said Malbecco) shall ye not:
But let him pass as lightly, as he came:
For little good of him is to be got,
And mickle peril to be put to shame.
But let us go to seek my dearest Dame,
Whom he has left in yonder forest wyld:
For (...) her safety in great doubt I am,
Least saluage beasts her person have despoyld:
Then all the world is lost, and we in vain have toyld.
They all agree, and forward them addressed:
Ah but (said crafty Trompart) weete ye well,
That yonder in that faithful wilderness
Huge monsters haunt, and many dangers dwell;
Dragons, and Minotaures, and feendes of hell,
And many wild woodmen, which rob and rend
All traueilers; therefore advise ye well,
Before ye enterprise that way to wend:
One may his journey bring too soon to evil end.
Malbecco stopped in great astonishment,
And with pale eyes fast fixed on the rest,
Their counsel craved, in danger imminent.
Said Trompart, you that are the most oppressed
With burdein of great treasure, I think best
Here for to stay in safety behynd;
My Lord and I will search the wide forest.
That counsel pleased not Malbeccoes mind;
For he was much afraid, him self alone to find.
Then is it best (said he) that ye do leave
Your treasure here in some security,
Either fast closed in some hollow greaue,
Or buried in the ground from ieopardy,
Till we return again in safety:
As for us two, least doubt of us ye have,
Hence far away we will blyndfolded ly,
Ne privy be unto your treasures grave.
It pleased: so he did. Then they march forward brave.
Now when amid the thickest woods they were,
They heard a noise of many bagpipes shrill,
And shrieking Hububs them approaching nere,
Which all the forest did with horror (...):
That dreadful sound the (...) heart did thrill,
With such amazment, that in have he fledd,
Ne ever looked back for good or ill,
And after him eke fearful Trompart spedd;
The old man could not fly, but fell to ground half dedd.
Yet afterward close creeping, as he might,
He in a bush did hyde his fearful hedd,
The jolly Satyrs full of fresh delight,
Came dancing forth, and with them nimbly ledd
Fair Helenore, with girlonds all bespredd,
Whom their May-lady they had newly made:
She proud of that new honor, which they redd,
And of their lovely fellowship full glade,
Daunst lively, and her face did with a Laurel shade.
The silly man that in the thickett lay
Saw all this goodly sport, and grieved sore,
Yet durst he not against it do or say,
But did his heart with bitter thoughts engore,
To see th'vnkindnes of his Hellenore.
All day they daunced with great lusty hedd,
And with their horned feet the green gras wore,
The whiles their Gotes upon the brouzes fedd.
Till drouping Phoebus began to hyde his golden hedd.
Tho up they began their merry pypes to trusse,
And all their goodly heardes did gather rownd,
But every Satyr first did give a busse
To Hellenore: so busses did abound.
Now began the humid vapor shed the grownd.
With perly deaw, and th'Earthes gloomy shade
Did dim the brightness of the welkin rownd,
That every bird and beast awarned made,
To shroud themselves, whiles sleep their senses did invade.
Which when Malbecco saw, out of his bush
Upon his hands and feet he crept full light,
And like a Got emongst the Gotes did rush,
That through the help of his fair horns on hight,
And misty dampe of misconceyuing night,
And eke through likeness of his gotish beard,
He did the better counterfeite aright:
So home he marched emongst the horned heard,
That none of all the Satyrs him espyde or heard.
At night, when all they went to sleep, he vewd,
Whereas his lovely wife emongst them lay,
Embraced of a Satyr rough and rude,
Who all the night did mind his joyous play:
Nine times he heard him come aloft ere day,
That all his heart with gealosy did swell;
But yet that nights ensample did bewray,
That not for naught his wife them loved so well,
When one so often a night did ring his matins bell.
So closely as he could, he to them crept,
When weary of their sport to sleep they fell,
And to his wife, that now full soundly slept,
He whispered in her ear, and did her tell,
That it was he, which by her side did dwell,
And therefore prayed her wake, to hear him plain.
As one out of a dream not waked well,
She turned her, and returned back again:
Yet her for to awake he did the more constrain.
At last with irkesom trouble she abrayd;
And then perceiving, that it was indeed
Her old Malbecco, which did her upbraid,
With looseness of her love, and loathly deed,
She was astonished with exceeding dreed,
And would have wakt the Satyr by he r side;
But he her prayed, for mercy, or for meed,
To save his life, ne let him be descryde,
But hearken to his lore, and all his counsel hyde.
Tho began he her persuade, to leave that lewd
And loathsome life, of God and man abhord,
And home return, where all should be renewd
With perfect peace, and bands of fresh accord,
And she receiud again to bed and board,
As if no trespass ever had been done:
But she it all refused at one word,
And by no means would to his will be won,
But chose emongst the jolly Satyrs still to won
He wooed her, till day spring he espyde;
But all in vain: and then turned to the heard,
Who butted him with horns on every side,
And trod down in the dirt, where his hoar beard
Was fowly dight, and he of death afeard.
Early before the heavens fairest light
Out of the ruddy East was fully reard,
The heardes out of their foldes were loosed quight,
And he emongst the rest crept forth in sorry plight.
So soon as he the Prison door did pas,
He ran as fast, as both his feer could bear,
And never looked, who behind him was,
Ne scarsely who before: like as a Bear
That creeping close, amongst the hiues to rear
An honey comb, the wakefull dogs espy,
And him assayling, sore his carkas tear,
That hardly he with life away does fly,
Ne stays, till safe him self he see from ieopardy.
Ne stayed he, till he came unto the place,
Where late his treasure he entombed had,
Where when he found it not (for Trompart bace
Had it purloyned for his master bad:)
With extreme fury he became quite mad,
And ran away, ran with him self away:
That who so straungely had him seen bestadd,
With vpstart hair, and staring eyes dismay,
From Limbo lake him late escaped sure would say.
High over hills and over dales he fledd,
As if the wind him on his wings had borne,
Ne banck nor bush could stay him, when he spedd
His nimble feet, as (...) still on thorn:
Grief, and despite, and gealofy, and scorn
Did all the way him follow hard behynd,
And he himself himself loathed so forlorn,
So shamefully forlorn of womankynd;
That as a Snake, still lurked in his wounded mind.
Still fled he forward, looking backward still,
Ne stayed his flight, nor fearful agony,
Till that he came unto a rocky hill,
Over the sea, suspended dreadfully,
That living creature it would terrify,
To look adowne, or upward to the hight:
From thence he threw him self dispiteously,
All desperate of his fore-damned spright,
That seemd no help for him was left in living sight.
But through long anguish, and selfe-murdring thought
He was so wasted and forpined quight,
That all his substance was consumed to naught,
And nothing left, but like an aerie Spright,
That on the rocks he fell so flit and light,
That he thereby received no hurt at all,
But chanced on a craggy cliff to light;
Whence he with crooked claws so long did crall,
That at the last he found a cave with entrance small.
Into the same he creepes, and thenceforth there
Resolved to build his balefull mansion,
In (...) darkness, and continual fear
Of that rocks fall, which ever and anon
Threats with huge ruin him to fall upon,
That he dare never sleep, but that one eye
Still open he keeps for that occasion;
Ne ever rests he in tranquillity,
The roaring billows beat his bower so boystrously.
Ne ever is he wont on ought to feed,
But todes and frogs, his pasture poisonous,
Which in his cold complexion do breed
A filthy blood, or humor rancorous,
Matter of doubt and dread suspicious,
That does with curelesse care consume the heart,
Corrupts the stomach with gall vicious,
Croscuts the liver with internal smart,
And does transfixe the soul with deaths eternal dart.
Yet can he never dye, but dying lives,
And does himself with sorrow new sustain,
That death and life attonce unto him gives.
And painful pleasure turns to pleasing pain.
There dwells he ever, miserable swain,
Hateful both to him self, and every wight;
Where he through privy grief, and horror vain,
Is woxen so deformed, that he has quight
Forgot he was a man, and Gelosy is hight.
Cant. XI.
Britomart chaceth Ollyphant,
finds Scudamour distressed:
Assayes the house of Busyrane,
where loves spoils are expressed,
O Hateful hellish Snake, what fury furst
Brought thee from balefull house of Proserpine,
Where in her bosom she thee long had nursed,
And fostred up with bitter milk of tine,
Foul Gealosy, that turnest love divine
To ioylesse dread, and make the loving heart
With hateful thoughts to languish and to pine,
And feed it self with selfe-consuming smart?
Of all the passions in the mind thou vilest art.
O let him far be banished away,
And in his stead let Love for ever dwell,
Sweet Love, that does his golding wings embay
In blessed Nectar, and pure Pleasures well,
Untroubled of vile fear, or (...) fell.
And ye fair Ladies, that your kingdoms make
In th'harts of men, them govern wisely well,
And of fair Britomart ensample take,
That was as true in love, as Turtle to her make.
Who with Sir Satyrane, as erst ye red,
Forth ryding from Malbeccoes hostlesse house,
Far off aspyde a young man, the which fled
From an huge Geaunt, that with hideous
And hateful outrage long him chaced thus;
It was that Ollyphant, the brother dear
Of that Argante vile and vicious,
From whom the Squyre of Dames was reft whylere;
This all as bad as she, and worse, if worse ought were.
For as the sister did in feminine
And filthy lust exceed all woman kind,
So he surpassed his sex masculine,
In beastly use all, that I ever find:
Whom when as Britomart beheld behind
The fearful boy so greedily poursew,
She was emmoued in her noble mind,
T'employ her puissaunce to his reskew,
And pricked fiercely forward, where she did him view.
Ne was Sir Satyrane her far behind,
But with like fierceness did ensew the chase:
Whom when the Gyaunt saw, he soon resinde
His former suit, and from them fled apace;
They after both, and boldly bad him bace,
And each did strive the other to outgoe;
But he them both outran a wondrous space,
For he was long, and swift as any Roe,
And now made better speed, t'escape his feared foe.
It was not Satyrane, whom he did fear,
But Britomart the flower of chastity;
For he the power of chaste hands might not bear,
But always did their dread encounter fly:
And now so fast his feet he did apply,
That he has gotten to a forest near,
Where he is shrouded in security.
The wood they enter, and search every where,
They searched diuersely, so both divided were.
Fair Britomart so long him followed,
That she at last came to a fountain sheare,
By which there lay a knight all wallowed
Upon the grassy ground, and by him near
His haberieon, his helmet, and his spear;
A little of his shield was rudely thrown,
On which the winged boy in colors clear
Depeincted was, full easy to be known,
And he thereby, where ever it in field was shown.
His face upon the grownd did groueling ly,
As if he had been slombring in the shade,
That the brave Maid would not for courtesy,
Out of his quiet slomber him abrade,
Nor seem too suddeinly him to invade:
Still as she stood, she heard with grievous throb
Him groan, as if his heart were pieces made,
And with most painful pangs to sigh and sob,
That pity did the Virgins heart of patience rob.
At last forth breaking into bitter plaintes
He said, O sovereign Lord that sit'st on hye,
And raignst in blis emongst thy blessed Saints,
How suffrest thou such shameful cruelty,
So long vnwreaked of thine enemy?
Or have, thou Lord, of good men's cause no heed?
Or does thy justice sleep, and silently?
What booteth then the good and righteous deed,
If goodness find no grace, nor righteousness no (...)?
If good find grace, and righteousness reward,
Why then is Amoret in caytiue band,
Since that more bounteous creature never fared
On foot, upon the face of living land?
Or if that heavenly justice may withstand
The wrongful outrage of unrighteous men,
Why then is Busirane with wicked hand
Suffered, these seven months day in secret den
My Lady and my love so cruelly to pen?
My Lady and my love is cruelly pend
In doleful darkness from the view of day,
Whilst deadly torments do her chaste breast rend,
And the sharp steel does riue her heart in tway,
All for she Scudamore will not denay.
Yet thou vile man, vile Scudamore art sound,
Ne can her ay de, ne can her foe dismay;
Unworthy wretch to tread upon the ground,
For whom so fair a Lady feels so sore a wound.
There an huge heap of singulfes did oppress
His struggling soul, and swelling throbs empeach
His foltring tongue with pangs of drerinesse,
Choking the remnant of his plaintiff speech,
As if his days were come to their last reach.
Which when she heard, and saw the ghastly fit,
Threatening into his life to make a breach,
Both with great ruth and terror she was smit,
Fearing least from her cage the weary soul would flit.
Tho stouping down she him amoued light;
Who therewith somewhat starting, up began look,
And seeing him behind a stranger knight,
Whereas no living creature he mistook,
With great indignaunce he that sight forsook,
And down again himself disdainefully
Abiecting, the earth with his fair forhead struck:
Which the bold Virgin seeing, began apply
Fit medcine to his grief, and spoke thus courtesly.
Ah gentle knight, whose deep conceived grief
Well seemest'exceede the power of patience,
Yet if that heavenly gracesome good relief
You send, submit you to high providence,
And ever in your noble heart prepense,
That all the sorrow in the world is less,
Then virtues might, and values confidence.
For who nill bide the burden of distress,
Must not here think to live: for life is wretchedness.
Therefore, fair Sir, do comfort to you take,
And freely read, what wicked felon so
Has outrag'd you, and thrald your gentle make.
Perhaps this hand may help to ease your woe,
And wreake your sorrow on your cruel foe,
At least it fair endeavor will apply.
Those feeling words so near the quick did go,
That up his head he reared easily,
And leaning on his elbowe, these few words (...) fly.
What boots it plain, that cannot be redrest,
And fow vain sorrow in a fruitless ear,
Since power of hand, nor skill of learned breast,
Ne worldly price cannot redeem my dear,
Out of her thraldom and continual fear?
For he the tyrant, which her has in ward
By strong enchauntments and black Magic leare,
Has in a dungeon deep her close embard,
And many dreadful feends has pointed to her guard.
There he tormenteth her most terribly,
And day and night afflicts with mortal pain,
Because to yield him love she does deny,
Once to me yold, not to be yolde again:
But yet by torture he would her constrain
Love to conceive in her disdainful breast;
Till so she do, she must in doole remain,
Ne may by living means be thence relest:
What boots it then to plain, that cannot be redrest?
With this sad hersall of his heavy stresse,
The warlike Damzell was empassiond sore,
And said, Sir knight, your cause is nothing less,
Then is your sorrow, certes if not more;
For nothing so much pity does implore,
As gentle Ladies helpless misery.
But yet, if please ye listen to my lore,
I will with proof of last extremity,
Deliver her fro thence, or with her for you die.
Ah gentlest knight alive, (said Scudamore)
What huge heroicke magnanimity
Dwells in thy bounteous breast? what could thou more,
If she were thine, and (...) as now am I?
O spare thy happy days, and them apply
To better boot, but let me die, that ought;
More is more loss: one is enough to die,
Life is not lost, (said she) for which is bought
Endless renowm, that more then death is to be sought.
Thus she at length persuaded him to rise,
And with (...) wend, to see what new success
Mote him befall upon new enterprise:
His arms, which he had vowed to disprofesse,
She gathered up and did about him dress,
And his forwandred steed unto him got:
So forth they both yfere make their progress,
And march not past the mountenaunce of a (...),
Till they arrived, whereas their purpose they did plott.
There they dismounting, drew their weapons bold
And stoutly came unto the Castle gate;
Whereas no gate they found, them to withhold,
Nor ward to wait at morn and evening late,
But in the Porch, (...) did them sore amate,
A flaming fire, ymixt with smouldry smoke,
And stinking Sulphur, that with griesly hate
And dreadful horror did all entrance choke,
Enforced them their forward footing to revoke.
Greatly thereat was Britomart dismayed,
Ne in that stownd wist, how her self to bear;
For danger vain it were to have assayd
That cruel (...), which all things fear,
Ne none can (...) to (...) near:
And turning back to Scudamour, thus said;
What monstrous enmity provoke we (...),
Foolhardy, as the Earthes children, which made
Batteill against the Gods? so we a God invade.
Danger without discretion to attempt,
Inglorious and beastlike is: therefore Sir knight,
Aread what course of you is safest dempt.
And how we with our foe may come to fight.
This is (quoth he) the dolorous despite,
Which erst to you I playnd: for neither may
This fire be quenched by any wit or might,
Ne yet by any means removed away;
So mighty be th'enchau^tments, which the same do stay.
What is there else, but cease these fruitless pains,
And leave me to my former languishing?
Fair Amorett must dwell in wicked chains,
And Scudamore here die with sorrowing.
Perdy not so; (said she) for shameful thing
Yt were t'abandon noble cheuisaunce,
For show of peril, without venturing:
Rather (...) try extremities of chance,
Then enterprised praise for dread to disauaunce.
Therewith resolved to prove her utmost might,
Her ample shield she (...) before (...) face,
And her swords point directing forward right,
Assayld the flame, the which eftesoones gave place,
And did it self divide with equal space,
That through she passed, as a thonder bolt
Perceth the yielding air, and does displace
The soring clouds into sad showers ymolt;
So to her yold the flames, and did their force revolt.
Whom whenas Scudam our saw past the fire,
Safe and untouched, he likewise began assay,
With greedy will, and envious desire,
And bad the stubborn flames to yield him way:
But cruel Mulciber would not obey
His threatfull pride, but did the more augment
His mighty rage, and with imperious sway
Him forced (maulgre) his fercenes to relent,
And back retire, all scorcht and pitifully brent.
With huge impatience he inly swelt,
More for great sorrow, that he could not pas,
Then for the burning torment, which he felt,
That with fell woodnes he effierced was,
And wilfully him throwing on the gras,
Did beat and bounse his head and brestful sore;
The whiles the Championess now decked has
The utmost rowme, and past the formest door,
The utmost rowme, abounding with all precious store.
For round about, the walls yclothed were
With goodly arras of great majesty,
Wouen with gold and silk so close and nere,
That the rich metal lurked privily,
As faining to be hidd from envious eye;
Yet here, and there, and every where unawares
It showed it self, and shone unwillingly;
Like to a discolourd Snake, whose hidden snares
Through the green gras his long bright (...) back declares.
And in those Tapets weren fashioned
Many fair pourtraicts, and many a fair feate,
And all of love, and al of lusty-hed,
As seemed by their semblaunt did entreat;
And eke all Cupids wars they did repeat,
And cruel battles, which he whilome fought
Against all the Gods, to make his empire great;
Besides the huge massacres, which he wrought
On mighty kings and kesars, into thraldom brought.
Therein was writ, how often thondring Jove
Had felt the point of his heart percing dart,
And leaving heavens kingdom, here did roue
In strange disguize, to slake his scalding smart;
Now like a Ram, fair Hell to peruart,
Now like a Bull, Europa to withdraw:
Ah, how the fearful Ladies tender heart
Did lively seem to tremble, when she saw
The huge seas under her t'obay her servant law.
Soon after that into a golden shower
Him self he chaung'd, fair Danae to view,
Ant through the roof of her strong brazen tower
Did rain into her lap an honey dew,
The whiles her foolish guard, that little knew
Of such deceit, kept th'yron door fast bard,
And watched, that none should enter nor issew;
Vain was the watch, and bootlesse all the ward,
Whenas the God to golden hew him self transfard.
Then was he turned into a fnowy Swan,
To win fair Leda to his lovely trade:
O wondrous skill, and sweet wit of the man,
That her in (...) sleeping made,
From scorching heat her dainty limbs to shade:
Whiles the proud Bird ruffing his feathers wide,
And brushing his fair breast, did her invade;
She slept, yet twixt her eielids closely spyde,
How toward her he rusht, and smiled at his pride.
Then showed it, how the Thebane Semelee
Deceiud of gealous Juno, did require
To see him in his sovereign maiestee,
Armd with his thunderbolts and lightning fire,
Whens dearly she with death bought her desire.
But fair (...) better match did make,
Ioying his love in likeness more entire,
Three nights in one, they say, that for her sake
He then did put, her pleasures longer to partake.
Twice was he seen in soaring Eagles shape,
And with wide wings to beat the buxo^me air,
Once, when he with Asterie did escape,
Again, when as the Troiane boy so fair
He snatched from Ida hill, and with him bare:
Wondrous delight it was, there to behold,
How the rude Shepherds (...) him did stare,
Trembling through fear, least down he fallen should
And often to him calling, to take surer hold.
In Satyrs shape Antiopa he snatched:
And like a fire, when he Aegin' assayd:
A shepeheard, when (...) he caught:
And like a Serpent to the Thracian maid.
Whiles thus on earth great Jove these pageaunts played,
The winged boy did thrust into his throne,
And scoffing, thus unto his mother said,
Lo now the heuens obey to me alone,
And take me for their Jove, whiles Jove to earth is gone.
And thou, fair Phoebus, in thy colors bright
Wast there enwouen, and the sad distress,
In which that boy thee plonged, for despite,
That thou bewray'dst his mothers wantonness,
When she with Mars was meynt in ioyfulnesse:
For thy he thrild thee with a leaden dart,
To love fair Daphne, which the loved less:
Less she thee loved, then was thy just desert,
Yet was thy love her death, and her death was thy smart.
So louedst thou the lusty Hyacinct,
So louedst thou the fair Coronis dear:
Yet both are of thy hapless hand extinct,
Yet both in flowers do live, and love thee breare,
The one a Paunce, the other a sweetbeare:
For grief whereof, ye mote have lively seen
The God himself rending his golden hear,
And breaking quite his garlond ever green,
With other signs of sorrow and impatient teene.
Both for those two, and for his own dear son,
The son of Climene he did repent,
Who bold to guide the charet of the Sun,
Himself in thousand pieces fondly rent,
And all the world with flashing fire brent:
So like, that all the walls did seem to flame.
Yet cruel Cupid, not herewith content,
Forced him estsoones to follow other game,
And love a Shephards daughter for his dearest Dame.
He loved Isse for his dearest Dame,
And for her sake her cattle fedd a while,
And for her sake a cowheard vile became,
The servant of Admetus cowheard vile,
Whiles that from heaven he suffered exile.
Long were to tell his other lovely fit,
Now like a Lion, hunting after spoil,
Now like a Hag, now like a faulcon flit:
All which in that fair arras was most lively writ.
Next unto him was Neptune pictured,
In his divine resemblance wondrous like:
His face was rugged, and his hoarie head
Dropped with brackish deaw; his threeforkt Pyke
He stearnly shook, and there with fierce did stryke
The raging billows, that on every side
They trembling stood, and made a long broad dyke,
That his swift charet might have passage wide,
Which four great Hippodames did draw in temewise tide.
His seahorses did see ne to snort amayne,
And from their nosethrilles blow the brynie stream,
That made the sparckling waves to smoke again,
And flame with gold, but the white fomy cream,
Did shine with silver, and shoot forth his beam.
The God himself did pensive seem and sad,
And hong adowne his head, as he did dream:
For privy love his breast empierced had,
Ne ought but dear Bisaltis ay could make him glad.
He loved eke Iphimedia dear,
And Aeolus fair daughter Arne hight,
For whom he turned him self into a Steare,
And fedd on fodder, to beguile her sight.
Also to win Deucalions daughter bright,
He turned him self into a Dolphin fair;
And like a winged horse he took his flight,
To snaky-locke Medusa to repair,
On whom he got fair Pegasus, that flitteth in the air.
Next Saturn was, (but who would ever ween,
That sullein Saturn ever weend to love?
Yet love is sullein, and Saturnlike seen,
As he did for Erigone it prove.
That to a Centaure did him self transmoue.
So proou'd it eke that gracious God of wine,
When for to compass Philliras hard love,
He turned himself into a fruitful vine,
And into her fair bosom made his grapes decline.
Long were to tell the amorous assayes,
And gentle pangues, with which he maked meek
The mighty Mars, to learn his wanton plays:
How often for Venus, and how often eek
For many other Nymphs hesore did shreek,
With womanish tears, and with unwarlike smarts,
Privily moystening his horrid cheek.
There was he painted full of burning darts,
And many wide wounds launched through his inner parts.
Ne did he spare (so cruel was the Elfe)
His own dear mother, (ah why should he so?)
Ne did he spare sometime to prick himself,
That he might taste the sweet consuming woe,
Which he had wrought to many others more.
But to declare the mournful Tragedyes,
And spoils, wherewith he all the ground did strew,
More eath to number, with how many eyes
High heaven beholdes sad lovers nightly theeueryes.
Kings Queens, Lords Ladies, knights and Damsels gent
Were heaped together with the vulgar sort,
And mingled with the rascal rablement,
Without respect of person or of port,
To show Dan Cupids power and great effort:
And round about a border was entrayld,
Of broken bows and-arrowes shiuered short,
And a long bloody river through them rayld,
So lively and so like, that living sense it fayld.
And at the upper end of that fair rowme,
There was an Altar built of precious stone,
Of passing value, and of great renown,
On which there stood an Image all alone,
Of massy gold, which with his own light shone;
And wings it had with sundry colors dight,
More sundry colors, then the proud Pauone
Bears in his boasted fan, or Iris bright,
When her discolourd bow she spreds through heaven bright.
Blyndfold he was, and in his cruel fist
A mortal bow and arrows keen did hold,
With which he shot at randon, when him list,
Some headed with sadlead, some with pure gold;
(Ah man beware, how thou those darts behold)
A wounded Dragon under him didly,
Whose hideous tail his left foot did enfold,
And with a shaft was shot through either eye,
That no man forth might draw, ne no man remedy.
And underneath his feet was written thus,
Unto the Victor of the Gods this be:
And all the people in that ample house
Did to that image bow their humble knee,
And often committed foul Idolatree.
That wondrous sight fair Britomart amazd,
Ne seeing could her wonder satisfy,
But evermore and more upon it gazd,
The whiles the passing brightness her frail senses dazd.
Tho as she backward cast her busy eye,
To search each secret of that goodly sted
Over the door thus written she did spy
Be bold: she often and often it ouer-red
Yet could not find what sense it figured:
But what so were therein, or writ or meant,
She was no whit thereby discouraged,
From prosecuting of her first intent,
But forward with bold steps into the next room went.
Much fayrer, then the former, was that room,
And richlier by many parts arayd:
For not with arras made in painful loome,
But with pure gold it all was ouerlayd,
Wrought with wild Antickes, which their follies played,
In the rich metal, as they living were:
A thousand monstrous forms therein were made,
Such as false love does often upon him wear,
For love in thousand monstrous forms does often appear.
And all about, the glistring walls were hong
With warlike spoils, and with victorious prays,
Of mighty Conquerours and Captains strong,
Which were whilome captiued in their days,
To cruel love, and wrought their own decays:
Their swerds and speres were broke, and hauberques rent
And their proud girlonds of tryumphant bays,
Trodden in dust with fury insolent,
To show the victors might and merciless intent.
The warlike Maid beholding earnestly
The goodly ordinance of this rich Place,
Did greatly wonder, ne could satisfy
Her greedy eyes with gazing a long space,
But more she meruaild that no footings (...),
Nor wight appeared, but wastefull emptiness,
And solemn silence over all that place:
Strange thing it seemed, that none was to possess
So rich purueyaunce, ne them keep with carfulness.
And as she looked about, she did behold,
How over that same door was likewise writ,
Be bold, be bold, and every where Be bold,
That much she muz'd, yet could not construe it
By any ridling skill, or commune wit.
At last she spyde at that rowmes upper end,
Another iron door, on which was writ,
Be not too bold; whereto though she did bend
Her earnest mind, yet wist not what it might intend.
Thus she there waited until euentyde,
Yet living creature none she saw appear:
And now sad shadows began the world to hyde
From mortal view, and wrap in darkness dreare;
Yet nould she d'off her weary arms, for fear
Of secret danger, ne let sleep oppress
Her heavy eyes with natures burdein dear,
But drew herself aside in sickernesse,
And her welpointed wepons did about her dress.
Cant. XII.
The mask of Cupid, and th'enchanted
Chamber are displayed,
Whence Britomart redeemes fair
Amoret, through charms decayed.
THo when as chearelesse Nighty coucred had
Fair heaven with an universal clowd,
That every wight dismayed with darkness sad,
In silence and in sleep themselves did shroud,
She heard a shrilling Trompet sound alowd,
Sign of nigh battaill, or got victory;
Naught therewith daunted was her courage proud,
But rather stird to cruel enmity,
Expecting ever, when some foe she might descry.
With that, an hideous storm of wind arose,
With dreadful thunder and lightning atwixt,
And an earthquake, as if it straight would lose
The worlds foundations from his center fixed;
A direful stench of smoke and sulphur mixed
Ensewd, whose noyaunce filled the fearful sted,
From the fourth hour of night until the sixth;
Yet the bold Britonesse was naught ydred,
Though much emmou'd, but steadfast still perseuered.
All suddeinly a stromy whirlwind blew
Throughout the house, that clapped every door,
With which that iron wicket open flew,
As it with mighty leuers had been (...):
And forth yssewd, as on the ready flore
Of some Theater, a grave personage,
That in his hand a branch of laurel bore,
With comely haueour and countenance (...),
Yclad in costly garments, fit for (...) Stage.
Proceeding to the midst, he still did stand,
As if in mind he somewhat had to say,
And to the vulgar beckning with his hand,
In sign of silence, as to hear a play,
By lively actions he began bewray
Some argument of matter passioned;
Which done, he back retired soft away,
And passing by, his name (...),
Ease, on his robe in golden letters cyphered.
The noble Maid, still standing all this vewd,
And merueild at his strange intendiment;
With that a joyous fellowship issewd
Of Minstrales, making goodly meriment,
With wanton Bardes, and Rymers impudent,
All which together song full chearefully
A lay of loves delight, with sweet concent:
After whom marched a jolly company,
In manner of a mask, enranged orderly.
The whiles a most delitious harmony,
In full strange notes was sweetly heard to sound,
That the rare sweetness of the melody
The feeble senses wholly did confound,
And the frail soul in deep delight nigh drowned:
And when it ceast, shrill trompets loud did bray,
That their report did far away rebound,
And when they ceast, it began again to play,
The whiles the maskers marched forth in trim array.
The first was Fansy, like a lovely Boy,
Of rare aspect, and beauty without pear,
Matchable either to that ympe of Troy,
Whom Jove did love, and chose his cup to bear,
Or that same dainty (...), which was so dear
To great Alcides, that when as he did,
He wailed womanlike with many a tear,
And every word, and every valley wide
He filled with Hylas name; the Ny mphes eke Hylas cryde.
His garment nether was of silk nor say,
But painted plumes, in goodly order dight,
Like as the (...) Indians do array
Their tawney bodies, in their proudest plight:
As those same plumes, so seemd he vain and light,
That by his gate might easily appear;
For still he fared as dancing in delight,
And in his hand a windy fan did (...),
That in the idle air he moved still here and theare.
And him beside marched amorous Desire,
Who seemd of ryper years, then the other Swayne,
Yet was that others swayne this elders sire,
And gave him being, commune to them twain:
His garment was disguysed very vain,
And his embrodered Bonet sat awry;
Twixt both his hands few sparks he close did strain,
Which still he blew, and kindled busily,
That soon they life conceived, and forth in flames did fly.
Next after him went Doubt, who was yclad
In a discolored cote, of strange disguyse,
That at his (...) a broad Capuccio had,
And sleeves dependaunt Albanese-wyse:
He looked askew with his mistrustfull eyes,
And nycely trod, as thorns lay in his way
Or that the flore to shrink he did auyse
And on a broken reed he still did stay,
His feeble steps, which shrunck, when hard thereon he lay.
With him went Danger, clothed in ragged weed,
Made of Bears skin, that him more dreadful made,
Yet his own face was dreadful, ne did need
Strange horror, to deforme his griesly shade,
A net in the one hand, and a rusty blade
In the other was, this Mischief, that mishap;
With the one his foes he threatened to invade,
With the other he his friends meant to enwrap:
For whom he could not kill, he practizd to entrap.
Next him was Fear, all armed from top to toe,
Yet thought himself not safe enough thereby,
But feared each shadow moving too or froe,
And his own arms when glittering he did spy,
Or clashing heard, he fast away did fly,
As ashes pale of hew, and winged heeld;
And evermore on danger fixed his eye,
Against whom he always bent a brazen shield,
Which his right hand unarmed fearfully did wield.
With him went Hope in rank, a handsome Maid,
Of cheerful look and lovely to behold;
In silken samite she was light arayd,
And her fair locks were wouen up in gold;
She always smyld, and in her hand did hold
An holy water Sprinckle, dipped in deowe,
With which sly sprinkled favors manifold,
On whom she list, and did great liking sheowe,
Great liking unto many, but true love to feowe.
And after them (...), and Suspect
Marched in one rank, yet an unequal pair:
For she was gentle, and of mild aspect,
Courteous to all, and seeming debonaire,
Goodly adorned, and exceeding fair:
Yet was that all but painted, and pourloynd,
And her bright brows were decked with borrowed hair:
Her deeds were forged, and her words false coynd,
And always in her hand two clewes of silk she twynd.
But he was foul, ill favored, and grim,
Under his eiebrowes looking still askaunce;
And ever as Dissemblaunce laughed on him,
He lowrd on her with dangerous eyeglaunce;
Showing his nature in his countenance;
His rolling eyes did never rest in place,
But walkte each where, for fear of hid mischaunce,
Holding a lattis still before his face,
Through which he still did peep, as forward he did pace.
Next him went Grief, and Fury matched yfere;
Grief all in sable sorrowfully clad,
Down hanging his dull head, with heavy chere,
Yet inly being more, then seeming sad:
A pair of Pincers in his hand he had,
With which he pinched people to the heart,
That from thenceforth a wretched life they ladd,
In wilful languor and consuming smart,
Dying each day with in ward wounds of dolours dart.
But Fury was full ill appareiled,
In rags, that naked nigh she did appear,
With ghastly looks and dreadful drerihed;
For from her back her garments she did tear,
And from her head ofterent her snarled hear:
In her right hand a firebrand she did toss
About her head, still roming here and there;
As a dismayed Dear in chase emhost,
Forgetful of his safety, has his right way lost.
After them went Displeasure and Pleasaunce,
He looking lompish and full (...) sad,
And hanging down his heavy countenance;
She cheerful fresh and full of ioyaunce glad,
As if no sorrow she ne felt ne dread;
That evil matched pair they seemd to be:
An angry Waspe the one in a vial had
The Other in hers an hony-lady Be,
Thus marched these six couples forth in fair degree
After all these there marched a most fair Dame,
Led of two grysie villeins, the one Despite,
The other cleped Cruelty by name:
She doleful Lady, like a dreary Spright,
Called by strong charms out of eternal night,
Had Deaths own image figurd in her face,
Full of sad signs, fearful to living sight,
Yet in that horror showed a seemly grace,
And with her feeble feet did move a comely pace.
Her breast all naked, as (...) yuory,
Without adorn of gold or silver bright,
Wherewith the Craftesman wonts it beautify,
Of her dew honor was despoyled quight,
And a wide wound therein (O ruefull sight)
Entrenched deep with knyfe accursed keen,
Yet freshly bleeding forth her fainting spright,
(The work of cruel hand) was to be seen,
That did in sanguine red her skin all snowy cle
At that wide orifice her trembling heart
Was drawn forth, and in silver basin laid,
Quite through transfixed with a deadly dart,
And in her blood yet steeming fresh embayd:
And those two villeins, which her steps vpstayd,
When her weak feet could scarcely her sustain,
And fading vital powers began to fade,
Her forward skill with torture did constrain,
And evermore increased her consuming pain.
Next after her, the winged God him self
Cameriding on a Lion ravenous,
Taught to obey the menage of that Elfe,
That man and beast with power imperious
Subdeweth to his kingdom tyrannous:
His blindfold eyes he bad a while unbind,
That his proud spoil of that same dolorous
Fair Dame he might behold in perfect kind,
Which seen, he much rejoiced in his cruel mind.
Of which full proud, him self up rearing hye,
He looked round about with stern disdain;
And did suruay his goodly company:
And marshalling the evil ordered train,
With that the darts which his right did strain,
Full dreadfully he shook that all did quake,
And clapped on hye his coulourd wings twain,
That all his many it affraide did make:
Tho blinding him again, his way he forth did take.
Behind him was Reproach, Repentance, Shame;
Reproach the first, Shame next, Repent behind:
(...) feeble, sorrowful, and lame:
(...) despightful, careless, and unkind;
Shame most illfauourd, bestiall, and blind:
Shame lowrd, Repentance sighed, Reproach did scould;
Reproach sharp stings, Repentance whips entwinde,
Shame burning brond-yrons in her hand did hold:
All three to each unlike, yet all made in one mould.
And after them a rude confused rout
Of persons flockt, whose names is hard to read:
Emongst them was stern Strife, and Anger stout,
Unquiet Care, and fond Vnthriftyhead,
Lewd Loss of Time,, and Sorrow seeming dead,
Inconstant Change, and false Disloyalty,
Consuming Riotise, and guilty Dread
Of heavenly vengeance, faint Infirmity,
Vile Poverty, and lastly Death with infamy.
There were full many more like maladies,
Whose names and natures I note readen well;
So many more, as there be fantasies
In wavering wemens wit, that none can tell,
Or pains in love, or punishments in hell;
All which disguized marched in masking wise,
About the chamber by the Damozell,
And then returned, having marched thrice,
Into the inner rowme, from whence they first did rise.
So soon as they were in, the door straight way
Fast locked, driven with that stormy blast,
Which first it opened; nothing did remain.
Then the brave Maid, which all this while was plast,
In secret shade, and saw both first and last,
Issewed forth, and went unto the door,
To enter in, but fownd it locked fast:
It vain she thought with rigorous uproar
For to efforce, when charms had closed it before.
Where force might not avail, their sleights and art
She cast to use, both fit for hard (...);
For thy from that same row me not to depart
Till morrow next, she did her self auize,
When that same Mask again should forth arize.
The morrow next appeard (...) joyous cheer,
Calling men to their daily ezercize,
Then she, as morrow fresh, her self did rear
Out of her secret stand, that day for to outweare.
All that day she outwore in wandering,
And gazing on that Chambers ornament,
Till that again the second evening
Her covered with her sable vestiment,
Wherewith the worlds fair beauty she has blent:
Then when the second watch was almost past,
That brazen door flew open, and in went
Bold Britomart, as she had late forecast,
Nether of idle shows, nor of false charms aghast.
So soon as she was entered, rownd about
She cast (...), to see what was become
Of all those persons, which she saw without:
But lo, they straight were vanished all and some,
Ne living wight she saw in all that room,
Save that same woeful Lady, both whose hands
Were bounden fast, that did her ill become,
And her small waste girt rownd with iron bands,
Unto a brazen pillour, by the which she stands.
And her before the vile Enchaunter sat,
Figuring strange characters of his art,
With living blood he those characters wrate,
Dreadfully dropping from her dying heart,
Seeming transfixed with a cruel dart,
And all perforce to make her him to love.
Ah who can love the worker of her smart?
A thousand charms he formerly did prove;
Yet thousand charms could not her steadfast heart remove.
Soon as that virgin knight he saw in place,
His wicked books in have he overthrew,
Not (...) his long labors to deface,
And fiercely running to that Lady true,
A murdrous knife out of his pocket drew,
The which he thought, for villeinous despite,
In her tormented body to embrew:
But the stout Damzell to him leaping light,
His cursed hand withheld, and maistered his might.
From her, to whom his fury first he meant,
The wicked weapon rashly he did wrest,
And turning to the next his fell intent.
Unawares it struck into her snowie chest,
That little drops empurpled her fair breast.
Exceeding wroth therewith the virgin grew,
Albe the wound were nothing deep impressed,
And fiercely forth her mortal blade she drew,
To give him the reward for such vile outrage dew.
So mightily she smote him, that to ground
He fell half dead; next stroke him should have slain,
Had not the Lady, which by him stood bound,
(...) unto him called to abstain,
From doing him to die. For else her pain
Should be remediless, since none but he,
Which wrought it, could the same recure again.
Therewith she stayed her hand, loath stayed to be;
For life she him enuyde, and longed revenge to see.
And to him said, Thou wicked man, whose meed
For so huge mischief, and vile villainy
Is death, or if that ought do death exceed,
Be sure, that naught may save thee from to die,
But if that thou this Dame do presently
Restore unto her health, and former state;
This do and live, else dye undoubtedly.
He glad of life, that looked for death but late,
Did yield him self right willing to prolong his date.
And rising up, began straight to ouerlooke
Those cursed leaves, his charms back to reuerse;
Full dreadful things out of that balefull book
He red, and measured many a sad verse,
That horror began the virgins heart to perse,
And her fair locks up stared stiff on end,
Hearing him those same bloody lines rehearse;
And all the while he red, she did extend
Her sword high over him, if ought he did offend.
Anon she began perceive the house to quake,
And all the doors to rattle round about;
Yet all that did not her dismayed make,
Nor slack her threatfull hand for dangers dout,
But still with steadfast eye and courage stout,
Abode to weet, what end would come of all.
At last that mighty chain, which round about
Her tender waste was wound, adowne (...) fall,
And that great brazen pillour broke in (...) small.
The cruel steel, which thrild her dying heart,
Fell softly forth, as of his own accord,
And the wide wound, which lately did dispart
Her bleeding breast, and riuen bowels gored,
Was closed up, as it had not been sor'd,
And every part to safety full sownd,
As she were never hurt, was soon restored:
Tho when she felt her self to be vnbownd,
And perfect hole, prostrate she fell unto the grownd,
Before fair Britomart, she fell prostrate,
Saying, Ah noble knight, what worthy meede
Can wretched Lady, quitt from woeful state,
Yield you in lieu of this your gracious deed;
Your virtue self her own reward shall breed,
Even immortal praise, and glory wide
Which I your vassal, by your prowess freed,
Shall through the world make to be notifyde,
And goodly well advance that goodly well was tryde.
But Britomart vprearing her from grownd,
Said, Gentle Dame, reward enough I ween
For many labors more, then I have found,
This, that in safety now I have you seen,
And mean of your deliverance have been:
Henceforth fair Lad comfort to you take,
And put away remembrance of late teene;
Insted thereof know, that your loving Make,
Has no less grief endured for your gentle sake.
She much was cheard to hear him mentiond,
Whom of all living wightes she loved best.
Then laid the noble Championess strong hond
Upon th'enchaunter, which had her distressed
So sore, and with foul outrages oppressed:
With that great chain, wherewith not long ygoe
He bound that pitteous Lady prisoner, now relest,
Himself she bound, more worthy to be so,
And captive with her led to wretchedness and woe.
Returning back, those goodly rowmes, which erst
He saw so rich and royally arayd,
Now vanished utterly, and clean subuerst
He found, and all their glory quite decayed,
That sight of such a change him much dismayed.
Thenceforth descending to that perlous Porch,
Those dreadful flames she also found delayed,
And quenched quite, like a consumed torch,
That erst all entrers wont so cruelly to scorch.
At last she came unto the place, where late
She left Sir Scudamour in great distress,
Twixt dolor and despite half desperate,
Of his loves succor, of his own redress,
And of the hardy Britomarts success:
There on the cold earth him now thrown she found,
In wilful anguish, and dead heaviness,
And to him called; whose voices known sound
Soon as he heard, himself he reared light from ground.
There did he see, that most on earth him ioyd,
His dearest love, the comfort of his days,
Whose too long absence him had sore annoyd,
And wearied his life with dull delays:
Straight he up started from the loath ed lays,
And to her ran with hasty egernesse,
Like as a Dear, that greedily embayes
In the cool soil, after long thirstinesse,
Which he in chase endured has, now nigh breathless.
Lightly he clipped her twixt his arms twain,
And straightly did embrace her body bright,
Her body, late the prison of sad pain,
Now the sweet lodge of love and dear delight:
But she fair Lady ouercommen quight
Of huge affection, did in pleasure melt,
And in sweet rauishment pourd out her spright:
No word they spoke, nor earthly thing they felt,
But like two senceles stocks in long embraceme^t dwelt.
Had ye them seen, ye would have surely thought,
That they had been that fair Hermaphrodite,
Which that rich Roman of white marble wrought,
And in his costly Bath causd to be site:
So seemd those two, as grown together quite,
That Britomart half envying their bless,
Was much empassiond in her gentle sprite,
And to her self often wished like happiness,
In vain she wished, that fate n'ould let her yet possess.
Thus do those lovers with sweet counteruayle,
Each other of loves bitter fruit despoile.
But now my teme begins to faint and fail,
All woxen weary of their iournall toil:
Therefore I will their sweatie yokes assoyle
At this same furrows end, till a new day:
And ye fair Swayns, after your long turmoyle,
Now cease your work, and at your pleasure play;
Now cease your work; to morrow is an holy day.
FINIS.
A Letter of the Authors expounding his whole intention in the course of this
work: which for that it gives great light to the Reader, for the better
understanding is hereunto annexed.
To the Right noble, and Valorous, Sir Walter Raleigh knight, Lo. Wardein of
the Stanneryes, and her Majesty's liefetenaunt of the County of Cornewayll.
SIr knowing how doubtfully all Allegories may be construed, and this book of
mine, which I have entitled the Faery Queen, being a continued Allegory, or
dark conceit, I have thought good as well for avoiding of gealous opinions and
misco^structions, as also for your better light in reading thereof, (being so by
you commanded,) to discover unto you the general intention and meaning, which
in the whole course thereof I have fashioned, without expressing of any
particular purposes or by accidents therein occasioned. The general end
therefore of all the book is to fashion a gentleman or noble person in
virtuous and gentle discipline: Which for that I conceived should be most
plausible and pleasing, being colored with an historical fiction, the which
the most part of men delight to read, rather for variety of matter, then for
profit of the exsample: I chose the historye of king Arthure, as most fit
for the excellency of his person, being made famous by many men's former works,
and also furthest from the danger of envy, and suspicion of present time. In
which I have followed all the antique Poets historical, first Homere, who in
the Persons of Agamemnon and Ulysses has ensampled a good governor and a
virtuous man, the one in his Ilias, the other in his Odysseis: then Virgil,
whose like intention was to do in the person of Aeneas: after him Ariosto
comprised them both in his Orlando: and lately Tasso disseuered them again,
and formed both parts in two persons, namely that part which they in Philosophy
call Ethice, or virtues of a private man, colored in his Rinaldo: The other
named Politice in his Godfredo. By ensample of which excellent Poets, I labor
to pourtraict in Arthure, before he was king, the image of a brave knight,
perfected in the twelve private moral virtues, as Aristotle has devised, the
which is the purpose of these first twelve books: which if I find to be well
accepted, I may be perhaps encoraged, to frame the other part of polliticke
virtues in his person, after that he came to be king. To some I know this
Method will seem displeasaunt, which had rather have good discipline
delivered plainly in way of precepts, or sermoned at large, as they use, then
thus clowdily enwrapped in All goricall devises. But such, me seem, should be
satisfide with the use of these days, seeing all things accounted by their
shows, and nothing esteemed of, that is not delightful and pleasing to
commune sense. For this cause is Xenophon preferred before Plato, for that the
one in the exquisite depth of his judgment, formed a Commune wealth such as it
should be, but the other in the person of Cyrus and the Persians fashioned a
government such as might best be: So much more profitable and gracious is
doctrine by ensample, then by rule. So have I labored to do in the person of
Arthure: whom I conceive after his long education by Timon, to whom he was by
Merlin delivered to be brought up, so soon as he was borne of the Lady
Igrayne, to have seen in a dream or vision the Faery Queen, with whose
excellent beauty ravished, he awaking resolved to seek her out, and so being
by Merlin armed, and by Timon thoroughly instructed, he went to seek her forth
in Faerye land. In that Faery Queen I mean glory in my general intention,
but in my particular I conceive the most excellent and glorious person of our
sovereign the Queen, and her kingdom in Faery land. And yet in some places
el, I do otherwise shadow her. For considering she bears two persons, the
one of a most royal Queen or Empress, the other of a most virtuous and
beautiful Lady, this latter part in some places I do ezpresse in Belphoebe,
fashioning her name according to your own excellent conceit of Cynthia,
(Phaebe and Cynthia being both names of Diana.) So in the person of Prince
Arthure I set forth magnificence in particular, which virtue for that
(according to Aristotle and the rest) it is the perfection of all the rest, and
contains in it them all, therefore in the whole course I mention the deeds
of Arthure app'yable to that virtue, which I write of in that book. But of the
xii. other virtues, I make xii. other knight the patrones, for the more variety
of the history: Of which these three books contayn three. The first of the
knight of the (...), in whom I express Holiness: The second of (...) Guyon,
in whom I set forth Temperaunce: The third of Britomartis a Lady knight, in
whom I picture Chastity. But because the beginning of the whole work seems
abrupte and as depending upon other antecedents, it needs that ye know the
occasion of these three knights several adventures. For the Method of a Poet
historical is not such, as of an Historiographer. For an Historiographer
discourses of affairs orderly as they were done, accounting as well the
times as the actions, but a Poet thrusts into the midst, even where it most
concerns him, and there recoursing to the things forepaste, and divining of
things to come, makes a pleasing Analysis of all. The beginning therefore of
my history, if it were to be told by an Historiographer should be the twelfth
book which is the last, where I devise that the Faery Queen kept her Annual
feast xii. days, upon which xii. several days, the occasions of the xii.
several adventures happened, which being undertaken by xii. several knights,
are in these xii books severally handled and (...). The first was this. In the
beginning of the feast, there presented him self a tall clownishe young man,
who falling before the Queen of Faries desired a boon (as the manner then was)
which during that feast she might not refuse: which was that he might have the
atchieuement of any adventure, which during that feast should hap^pen, that
being granted, he rested him on the floor, unfit through his rusticity for
a better place. (...) after entered a fair Lady in mourning weeds, riding on
a white Ass, with a dwarf behind her leading a warlike steed, that bore the
Arms of a knight, and his spear in the dwarfes hand. She falling before the
Queen of Faeries, complained that her father and mother an ancient King and
Queen, had been by an huge dragon many years shut up in a brazen Castle, who
thence suffered them not to yssew: and therefore besought the Faery Queen to
assygne her some one of her knights to take on him that exployt. Presently that
clownish person vpstarting, desired that adventure: whereat the Queen much
wondering, and the Lady much gainesaying, yet he earnestly importuned his
desire. In the end the Lady told him that unless that armor which she
brought, would (...) him (that is the armor of a Christian man specified by
Saint Paul v. Ephesians.) that he could not succeed in that enterprise, which being
forthwith put upon him with dew furnitures thereunto, he seemed the goodliest
man in all that company, and was well liked of the Lady. And eftesoones taking
on him knighthood, and mounting on that strange Courser, he went forth with
her on that adventure: where begins the first book, vz.

A gentle knight was pricking on the plain. etc.

The second day there came in a Palmer bearing an Infant with bloody hands,
whose Parents he complained to have been slain by an Enchaunteresse called
Acrasia: and therefore craved of the Faery Queen, to appoint him some knight,
to perform that adventure, which being assigned to Sir Guyon, he presently
went forth with that same Palmer: which is the beginning of the second book
and the whole subject thereof. The third day there came in, a Groom who
complained before the Faery Queen, that a (...) Enchaunter called Busirane had
in hand a most fair Lady called Amoretta, whom he kept in most grievous
torment, because she would not yield him the pleasure of her body. Whereupon
Sir Scudamour the lover of that Lady presently took on him that adventure. But
being unable to perform it by reason of the hard Enchauntments, after long
sorrow, in the end met with Britomartis, who succored him, and reskewed his
love.

But by occasion hereof, many other adventures are intermedled, but rather as
Accidents, then intendments. As the love of Britomart, the overthrow of
Marinell, the misery of Florimell, the vertuousnes of (...), the lasciuiousnes
of Hellenora, and many the like.

Thus much Sir, I have briefly ouerronne to direct your understanding to the
wel-head of the History, that from thence gathering the whole intention of the
conceit, ye may as in a handful gripe all the discourse, which otherwise may
happily seem tedious and confused. So humbly craving the continuance of your
honorable favor toward me, and the eternal establishment of your happiness, I
humbly take leave.

23. January. 1589. Yours most humbly affectionate. Ed. Spenser.

A Vision upon this conceit of the Faery Queen.
ME thought I saw the grave, where Laura lay,
Within that Temple, where the vestall flame
Was wont to burn, and passing by that way,
To see that buried dust of living fame,
Whose tumbe fair love, and fairer virtue kept,
All suddeinly I saw the Faery Queen:
At whose approach the soul of Petrarke wept,
And from thenceforth those graces were not seen.
For they this Queen attended, in whose steed
Oblivion laid him down on Lauras hearse:
Hereat the hardest stones were seen to bleed,
And groans of buried ghostes the heuens did perse.
Where Homers spright did tremble all for grief,
And cursed th'accesse of that celestial theife.
Another of the fame.
THe praise of meaner wits this work like profit brings,
As does the Cuckoes song delight when Philumena sings.
If thou have formed right true virtues face herein:
Virtue her self can best discern, to whom they written bin.
If thou have beauty praysd, let her sole looks divine
Judge if ought therein be amiss, and mend it by her eine.
If Chastity want ought, or Temperaunce her dew,
Behold her Princely mind aright, and write thy Queen anew.
Mean while she shall perceive, how far her virtues sore
Above the reach (...) that live, or such as wrote of yore:
And thereby will excuse and favor thy good will:
Whose virtue can not be expressed, but by an Angels quill.
Of me no lines are loved, nor letters are of price,
Of all which speak our English tongue, but those of thy device.
W. R.
To the learned Shepeheard.
COllyn I see by thy new taken task,
some sacred fury has enricht thy brains,
That leads thy muse in haughty verse to mask,
and loath the lays that longs to lowly swaynes.
That lifts thy notes from Shepheardes unto kings,
So like the lively Lark that mounting singes.
Thy lovely Rosolinde seems now forlorn,
and all thy gentle flocks forgotten quight,
Thy changed heart now holds thy pypes in scorn,
those pretty pypes that did thy mates delight.
Those trusty mates, that loved thee so well,
Whom thou gave mirth: as they gave thee the bell.
Yet as thou erst with thy sweet roundelayes,
did stir to glee our laddes in homely bowers:
So moughtst thou now in these refyned lays,
delight the dainty ears of higher powers.
And so might they in their deep skanning skill
Allow and grace our Collyns flowing quyll.
And fare befall that Faery Queen of thine,
in whose fair eyes love linckt with virtue sittes:
Enfusing by those bewties fyers deuyne,
such high conceits into thy humble wits,
As raised has poor pastors oaten reed,
From rustic tunes, to chaunt heroique deeds.
So might thy Redcrosse knight with happy hand
victorious be in that fair Islands right:
Which thou do veil in Type of Faery land
Elyzas blessed field, that Albion hight.
That shieldes her friends, and wars her mighty foes,
Yet still with people, peace, and plenty flows.
But (jolly shepeheard) though with pleasing style,
thou feast the humor of the Courtly train:
Let not conceit thy settled sense beguile,
ne daunted be through envy or disdain.
Subject thy dome to her Empyring spright,
From whence thy Muse, and all the world takes light.
Hobynoll.
Fair Thamis stream, that from Ludds stately town,
Runst paying tribute to the Ocean seas,
Let all thy Nymphs and Sirens of renown
Besilent, while this Bryttane Orpheus plays:
Nere thy sweet banks, there lives that sacred crown,
Whose hand strowes Palm and neuer-dying bays,
Let all at once, with thy soft murmuring sown
Present her with this worthy Poets prays.
For he has taught hye drifts in shepeherdes weeds,
And deep conceits now singes in Faeries deeds.
R. S.
Grave Muses march in triumph and with praises,
Our Goddess here has given you leave to land:
And biddes this rare dispensor of your graces
Bow down his brow unto her sacred hand.
Deserts finds dew in that most princely doom,
In whose sweet breast are all the Muses bredde:
So did that great Augustus erst in Room
With leaves of fame adorn his Poets hedde.
Fair be the guerdon of your Faery Queen,
Even of the fairest that the world has seen.
H. B.
When stout Achilles heard of Helens rape
And what revenge the States of Greece deuisd:
Thinking by sleight the fatal wars to escape,
In woman's weeds him self he then disguisde:
But this devise Ulysses soon did spy,
And brought him forth, the chance of war to try.
When Spencer saw the fame was spredd so large,
Through Faery land of their renowned Queen:
Loath that his Muse should take so great a charge,
As in such haughty matter to be seen,
To seem a shepeheard then he made his choice,
But Sydney heard him sing, and knew his voice.
And as Ulysses brought fair Thetis son
From his retired life to menage arms:
So Spencer was by Sidneys speeches won,
To blaze her fame not fearing future harms:
For well he knew, his Muse would soon be tired
In her high praise, that all the world admired.
Yet as Achilles in those warlike srayes,
Did win the palm from all the Grecian Peers:
So Spencer now to his immortal praise,
Has won the Laurel quite from all his seres.
What though his task exceed a human wit,
He is excused, since Sidney thought it fit.
W. L.
To look upon a work of rare devise
The which a workman sets out to view,
And not to yield it the deserved prise,
That unto such a workmanship is dew.
Does either prove the judgment to be naught
Or else does show amind with envy fraught.
To labor to commend a piece of work,
Which no man goes about to discommend,
Would raise (...) that there did (...),
Some secret doubt, whereto the praise did tend.
For when men know the goodness of the wine,
It Is needless for the host to have a sign.
Thus then to show my judgment to be such
As can discern of colors (...), and white,
As alls to free my mind from (...) tuch,
That never gives to any man his right,
I here (...) this workmanship is such,
As that no pen can set it forth too much.
And thus I hang a garland at the door,
Not for to show the goodness of the ware:
But such has been the (...) hereto fore,
And customs very hardly broken are.
And when your taste shall tell you this is true,
Then look you give your host his utmost dew.
Ignoto.

England etc.
THose prudent heads, that with their counsels wise
Whylom the Pillours of the earth did sustain,

And in the neck of all the world to rain,
Often from those grave affairs were wont abstain,

So Maro often did Caesar's cares allay.
So you great Lord, that with your counsel sway

With like delights sometimes may eke delay,

MAgnificke Lord, whose virtues exellent
Do merit a most famous Poets wit,

Naught is thy worth disparaged thereby,
But when my Muse, whose feathers nothing (...)

With bolder wing shall dare alofte to (...)
To the last praises of this Faery Queen,
Then shall it make more famous memory
Of thine Heroicke parts, such as they been:

To these first labors needed furtheraunce,
To the right Honorable the Earl of Oxenford, Lord high Chamberlayne of
England. etc.
Receive most Noble Lord in gentle gree,
The unripe fruit of an unready wit:
Which by thy countenance does crave to be
Defended from foul Enuies poisnous bit.
Which so to do may thee right well besit,
Since th'antique glory of thine auncestry
Under a shady vele is therein writ,
And eke thine own long living memory,
Succeeding them in true nobility:
And also for the love, which thou do bear
To the Heliconian ymps, and they to thee,
They unto thee, and thou to them most dear:
Dear as thou art unto thy self, so love
That loves and honors thee, as does behoue.
To the right honorable the Earl of Northumberland.
THe sacred Muses have made always clame

And Registres of everlasting fame,

To Embrace the service of sweet Poetry,
By whose endeavors they are glorifide,
And eke from all, of whom it is enuide,
To patronize the author of their praise,
Which gives them life, that else would soon have did,
And crowns their ashes with immortal baies.
To thee therefore right noble Lord I send
This present of my pains, it to defend.
To the right Honorable the Earl of Ormond and Ossory.
Receive most noble Lord a simple taste
Of the wild fruit, which saluage soil has bred,
Which being through long wars left almost waste,
With brutish barbarism is ouerspredd:
And in so fair a land, as may be redd,
Not one Parnassus, nor one Helicone
Left for sweet Muses to be harbored,
But where thy self have thy brave mansione;
There in deed dwell fair Graces many one.
And gentle Nymphs, delights of learned wits,
And in thy person without Paragone
All goodly bounty and true honor sits,
Such therefore, as that wasted soil does yield,
Receive dear Lord in worth, the fruit of barren field.

And noble deeds each other garnishing,
Make you ensample to the present age,
Of the old Heroes, whose famous offspring
The antique Poets wont so much to sing,
In this same Pageaunt have a worthy place,
Since those huge castles of Castilian king,
That vainly threatened kingdoms to displace,
Like flying doves ye did before you chase;
And that proud people woxen insolent
Through many victories, did first deface:
Thy praises ever lasting monument
Is in this verse engraven semblably,
That it may live to all posterity.
To the most renowned and valiant Lord, the Lord Gray of Wilton, knight of the
Noble order of the Garter, etc.
MOst Noble Lord the pillor of my life,
And Patron of my Muses pupillage,
Through whose large bounty poured on me rife,
In the first season of my feeble age,
I now do live, bound yours by vassalage:
Since nothing ever may redeem, nor reaue
Out of your endless debt so sure a gage,
Vouchsafe in worth this small gift to receive,
Which in your noble hands for pledge I leave,
Of all the rest, that I am tide t'account:
Rude rymes, the which a rustic Muse did weaue
In sauadge soil, far from Parnasso mount,
And roughly wrought in an unlearned Loome:
The which vouchsafe dear Lord your favorable doom.
To the right noble and valorous knight, Sir Walter Raleigh, Lo. Wardein of the
Stanneryes, and liefenaunt of Cornewaile.
TO thee that art the summers Nightingale,
Thy sovereign Goddesses most dear delight,
Why do I send this rusticke Madrigale,
That may thy tunefull ear vnseason quite?
Thou only fit this Argument to write,
In whose high thoughts Pleasure has built her bower,
And dainty love learned sweetly to endite.
My rimes I know unsavory and sour,
To taste the streams, that like a golden shower
Flow from thy fruitful head, of thy loves praise,
Fitter perhaps to thonder Martial stowre,
When so thee list thy lofty Muse to raise:
Yet till that thou thy Poem wilt make known,
Let thy fair Cinthias praises be thus rudely shown.
To the most virtuous, and beautiful Lady, the Lady Carew.
NE may I, without blot of endless blame,
You fairest Lady leave out of this place,
But with remembrance of your gracious name,
Where with that courtly garlond most ye grace,
And deck the world, adorn these verses base:
Not that these few lines can in them comprise
Those glorious ornaments of heavenly grace,
Wherewith ye triumph over feeble eyes,
And in subdued hearts do tyranyse:
For thereunto does need a golden quill,
And silver leaves, them rightly to devise,
But to make humble present of good will:
Which whenas timely means it purchase may,
In ampler wise it self will forth display.
E. S.
To all the gracious and beautiful Ladies in the Court.
THe Chian Peincter, when he was requirde
To pourtraict Venus in her perfect hew,
To make his work more absolute, desird
Of all the fairest Maids to have the view.
Much more me needs to draw the semblant true,
Of beauties Queen, the worlds sole wonderment,
To sharp my sense with sundry beauties view,
And steal from each some part of ornament.
If all the world to seek I ouerwent,
A fairer crew yet no where could I see,
Then that brave court does to mine eye present,
That the worlds pride seems gathered there to be.
Of each a part I stole by cunning theft:
Forgive it me fair Dames, since less ye have not lefie.

MOst Noble Lord the pillor of my life,
And Patron of my Muses pupillage,
Through whose large bounty poured on me rife,
In the first season of my feeble age,
I now do live, bound yours by vassalage:
Since nothing ever may redeem, nor reaue
Out of your endless debt so sure a gage,
Vouchsafe in worth this small gift to receive,
Which in your noble hands for pledge I leave,
Of all the rest, that I am tide t'account:
Rude rymes, the which a rustic Muse did weaue
In fauadge soil, far from Parnasso mount,
And roughly wrought in an unlearned Loome:

IN vain I think right honorable Lord,
By this rude rhyme to memorize thy name;
Whose learned Muse has writ her own record,
In golden verse, worthy immortal fame:
Thou much more fit (were leisure to the same)
Thy gracious Souerain praises to compile.
And her imperial Majesty to frame,
In lofty numbers and heroicke style.
But since thou may not so, give leave a while
To baser wit his power therein to spend,
Whose gross defaults thy dainty pen may file,
And unadvised ouersights amend.
But evermore vouchsafe it to maintain
Against vile Zoilus backbitings vain.

Whose girland now is set in highest place,
Had not Mecoenas for his worthy merit,

Might long perhaps have lien in silence bace,
Ne been so much admired of later age.
This lowly Muse, that learns like steps to trace,
Flies for like aid unto your Patronage;
That are the great Mecenas of this age,
As well to all that civil arts profess
As those that are inspird with Martial rage,
And craves protection of her feebleness:
Which if ye yield, perhaps ye may her raise
In bigger tunes to sound your living praise.
E. S.
To the right noble Lord and most valiant Captain, Sir John Norris knight,
Lord president of (...),
Who ever gave more honorable prize
To the sweet Muse, then did the Martial crew;
That their brave deeds she might immortalize
In her shril tromp, and sound their praises dew?
Who then ought more to favor her, then you
Most noble Lord, the honor of this age,
And Precedent of all that arms ensue?
Whose warlike prowess and manly courage,
Tempred with reason and aduizement sage
Has filled sad Belgicke with victorious spoil,
In France and Ireland left a famous gage,
And lately shakt the Lusitanian soil.
Since then each where thou have dispredd thy fame,
Love him, that has eternized your name.

TO thee that art the summers Nightingale,
Thy sovereign Goddesses most dear delight,
Why do I send this rusticke Madrigale,
That may thy tunefull ear vnseason quite?
Thou only fit this Argument to write,
In whose high thoughts Pleasure has built her bower,
And dainty love learnd sweetly to endite.
My rimes I know unsavory and sour,
To taste the streams, that like a golden shower
Flow from thy fruitful bead, of thy loves praise,
Fitter perhaps to thonder Martial stowre,
When so thee list thy lofty Muse to raise:
Yet till that thou thy Poem wilt make known,
Let thy fair Cinthias praises be thus rudely shown.
E. S.
