CORDERIVS DIALOGVES TRANSLATED Grammatically.

For the more speedy attaining to the knowledge of the Latin tongue, for
writing and speaking Latin.

Done chiefly for the good of Schools, to be used according to the Direction
set down in the Book called Ludus Literarius, or The Grammar-schoole.

LONDON, Printed by A. Griffin, for Andrew H^bbe at the Sign of the Bell in
Saint Paul's Churchyard. 1636.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE WILLIAM, Lord CAVENDISH, Baron of Hardwicke, All grace
and Happiness.
RIght Noble Lord, your favorable approbation of my School-indeavouvs,
together with your honorable bounty, for the encouraging of me, to the
accomplishment of my promise for my Grammatical translations, have imboldned
me to dedicate this little labor unto your Lordship. And so much the rather,
for that I hope, it being used aright, according to the directions given in my
book called Ludus Literarius, or the Grammar-schoole, shall give a full
demonstration of whatsoever I have written therein, concerning the commodity of
such like translations (so far as the matter hereof does extend it self) to
make the way to the Latin tongue, most easy and full of all pleasant
allurement, when once the common grounds of the Accedence are gotten, with a
perfect readiness in the examples of the Nounes and Verbes, which may soon be
effected, by the help in the Posing of the Accedence and Grammar. So as the
benefit of these may not only redound unto our common Country-schools, but
happily (and as I unfainedly wish) unto many in all places, who either having
had but some little smattering in Latin, or having lost that which they had
therein, are desirous to repair the same. And more specially to our debauched
youth, to help to retire some of them, to the sweet and pleasant delights,
which are to be found in good studies, and the best aut^ors, from their
disordered courses, wherein they so generally and wholly run themselves out
of all; mispending their talents, both time and patrimony, to their utter
perdition, in all kind of strange riot, and outrageous excess; without any
further consideration, either of the end why they were borne, or wherefore
those pre^ious talents of time, wit, and good ability, were committed unto
them: or so much as of that dreadful account, which they must every one give
up for the same: never bethinking themselves, that the Lord has not put this
price into their hands, to be so consumed in spending days, nights, and
years, yea their whole lives, in drinking, gaming, swearing, revelling, and
all manner of outrage, worse then ever did the Heathen; but to be otherwise
employed, even to buy wisdom, Pro. 16.17.
as Solomon does tell them; to the advancing and perpetual upholding of his
true Religion and service, every one for his ability, by himself and all
others; to have wherewith not only to maintain, but also to better their
estate, with all those who do depend upon them. And so generally to the
performance of every holy duty, which he requires at all our hands; yea to
live in such employment, as may most te^d to the adorning of our holy
profession of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ, and the comfort of our own
souls, with the good of all others. Thus undoubtedly must our accounts be
made: and to whom more has been committed, must more be looked for at their
hands. Wherefore proceed (most worthy Lord) in this your noble care, to further
for your part all those good means by which the Church of God may ever
prosper, and all good learning and virtue (the chief pillars and ornaments
both of Church and Commonwealth) may flourish more and more. That your self,
with your noble progeny, may be blessed in the earth, and you (ever ready to
give up a happy account of your stuardship) to be taken up into everlasting
habitation, to live in bliss eternally: Whereunto I shall ever strive for you,
and to accomplish my service thus entered into for the common good of the
present and all succeeding generations. And so in all humble thankfulness
taking my leave, I commend your Lo* with your most virtuous Lady, and all your
Noble family, to his heavenly Grace, to perfect that good work, which he has
begun, and rest

Your Lo* most humbly and thankefully devoted, I. BRINSLEY.

To the courteous READER.
THou art to be admonished (good Reader,) that in this translation of
Corderius, I have referred into the Margents, all the Grammatical
constructions which cannot be uttered in our own tongue, but by over-harsh
phrases; and made references unto them most commonly with an asteriske or
little star. Least whilst we seek to get Grammar and Latin, we lose
purity or propriety in our own tongue, and bring in barbarism in stead
thereof. And therefore at each Asteriske, the learner is to be admonished, that
ever in construing, parsing, or making Latin, out of this English translation,
he forthwith cast his eye from the text unto the margent, to the like mark:
yet so as that withal, he ever in the second place, give phrase for phrase;
viz. unto our English phrase, to give the like proper Latin phrase, and so
likewise in construing and parsing, or reading the English out of Latin: To
the end to learn both Grammar and phrase, propriety and purity in both tongues
together: and also for the more ready and full understanding of the matter
therein contained. This course I have upon good advice and trial, found most
speedy, sure, and profitable. What is already done, with so great pains, and
care, in weighing every word and phrase, and fitting them to these purposes,
and that, as it were by hours stolen either from my sleep or necessary
recreations, in the midst of my continual employment in my calling, (which
requires a whole man,) accept in good part, and what is defective, future
editions shall (God willing) supply. Use it carefully and constantly, according
to the directions in the Grammar-schoole: and try whether, by the blessings of
the almighty, it will not perform whatsoever is promised therein concerning it.

For the Coins, so often mentioned in it, because they are French coins and
differing from ours, I have advisd with sundry learned both of the French and
English, skillful in the French tongue, and have here set them down,
according to their several valuations in our coin, so near as we have been
able to judge; and ever in the book likewise, so near as I could
conveniently. These here being first perfectly gotten, all in the book will be
very plain.

As, with the French is called un-sould: short it is pronounced, a sou; which
in Dutch called a stiiver; in Latin stiverus, or sestertius. And ten Dutch
stivers make our E^glish shilling; so that a stiver is more then a penny. Thus
As is taken commonly in French; though with the Romans it is taken otherwise.
Calep.

Solidus with the French does commonly signify the same with As: yet sometimes
solidus does signify a shilling with the French, and six sowes make their
shilling, as six stivers make a shilling in Dutch.

Semis is half of As or solidus; the French call semis, deux-liards, two
farthings, though we cannot utter it just: for a lard is not just a farthing.

Quadrans is the fourth part of As, in French un-liard, somewhat more then a
farthing.

Sextans is the s^xt part of As, in French un-double.

Decusses is ten Ass^s, in French dixsoulds, in Dutch ten stivers, in English a
shilling. Though Calepine differ herein.

Denariolus is the twelfth part of As, in French un-denier.

Denarius is a cotne as much as ten denarioli, in French vn-carolus, about our
penny, or somewhat more.

These are the principal coins here mentioned: what thou think amiss in
these, or any part hereof, or of any of my endeavors, signify to me in
courtesy: so thy love shall both much further and encourage me to the
accomplishing of the work. Whereunto desiring with all the help of thy
prayers, unto him whose all my travels, and thoughts are, I commend thee to his
Grace, and rest

Thine so far as his goodness shall enable. I. B.

Q. I (that I may confess it frankly.

C To conclude, all your exercises do delight me marvellously, even in the very

Q Unless thou were he, who (as I know) do neither think me vain nor a

Q Therefore turn thy mind to the matter.

utter most shortly whatsoever I shall think to be of weight*

self that our master to be.
I would have thee to persuade thy self of that, that our Master is much more
gentle, or m^lde.
courteous to us, then he appears openly in the school: for he l^veth, or
carries himself.
he is conversant so familiarly amongst us, as a wise father is wont [to be]
amongst [his] children. Why then (will thou say) is he so severe openly? I
answer, because without such severity (as I have heard of himself, when
sometime.

he made report of it to a certain familiar friend) so great a scholasticall

R Was not his coming troublesome.
grievous to thee?


S What grievous? yea truly, it was most gladsome, or welcome.

R Because peradventure he being absent there is power to thee of living more
freely.
when he is abse^t, thou have power to live more at thy liberty.


S I know not what liberty thou show unto me, or meanest.
tellest me of.


R Of drinking, playing, running up and down.


S therefore do thou think me to do no other thing.
Do thou think then that I do nothing else, when.

R All almost, or for most part.

But as for me, I live so when my father is away* as when he is present.
