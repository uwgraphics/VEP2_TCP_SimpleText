TO THE HONORABLE protection of the Lady Arbella.
NOtwithstanding your rare perfections in so many knowledges, which have
adorned you and you them, let not, worthy Lady, one sole quality of mine
seem the rather insufficiency to your judgment, or breed less acceptance for
being offered alone. It comes out of a profession worthy some grace, and
has in it humors variable for delights sake. I offer them as that whereby I can
best express my service to you, and you may (if it please you) make use of
them at your idlest hours. Many causes I have to imbolden mine attempts of
duty to you, and your favors stand in the top of them: others there are more
secret, and lie in the nature of your own apprehension. And howsoever the
policy of times may hold it unfit to raise men humbled with adversities to
titles of dearnesse, whether to shun charge, or express pride, I rather know
not, yet you I hope out of the honor of your nature, will vouchsafe your
favors to a forward servant, so nearly tied to a dutiful devotion. In what
rank you please to place me, I will not change mine order. It shall be
promotion to me that you account of me in any place, and all the commendations
I seek to my labors in this work, if you will be pleased to hear it at some
times, and protect it at all times. Thus your ladyship having heard what I ca^
say in this first leaf, you may (if it please you to vouchsafe acceptance)
hear what I have song in the rest that follow. And so I rest:

Yours humbly to be commanded: MICHAELL CAVENDISH.
From Cauendish this 24 of July.

This is the Ditty of the second song.
WHy should my muse thus restles in her woes,
Summon records of never dying fears?
And still revive fresh springing in my thoughts,
The true memorial of my sad dispaires?
Who forced to love to those fair eyes am thrall,
Where eyes nor thoughts grant one respect at all?
Endless my grieves since endless is her course,
Still to inflict more torments on my grieves,
Without remorse of poor hearts scalding sighs,
When heaven in tears bewailes my no relieues,
A hard regard, where true devoted love
Conflict it naught but still these crosses prove.
Cease worlds bright sun, from henceforth once to shine,
But in my death now suffer springs to perish,
Forbear to grace earths glory with thy beams,
her richest treasure now forbid to flourish;
Since that her eyes the sunshine of my life.
Affords no grace but torments death and strife.
This is the ditty of the third song.
Have I vowed and must not break it?
Fondly vow dis wisely broken,
Do i love and dare not speak it?
Silence does no love betoken:
Thus I bind in this my breaking,
And I am in silence speaking.
Love is bound though I seem free,
Wrapped in deep affections snare,
Love I must how so ere it be,
Too late men say does come beware.
Then vow no more since vows are vain,
Wrapped in deep affections chain.
This is the Ditty of the fifth song.
Love is not blind, but I my self am so,
With free consent blindfolded by desire,
That guides my will along the paths of woe,
To seek refreshing for a needeles fire.
Love is no boy as fools in fancies feign,
It is my self that play the child so right,
I hope and fear, I weep and laugh again,
And use no fence against so weak a might.
Love has no fire yet is mine only lust,
Does raise the flame which makes my thoughts to fry,
Vain hope and fond conceits in which I trust,
Are the only wings that bear him up so hie.
Love has no bow nor shafts to shoot withal,
He has no bands wherewith to tie us fast,
He has no power, those that be free to thrall,
More than we give nor can no longer last.
Love is a Poets Lie, a beggars store,
A mad man's dream, an ignorants idol great,
In brief this God whom we so much adore,
Of manners strange does find as strange a seat.
This is the ditty of the sixth song.
Love the delight of all well thinking minds,
Delight the fruit of virtue dearly loved,
Virtue the highest good that reason finds,
Reason the forge on which men's thoughts are proved:
Are from the world by natures power bereft,
And in one creature (for her glory) left.
Beauty her cover is, the eyes true pleasure,
In hon^^s fame she lives, the ears true music,
Excess of wonder grows from her lust measure,
Her inward parts are passions only physic:
From her clear heart the springs of virtue flow,
Which (imag'd in her words and deeds) men know.
Time feign would stay that he might never leave her,
Place does rejoice that he must needs contain her,
Death craves of heaven that he may not bereave her,
The heavens know their own and do maintain her:
Delight, Love, Reason, Virtue, let it be,
To hold all women light but only she.
This is the ditty of the seventh song.
THe heart to rue the pleasure of the eye,
The eye to wound the heart with his delight,
What may be said that owe them both hereby,
But both tow serve unto his own despite:
O save and win them both by one desert,
Please still the eye but pity on the heart.
The eye beholds as much as much may be,
In beauty grace and honor to require,
The heart conceaues more then the eye can see,
And slaies himself to feed his wounds desire:
O save and wine them both by one desert,
Please still the eye but pity on the heart.
This is the ditty of the ninth song.
CVrst be the time when first mine eyes beheld
Those rare perfections all men's thoughts admire,
And justly may a shepherds swain bewail
Those fatal hours which caused him first desire;
Loves sweet consent that makes so deep impression,
As heart and soul will witness in confession.
Why should these eyes borne traitors to my rest,
Command my thoughts to yield to this presumption,
To love a nymph whose beauty all surpassing,
In all men's thoughts breeds still a strange confusion;
Heavens forbid that I should dare to move,
A face that gods solicit still in love.
Phillis sweet Phillis the shepherds only Queen,
Skornes to admit a swain into her love,
He pipes and sings and pleades to her for grace,
His sons and Sonnets her can nothing move:
He sighs and vows and prays with true devotion,
But vows and prayers work in her no motion.
Then Coridon must yield to this his curse,
Since that his love cannot her love importune,
For fear dispaires convert this ill to worse,
And by disgrace add more plagues to fortune,
Poor man sit down power out thy plaints amain,
Phillis thee skornes and holds in high disdain.
