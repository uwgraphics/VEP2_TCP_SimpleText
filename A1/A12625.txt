AN HVMBLE SVPPLICATION TO HER MAJESTY.

Printed, Anno Do. 1595.

AN HVMBLE SVPPLICATION TO HER MAJESTY.
MOST MIGHTY and most merciful, most feared, and best beloved Princes, they
are at the bottom of a helpless misery, whom both a condemned estate makes
common objects of abuse, and an vnpittied oppression barreth from discovering
their griefs to those, that only are able to afford them remedy. Every one
trampleth upon their ruin, whom a Princes disgrace has once overthrown.
Sovereign favors being the best foundations of Subjects fortunes, and their
dislikes the steepest downe-falles to all unhappiness. Yet a Prince supplying
the room, and resembling the person of Almighty GOD, should be so indifferent
an arbitrator in all causes, that neither any greatness should bear down
Justice, nor any means be excluded from mercy; and therefore an humble
confidence in your Maiestes goodness, (perfect in all Princely duties, and the
only shot anchor of our just hopes) induced us to lay open our manifold
extremities, which heretofore (as it seems) has bin scarcely heard, less
believed, and nothing regarded. And though our condition be so desolate, that
we can neither be freed from outward misery, but by becoming inwardly more
miserable, nor complain of our troubles, but our very complaints are punished:
yet an infamed life, being to free minds more irksome then an innocent death,
we had rather put our uttermost hazards to your highness clemency, the^ seem
with our silence to give credit to our obliques: to which if we do not, it
may be imagined we cannot answer.

There has been of late published to our undeserved reproach, so strange a
proclamation, that it has made your most affied Subjects doubtful what to
believe: since they see so apparent and incurable truths, countenanced with so
Reverend authority, and warranted with the most Sacred sight of their most
honored Queen: the due respect that every one carries to your gracious
person, acquiteth you in their knowledge, from any meaning to have falsehood
masked under the veil of your Majesty: yet when they see your Sovereign
style so abased, to the authorizing of fictions, that the Magistrates of the
whole realm, most generally sooth things so directly disproued by common
scence, and contrary to their own, and all men's knowledge, it cannot be but a
torment to their Christian minds: yea, and it must make them of force justly
to scorn that any Subject should dare in so high a degree, to blemmish both
his Princes, and her officers credits, as to draw them to auerre his plain and
inexcusable lesings: for what can they think, but this to be either a racking
of public authority to private pusposes, who being yet ripe to reveal their
own dangerous grounds, are forced to borrow these deluding shadows, or an
open condemnation of your Majesty's actions, as though they bare themselves
upon so unjust and lawles motives as could not able them for righteous, but by
begging relief of these counterfeit illusions.

We verily presume that none of your Majesty's Honorable Council, would
either show so little accquaintance with the Princes style, as to deliver in
your name a discourse so full farced with contumelious terms, as better suited
a declamorous tongue, then your highness pen, or be so lightly affected to the
regard of your Honor, as to defile it with the touch of so many false
assertions: yet all men justly marvel that any Inditor durst adventure to
disgorge their private ill will, rather then to observe decency in so public
a thing: yea they lament their own case, when these abuses make uncertain what
to credit in serious points, importing their Country, and their own safeties,
when they see in this (which seems to be but a Prologue to future Tragedies)
the strongest foundation to humane belief, applied in all men's minds to
support mere improbabilites. And though the injury offered to your Majesty,
and merely concerning your Realm, might in equity challenge al men's pens
to warn you of so perilous courses: yet since Priests and Catholics, are the
marks chiefly shot at, we ask humbly leave of your Majesty and Council,
to show how chollericke the humor was toward us, that cared not though the
arrow hit your Highness Honor in the way, so the head thereof might enter into
our hearts. It is an easy thing to be a true Prophet, in foreseeing how this
necessary clearing will be aggrauated to your Majesty with heinous words,
since those that would dislodge us out of all good opinions, will doubtless
endeavor to fulfill any such Prophecy: but now we humble our Petitions to your
care of innocence, that it may arm your ears against such partial
appeachers, and incline you to measure your censure with equity.

To make therefore our entry with the vnfauorable terms, wherein we are
often and generally called unnatural Subjects, we desire to have it decided
by your Majesty's own arbitrament, whether we have justly deserved to wear so
base a liuerie: if we live at home as Catholics professing our name, and
refusing to profess a contrary Religion, we can neither keep our places in
the Innes of Court, but we are imprisoned for Recusancie, impouerished,
troubled, and defamed. And yet if we leave all and seek free use of our
conscience, depart the Realm taking such helps as the Charity of other
countries affords us, we are strait rekoned for unnatural Subjects.

It is rather an unnatural thing to disobey the author of nature for any
creature, in forsaking the faith by which we hope only to be saved, and yet we
must do this to the wilful murdering of our souls: or if we refuse it, be we
at home or abroad, by these hard censures we are proclaimed unnatural. All
bonds both of nature and grace inuit us to love God, and our Country more
then our lives, and our neighbors as our selves: which if we observe in the
highest degree, we hope what other title soever we deserve, we shall at the
least be deemed not to swerve from the rules of Native courtesy: we are in so
mighty and warrantable proofs assured by all Antiquity, that our Catholic
Faith is the only truth, (to which all that have bin, or shall be saved, must
owe their fidelity) that we think it a worthy purchase, for the perseverance
in the same to forfet our best fortunes, and engage our lives to the great
cruelties, the^ by reuolting from it, to enter league with error, and to make
our souls the price of infernal pain, if the^ we esteem it at a higher rate
then our lives, believing that out of it, neither God can be truly served,
nor any soul saved: so if we seek with our deepest perrills to plant it in
our Realm, and to win souls from misbeleefe unto it, we think that we owe
a most sincere, and natural love to our Country: for even by Christ's own
testimony, no man's Charity reaches to any higher point, then to yield his
life for the benefit of his friend. And if others that so deeply touch us for
unnatural creatures, would with as much diligence have searched out the truth
by an indifferent trial, between the learned on both sides, as they have with
violence martyred, and oppressed us, they would happily think themselves
more unnatural, for having misledde infinite souls into endless perdition,
then us that with the sweat of our dearest blood, seek to gleane a few
scattered ears, the silly relics of their unfortunate harvest. And if our
due care of our Country be such, that to rear the least fallen soul amongst
your Majesty's Subjects from a fatal lapse, we are contented to pay our lives
for the ransom, how much better should we think them bestowed, if so high a
pennyworth as your GRACIOUS SELF, or the whole Realm might be the gaynes of
our dearest purchase.

But though they that hunt this fault in us, might best be their own pray
(faith being the strongest of true and natural fidelity: yet must we be
accounted unnatural, being balanced in their affections, that draw all causes
of compassion to motives of cruelty, and make their condemning reports, the
contraries of our dutiful meanings with the like spirit, still breathing more
ill will, then truth: He terms the Right Honorable the Lord Cardinal
Archbishop Allen, and Father Parsons (both learned and reverent men) two
seditious heads, looking happily through such eyes, as judge all men by their
own colors, and what cause have they given to this slaunderer, unless it be
counted sedition to gather the ruins of Gods afflicted Church, and to have
provided Sanctuaries, for persecuted and succourlesse souls: which forced at
home, either to live with a goared conscience, or to lie open to continual
vexations, rather choose to leave their country then their Catholic Religion.
It was no sedition for many in Queen Mary's time, to be harbored in Geneua,
maintained the^ by those that now envy against us. It is no sedition to admit
such multitudes of strangers, as for their faith swarm into England, out of
all countries. It is thought Charity to aid the Stats of Flaunders in the
behalf of Religion. It is extolled in your Majesty as an Honorable favor to
protect the Portingall, and S. Horatio Palanisine: but if we (whose case at
home) in respect of our faith is more miserable then any Protestants in any
other Countries, have chosen two venerable men to procure us some refuge, from
our domestical scourges, where we may follow our studies, and exercise
Piety, strait your Majesty (though induced to practice the same courtesy to
others) is informed against them as seditious heads. So true it is, the same
thing is not it self in diverse persons, and yet as God almighty and the world
is our witness, nothing in those Seminaries, is either intended, or practiced,
but the relief and good education of such forsaken men, as from the storm of
our English shore, fly thither for a calm road, that perfited in the course
of learning and virtue, they may return to offer their blood for the recovery
of souls: As for the baseness of their birthes, which among other like points*
is interlaced with as impertinent, as scornful a parenthesis, as a fitter
noate for the penners, than for your majesty's observation.

I mean not to dwell long upon it, for the thing neither imports any offense
to God, not crime against your Majesty, nor greatly abaseth them, whom
excellent virtue, the only true measure of worthiness has ennobled. Yet this
without disparagement to any may truly be avoided, that the Cardinals grace,
is of as good and ancient a house, and every way as worshipfully allied as some
of the highest Counselours were in their meaner fortunes, till your Majesty's
favors, and their rare abilities, made them steps to clime into their present
honors. And whether he might of likelihood have carried as high a sail if the
time had equally secunded him with favorable gales, I leave to their
judgments who are privy to his present estate, greater than England can
afford to any clergy man. For your Majesty being as able to know, and we less
willing to use the excellency of your subjects, tha^ other Princes, it may be
justly presumed, that he might as well have entered into credit at home, if his
Faith had not drawn his foot from the first step, as with strangers in a
foreign country, where nether familiarity with the Peers, nor acquaintance with
the Prince but the only fame of his worthiness, sent an admiration and love of
him into their hearts, and whosoever considers the manner of his advancement,
being created Cardinal alone, out of the ordinary times, (a prerogative seldom
yielded but to special persons, who marketh his wisdom to have bin in such
reverence, that in Pope Greg. the 14. his sickness, he was thought fitest among
the Cardinals, to be vizgerent in spiritual causes: who is ignorant of the small
cause of our country, by laws, libels, and other means, seeeking to undermine
the Popes Sea (has given him to reward her subjects, with so high promotions:
who finally weyeth the adventures of our Council, to hinder his preferment, and
darken his virtues with hard information, shall easly believe the man to be of
rare perfectio^s, that having no other wings to bear his credit, but learning
and virtue, could reach to so high points of favor, notwithstanding so mighty
lets. As for Father Parsons he having placed the uttermost of his ambition, in
contempt of honor, and the highest of his wealth in voluntary poverty: will
easlie acknowledge his birth to have bin of more honest the^ great parents: yet
were they not so mean, but that they were able to afford him such education,
as might have made his good parts a way to no small preferme^t. And albeit his
credit be great with the K. of Spain, yet did he never Usurp the Title of
the KINGS CONFESSOVR, as as this inditor would persuade your Majesty, though
some of the simple sort of our English soldiers, in the Galleys, upon error
and ignorance, muttered some such speeches amongst them selves. As for other
Priests how many of them are Knights and Esquires sons, as otherwise both to
worshipful and noble houses alleyed, and heirs to fair revenues, let their
own friends and Parents dispersed through the whole Realm bear witness.
This only we may say in answer of our objected baseness, that in the small
number of the Catholic Priests of our Nation, (which reaches not to the
tenth of the Protestant Ministry) there are very near as many, yea happily
more Gentlemen, then in all the other Clergy of the whole Realm.

Now whereas we are most vncourteouslie called a multitude of disolute
youngmen, we desire no other evidence to disprove this accusation, then an
indifferent censure: For first before our departure out of the Realm, we must
resolve to abandon our Country friends, and all such comforts, as naturally
all men seek and find in their native Country. We must relinquish all
possibilities of favor, riches, and credit. We must limite our minds to the
restrained and severe course of the SOCIETY OF JESUS, or the Seminaries, where
the place is in exile, the rules strickt, the government austere, our wills
broken, the least fault chastised, and a most absolute virtue exacted. And who
can imagine those to be so desolute humors, who this determine to abridge
themselves of all actions, of disolutenes, and to imprison their affections
within the presinct of a reguler and straight order, and lest happily it may be
imagined that we say more then in proof we find, it is known to thousands,
and daily seen, and witnessed by travelers, that we are there tide to so
prezise terms in diet, apparel, exercise, and all other things, that we are
much more shortened of our scope, then in any College of our English
Universities. I omit the prayer, fasting, haire-cloth, and other chastisements
of the body, which being voluntary, yet usual; are to any if not more then
partial Judges, invincible grounds against this slander, of being dissolute:
but let our intertainme^t at our return, be a final overthrow of this false
imposition: for who can think them dissolute, that being by the Laws, by
examples by common experience taught, with what bloody conflictes they are
here to encounter, and how many fears, daingers, and agonies, both in life;
and death, they undoubtedly expect, (are notwithstanding contented) for
reclaiming of souls unto Gods fold, willing to yield their bodies to the
hasard of al those miseries foreseen, and foreknowne, and advisedly chosen
before all worldly contentments.

But it may be that some, unacquainted with our states, will measure our minds,
by our apparel, (being as we confess) more agreeable oftentimes, to the
common fashion, than to the grave attire that seems our calling, neither is
our habit, or behavior so ruffian-like, or disordered, (as this inditor, ever
forgetting truth, when he remembers us, would willingly have it imagined) but
in this we must yield our reason, (since we cannot reform the inconvenience)
till your Majesty think it good to license us without danger, to exercise our
functions, much-more mighty is the salvation of our souls, than the external
decency of our apparel, which though it be necessary in time and place, yet is
it not so essential a point, as for the care thereof, to neglect the charge of
Gods flock, and the safety of our own lives: David upon just cause fained
him mad, but his madness was an effect of perfect wisdom, and reason the guide
of his seeming folly. Judith laying aside her hairecloth, and widows weed,
disguised her self in such ornaments, as were fitter to allure laciuious eyes,
the^ to bear witness of her sober mind. And if God added grace and beauty to
her youthful dresses, to further her just revenge upon her enemies, much more
may we hope he will allow a less disguisage in us, to revive the souls of our
dearest friends. It is no sure argument of inward beauty, to be vain in show,
seeing a modest and an humble mind, may be shadowed under the glorious and
courtly robes of a virtuous Hester. And if angels for the benefit of bodies
have suited their shapes, to the requests of their Ministers: now appearing
like soldiers, as to Joshua: now like trauailers, as to Tobie: now like
gracious youths, as to Lot: yea if Christ as the occasion required, seemed to
the two Disciples a Pilgrim, and to Saint Marie Magdalene a Gardener, why may
not we for the winning of souls, (which as God is our witness is the only
cause of our coming) frame our behavior and attire, to the necessity of our
days, as we read the ancient bishops did, in the persecution of the Vandalls,
this therefore cannot be esteemed a just presumption of a dissolute mind in us,
whom not any will to such finenesse, but a desire of safety enforces us to
wear the liueries of the time.

Now whereas the heavy adversaries of our good names, has abused your
Majesty's ears with a truethlesse surmise, that we should avoid the Realm
for lack of living, we humbly resign his folly, to the correction of your
Highness wisdom, for to whom can it seem probable, that we fly for lack
of living, of whom many have vowed all, willingly acepted a voluntary poverty,
leaving that we had, without either hope, or care of getting more, our wealth
being now in well-doing, and our passions, our best possessions, is it like
that for want of living any would enter into a course, wherein without
possibility of preferment they were in apparent hazard to loose their lives:
are any sledde for such poverty, that at the least they could not have lived
in service, with more ease and less labor, than they tie themselves unto, in
a most straight life, where they do more by a willing obedience than they
should have been put unto in a hired subjection, or are they of such quality,
and of so many pleasing parts, that they can in these severe times win men
with peril of their Lives, Lands, and Posterities, to entertain and comfort
them, and could they not have found without plunging themselves in the Sea of
dangers, some more easy means for a competent maintenance, then to beg it
out of so many exegents, and to wring it through so grievous oppressions, and
why should these fears of wantes pinch them more then infinite others, whom
they left behind them? They are men of as pregnant wits, as delivered
tongues, as mature judgments, as most of the Innes of Court, or Universities
where they lived: yea, they were already stepped so far into promotion, that
they needed not to have doubted, nothing less then lack of living, diverse of
them having bin Proctors of University, Fellows and Officers of Colleges, and
likely to (...) rise^ to (...) higher preheminencie. To ^omitte those that
hau^. Reuennewes, and Annuities of they own, besides the allowance and kindred,
with rich and most wealthy families. It pleases further this unfriendly
informer (who seems best pleased with displeasing us) to derive our departure
from a conscience guilty, of crimes committed, being still himself in the
likeness of his speeches, as void of verity, as full of ill will: for if
Priests at their arraignement, be in manner charged with Original sin, many
of them having bin scarcely borne, at the rising in the North, which is always
a common place to declaime against them. If all the notorious faults, that may
any way concern Catholics, are made ordinary inditements, to condemn those
that never heard of them, till they come to the bar: how much would any fault
of their own be objected, yea and multiplied in the urging, if any such could
have bin found: but yet none was ever touched for any thing committed before
his departure, as all testimonies may depose, and the very records testify
in our behalf, and to prevent any inst grounds of this oblique, the
superiors (not ignorant how many eyes are busied in watching for the least
advantage against us) make diligent scrutenie, for the perfect notice of their
virtue, whom they admit to Priesthood, who being for the most part among many
of their own houses, or standing in the Universities, could not cloak any
great enormitie from notice: yea the very age of the greater part (they going
ever very young) is a warrant to quite them from any such offense, as should
force them to fly their Country. And as for the rest, which are of riper
years, they have bin so notified for their morrall life, that they have made
common report their harbinger, to take up their due rooms, in every man's good
opinion. In sum this being an approved accusation, delivered by one that in
the same discourse, has empanalled an enquest of untruths, to find out him in
this also guilty of falsehood, it needs no other answer, but a wise censure
of the Reader: But now most merciful Princess license our too much wronged
innocence, to relate the sharpest doubt of this unkind adversary, joined
with those three odious terms of fugitives, rebels, and traitors, and
dipped as deep in the bitterness of gaul, as he would have it enter into our
dearest blood: And first we crave most humbly but the right of Christians
belief of our oath, which is the only Certificat to make our thoughts
undoubted; upon hope whereof we oppose our guiltless hearts against these
tiles, as our best armor of proof, protesting upon our souls and salvation,
and calling Almighty God and his Angels to witness, that as we hope to have
any benefit by the most precious wounds, and death of our Lord JESUS CHRIST:
the whole and only intent of our coming into this Realm, is no other; but to
labor for the salvation of souls, and in peaceable and quiet sort, to
confirm them in the ancient Catholic faith, in the which their forefathers
lived and died, these thousand four hundred years, out of which we
undoubtedly believe it is impossible that any soul should be saved.

This from the sincerest of our thoughts, before the throne of God, we must
truly profess, intending if no other remedy may be had, to let your
Majesty seal it with the best blood that our faithful, and faultles hearts
can afford. And if any be so hardened in a set incredulity, as rather to
condemn us to perjury, the^ to clear us upon so deep an oath, we will make
reason his guide into our intentions, by which if he think us not as much
perished in our wits, as he supposes us to be in our fidelity, he shall
easily see the truth of our protestation: for first, treason being an offense
that carries with it self a stain of infamy, as can never be taken out, and
makes them that commit it dead, and unpardonable persons. Who ca^ imagine any
so foolish, desperate, as to incur so reproachful a crime full of certain
perils having no other possible mark for his hope, but the uttermost of
worldly evils. And if any one should chance to be so far distracted from
his sense, and to throw himself into so bottomless a destruction: Yet that so
many, and so learned, and so grave men, as daily suffer for their coming in
Priests, would cast away their labors, lives and credittes, for nothing but a
cruel and eternal reproach; our bitterest enemy would never deem it likely,
and what other inticement should allure us to be traitors, not any perswation
that our selves can compass so great an exploit, (there being scarce 300.
Catholic priests of our nation in the whole world; a silly army to subdue so
great a Monarchy) not any confidence in Catholic assistance, who^ none is so
mad to think able to do such an enterprise, being few in number, dispuruied of
munito^, narowly watched by Officers, restrained in their liberties,
impouirished in their goods, and disabled in all provisions. Not the
imagination to be advanced by foreign power: for then we would rather expect
the conquest, till the time and oppertunitie were ripe, for us to enter upon
our hopes, then so venterously to press upon the swords of our enemies, and
hazard not only our future expectations, but our present safeties, we would
rather live abroad, though it were with as hard shifts, as those that now
possess honorable romes did once at Ceneua: then leopard our welfare, to so
many so known and inevitable harms, which we are more likely soon to feel,
then so long to eschew. And if we were to come as rebels into the Realm, our
education in Colleges should be aunswerable to the qualities, we should be
trained in martial exercises, busied in public and ciuell affairs, hardened
to the field, and made to the weapon: whereas 1000. ears and eyes are
witnesses, that our studies are nothing else but Philosophy and divinity, our
teachers religious men, acquainted with no other knowledge but learning and
virtue, all our warlike preparations, the wresting for our wills, the mortifying
of our bodies, and a continual warfare with Nature, to get the victory over
our selves: and for other schoolepoints of sedition, wherein this our hard
friend finds us to be instructed, Almighty God is our witness, that we
neither learn nor teach any, having only had in our studies, the common end
that all men shot at, namely to attain such knowledge, that might be an
ornament to our functions, a help to our conuersations, and a benefit to our
country. But if by these Schoolepoints of sedition be meant that religion
which there we are taught: and here we profess this meaning answers it
self: For this cannot be any way treasonable to your Majesty's estate, unless
that it be esteemed offensive, which was the faith of all your royal
ancestors, these 1400 years, is the faith of the greatest part of
Christendom, and for the defense whereof your Majesty's most worthy father,
attained the glorious title of defender of the Faith. But whatsoever this
informer meant by his schoolepoints of sedition, we hope that your Highness
censure, will free us from the thing it self, since neither likelihood to
effectuate any hope at home, nor any likeness of our education abroad, can in
your wisdom seem to argue us guilty of any rebellious intentions. Let
this further be an assured proof to the contrary, that since we are so
religiously addicted to the end of our coming, that for the atchiuing thereof,
we recount our torments, triumphs, and our deaths a glory: If this end were
the overthrow of your Majesty: or if your displeasing had bin the point, that
with so many bleeding wounds, we have witnessed to be so dear unto us, we
would with the loss of fewer lives, have perfitted our purposes, and long ere
this have brought the cards to an unfortunate shufling: for whosoever has
content^ed his own life, is Master of another: and he that is resolute to
spend his blood, will rather seek to sell it for the intended price, then with
a fruitles affection cast it away for nothing.

No no, most Gracious SOVEREIGN, Heaven and Earth shall witness with us in
the dreadful day of doom, that our breasts never harbored such horrible
treasons, and that the end of our coming is the salvation of souls, not the
murdering of bodies, we being rather willing to die, then to contribute the
least hair of our head to the latter, and not so willing to live, as to shed
the best blood in our bodies: for the first, give then (O most gracious Queen)
wise men leave to see, that they show themselves no less disloyal to your
Majesty, the^ envious to us: that durst diuulge these Fables under the name of
your Highness, making their Prince the patroness of their feigned, and devised
falsehood.

Now with what shadow or likelie-hood, can it sincke into any sound belief?
that we come with ample authority, to persuade your Majesty's Subjects to
renounce their duties, and to bind them with oaths and Sacraments, to forswear
their natural allegence to their Princess highness, and to yield all their
powers to the Spanish Princes forces: for to say we do it upon hope, to be
enriched with those possessions that others now enjoy, has but small semblance
of probabilities, considering how much likelier we are to inherit your
RACKES, and possess your place of EXECVTION, then to survive the present
incombences of spiritual liuinges, or to live to see any dignities at the KING
of SPAIN his disposition, and since both the daily Martyrdomes of many before
our eyes, and our own evident and hourly dangers, can not but kill in us all
such aspiring fantasies, if any mind were so m^dd^, as to sell his soul at so
base a rate.

Let it be scanned with equity, how little seeming of truth it carries, that
so many should upon so improbable and uncertain expectations, offer their
lives to most probable and certain shipwracks. And can any imagine us to be so
simple, that we cannot see how impossible it is for Catholics to do the king
any good, though they were as much bent that way as their accusers would have
it thought: do we not see that they are scattered one among thousands, and at
all such accurrants so well watched, and so ill provided: that to vvish them to
stir in the Kings behalf, were to train them to their undoing, and to
expose them to a general massacer by domestical fury, and what better
advocate can plead for us in this case, then your Majesty's own experience, who
in the last attempt of the king, found none more forward to do all duties, and
liberally to stretch their abilities, then Catholics were in your highness
defense, and though they were ceased for men and money, far above their
reuennewes, and so fleeced of their armor and weapons, that they were left
unfurnished, for their own sauegards: yet were they so far from mutining, or
touch of disloyalty, that they willingly yielded more, then any other of their
quality, which doubtless if Priests had sworn them with oaths, or bound
them with Sacraments, to the contrary they would never have done: since they
venture both lives and liberties, for other charitable works of far less
weight, then the avoiding of the damnable sins, of perjury and sacrilege.
It is also well known even unto the Coyners of these untrue surmises, that if
the King should come so slenderly provided, as to need the handful of
Catholics helps, (who neither have conntenance, charge, nor authority in the
common wealth) your Majesty need not greatly fear, since it were impossible
he should be strong, to whom so weak, and bootles a succor should be
necessary. And to what effect should we then persuade Catholics to leave
their obedience to your Highness, since it can neither benefit us, nor avail
them: but rather draw upon us, both a manifest subversion: yea did we not
rather strengthen them in their duties, and so confirm them in patience, that
with conscience and religious fear they restrained nature. It were imposible
for flesh and blood to digest the unmerciful usage that they suffer by such
persons, whose baseness dubleth the injury of their abuse: for who, if it were
not more than the fear of man that has held them, would not rather die upon
the enemies that sought their blood, (as for men of ill mind it were no hard
matter) than to live to continual death, and to leave the authors of their
evils behind them, to triumph over their ruins, and to send after them more
of their dearest friends. What gentleman could endure the peremtory and
insolent imperiousnes of a company of gredy and manerlesse mates, which still
are praying upon Catholics, as if they were common booties, and ransack them
day and night, brauing them under their own roofes, with such surlinesse, as if
every castaway were allowed to be unto the^ an absolute Prince. But happily
because we desire to recover the lapsed, and confirm the standing in the
ancient faith of their forefathers, it may be presumed that this is a
withdrawing from your Majesty's obedience. But if indiffere^cy may be one of
the Jury, disloialty shall never be found the sequel of any article of our
Religion, which more than any other, tyeth us to a most exact submission to
your Temporal authority, and to all points of allegiance, that either now in
Catholics Countries, or ever before in Catholics times were acknowledged to
be due to any Christian Prince: do not now Catholics governed by the
Princip^les of their faith, yield in respect thereof with a known mildness,
their goods, liberties, lands, and lives, and do they not with a most
resolute patience obey a scourging, and afflicting hand.

Then how much more would they be willing to double their duties and
increase their serviceable affections to your Highness, if they sound but the
like clemency that other subjects enjoy, and were not made (as now they
are) common steeles for every merciless and flint-harted, to strike out upon
them the sparks of their fury.

It is a point of the Catholic faith, (defended by us against Sectaries of
these days) like subjects are bound in conscience under pain of forfeting
their right, in Heaven, and in incurring the guilte of eternal torments, to
obey the just Laws of their Princes, which both the Protestants and Puritanes
deny, with their father and master Calvin. And therefore if we were not pressed
to that, which by the general verdit of allegiance, was judged breach of the
Law of God: we should never give your Majesty the least cause of displeasure,
for (excepting these points) which if impartial audience were allowed, we
could prove to employ the endless misery and damnation of our souls, in all
other civil and temporal respects, we are so submitted and pliable, as any
of your Majesty's best beloved subjects. If then your highness would
vouchsafe to behold our case, with an (...) eye, and not to view us in the
mirror of a misse-informed mind, we would not doubt, but that your excellent
wisdom would find more grounds even in policy, and in the due care of
your safety, to incline your gracious favor toward us, still inthralled in
our present unhappiness. But it may be, that some more willing to rip up old
faults, than to admit any clearing of them, when in their hearts they have
already condemned us to all punishments, will here bring in Ballards, and
Babingtons, matters against us, as a Golias to overthrow all other proofs of
our good meanings. To this first we answer, that it were a hard course to
reprove all Prophets for one Saul, all Protestants for one Wyat, all Priests
and Catholics for one Ballard and Babington.

Your Majesty's sister reigned not the sixth part of your time, and yet sundry
rebellions were attempted by the Protestant faction against her, in that short
space, as every Chronicle can witness: whereas in this your Majesty's
prosperouse reign of 35. years in all England, the Catholics never rose but
once in open field to have won the freedom of conscience, which the
Protestants in those few years labored with so many mutinies: for as for
Parrie, he never professed in like, nor action to be a Catholic: yea, and he
took it offenciuely with signification of his mind, in hot words, that
some upon surmise, had so named him, and therefore howsoever he might by
aspiring thoughts, or mercinarie mutinies, be by any foreign enemy used to
evil practices, it cannot justly be laid against us, who^ neither priuitie
nor consent to his intentions, can any way touch: and as for the action of
Babington, that was rather a snare to entrap them, then any devise of their
own, since it was both plotted, furthered, and finished, by S. Frauncis
Walsingham, and his other accomplices, who laid and hatched all the particulers
thereof, as they thought it would best fall out to the discredit of Catholics,
and cutting of the Queen of Scots: for first it is to be known to all, that
Poolie being Sir F. Walsinghams man, and thoroughly seasoned to his Masters
tooth, was the chief instrument to contriue and prosecute the matter, to draw
into the net such green wits, as (fearing the general oppression, and
partly angled with golden hooks) might easily be over wrought by M Secr.
subtle and sisting wit: for Poolie masking his secret intentions under the
face of Religion, and abusing with irreligious Hypocrisy all Rites and
Sacraments, to borrow the false opinion of a Catholic, still feeding the poor
gentlemen with his masters baits, and he holding the line in his hand, suffered
them like silly fishes to play themselves upon the hook, till they were
thoroughly fastened, that then he might strike at his own pleasure, and be sure
to draw the^ to a certain destruction. And though none were so deep in the
very bottom of that conspiracy as Poolie himself, yet was he not so much as
indicted of any crime, but after a little large imprisonment (more for policy
the^ for any punishment) set at liberty, and in more credit then ever he was
before: for it being a set match, and he having so well performed his evil part
(though to please Babes.) A stroke was given to beat him, yet doubtless he was
largely fed in privy pay, as so Christian policy did best deserve. It is also
known by Phillips the deciphers letters to his party practisioner, G. Gifford,
in whose chest and chamber they were taken at Parris, and by G. Giffords own
examination, that these Gentlemen were bought and sold, being drawn
blindfolde, to be workers of their overthrow, and carry with silly Isaac the
fire, in which they the^ selves were to be sacrificed. And sure it is, that all
the letters that fed them with foreign hopes, all the devises that wrought
them into homebred imaginations, sprung all out of the Fountain of Sir
FRAVNCIS WALSINGHAMS fine head: for GILBERT GIFFORD having some years before
been Master Secretaries intelligencer, (as the date of Phillippes Letter unto
him discovered) when the matter was once on foot in England, was made the
mean to follow it in France among certain of the Scottish Queens friends,
more apt to enter, then able to go through great dissignements, where he
knowing of the letters, and the course how they were conveyed, discovered all
to M. Secretary, to who^ also he brought diverse of the like tennor, written
partly to the Queen, partly to Babington, at his own coming into England:
whereas more the^ 3. months before, the counsel would seem to know these
intentions: and when by often resort to Sir Frauncis Walsinghams house, in
private sort he had taken of him privy directions, to make his course the
more plausible for his proceedings in France, he practiced here with the
French Ambassadors Mounsieur Catanense, whom then he knew to be very well
affected both to the Scottish Queen, and to the Duke of Guyes, and though he
were a man of more then ordinary discourse: yet with so forsworn an
hypocrisy, and so deep periuries, did Gifford over reach him, that when the
train was discovered, some of the Gentlemen enraged with so great impiety,
said that though it were a great part of the Gospel that an English man would
be true, they should hardly believe it, for that Devil Giffordes sake, as in
their passion they termed him: But so it was that Gilberts wit far too good
for so bad an owner, and newly refined by M. Secretaries forge, won so much
credit, that he being commended and believed, as his desire was, he went over
to entreat by means with the Duke of Guyse, and such others as were thought
fit to be taken in, as stales to countenance the matter, and to put the
Gentlemen in vain expectations, till the thread were spunne to the intended
length. And so far was this unfortunate wretch given over to desperate malice,
that first to possess him more of M. Secretaries good opinion, and to show his
aptness to be used in such exploits, he dedicated to him, a book of his own
compiling, breathing such Infamies, and Atheismes, as best became the spirit of
so perjured and Apostata: and on the other side, to shun the suspicion of being
M. Secretaries bad instrument in this unchristian policy, he was himself
confessed, purposely Graduated, and as it is thought made Priest: so impious
were the means to wrest the poor Gentlemen from their duties, to their
confusion. Phillips also, who was M. Secretaries right hand, held correspondent
with Gilbert Gifford, still keeping the ice from breaking, till they were all
upon it, whom they meant to drown in the same destruction. And to draw the
Queen of Scotts into the better opinion of this designeme^t, whom
experience had taught to suspect so dangerous motions. The matter was with
continual and secret meetinges very seriously urged with her agents in
France, in whom it is feared they relied too much affiance: but whether for
love to their Master, they were apt to entertain any hope of her delivery,
or for league with M. Secretary, too ready to build upon his foundations, they
induced the Queen to like of their good will, that were willing to adventure
their states and lives to do her service, and as things were by these
inventions, ripening in France: so Poolie no less diligently plied the matter
at home, continually conuersing with Ballard, and the gentlemen, and laboring
to draw more conies in to the hey. It is strange to mark with what cunning the
grave and wiser sort of Catholics, were sounded a far off, not by revealing
any direct intention: but so nicely gla^cing at general points, with iffes
and andes, that they never understood the language, till effects did consture
these roauing speeches: yet when so much of their disposition was known, by
their unwillingness to hear, and peremtorines in cutting off the Officers of
such discourses, there was no less care used to conceal these purposes from
them, then there had bin cunning to search out how they would deem of the^: for
it was feared, their wisdom would have found out the fraud, and untimely have
launced an unripe impostume. It is further known that the coppie of that
letter which Babbington sent to the Queen of Scots, was brought ready penned
by Poolie, from M. Secretary: the answer whereof, was the principal grounds of
the Queens condemnation. There was also found in Sir Frauncis Walsinghams
accountes after his decease, a note of 7000. pounds bestowed upon Nato and
Curlie, who being the Queens Secretaries, framed such an answer as might best
serve for a bloody time, and fit his intention that rewarded them with so
liberal a fee. This made Phillippes so bold to advise Gifford by his Letters,
that if he came in any suspicion of detecting the Queen, he should lay it
either to Nato, or Curlie, whose shoulders being bolstred with so large bags,
he thought would be best able to bear the burden away: It is also certain
that Barnard (^ M. Secretaries undoubted agent) went over into France about
this practice, there free passages being warranted with all security: when
they had been there so long, that Barnard might look into these proceedings,
that in those Countries were actors in the matter, he returned again with
Ballard, and having a large Commission from Sir Frauncis Walsingham, to take
what manner of horses he would, out of any Gentleman's Park, or Pasture, and
of other unusual liberties, he went with Ballard into the North, there he
sought with what sleights he could, to have won diverse Gentlemen, making
Ballards credit his countenance, and drawing the poor men unwittingly to be
the occasion of his own and others ruin. In the end having cusoned another to
get a Letter of commendations to the Lord Prior of Scotland: he sifted out of
him what he could, and taking with him a Letter touching this matter, he
brought it with all the intelligence and success of his malicious Pilgrimage,
to the Council. And though he were thus inward and conversant with Ballard,
carrying him to sundry Gentlemen of account, to feel and tempt them about
this action, and to draw them into the desired compass: yea though himself
were a motion to some, to enter into it, pretending that he had over reached M.
Secretary, in getting that Commission: yet was he never called to the bar,
but hired to stay a time in restraint, with such a recompense for his service,
as might be well perceived to be large, by his liberal spending, and plenty in
prison, he being otherwise a hungry and needy merchant, without either trade
or living to maintain such expenses: and how privy S. Frau. was to the whole
course of the Gentlemen's actions, and to the certain period of the time,
wherein all his endeavors would come to the full point, may be gethered by
this, that being by a Priest that was to be banished sued unto for 20. days
respite to dispatch his business: first repeating the number, and pausing a
while with him self. No says he, you shall have but 14. for if I should grant
you any more, it would be to your hinderance, as you shall hear hereafter:
wherein he said true, for much about that time, was public notice taken of
Babbingtons matter, all ways were watched, infinite houses searched, hewes
and cries raised, frights bruted in the peoples ears, and all men's eyes filled
with a smoke, as though the whole Realm had been on fire, whereas in truth,
that was but the hissing of a few green twigs, of their own building, which
they might without any such uproar have quenched with a handful of water, but
that made not so much for their purpose as this buggish terible shows: and
thought they were so well acquainted with all the Gentlemen's hearts, that they
might every hour in the day or night, have drawn them in the net like a
couie of partridges. Yet forsooth, must some of them be suffered purposely to
flee that they might have the better color to make those general
demonstrations of a needles fear. John Savage likewise when he came to the
Court, was so well known to be a chicken of that feather, that two Pentioners
were charged to have an eye unto him, and to watch so long as he stayed there,
and yet was he suffered to go up and down, and usually to haunt the presence,
till all irons were hot that were laid in the fire, to fear the credit of
poor Catholics, and to give the Queen of Scotts her deaths wound: it was
also noted, that after Ballard was inchaunted with Poolies charms, he became a
stainger to all Jesuits and other Priests, being limited by the politic
rules of his promptor, to such company as Master Secretary knew to be of
divine sights, to see through so many mistes, as he by his instruments had
already cast before their eyes, the Gentelmen were also throughlye charmed, to
keep their counsels from the wiser and mature sort of Catholics, whom
there was no hope to make them parties. Of which John Charnocke at the bar
said the reason to be because the older, the colder, yet the true ground was
a special promise of Master Secretary to keep the threede out of their hands
that would soon have vnwounde it to the bottom, for what man that had but
known the first syllable of pollicye, would think it a likelye course for
them, to alter the whole state of so great a kingdom to quite contrary
Religion and gouernmente, that neither had power to back them, (as then
there was none ready, nor helps at home to support them) being al but private
gentelmen, (neither of wealth, nor sufficient credit for such a matter) to
carry with them any great numbers, who would not have pitied their
indiscretion, that intending so great an alteration, thought it a fit way to
go pickeing here and there one, as if such plots in so many young tongues
could lie hidden so long, as to give them respite to gleane a sufficient army.
And for men that pleadged their heads in so dangerous attempts, to be so
credulous, as to rest their hopes upon so fliting and fair promises of
foreign helps, without the certainty of such preparation of ships and me^,
as might come in due time to follow their beginnings, was a most childishe
sight. And therefore for any man of experience that had looked to it, there
would have offered it self a just suspicion, that the plotte was rather a
train to entrappe the actors in it, than a mean to effect that intended by
it. For though they had cut off some of the Council: yea, and dismantled the
realm of your sacred majesty, (which Gods goodness neither would, nor we
hope will permit) yet had their purpose been far from any semblance of their
desired issue, for then they must have proclaimed either the Queen of Scotts,
or at least by some means have sought her delivery, and consequently have
notified to the world that for her rising was your Majesty's going down. And
what a tide of resistance would this notice have done, none can be so seely but
he must needs see. For first by the oath of associatio^, all the Nobility had
bin bound, to persist her to death, which many without an oath would otherwise
have been apt enough to do. The crown also being left without any
declared owner, a fair goal for them that run first at it, no doubt but
diverse competitors would have hindered her course, to have made her hopes-way
to so fair an aim. Then the act of PARLIAMENT excluding straingers from the
Crown, (as she by diverse means was diuoulged to be) would also have added
dainger to her claim, especially considering the ancient and deep rooted
dislike, between the Scottishe and the English, no small motive to a popular
mutiny: but most of all her vehemence in the Catholic religion, (against
which both the Nobility, Clergy, and commons were most violently bent) would
have made them ready in that respect, to take heed of the least of these
lettes, to exclude her from the Crown, and to translate the title to some
other more suitable, to their belief. All which impedimentes meeting so full
with every eye, that did but look toward them, must needs have made any in
reason to conclude it an impossibility for these gentlemen to have compassed
their drifte, which also they might easily have discerned, had they not bin
bewitched with master secretaties fine devises, and deluded with his spies,
cosoning letters and messages from foreign parts, for the Spanishe fleet was
not ready in two years after, and in France, (more than a few that in
Gascoine were employed against the Hugonits) there was no kind of provision by
sea, nor land, yea the king was then known to be so sure a friend to England,
and so sharp an enemy to the Guisian party, in which the Queens affiance was
only fastined, that he would never have suffered her hopes to have had (...)
by any French assistants. And from Scotland they never looked for any aid,
knowing that if they were not every way blind, how the king was wholly
carried a way with an English byas, and so settled in the possession of the
Crown, and in the bent of the contrary faith, that what soever he might have
attempted for himself, it was never likely he would have followed their
designement, of which the principal scope was the alteration of Religion. And
he that in respect of his belief, refused with the Infant of Spain, the
present possession of the Lowe-Countries assistance for the chalenging of his
other titles, and promised to be proclaimed heir, if the Spanishe king should
fail, was doubtless much better armed against their slender perswations which
could never have tempted him with such glorious offers. Finally the weakness
of their beginning was an apparent proof that it was conceived and bred by
them that would be sure to bring it to an abortion, and never suffer it to
prevail to any other purpose, but to make us more hateful, and to bereave
your Majesty of your more infamed than faulty Cosen.

Thus much Gracious Sovereign, is your Highness drawn by these indirect
courses, to use your unwilling sword, against your less favored, then
faithful Subjects, and put in ungrounded fears of their disloyalty, who are
of themselves so far from defiling their hearts with any treasonable
thoughts, that their heavy enemies had no other ways to dismount them from
their best deserving, buy by violenting them too evil; by these sinester
inventions we know your Majesty's mind to be, from yielding your Royal
assent to so ugly shifts, you ever binding your desires to the limits of
virtue, and measuring your Regalitie, more by will to save, then by power to
kill. Yet it cannot but afflict us, to see your Highness ears so gaurded
against our complaints, and possessed with their perswations, that most malign
us, that we can have no other orators for your gracious favors, then the
tongues that cannot afford us any favorable word. It has bin always the
policy of our adversaries, to keep us aloof from revealing our unjust
oppressions, lest they should incline your mercy to pity us, and they so arm
your Highness with so hard informations against us, that they make our very
suit for lenity seem an offensive motion: yet since we must either speak or
dye, seeing so many slightes are put in ure to bury us quick in all miseries,
we hope God will make our petitions weigh into your heart, and win your
clemency to consider our distress. Notwithstanding the slanders that are
published against us: and if we may make our benefit of that which others have
used to our greatest harms, we think that very act of Babington, may insure
your Highness of the impossibility of Catholics to be drawn to rebellion,
for when our oppressions were heauiest, our deaths ordinary, and so fine
wits busied to draw us into the foil, yet was there not in all England in
so long time found out above one Priest, and he one of the meanest, and few
more than a dozen Laymen, that could be won to stoop to these odious
lures. Let not therefore this more prejudice us than so open threats, and
direct menacings of the whole state, have endamaged others, since of our side,
there followed no effect, and our numbers were less likely to hurt (not
ariuing to a scoare) than these that dared your Majesty's Scepter with many
thousands, but because we like God-Almighties fools, (as some scornefully call
us) lay our shoulders under every load, and are contented to make patience the
only salve for all sores: many that see, are willing to use the awe of
conscience, for the warrant to tread us down, whereas they presume not to
meddle with others, although more fatal to your Highness estate, knowing that
if they should make them partners, but of half our afflictions, they would
seem to bewray more impatient stomachs, for if the working of their spirits
be so vehement, as with so little fear and so much solemnity to proclaim a
new Christ and king of the earth, adding the creast of an usurped Messiah to
countenance, the challenge of humane sovereignty. If being so freely permitted
to use their consciences to themselves, and to enioie their honors, offices,
and favors in the common wealth, without any taste of your scourges, they
notwithstanding sparkle not such tokens of a concealed flame, it can not choose
but be seen and known, how much more cause there is, to look into their
actions, and to fear their attempts, than to wreake so much anger upon us,
that were never chargeable with so huge enormities. And yet the death of one
man shut up in a silent oblivion, that open offer of uproar, and most
blasphemous impiety against God and your Majesty, though it be generally
known that there were more favorers and (...) of that parti than could be
ever charged with Babingtons offense.

We speak not this to incense your Majesty against others, being so well
acquainted with the smarte of our own punishementes, to wish any Christian to
be pertaker of our pains. Our only intent is, most humbly to entreat, that if
so impatient a zeal, accompanied with seditious words and actions, was so
easily finished and remitted in the chastisement of one, your Highness in
clemencye, would not suffer so many innocent Priests and Catholics, to be so
cruelly and continually martyred, who never incurred so enormous crimes. And
since we daily in our lives, and always at our executions unfeignedly pray for
your Majesty, since at our deaths we always protest upon our souls our
clearnes from treason, and our dutiful and loyal minds, subscribing our
protestation, with our dearest blood. Let us not most merciful Sovereign be
thus daily plunged deeper into new disgraces, and still proclaimed and
murdered for traitors. Let us not be so esteemed for Godless and desperate
monsters, as to spend our last breath in bootlesse periuries, or at our
greatest need of Gods favor, to sacrifice to the devil our final vows,
what reason then can move us so damnably to dissemble, when our expired date
cutteth off all hopes, our death the end of evils, has in this world no
after fears, and a resolute contempt of our own lives, excludes al thoughts
of meaner lives, yea if any hope, fear, or love carry any swaye, (as
doubtless there does in all Christian minds) it is a hope to be saved, a fear
to be damned, aloue to God, to his truth, and our endless well-doing, al which
in that dreadful moment, (whereupon depends our whole eternity) can never be
motives unto us, to send our forsworn souls headlong to hellfire. But let
us proceed in our necessary defense, as the inditor does in his false
accusations, (we are charged for the easiar (...) of unnatural people, weak
of understanding to yield to our perswations) to have brought Bulls, and
Indulgences pretending to promise Heaven, or cursing damnation to hell. It was
but a foreign supply for want of true factes, to fasten upon this fond
conclusion being so far from truth, and so full of incongruity, that every
nouice in our faith, can reprove it for error. I omit the reproachful terms
of unnatural and weak understanding, most injuriously fathered upon such a
Princes pen, whom a Royal mind has taught, not to stain her paper, or
blemishe her style, with those and so many other base and reuiling words, as
are pestered together in this proclamation. I report all men to their eyes,
and ears for answer to these slanders, whether (the soule-rightes excepted)
in all temporal duties, Catholics be not as natural to their Prince, as
beneficial to their neighbors, as reguler in themselves, as any other
subjects, yielding the uttermost of all that is exacted in Subsidies, Persons,
Men, and Munition, besides the patient loss of our Goods and Lands for their
Recusansie.

Let it be read in letters of experience, whether Catholics be of shallowe
brain, or of so weak understanding, that they would be carried away with
these imaginary Bulls, promising heaven, and threatening hell, of which
Catholics ears never heard before.

This world can witness, that in Divinity, Law, and Physic, and all other
faculties and functions, either of Piety, or policy, all England, I may say
all Christendom, scarce knows any men more renoumed than our ENGLISH
Catholics, (without vanity be it spoken in a just defense) but though they
were not such Sallomons for wisdom, as some others take themselves to be,
yet they be allowed ordinary sense and intendment, which if it be but so much,
as may serve them to tell over the Articles of their Creed, it is enough to be
known that no Bulle can promise Heaven, or threaten Hell, but for keeping or
breaking Gods Commandments.

Judge then, (most Sovereign LADY) whether that it be not too great an
indignation to see the sacred name of our Noble QVEENE, which next to Gods
word should be honored among the most impregnable testimonies of truth, to
be with undeserved abuse by any subject subscribed to these most vain, and so
impossible fictions.

Who likewise (but meaning to make his PRINCES pain a spring of untruths)
would against the certain knowledge of so many and so infinite people, as
well seers as hearers, even as from your MAJESTY: that no PRIEST in Indicted,
Arreined, or Executed for Religion: since it is so often, and in every Sessions
seen, that unless we our selves should confess manifestly that we were
PRIESTS, no other treasonable crime, could be justly proved against us, and
for this (how far it is from deserving this odious title) your Majesty may
easilye gather, for that all Christendom has these fifteen hundred years
honored for Pastors and governors of their souls, those that now are more
than vnfauourably termed Traitors, yea if to be a Priest made by the authority
of the Sea of Rome, and present within your highness dominions, be a just
title of treason. If they that harbor, reliue, or receive any such, be worthy
to be deemed fellons: then all the glorious Saints of this Land whose
Doctrine and virtue God Almighty confirmed with many miracles, were no better
than traitors, and their a-bettours fellons. Then DAMIANVS and FVGATIVS, that
first brought Christianity in King LUCIUS his time, 1400. years past: then
Saint AUGUSTINE and his companions that converted our Realm in Saint GREGORY'S
time were, who in the compass of treason, since their functions and ours were
all one equally divided from the Sea of Rome, from whence they were directly by
the Popes Elutherius and Gregory sent into this kingdom being Priests, and
Religious men, as all antiquity does witness, yea all the Churches and places of
piety, (chief ornaments of this Noble Realm) all the Charters and Indowments
bestowed upon Priests and Religious persons, and yet registered in the ancient
laws are but monuments of felony, and favorers of treason. And if it should
please God to alot the day of general resurrection in your Majesty's time, (a
thing not impossible as uncertain) what would so many Millions of Prelates,
Pastors, and Religious people think, that both honored and blessed this
kingdom with the holiness of their life, and excellency of their learning:
much would they rest amazed, to see their Relikes burned, their memories
defaced, and all their Monasteries dedicated once to piety, prayer, and
chastity: now either buried in their ruins, or profaned by unfitting uses:
but more would they muse to find their Priesthood reckoned for treason, and the
relief of Priests condemned for felony; these being the two principal
testimonies of devotion, that their ages were acquainted with: yea, what would
your Majesty's Predicessors, and Fathers, with the Peers and people of your
Realm think, when they should see themselves in terms of felony by the
censure of your laws, for erecting Bishoprikes, and endowing Churches,
founding Colleges, and some other like places, for the honoring and
maintaining of Priests, and Religious men: yea and for giving their Ghostly
Father in way of relief, but a cup of cold water, though it were at the very
point of death when they needed spiritual comfort, being to abandon their
mortal bodies: and though the Priests at that time were not made since the
first year of your Majesty's reign, which is the only point which excludes
them from the statute, yet were they all such Priests, or Abbetors of them, as
were consecrated by authority derived from the Sea of Rome, (as al registers
do record) and present within your Majesty's realm, which are the only
material points, for which we have bin, or can be condemned: for the Sea of
Rome remaining in the selfsame state, still endued with the same authority,
and neither the manner of our creation, or Priesthood it self, is any thing
altered from that it was. Why should it be more treasonable to be made
Priests, in the midsomer day of your first year, the^ the next day before, or
the last of Queen Mary's Reign, for neither does the Pope, nor any other
Bishop by making us Priests claim or get any more authority in our Realm,
then they of Basil or Geneua, by making Protestants Ministers, nor we by
receiving our orders from him, acknowledge in him a mite worthy of authority,
more then every lay-ma^ does through all Christendom: and as for oaths and
promises in receiving Holy Orders, we neither take nor plight any but one
common to the Priests of all Nations, which is a solemn vow of perpetual
Chastity, a thing rather pleasing then offensive to a virtuous Queen, who
has for her self made choice of a single life. And who then can find any
cullourable pretense to verify this slander more grievous to us then death it
self, that we are not condemned and executed for Religion, but for treason:
we being always arraigned and cast upon this statute of coming into England,
being since the first of your Majesty's Reign, made Priests by the authority
of the Sea of Rome: for what can be meant by Religion, if it be not a point,
yea and a chief point thereof to receive a Sacrament of the CATHOLIC CHVRCH
(as we acknowledge Priesthood to be) of the chief PASTOVR and PRELATE
thereof, from whence we can prove all lawful Priesthood to have descended
this fifteen hundred years, and to avouch us Traitors for coming into
England, or remaining here is an injury without ground, since in this respect,
the statute could not touch us (setting priesthood aside) many coming and
going at their pleasure, without such supposall of treason: But it is our
coming in as Priests, that is so highly condemned, and therefore our
Priesthood and nothing else punished by this law: And howbeit the chief
deuisers of this, and all the like decrees (ever seeking to attain their
drifts, against religion under some other pretense) exempted the QVEENE MARIE
Priests, from the compass of this Statute, by a limitation of time: yet was
that but a color to inueagle such eyes, as either through carelessness would
not look, or through weakness could not reach to their final intentions, and
little regarded that a few old and feeble men, whom neither age, by course of
nature, or they by any other acts might sone cut off, so the seed might be
extinguished and a new supply of posterity prevented, which by this Law
(though in vain) they purposed to do. Be it therefore never so much mistitled
with the undeserved name of treason, the (...) reproach cannot cover the truth
from your Majesty's best deserving insight, which by this cannot but apparently
see, that it is, it was, and ever will be religion, for which we expose our
blood to the hazard of these laws, and for the benefit of souls, yield our
bodies to all extremities. It may be also easily gathered by the weakest wits,
what huge treasons they be, for which we be condemned, since at all our
araignements and deaths, we are offered, that once going to church, should wipe
away the heinousnes of this treason: a courtesy never mentioned to true
traitors, and a sufficient proof it was a religious fault, that is so easily
clered by a religious action: yet we must with just complaint of most unjust
proceeding acknowledge, that at the bar many things, (whereof not so much as
our thoughts were ever guilty) are besides our Priesthood, partly by
indictment, partly by some in office laid to our charge, and yet so naked of
proofs, or of any likely conjectures, that we can never be condemned of any
thing, but our own confession of Priesthood: and hereof the last araignement
of three Priests at Westminster, even since the Proclamation, gave such an
ample notice, as the Lord chief Justice said; that though many things had bin
urged, yet was he to pronounce sentence of death against them, only upon the
statute of coming into England, being made Priests after the Roman order,
since the first of her Majesty's reign: yet it has bin some time objected
against Priests, that they should pretend to kill your sacred Majesty: a thing
so contrary to their calling, so far from their thoughts, so wide of all
policy, that whosoever will afford reason her right, cannot with reason think
them so foolish to wish, muchlesse to work such a thing, every way odious, no
way beneficial. We come to shed our own blood, and not to seek the effusion
of others blood. The weapons of our warrefare are Spiritual not offensive, and
we carry our desires, so high lifted above savage and brutish purposes, that
we rather hope to make our own Martyrdom, steps to a glorious eternity,
then our deaths, our purchase of eternal dishonor. And who but men unwilling
to have us thought owners of our right wits, would abuse your Majesty's
authority, to sooth up so great vnlikelie-hoodes, since none can be so
ignorant, how pernicious it were for PRIESTS and CATHOLICS, to loose the
protection of your Majesty's Highness, and to forgo present suerties, for
uncertain chaunges. For if any would bequeath his blood to so brutish a fact:
if he were not as much enemy to all men, as to himself, he would at the
least have some appearance of benefit, that might be supposed to ensewe to
those, for whose good, he would be thought to have cast away his life: but
none that looks but a step before him, into future accidents, can think
it any way available unto us, to be bereaved of your Majesty: since that our
hopes are now bent, not upon any ^^pected happiness, but only upon a more
intolerable misery. And although our cause at this present be so hard, that
it is the next degree to extremetie: yet we see things hang in so doubtful
terms, that the death of your Majesty would be an alarum^^ to infinite
vprores, and likelier to breed all men to a general calamity, then CATHOLICS
any cause of comfort: and therefore us to seek it, were not only an
impiety to our Country, but a tyrranie to our selves, who of all others
were surest to find the fiercest encounters of the popular peoples fury, and
though we could, (as then no man possible can) find a privy or secret
harbor from the common storms:) yet whom should we look upon that may
promise us any hope or comfort of bettering our fortunes, since the likeliest to
succeed, are further from our Religion, then your Majesty ever was, and
likelier to charge us with a heavier hand, then to lighten the burden,
vvherevvith we are already bruised, and both your Majesty's Sex inclined to
piety, and the mildness of your own disposition, rather wrested by others,
then proone of it self, too angry resolution, makes us more vvilling to
languish in this quartane of our lingering cumbers, then to hazard our selves
to those extreme fittes, that might happily be caused by the heat of men,
more vvar-like and less pitying minds: for now our dispairefull estate is
much like unto a vveake and tender Castle, beseeged with many enemies, and
continually battered and beaten with shot, in which though the aboade be
amongst many accounted most dangerous and distresseful, yet without it there
is nothing but certain miseries, rest you therefore assured (most Gracious
Sovereign) since we are devoted to so hard a destiny, that we neither dare
hope for any cause of contentment, or end of unhappiness, we had rather trust
to the softness of your merciful hand, (and next to God) to rest to the hight
of your possibilities, in your favor and clemency, than by any unnatural
violen^^ against Gods anointed to seek the ruin of your Realm, and draw
upon our selves the extremest of worldly harms, in this only we crave
admittance of our (...) requests, that evil informers rob not our words of
due belief, nor draw your wisdom to their frivolous fears, wholly grounded
in mere fictions, and purposely devised to our ignominy. Now whereas he
imposes on some to have said, that they would take part with the Army of
the Pope, against our Realm, it is a most unlikely thing, unless it were
proceeded out of some frail tongue by force of torture, that was rather willing
to say what they seemed to require, than to abide the hell of their intolerable
torments, for such is now our forlorn estate, that we are not only
prisoners, at every promoters pleasure, and common steps for every one to
tread upon: but me^ so neglected by our Superiors, and so left to the rage of
pittiles persons, that contrary to the course of all Christian laws, we are
by extremest torments forced to (...) our very thoughts. It is not enough to
confess that we are Priests: (for it is seldom denied) but we must be urged
upon the torture with other odious interogations, far from our knowledge,
much further from our action. We are compelled to accuse those whom our
conscience assures to be innocent, and to cause their overthrow by our
confessions, to whose souls we (...) Pastors, and they the fosterers of our
bodies. And if we do not, because without untruths and injuries we cannot
answer, we are so vnmercifuly tormented, that our deaths, (though as full of
pangs as hanging, drawing, and vnbowelling us quick can make them) are unto us
rather remedies, the^ further reuenges, more releasing then incresing our
miseries. Some are hanged by the hands eight or nine hours, yea twelve hours
together, till not only their wits, but even their senses fail them, and when
the soul (weary of so painful an harbor, is ready to depart, then apply the
cruel comforts and revive us, only to martyr us with more deaths, for est
soones they hang us in the same manner, trying our ears with such questions,
which either we cannot, because we know not, or without damning of our souls
we may not (...); some are whipped naked so long, and with such excess, that
our enemies unwilling to give constancy the right name, said that no man
without the help of the devil, could with such vndauntednesse suffer so
much. Some besides their torments have been forced to be continually bo^^ed
and clothed many weeks together, pyned in their ^yet, consumed with varmine,
and almost stifeled with stench, and kept from sleep, till they were past the
use of reason, and then examined upon the advantage, when they could scarce
give an account of their own names. Some have been tortured in those parts,
that it is almost a torture to Christian ears to hear it, let it then be
judged, what it was to Chaste and Modest men to endure it, the shame being no
less offensive to their mind, than the pain, though most excessive to their
bodies; diverse have been thrown into unsavory and dark dungeons, and
brought so near staruing, that some for famine have licked the very moisture
of the walls. Some have been so far consumed, that they were hardly
recovered of life. What insufferable agonies we have been put unto upon the
Rack, it is not possible to express, the feeling so far exceeds all
speech. Some with instruments have been rouled up together like a balle, and
so crushed that the blood sprouted out at diverse parts of their bodies.

To omit diverse other cruelties, better known by their particular names, to
the Racke-Miasters, and Executioners, then to us, though too well acquainted
with the experience of their smartes. It is not possible to keep any reckoning
of the ordinary punishments of BRIDEWELL, now made the common Purgatory of
PRIESTS and CATHOLICS, as grinding in the Mill, being beaten like slaves,
and other outrageous vsages: for to these we are most cruelly enforced at the
discreation of such, as being to all other despised, underlings, take their
only felicity in laying their greedye commandments, and showing their
authority upon us, to whom every warder, Iaylor, and Porter, is an unresisted
Lord.

Thus (most excellent Princes) are we used, yea thus are we vnhumanely abused,
for being Priests, and of our forefathers faith, and of purpose to wring out
of us some odious speeches, which might serve at our arraignments for stales to
the people, to make them imagine greater matters than can be proved: whereas
neither evil meaning, nor truth, but torture only was guide to the tongue
that spoke them, within so hard conflictes of flesh and blood, with so bitter
conuulsions, is apt to utter any thing to abridge the sharpness and
severity of the pain. Such undoubtedly were the words alleged of taking part
with the army of the Popes, against our Realm, if they ever issued out of
Priests mouths, or else they were spoken by some unskillful Layman, that
knowing not how to answer such captious questions, and for reverence of the
chief Pastor of GODS Church, not daring to say that he would not take part
against him, had rather venture his life, by saying too much, than hazard his
conscience in not aunswering sufficient. But the ignorance of one must not
measure the meanings of all, whom knowledge of our deaths teaches aunswers far
different from his, and makes us ready to defend our Realm, as the Catholic
subjects, of you Majesty's ancestors, or any other Princes were, or ever
shall be. For did we carry so traitorous minds as our enemies give out, we
could not possible be so cowardly or foolish, as to suffer these tyrannies
for nothing, being otherwise resolved to dye, and knowing the heads and hands
from whence these cruelties proceed, without your Majesty's priuities. But as
with patience and mildness we hitherto have, and hereafter mean to endure
our scourges, having no way deserved the^, but by seeking the salvation of
souls, and praying for their good that torment us, so in answer of this
point, do we assure your Majesty, that what army soever should come against
you, we will rather yield our breasts to be broached by our enemies swords,
than use our swords to the effusion of our Country blood. But let us now come
to the confusion of some that would avouch Cardinal Allen to be Pope, and
Father Parsons to the king of Spain, to have showed certain scroles of the
names of catholics, and to have tempted him to renew the war, by promising
many thousands that should be in England ready to aid them, concerning which
there needs no more to be said, but that the penitents that made the
confession, knew well enough that they were not with their right ghostly father,
or else they would never have committed such a sacrilege, abusing the
Sacraments with such untruths. For we are assured by their notice, who were
more internal and co^uersant with them both, than the authors of this
confession ever could be, that they are sufficiently informed of the estates
of Catholics, the one by experience, the other by continual reports of those
that go over. And therefore neither in policy, in which they are noe punies,
nor honesty on which their creeit does lie, would they deliver such follies
into Princes ears, which all protestants hearing by so many atturneies, (as
all protestants do) were able to disprove them of falsehood, for neither are
the restraints, and number of Catholics so secret, nor the course to suppress
them so unknown, but every Prince sees it an impossibility for them to do any
thing, being as before is showed, so naked and needy, and every way so
unprovided. Neither would they in discreation, (if they were as they are not)
the motioners of the Kings coming, feed them with a vain hope of the^, whom
they at least knew to be a kind of broken reeds, since the more help he
expects,, the less he would bring, and happily build a maimed plotte upon
a false supposall, to his second overthrow: and if this preparation be greater
than ever, why should he the^ trust to our less ability, and the Laws daily
weakening our strength, and time hourly increases his more than he did at the
first assault, when not any Priest nor Catholic in England, was acquainted
with his coming, nor sure of his intent, til the common voice bruted it, and
our provisions ascertained his purposes, and unless they were our enemies they
would not in common wisdom show scrolles of our names, or promise our
assistance, since they knew not how ready our adversaries at home would be
upon less matters to seek our subversion, yea though they should as we are
sure they will not (pass so fond promises) yet could not Catholics but hazard
all their estates in their vncertaineties of foreign war, seeing specially his
last overthrow, and knowing the enterprise to be such, that either the King
must stand upon the strength of his own force, or the sorry addition of their
impotent succor, which can never enable him to contriue his endeavors.
Finally, both Cardinal Allen, and Father Parsons, are known generally to be
men of excellent gifts, and no such nouices in the knowledge of Princes
intelligencers, as in the weighty points of alteration of States, and invasion
of Kingdoms, to presume to delude them with impudent assertions, known to
themselves to be false, as the informer acknowledges this to be. And if
effects, the most infallible testimonies of intentions, may bear the deserved
credit against naked and unprovided words of this partial Inditor, Father
Parsons has by evident demonstrations of a loyal mind, sufficiently cleared
himself from such undue suspicions: for having by his wisdom and rare parts,
purchased more then ordinary credit with the King of Spain. All that have bin
eye witnesses of his proceedinges, can avouch, that he has used the kings
favor every way to the benefit, but no way to the prejudice of your Majesty's
subjects. The soldiers that in your service lost their liberties, and expected
no other entertainment, but the customarie pay of professed hostility, was by
his means an intercession, not only pardoned their lives, but with new
apparel and money in their purses, enfranchised to their full liberties,
either to stay in the Country, if they so fancied, or to return to their
own, if they were so better pleased; yea whereas by long continued breaches,
between Spain and England, the name of an Englishman was in most parts of
those kingdoms, far less loved then known: he has used such means for
the mittigation of their enmity toward us, that now we are no less welcome
amongst them, and more charitably used, then in most other Nations: whereof not
only the quiet of Marchaunts, the admittance of our Students, even in the heart
of our Realm, (both things unusual in so jealous and suspicious times) but the
singular courtesy toward their professed and known enymies, who are actually
taken in a violent enterprise against them, gave proof to your Majesty,
witnessing how much Father Parsons has quallified the dislikes, that wars
brings forth: for even the Athalantado or chief Governor of the Galleyes of
spain, to make manifest that neither the king, nor his Nobles had in the heat
of their Martial broils, lost the feeling of their ancient League with our
Country, sent into the Galleys of our English Captains, the plate and meat
from their own table, that the world by these friendlinesse know, how much
better they can use their enemies, then some of your Majesty's unworthy
Maiestrates, your natural subjects, and loyal friends. And though it rest
not in a private man's power, to stay the endeavors of so mighty a Prince, in
so general, and important an enterprise, as is war with England. Yet this
without presumption may be truly said, that if ever he should prevail in
that designement, (as the casualties of war are most uncertain, and only
over ruled by God) Father PARSONS assisted with Cardinal ALLENS authority,
has done that in our Countries behalf, for which his most bitter enemies, and
generally all your Majesty's Subjects, shall have cause to thank him for his
serviceable endeavors; so far has he inclined fury to clemency, and rage
to compassion. The confi^ent therefore that gave out these confessions, did it
but to sooth up such credulous auditors as they knew very apt to entertain
any rumors against the credit of Catholics, hoping of likelihood to sell them
these fables for some benefit of more importance.

No no most GRACIOUS Sovereign, it is not the authority of two private men,
that can carry away Princes, so ready to employ the many forces, if they
have not motives of greater consequence: and whosoever considers our
surprising of the Kings Towns in Flaunders, or inuading his Countries in
Spain, and Portingale, our assisting his enemies against his daughters right
in Britain, our continnall intercepting his treasure, warring with his
fleets, and annoying* his Indies: shall find other causes of his coming, even
since his last repulse, then the slender hope of a few beggarly Catholics,
or the fainte perswation of two banished men. It is also no small injury that
is offered to your Highness, in making your SACRED hand, guided by such
thoughts as scorn to have untruths the patron of your actions, to seem the
Author of this Sentence: That many men of wealth professing in your realm a
contrary religion, are known not to be empeached for the same, either in their
lives, lands, goods, or liberties, but only by paying a pecuniary sum, as a
penalty for the time, that there refuse to come to Churches. If this be as
truly, as confidentlye spoken, why were the venerable Prelates, and other
Priests, and Gentlemen deprived of their Livings, and pyned in Wisbiche: why
are all the principal Catholics committed to Elye, known to the ministers,
then to Banbury, afterward to their own houses with a short compass about
them, being now only let loose to verify a part of this proclamation, and to
be easlyer ensnared in the perils thereof, to which every child may see, they
are more subject at home, than they would be in prison, and if they chance
not to be so wary not to be entrapped, effects will soon prove, (if your
Majesty's favor prevent not the intention of others, that this liberty was)
for a purpose, just at the coming forth of the proclamation granted, since
order will soon be taken, that they shall not surfeit of being so long free,
and if this saying be true, that none are troubled for religion, what keeps
at this hour at London, York, and other places, great numbers of many poor
Catholics in prison, some of them languishing a-way with the commodities of
their enclosure, have by a patient death obtained the best liberty, others yet
after many years indurance, for no other cause but for Religion, being
offered liberty if they would go to Church. Pining still in painful
restraint, witnesses to the world, with their lingering miseries, the manifest
falsenes of this assertion Was it not punishment for Religion, when a company
of Honorable and Worshipful Ladies and Gentlewomen were most uncivilly led
through Cheapside, with their Priests before them, only for hearing MASS, and
that before Priesthood was enacted to be Treason. Is not that very statute a
most heavy oppression, now when the most of these Queen MARY'S Fathers that
are left, are become so oulde and impotent, that they can not possibly supply
Catholics special necessities, to make it by Law felony to receive young
Priests. Are not Catholics shortened by this means from such helps to which
their conscience and Religion binds them, a torment to virtuous minds, more
afflictiue than any outward punishment? Are they not by this tied to this
wounding and bitter choice, either to live like Heathens without the Rites of
Christian and necessary SACRAMENTS, for their souls health, or to purchase
them at the rigorous price of hazarding their Liberties, Lives, Lands, and
Posterities, as in case of fellonie. In points also of our credit, how deeply
we are incurred in respect of our Religion, how many experiences make it
most manifest? We are made the common Theme of every railing declaymer,
abused without means or hope of remedy, by every wretch with most infamous
names: no tongue so forsworn, but it is of credit against us: none so true,
but it is thought false in our defense; our slanders are common works for
idle presses, and our credits are daily sold at the Stationers staules,
every Libeller repayring his wants, with impayring our honors, being sure
that when all other matters fail, any Pamphlets against us shall ever be
vvelcomed, with seen, as allowed. If we keep Hospitality we are
censured to be too popular: if we forbear, we hoarde up money for secret
purposes: if we be merry, we are ^de with foreign hopes: if sad, we are
(...)-content with the state at home: If we subscribe to Articles, it must
be called Hypocrisy: if we refuse disloyalty, in some we are measured by
the eyes and tongues, of such whom we can no way please, but by being
miserable: yea, the very name of a Catholic, as they in their new Testament
term it a Papiste, is so known a vantage for every one, that either owes
them money, or offers them injury, that they can neither claim their right,
nor right their vvronges: but their adversaries straight leaving the
mainepointe, pleads against them for their Recusancie. And thus traversing
their suites, often causes their persons to be committed to prison. If any
displeasing accident fall out, whereof the authors are either unknown or
ashamed, Catholics are made common Fathers to such infamous Orphans, as
though none were so fit sluices as they, to let out of every man's sink, these
unsavory reproaches: not so much but the casual fires that sometimes happen in
London, the late vprores between Gentlemen and aprentises, were laid to our
charge, though the occasioners of both were known so well that the report against
us, could not but issue from an undeserved malice: yea Hacket a man so far from
our Faith, as Infidelity it self, and a little before so notorious a
Puritan, that he was of chief reckoning among them; when his blasphemies grew
so great, his articles so impious, that they made Christians ears to glow, and
his adherents to blush: then was he posted over to us for a Papist, and so
named to vulgar sort; so common a practice it is to bestow upon us, the
infamies of all offenders. I omit the vniformed shame and contempt, that the
very laws lay upon us, condemning the chief function of our Religion, partly
for treasonable, partly for punishable faults: And pretending an ancient
faith honored in all former ages, to be so detestable a thing, that it should
by a solemn Statute be thought necessary to make it treason, to persuade any
unto it. I leave the slanders forged against Priests, after their Executions,
purposely reserved till the parties were past answering, and then deuulged to
make them hateful. It were infinite to lay before your Majesty's eyes, all
the crosses that in this world we bear: which to men, whom either gentry or
nobility makes tender over their honors, cannot be but most bitter
corrisiues: for they neither dare revenge their own quarrels for fear of double
offense to god and your highness, nor hope to have redress in ordinary
course, so far has disfauor excluded them, from all needful remedies: yet
must your Majesty be informed, (so uncharitable are our enemies) that we suffer
nothing for Religion, whom only in respect of Religion these neglected
miseries have made most contemptible every one doing us wrong, to please our
superiors, whom they see careless in yielding us any right. Now how
undutiful an impeachment it was to the credit of your Majesty's words and
writings, to publish under your Sovereign title, that Catholics for Religion
are not impeached in their goods or lands, I leave to effects to prove. And
what is our recusancie, or refusal, to be present at their protestants
service, but a mere matter of conscience, for as there is none so known, or
usual a way to distinguishe any religion from other, as the external rites
and Sacraments peculiar to every one, so can none more effectually deny his
own than by making open confession of a contrary speech by his assistance and
present at the solemnities and service proper to it. For not only he that
denies Christ in his heart, but he also that denies or is ashamed of him,
shall in the latter day be denied of him before his Angels. And seeing men
judge best of our minds, by our actions, we cannot possibly give any greater
proof unto them, that we are no Catholics, than if we join with Protestants,
in their Churches and service, by which, as then most certain and special
marks, they the^ selves are known to be of that opinion. We therefore, not
gainesaid by Calvin, Melanciho^, or any other learned Protestant, in this
esteem of voluntary presents, of any in or at the service of a contrary sect,
a denial of his faith before men which being by Christ expressly prohibited
cannot but be judged a mere matter of conscience, and religion, and as such a
one as is by us refused, since neither pleasure nor policy could otherways
witholde us, our refusal redounding to our so great trouble and disadvantage,
for first there are twenty pounds by the month exacted of such as are to pay it
after thirteen months by the year, an account unusual in all other causes,
as the laws commonly read Printed and practiced witnesses, and multitudes of
the vnabler sort of catholics daily feel, that al their goods, and third part
of their lands are ceased on, for their Recusancie that cannot yearly pay
thirteenscore pounds for the same. And this is so perscribed, and performed
with such rigor, that it is in the leases of Protestants hands by a special
prouiso, ordained that recusants should not be so much as tenantes to their
own lands, so severely is their religion punished in that behalf: yea and
this law has bin so severely executed, that whereas poor farmers and
husbandmen, had but one Cow for themselves, and many children to live upon it,
that for their Recusancie has bin taken from them, and where both kine and
cattle were wanting, they have taken their couerlets, sheets, and blankets from
their bedds, their victuals and pore provision from their houses, not sparing
so much as the very glass from their windows, when they found nothing else
to serve their turns withal, which most pitiful abuses pore souls both in the
North and other countries, have bin continually cu^bred, no complaints taking
place, where these outrages were, rather commended for good services, than
rebuked for misdemeanors. So irreuocably are we condemned to a servile
bondage. And if your Majesty did but know what other extreme penury and
desolation, they ordinarily feel, your merciful heart, never hardened to see
lamentable spoils would rather have the laws repealed, than the execution so
intolerable. It is not possible to express in words the continual hell we
suffer by the merciles searching and storming of purseuants and such needy
officers, that care not by whose fall they rise, not having any deserts or
other degrees, to clime to the hight of their ambition, but by the punishment
and pains of poor Catholics. They water their fou^tains with the showers of
our tenderest veins, and build their houses with the ruins of ours,
tempering the mortar of their foundations, with our innocent blod: our livings
are but snares for the owners lives, commonly made the fee of ery mercenary
mouth, that can by sounding our disgraces into credulous ears, procure
themselves warrants to seize upon our substance. They make our wills before we
be sick, bequeathing to their own uses, what share they like, and by
displa^ting our offspring adopt themselves to be heirs of our lands, beging and
broking for the^, as if we were either condemned for fools, or in perpetual
minority, and not contented with our wealth, they persecute our lives, never
thinking their possession sure, til the assurance be seasoned with our death.
So easy it is for our enemies to quench their angry thirste in our blood: yea
we are made so common forage for all hungry cattle, that even the thieves with
scutchins and counterfeit warrants, have under the pretense of purseuants
spoiled us in our houses, having the officers to assiste the^ in their
robberies, so ready they are at every ones call, to practice their authority to
our vexation, and so well known it is to every way beater how openly
Catholics lie to the pray. And though some very few find more favor being
able to follow it with golden petitions, yet all the rest, whose meaner estates
cannot reach the charge of such costly friends, are made common blottes, open
to every chance of the dice, to give entry to their adversaries, by their
displeasing their own servants and tennantes crowing over them, and vaunting
that every pawn may give their mate to their highest fortune: for be he never
so base that plays with them, with the least advantage, he is sure that many
will back him in it, and have the trick with a sure help, though it be the son
that takes against his father, or any faulty drudge that for fear of
correction accuses his master. It were infinite to set down the laborinth of
our afflictions, in which, what way soever we go, it is but a loosing of our
selves and a vvinding of us further into an endless course of calamities. Let
this suffice, that now so heavy is the hand of our superiors against us, that
we generally are accounted men, who^ it is a credit to pursue, a disgrace to
protect, a commodity to spoil, again to torture, and a glory to kill. We
presume that your Majesty seldom or never hears the truth of our
persecutions, your lenity and tenderness being known to be so professed an
enemy to these cruelties, that you would never permit their countenance, if
they were but expressed to your highness as they are practiced upon us: yet since
we can bring the ruin of our houses, the consumption of our goods, the poverty
of our estates, and the weeping eyes of our desolate families, for palpable
witnesses of the truth of these complaints. Let us not be so far exiled out
of the limets of all compassions, as besides all other evils to have it
confirmed with your Majesty's hand, that we suffer no punishment for religion,
suffering in proof all punishments, for nothing else: we have been long enough
cut from all comforts, and stinted by an endless task of sorrows growing in
griefs, as we grow in years, one misery oretaketh another, as though every one
were but in earnest of a harder payment; we have some small hope that our
continued patience, and quiet effusion of our bloodat your Majesty's feet,
would have kindled some spark of remorse toward us: but still we see that we
are not yet at the depth of our misfortunes, we must yet tread the restles maze
of new agreeuance, since we perceive by this Proclamation, that our cause is
too far for being pitied, that it is not so much as known, where it can
only be redressed: yet since help never comes too late, to so helples
creatures, who daily are drawn nearly to the brinke of a general
destruction, which some that give aim to your Majesty, seem willing that you
should discharge upon us: we are forced to deuulge our petitions by many mouths
to open unto your Highness our humble suits: for neither our selves to present
the^ in person (being terrified by the president of imprisonment, that last
attempted it) nor having the favor of any such patron, as would be willing to
make himself our mediator to your Majesty: we are forced to commit it to the
multitude, hoping that among so many, that shall peruse this short and true
relation of our troubles, GOD will touch some merciful heart, to let your
highness understand the extremity of the^, which if we were once sure to have
been effectually performed, we might either set up our rest, ^n an vnflexable
sentence of misery, which we hope shall never proceed from so easy and
gracious a Judge, as your sacred self, or either expect some lenity to allay
the anger of our smart, a thing more incident unto the mild temper of so
excellent a mind. In the mean season, we humbly crave pardon of this forced
defense, and necessary supplication, which was extorted from us by open and
unsupportable untruths, no less needful for your majesty to know, the^ for
us to disprove; employing the undeserved touch of your Majesty's word, and
playning the direct path, to our intended subversion; Accept it therefore (most
merciful Princess) and all our humble duties and faithes with it, which with
most loyal thoughts, and serviceable resolulutions, are unfeignedly betrothed
to your Majesty's defense. God of his infinite goodness prosper and preserve you
to his glory, your subjects comfort, and your own, both temporal and eternal
happiness. December 14. Anno. 1595. FINIS.
