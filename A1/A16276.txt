A very godly Song, entitled, The earnest petition of a faithful Christian,
being Clarke of Bodnam, made upon his Deathbed, at the instant of his
Transmutation. To a pleasant new tune.

NOw my painful eyes are rolling,
And my passing Bell is towling:
Towling sweetly: I lie dying,
And my life is from me flying.
Grant me strength, O gracious God,
For to endure thy heavy rod:
Then shall I rejoice and sing,
With Psalms unto my heavenly King.
Simeon that blessed man,
Believed Christ when he was come,
And then he did desirs to dye,
To live with him eternally.
Christ wrought me a strong salvation,
By his death and bitter passion:
He has washed and made me clean,
That I should never sin again.
Grievous pains do call and cry,
O man, prepare thy self to dye.
All my sins I have lamented,
And to dye I am contented.
Silly Soul, the Lord receive thee,
Death is come, and life must leave thee,
Death does tarry no man's leisure,
Then farewell all earthly pleasure.
In this world I nothing crave,
But to bring me to my Grave,
In my Grave while I lie sleeping*
Angels have my soul in keeping.
When the Bells are for me ringing,
Lord receive my soul with singing:
Then shall I be free from pain,
To live and never dye again.
Whiles those worms corruption breed on,
Wait my noisome corpse to feed on,
My fervent love (this prison loathing)
Craves a robe of Angels clothing.
Farewell world and worldly glory,
Farewell all things transitory,
Sion hill my soul ascends,
And Gods Royal Throne attends.
Farewell wife and children small,
For I must go now Christ does call,
And for my death be ye content,
When I am gone, do not lament.
Now the Bell does cease to towle,
Sweet Jesus Christ receive my soul*
The second part of the Clarke of Bodnam. To the same tune.

O God which did the world create,
Hear a poor sinner at thy gate:
Thou that from death did set me free,
Remit my sins and show mercy.
Oh thou that caus'dst thy blessed Son,
Into this Uniuerse to come,
Thy Gospel true here to fulfill,
And to subdue death, sin, and hell.
Grant for his sake that died on tree,
On the blessed Mount of Caluary:
That I being grieved for my sin,
May by repentance heaven win.
The Gospel says, Who so believe,
To them will thou a blessing give:
Amongst which number grant me faith,
That to believe, thy Gospel says.
Which if I do, (as grant I may,
Though here I dye, I live for aye:
Then Savior sweet, remit my sin,
And give me grace that life to win.
And since they death (a price most great)
Has bought me, here I do entreat,
To give me grace thy Name to praise,
Both now, and evermore always.
For by thy death my soul is free
From hell, which still by thy decree,
To sinners all for sinn^^ due,
Until thy Son our Savior ^i^e,
Did vanquish by Almighty power,
Death, hell, and all that could devour.
My sins, O Lord, I do confess,
Like sands in Sea are numberless.
Yet though my sins as scarlet show,
Their whiteness may exceed the Snow*
If thou thy mercy do extend,
That I my sinful life may mend.
Which mercy thy blessed Word does say,
At any time obtain I may,
If power and grace in me remain,
From carnal sin for to refrain.
Then give me grace, Lord, to refrain
From sins, that I may still remain^
With thee in heaven, where Angels sing,
Most joyfully to thee our King.
And grant (O Christ) that when I dye,
My soul with thee immediately,
May have abode amongst the blessed,
And live for ever in true rest.
FINIS.
