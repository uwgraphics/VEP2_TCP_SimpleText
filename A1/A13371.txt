Liber psalmo^^i.
Psalmus (...)
BEatus vir qui non abiit in co^ cilio impiorum, and i^ via peccatorum non
sterit: and in (...) pestilentie non sed it.

Sed in lege domini volu^tas eius: et in lege eius meditabitur die ac nocte.

^terit tanque lignum quoth pla^tatum est secus decur sus aquaru^: quod fructu^
suum dabit in te^pore suo.

^t folium eius non defluet: et omnia quecunque faciet presperabu^tur.

^ on sic impij non sic: sed ta^que puluis quem proiicit ventus a facie terre.

^deo no^ resurgu^t impij in iudioi^: neque peccatores in concilio instorum.

^noniam nouit vn^s via^ ^ustorum: et iter impioru^ peribit.

(...)
QVare fremueru^t ge^tes: et populi meditati sunt inania?

A stiterunt reges terre, et principes conueneru^t in vnum aduersus d^^m, and
aduersus Christum eius.

^iru^pamus vincula eorum: et proiici amus a nobis iugum ipsorum.

^ui habitat in celis irridebit eos: et dominus sub sannabit eos.

^unc loquetur ad eos in ira sua: et in furore suo co^turbabit eos.

^ go au^t constitutus sum tex ab eo super Sion mo^tem sanctum eius: predicans
preceptum eius.

^ ominus dixit ad me: (...) lius meus es tu, ego hodie genui te.

^ ostula a me, et dabo tibi gentes hereditatem tuam, et possessionem tua^
terminos terre.

^eges eos in virga ferrea: et tanque vas figuli co^ fringes eos.

^t nunc reges intelligi te: erudimini qui indicatis terram.

^eruite domino in timo re: et exultate ei cum tree more.

^pprehendire disciplinam, ne quando irascatur dominus: et pereatis de via
iusta.

^um exarserit in breu^ ira eius: beati omnes qui confidunt in eo.

NOmine, quid multiplicati sunt qui tribula^t me? multi insurgu^t aduersum me.

^ulti dicu^t anime me: Non est salus ipsi in deo eius.

(...) au^t domine susceptor meus es, gloria mea, et exaltans caput meum.

^oce mea ad dominu^ clamaui, et exaudiuit me de monte sancto suo.

^go dormiui et soporatus sum, et exurrexi, quia dominus suscepit me.

^on timebo milia populi cricundantis me: exurge domine saluum me fac deus meus.

^uoniam tu percussisti omnes aduersantes mihi sine causa, dentes peccatorum
contriuisti.

^omini est salus, et super populum tuum benedictio tua.

ostendet nobis bona?

^igna^um est super no^ lumen vultus tui dn^e dedisti letitia^ in cord meo.

^fructu frume^ti, vini e^ olei sui multiplicati sunt.

^n pace in idipsum dormiam et requiescam.

^uoniam tu bomine singulariter in spe: co^stituisti me.

VErba mea auribus percipe d^^e: intell^ ge clamorem meum.

mane astabo tibi and bidebo: qm^ non deus volens iniquitatem tues.

neque habitabit iuxta te malignus: neque permanebunt iniusti ante oculos tuos.

odisti omnes qui opera^tur iniquitatem: perdes omnes qui loquuntur me^dacium.

uirum sanguinum and dolosum abominabitur dominus: ego autem in multitudine
misericordie tue introibo in domum tuam, adorabo ad te^plum sanctu^ tuum in
timore tuo.

^omine deduc me in iusticia tua propter inimicos meos: dirige in co^spectu tuo
viam meam.

^uoniam non est in ore eorum veritas: cor eorum vanun est.

^epulchrum parens est guttur eoru^, linguis suis dolo^e agebant, iudica illos

^arauit in iudicio thronum suum, and ipse iudicabit orbem terre in equita te,

^t factus est dominus refugium pauperi, adiutor in oportunitatibus in
tribulatione.

^t sperent in te qui nouerunt nomen tuum, quoniam non dereliquisti ^rentes te

^sallite domino qui habitat in Sion, annunciate inter gentes studia eius.

^noniam requirens sanguinem, eorum recordatus est, non est oblitus clamorem

^iserere mei domine, vide humilitatem meam de inimicis meis.

^ui exaltas me de portis mortis, vt annunciem omnes laudationes tuas in portis

^^ognoscetur dominus iudicia facie^s: in operibus manuum suatum co^prehe^ nsus

^onuertantur peccatores in infernum: omnes gentes que obliuiscu^tur deum.

^uoniam non in finem obliuio erit pauperis: pacie^tia pauperum no^ peribit in
finem.

^xurge dn^e, non conforretur homo, iudice^tur ge^tes in conspectu tuo.

^onstitue domine legislatorem sup eos: vt sciant ge^tes quoniam homines sunt.

^t quid domine recessisti long? despiets in oportunitatibus in tribulatione.

^um superbit impius, in^enditur pauper: comprehendu^tur in co^ciliis quibus
cogitant.

^noniam landatur peccaror i^ desideriis ai^e sue: et iniquus benedicitur.

^racerbauit dominu^ peccator: secundum multitudinem ire sue non queret.

^on est deus in conspecti^ eius, inquinate sunt vie illius in omni tempore.

^ixit in cord suo: non mouebor a generatione in generatione in sine malo.

^uius maledicti^^e os plenum est: et amaritudine et dolo: sub lingua eius

^edet in insidiis cum diuitibus in occultis: vt interficiat innocentem.

^culi eius in pauperum recipient, insidiatur in abscondito quasi leo in

^nsidiatur vt tapiat pauperem, rapere pauperem dum attrahit eum.

^n laqueo suo humiliabit eu^, inclinabit se and cadet, cum dominatus fuerit

^ixit enim in cord suo oblitus est deus, auerti^ faciem suam ne videat in

^xurge domine deus, et exaltetur manus tua, ne obliuiscaris pouperum.

^ropter ^d irritauit impius deum? dixit enim in cord suo: non requiret.

Tides, quoniam tu laborem and dolorem co^sideras, vt tradas eos in manus tuas.

^ibi derelictus est pauper: orphano tu eris abiutor.

^ontere brachium peccatoris and maligni, queretur peccatum illius, et no^

(...)
^N dn^o confido: quomodo dicitis anime me: transmigra in montem sicut passer.

^uoniam ecce, peccato^es intenderunt arcum, parauerunt segittes suas in
pharetra, vt sagitte^t in obscuro rectos cord.

Quoniam que perfe^isti, destruxerunt: iustus aute^ quid fecit?

Dominus in te^plo sancto suo, dominus in celo seeds eius.

Oculi eius in pauperem recipient, palpebre eius interroga^t filios hominu^.

Dominus interrogat in stu^ et impium: qui autem diligit iniquitatem, odit
animam suam.

Yluet super peccatores laqueos: ignis, sulphur et spiritus procellaru^ pars
calicis eorum.

Quoniam iustus dominus et iusticias dilexit, equitatem vidit vultus eius.

(...)
^Aluum me fac dn^e, quonia^ defecit sanctus: quoniam diminute sunt veritates a

^ana loquuti sunt vnusquisque ad proximum suu^ labia dolosa in cord and cord

Qui dixerunt: lingua^ nostram magnificabimus, labia nostra a (...) sunt, quis

Propter miseriam i^opu^ et gemitum pauperu^, nu^c exurgam, dicit dominus.

Ponam in salutari, fiducialiter agam in eo.

Elophia domini elequia casta, argeutum igne examinatum, probatum terre
purgatum septuplum.

Qu dn^e seruabis nos: et custodies nos a generatione hac in eternum.

^n circuitu impij ambula^t, secu^dum altitudinem tuam multiplicasti filios
hominum.

Psalmus. xij.
VSque quo domine obli uisceris me? in finem? vsque quo auertis faciem tuam a
me?

Quandiu ponam consilia ^n anima mea, dolorem in cord meo per diem?

^sque quo exaltabitur ini micus meus super me? re spice and exandi me dn^e
deus meus.

Illumina oculos meos, ne vnquam obdormiam in morte, ne qua^do dicat inimieus
meus: preualui aduersus eum.

Qui tribulant me, exultabu^t si motus fuero: ego au^t in mi^a tua speraui.

Exultabit cor meu^ in salutari tuo: ca^tabo domino qui bona tribuit mihi, et
psallam nomini domini al tissimi.

(...).
^Ixit insipiens in cord suo: non est bens.

^orrupti sunt and abominabiles facti sunt in studiis suis: non est qui faciat
bonum, non est vsque ad vnum.

Dominus de celo prospexit super filios honunum, vt videat si est intellige^s
aut requirens deum.

Omnes declinaueriunt simul, inutiles facti su^t, no^ est qui faciat bonum, non
est vs^s ad vnum.

Sepulchrum patens est guttur eorum, linguis suis dolose agebant, venenum
aspidu^ sub labus eorum.

Quorum os maledictione and amaritudine plenu^ est, veloces pedes eorum ad
effundendum sanguinem.

Contritio and infelicitas in vijs eorum, and viam pacis non cognouerunt, non
est timor dei ante oculos eorum.

^onne cognosce^t omnes qui opera^tur iniquitate^ qui deuorant plebem me^ sicut
escam panis?

Dominum non inuocaue runt: illic trepidauerunt timore, vbi non erat timor.

^uoniam dominus in generatione iusta est, concilium inopis confudistis,
quoniam dominus spes eius est.

Quis dabit ex Sion salutare Israel? cum co^uercerit dominus captiuitatem
plebis sue, exultabit Jacob and letabitur Israel.

(...).
DOmine, quis habita bit in tabernaculo tuo, aut quis requiescet in monte
sancto tuo?

Qui ingreditur sine macula, et operatur iusticia^.

Qui loquitur veritatem in cord suo, qui non egit dolum in lingua sua.

Nec fecit proxio suo malum, et opprobriu^ non accepit aduersus proximos suos.

Ad nihilum deductus est in co^spectu eius malignus, time^tes autem dominum
glorificat.

Qui jurat proximo suo, et non decipit: qui pecuniam suam non dedit ad vsuram,
et munera super innocentem non accepit.

Qui facit hec, non co^monebitur ineternum.

psalm^s. (...).
COnserua me domine quoniam speraui in te, dixi domino: deus meus es tu,
quonia^ bonrum meorum non eges.

Sa^ctis qui in terra sunt eius, miristcauit oe^s volu^ rates meas in eis.

Multiplicate sunt infirmitates eorum: postea a^celerauerunt.

Non congregabo conuenticula eorum de sanguinibus, nec memor ero nomiuum eorum
per labia mea.

Dominus pars heredita it is me and calicis mei: tu es qui restitues hereditatem
meam mihi.

^unes cedideru^t mihi in preclaris, etenim here ditas mea preclara est mihi.

^enedicam dominum qui tribuit mihi intellectum, insuper et vsque ad noctem in
crepuerunt me tenes mei.

Prouidebam vn^min conspectu meo semper, quoniam a dextris est mihi ne

Propter hoc letatum est cor meu^, et exultauit lingua mea, insuper et caro mea
requiescet in spe.

Quoniam non derelinques ai^am meam in infer no, nec dabis sanctum tuum videre
corruptionem.

^otas mihi fecisti vias bite, adimplebis me letitia cum vultu ruo, delecta
tiones in dextera tua vsque in finem.

Psal^^^ xvi.
EXaudi domine iusticiam meam, intend deprecationem meam.

Iuribus percipe orationem mea^, non i^ labiis do^osis.

(...) vultu tuo iudiciu^ meum prodeat, oculi tui videant equitatem.

^robasti cormeum, and visitasti nocte: igne me examinasti, and non est inuenta
in me iniquitas.

(...) non loquatur os meu^ opera hominum: proprer verba labiorum tuorum ego
custodiui vias duras.

^erst^e gressus meos in semitis tuis, vt non moueantur vestigia mea.

Ego clamaui, quoniam ex audisti me: deus inclina aurem tuam mihi, and exaudi
verba mea.

^irifica misericordias tuas, qui saluos facis sperantes in te.

A resistentibus dextere tue custodi me, vt pupilla^ o^uli.

Sub vmbra alarm tu^ rum protege me, a facie impioru^ qui me afflixeru^t.

Proiicie^tes me nunc circundederu^t me, oculos suos statuerunt declinari in

Pusceperu^t me sicut leo paratus ad predam, and sicut catulus leonis habitans
in abditis.

^xurge domine, preueni eum, and supplanta eum: eri pe animam meam ab impio,
frameam tuam ab inimicis manus tue.

^omine a paucis de terra divide eos in vita eorum, and de absco^ditis ruis
adimpletus est ve^ter eorum.

Paturati sunt filiis, and diuiserunt reliquias suis paruulis suis.

Ego autem in iustitia apparebo conspectui tuo, satiabor cu^ apparuerit gloria

Protector meus and cornu salut (me, and susceptor meus.

Mircundederunt me dolores mortis, and torrentes iniq^rat (^ turbaueru^t me.

^olores inferni circundederunt me, preoecupaue runt me laquei mortis.

^n tribulatione mea in^ocanui dominum, and ad deu^ meum clamaui.

^t exaudiuit de te^plo sa^cto suo voce^ mea^, and clamor meus in conspectu
eius introiuit in aures eius.

^ommota est and contremuit terra, fundamenta montium conturbata sunt and

^t ascendit super cherubin and volauit, volauit super pennas ventorum.

^t posuit tenebras latibulu^ suu^ in circuiru eius, tabernaculum eius

Pre fulgore in conspectu eius nubes transierunt, gra^do and carbones ignis.

Et i^to^^it de celo dn^s, and altissimus dedit voce^ sua^: gra^do and carbones
ignis.

Et inisit sagittas suas, and dissipauit eos: fulgura multiplicauit, and

Et apparuerunt fontes aquarum, and reuelata sunt fundame^ta orbis terrarum.

Ab increpatione tua domine, ab inspiratione spiritus ire tue.

Misit de summo and accepit me, and assumpsit me de aq^s multis.

Eripuit me de inimicis meis fortissimis, and ab his qui oderunt me, quonia^

Preuenerunt me in die afflictionis me, et factus est dominus protector men's.

Et eduxit in latitudine^: saluum me fecit, quoniam voluit me.

Et retribuet mihi dominus secundu^ iustitia^ mea^, and secundum puritate^

Quia custodiui vias domini, nec impie gessi a deo meo.

Quonim omnia iudicia eius in conspectu meo, et iustitias eius non repuli a me.

Et ero immaculatus cum eo, and obseruabo me ab iniquitate mea.

Et retribuet mihi dominus secundum iustitiam meam, and secundum puritatem

Quoniam in te eripiar a tentatione, and in deo meo transgrediar mutum.

Quoniam quis deus preter dominum, aut q^s deus preter deum nostrum?

Deus qui precinxit me virtute, and posuit immaoulatam viam meam.

Qui perfesit pedes meos tanquam ceruorum, and super excelsa statuens me.

Omnes videntes me detiserunt me, loquuti sunt labijs, and mouerunt caput.

Sperauit in domino, eripiat eum: saluu^ faciat eu^, quoniam vult eum.

Quonia^ tu es qui extraxisti me de ventre, spes mea ab vberibus matris me, in

De ventre matris me deus meus es tu, ne discesseris a me.

Quonia^ tribulatio proxima est, et non est qui adiuuet.

Circumdederunt me vituli multi, tauri pingue^ obsederunt me.

A perueru^t super me o^ suum, sicut leo rapiens e^ rugiens.

Sicut aqua effusus sum, et dispersa sunt omnia ossa mea.

Factum est cor meum ta^quam cera liquescens i^ medio veutris mei.

A ruit tanqua^ testa virtus mea, et lingua mea adhesit faucibus meis, and in

Quoniam circumded eru^^ me canes multi, conciliu^ malignantiu^ obsedit me.

Darrabo nomen tuu^ fratribus meis, in medio ecclesie laudabo te.

Qui timetis dominum, laudate eu^: vniuersum se men Jacob glorificate eu^.

Timeat eu^ omne semen Israel, quoniam non spreuit neque despexit deprecationem

Manducauerunt and adorauerunt oe^s pingues terre, in conspectu eius cadent

Et anima mea illi viuet, et semen meum seruiet ipsi.

Dulsis et rectus dominus, propter hoc legem ^abit delinquentibus in via.

^iriget mansuetos in iudicio, docebit mites vi^s suas.

Universe vie domini misericordia and veritas, requirentibus testame^tum eius
and testimonia eius.

Propter nome^ tuum domine propiciaberis peccato meo, multum est enim.

Quis est homo qui timet dominum? legem statuit ei in via quam elegit.

Anima eius in bonis de morabitur, and semen eius hereditabit terram.

Firmamentum est dominus timentibus eum, et testame^tum ipsius vt manifestetur
illis.

Oculi mei semper ad dominum, quoniam ipse euellet de laqueo pedes meos.

Respice in me and miserere mei, quia vnicus and pauper sum ego.

Tribulationes cordis mei multiplicate sunt de necessitatibus meis erue ^ne.

Wide humilitatem meam and laborem meum, et dimitte vniuersa delicta mea.

Respice inimicos meos, quonia^ multiplicati sunt, et odio iniquo oderunt me.

Custodi animam meam, et erue me: non erubescam, quoniam speraui in te.

Innocents and recti adheserunt mihi, quia susti^ nui te.

Libera deus Israel ex omnibus tribulationibus suis.

Psalmus.xxv.
IVdica me domi^e, quoniam ego in innocentia mea ingressus sum, et in domino

Proba me domine, and tenta me: ure renes meos et cor meum.

Quoniam misericordia tua ante oculos meos est, et complacui in veritate tua.

Non sedi cum concilio vanitatis, and cum iniqua gerentibus non introivo.

Odiui ecclesiam maligna^tim, and cum impiis non sedebo.

Lauabo inter innoce^tes manus meas, and circu^dabo altar tuum domine.

Vt audiam voce^ laudis, and enarrem vniuersa mira bilia tua.

Domine dilexi decorem domus tue, and locum habitationis glory tue.

In quorum mambus iniquitates sunt, dextera eorum repleta est muneribus.

Ego autem in innocentia mea ingressus sum, redime me, et miserere mei.

Vnam petiit a domino, hanc requiram: vt inhabitem in domo domini omnibus

Vt videam voluntatem domini, and visitem templum eius.

Quoniam absoondit m^ in tabernaculo suo in die malorum, protexit me in

In petra exaltauit me, et nunc exaltauit caput meum super inimcos meos.

Circuiui and immolaui in tabernaculo eius hostiam vociferationis: cantabo et

^xaudi domine vocem meam quia clamaui ad te: miserere mei et exaudi me.

Tibi dixit cor meum: exquisiuit te facies mea: faciem tuam domine requiram.

A diutor meus es tu, ne derelinquas me: ne que despicias me deus saluta ris

Legem pone mihi domine in via tua, and dirige me in semita recta perpter

EXultate iusti in domino, rectos decet collaudatio.

Consilium autem domini ineternum manet, cogita tiones cordis eius in

Domine, quando respicies? restitue animam meam a malignitate eorum, a leonibus

^on^^rebor tibi in ecclesia magna, in populo graui laudabo te.

^on supergaudeant mihi qui aduersantur mihi inique, qui oderunt me gratis, et

Iudica me secundum iustitiam tuam domine deus meus, et non supergaudeant mihi.

DIxit iniustus vt delinquat in semetipso: non est timor dei ante oculos eius.

Quoniam dolose egit in conspectu eius, vt inueniatur iniquitas eius ad odium.

^oli emulari in eo qui prosperatur in via sua, in homine faciente iniustitias.

^esine ab ira, and derelin que furorem: noli emul^ri vt maligneris.

Quoniam qui malignantur, exterminabuntur: sustinentes autem dominum ipsi

Et adhuc pusillum, and non erit peccator: and queres lo eum illuis, et non

Mansueti autem hereditabunt terram, and delectabuntur in multitudine pacis.

Obseruabit peccator instum, and stridebit super eu^ dentibus suis.

^I vere vtique iusticia^ loquimini, recte iudicate filij hominum.

Que non exaudiet voce^ incantantium, and venefici incantantis sapienter.

Deus ^o^teret dentes eorum in ore ipsorum, molas leonum co^fringet dominus.

Sicut cera que fluit, auferentur: super^ecidit ignis, and non viderunt solemn.

Et dicet homo: si vtique est fructus iusto, vtique est deus iudicans eos in

Psalmus.lviii.
ERipe me de inimicis meis deus meus et ab insurgentibus in me libera me.

Eripe me de operantibus iniquitatem, and de viris sanguinum salua me.

Quia ecce, ceperunt animam meam, irruerunt in me fortes.

Disperge illos in virtute tua, and depone eos protector meus domine.

Dilictum oris eoru^, sermonem labiorum ipsoru^: et comprehenda^tur in superbia

Psalmus (...)
DEus repulisti nos and destrucisti nos: iratus es, and misertus es nobis.

Commonisti terram and co^turbasti eam: sana contritiones eius, quia commota

Ostendisti populo tuo dura, potasti nos vino compunctionis.

Dedisti metuentibus te significationem, vt fugia^t a facie arcus.

Et libere^tur dilecti tui, saluum fa^ dextera tua, et exaudi me.

^eus loquutus est in sancto suo: letabor and partibor Sichiman, et co^uallem

Deus est Galaad, et meus est Manasses, and Ephraim fortitudo capitis mei.

Pslamus.lx.
EXandi deus deprecationem meam, intend orationi me.

Psalmus.lxii.

Sitiuit i^ te anima mea, qua^ multipliciter tibi caro mea.

In terra deserta, inuia, et inaquosa, sic in sancto apparui tibi, vt viderem

Quoniam melior est misericordia tua super vitas, labia mea laudabunt te.

Sic benedicam te in vita mea, et in nomine tu^ leuabo manus meas.

Sxicut adipe et pinguedi ne repleatur anima mea, and labiis exultationis

Sic memor fui tui superstratum meum, in marutinis meditabor in te, quia fuisti

Et in velamento alarm tuarum exultabo: adhesic anima mea post te, me suscepit

Psalmus.lxiij.
EXaudi deus orationem mea^ cum deprecor, a timore inimici eripe animam meam.

Protexisti me a connentu malignantium, a multitudine opera^tiu^ iniquitatem.

Quia exacuerunt vt gladium linguas suas, intenderunt arcum (rem amaram) vt

Subito sagittabunt et non timebunt, firmauerunt sibi sermonem nequam.

^arrauerunt vt absconderent laqueos, dixerunt: quis videbit eos?

^arutati sunt iniquitates, defecerunt serutantes scrutinio.

Sagitte paruulorum fact sunt plage eorum, et infirmate sunt contra eos lingue

Conturbati sunt omne a qui videba^t eos, and timuit omnis homo.

Benedicite ge^tes deum nostrum, and auditam facite vocem laudis eius.

Qui posuit animam mea^ ad vitam, and no^ dedit in co^motronem pedes meos.

Quonia^ probasti nos deus, igne nos examinasti sicut examinatur argentum.

Induxisti nos in laqueu^, posuisti tribulationes in dorso nostro, imposusti

Transiuimus per ignem and aquam, and eduxisti nos in refrigerium.

Introibo in domum tuam, in holocaustis reddam tibi vota mea, que distiuxerunt
labia mea, et loquutum est os meum in tribulatione mea.

Holocausta medullata offeram tibi cu^ incenso arietum, offeram tibi boues cum

Venite, audite, and narrabo (omnes qui timetis deum) quanta fecit anime me.

Ad ipsum ore meo clama^^i, and exultaui sub lingua mea.

Ini quitatem si aspexi in cord meo, non exaudiet dominus.

Propterea exandiuit dominus, and atte^dit voci deprecationis me.

Benedictus deus, qui no^ amoust orationem meam et misericordiam suam a me.

Psalmus.lxvij.
EXurgat deus, and dissipentur inimici eius: and fugiant qui oderu^t eu^, a

In labor hominum non sunt, and cum hominibus non flagel labuntur.

Ideo tenuit eos superbia, operti sunt iniquitate and impietate sua.

Prodiit quasi ex adipe iniquitas eorum, translerunt in affectum cordis.

Cogitauerunt and loquuti sunt nequitiam, iniquitatem in excelso loquuti sunt.

Et dixi: ergo sine causa iustificaui cor meum, and laui inter innocents manus

Tu confirmasti in virtute tua mate, contribulasti capita draconu^ in aquis.

Tu co^fregisti capita draconis, dedisti eum esca^ populis Ethiopum.

Tu dirupisti fontes et torrentes, tu siccasti fluuios Ethan.

^nus est dies, and tua est nox: tu fabricatus es autoram and solemn.

^u fecisti omnes terminos terre, estatem and virtue plasmasti ea.

^emor esto huius: inimicus improperauit domino and populus insipiens in^itauit
nomen tuum.

^e tradas bestijs animas confitentes tibi: animas pauperum tuoru^ ne
obliuiscaris in finem.

^espice in testamentum tuum, quia repleti sunt obscurati sunt terre domibus
iniquitatum.

Ne ^auertatur humilis factus confusus: pauper and inops laudabunt nomen tuum.

Exurge deus, iudica causam tuam, memor esto improperiorum tnorum que ab
insipie^te su^t tota die.

Ne obliuiscaris voces inimicoru^ tuorum: superbia eorum qui te oderunt
ascendit semper.

(...).
COnfitebimur tibi deus, co^fitebimur and in nocabunus nomen tuum,

^arrabimus mirabilia tua, cu^ accepero tempus, ego iusticias iudicabo.

Liquefacta est terra et omnes qui habitant in ea ego confirmaui columnas eius.

^^xi iniquis: nolite inique agere, and delinquentibus: nolite exaltare cornu.

^olite extollere in altu^ cornu vestru^, nolite loqui aduersus deum
iniquitatem.

Quia neque ab orient, neque ab occidente, neque a desertis montibus, quoniam
deus iudex est.

Hunc humiliat, and hunc exaltat, quia calix in manu domini vini meri plenus
mixto.

Et inclinauit ex hoc in hoc: veruntamen fex eius non est examinati, bibent
omnes peccatores terre.

Ego autem annunciabo in seculum, cantabo deo Jacob.

Et omnia cornua peccatorum confringa^, and exaltabuntur cornua iusti.

^^tus in Judea deus, in Israel magnum nomen eius.

Et factus est in pace locus eius, and habitatio eius in Sion.

^bi confregit potentias arcum, scutum, gladium and bellum.

Illuminans tu mirabili tera montibus eternis: turbati sunt omnes insipientes
cord.

Dormierunt somnu^ suu^, and nihil inueneru^t omnes viri diuitiarum in manibus
suis.

Ab increpatione tua deus Jacob: dormitaueru^t oe^s qui ascenderunt equos.

Tu terribilis es, and qui^ resistet ribi? ex tunc ita tua.

De celo auditum fecisti iudicium: terra tremuit, and quieuit.

(...) exurgeret in iudiciu^ deus, vt saluos faceret omnes mansuetos terre.

Quoniam cogitacio hominis confitebitur ribi, and reliquie cogitationis diem

Voue^e and reddite domino deo vestro, omnes qui in circuitu eius affertes

^erribili and ei qui aufer^ spiritum principum, terribili apud omnes reges

(...)
VOce mea ad dominu^ clamaui, voce mea ad deu^, and intendit mihi.

^n die tribulatio^is me deum exquisiui manibus meis nocte contra eum, and non

Benuit consolari anima mea, memor fui dei, and delectatus sum, and exercitus
su^, and defecit spiritus meus.

Anticipaueru^t vigilias oculi mei, turbatus sum and non sum loquutus.

Cogitaui dies antiquos and annos eternos in mence habui.

Et meditatus sum nocte cum cord meo; and exercitabar, and scopebam spiritu^
meum.

^u^quid ineternu^ proijciet deus, aut non apponat vt complacitior sit adhuc?

Aut in finem misericordiam suam abscidit, a generatione i^ generatione^.

Aut obliuiscetur misereri deus, aut continebit in ita sua misericordias suas?

Et dixi: nunc cepi, hec mutatio dextere excelst.

^emor fui operu^ domini quia memor ero ab initio mirabilium tuorum.

Et meditabor in omnibus operibus tuis, and in adiuuentionibus tuis exercebor,

Deus in sancto via tua: quis deus magnus sicut deus noster? tu es deus qui
facis mirabilia.

^otam fecisti in populis virtutem tuam, redemisti in brachio tuo populum tuum
filios Jacob et Joseph.

Viderunt te aque deus, viderunt te aque, and timuerunt, and turba^e sunt
abissi.

^^ltitudo sonitus aquarum, vocem dederunt nubes.

Etenim sagitte tue tra^sierunt, vox tonitrui tui in rota.

^^uxeru^t coruscationes tue orbi terre, co^mota est and contremuit terra.

In mari via tua, and semite tue in aquis multis, et vestigia tua non
cognoscentur.

Deduxisti sicut o^es populum tuu^ in manu Moysi and Aaron.

(...)
ATte^dite popule meus legem mea^, inclinate aurem vestram in verba oris mei.

^peria^ in parabolis os meum, loquar propositiones ab initio.

Qua^ta audiuimus and cognouimns ea, and patres nostri narrauerunt nobis.

^on sunt occultata a filijs eorum in generatione altera.

^arrantes lauds domini, and virtutes eius and mirabilia eius que fecit.

(...) suscitauit testimoniu^ in Jacob, and legem posuit in Israel.

Q^anta mandauit patribus nostris: nota facere ea filiis suis, vt cognoscat
generatio altera.

Filij qui nascentur and ex urgent, enarrabunt filiis suis.

Vt ponant in deo spem suam, et non obliuisca^tur operum dei, et mandata eius
exquirant.

^e fiant sicut patres eorum, generatio praua et exasperans.

^eneratio que non direxit cor suu^, et non est creditus cu^ deo spiritus eius.

Filij Ephraim intende^tes et mittentes arcum, conuersi sunt in die belli.

^on custodierunt testame^tum dei, et in lege eius noluerunt ambulare.

Et obliti sunt henesticiorum eius, et mirabilium eius que ostendit eis.

^oram patribus eorum fecit mirabilia in terra Egypti, i^ ca^po thaneos.

Interrupit mare, and perdurit eos, and statuit aquas quasi in vtre.

Et deduxit eos in nube diei, et tota nocte in illuminatione ignis.

Interrupit petra^ i^ here mo, et adaquauit eos quasi in abysso multa.

Et eduxit aquam de petra, et eduxit tanqua^ flumina aquas.

Et apposueru^t adhuc peccare ei, in iram concitauerunt excelsum in inaquoso.

Et tentauerunt deum in cordibus suis, vt petere^t escam animabus suis.

Et male loquuti sunt de deo dixerunt: nunquid poterit deus patate mensam in
deserto?

Quoniam percussit petram, et fluxerunt aque, et torrentes inundauerunt.

Nunquid and panem poterit dare, aut patare mensam populo suo?

Ideo audiuit dominus and distulit, and ignis accensus est in Jacob, et ira
ascendit in Israel.

Quia non credideru^t in deo, nec speraueru^t in salutari eius.

^t ma^dauit nubibus desuper, et ianuas celi aperuit.

Et pluit illis manna ad manducandum, et panem celi dedit eis.

Panem angelorum manducauit homo, cibaria misit eis in abundantiam.

Tra^stulit austrum de celo, et induxit in virtute sua Africum.

Et pluit super eos sicut puluerem earnes, et sicut arenam maris volatilia
pennata.

Et ceciderunt in medio castrorum eorum circa tabernacula eorum.

Et manducauerunt and saturati sunt nimis, et desiderium eorum attulit eis non
sunt fraudati a desiderio suo.

Adhuc esce eorum erant in ore ipsorum, et ira dei ascendit super eos.

Et occidit pingues eorum, et electos Israel impediuit.

In omnibus his peccauerunt adhuc, et non crediderunt mirabilibus eius.

Et defecerunt in vanitate dies eorum, et anni eorum cum festinatione.

Cum otcideret eos, quereba^t eum, et reuertebantur, et diluculo venieba^t ad
eum.

Et rememorati su^t quia deus adiutor est eorum, et deus excelsus rede^ptor
eorumest.

Et dilexeru^t eum in ore ^uo, et lingua sua mentiti sunt ei.

Cor autem eorum non erat rectum cum eo, neo fideles habiti sunt in testamento
eius.

Ipse autem est misericors, et propitius fiet peccatis eoru^, et non disperdet
eos.

Et abundauit vt auerteret iram suam, et non accendit oe^m iram suam.

Et recordatus est quia caro sunt, spiritus vadens et non rediens.

^uoties exacerbaueru^t eum in deserto? in iram concitauerum eum in inaquoso.

Et conuersi sunt and tentauerunt deum, et sanctum Israel exacerbauerunt.

^on sunt recordati manus eius, die qua redemit eos de manu tribulantis.

^icut posuit in Egypto signa sua, and prodigia sua in campo Thaneos.

Et conuertit in sanguinem flumina eorum, and imbres eorum ne biberent.

^isit eos cynomiam, and comedit eos, and ranam, and disperdidit eos.

Et dedit erugini fru^tus eorum, and labores eorum locuste.

Et occidit in gra^dine vineas eorum, and moros eorum pruina.

Et tradidit grandini inmenta eorum, and possessionem eorum igni.

Nisit in eos ira^ indignationis sue, indignationem and iram and tribulationem,
inuisiones, per angelos malos.

^ia^ fecit semite ire sue, non pepercit a morte animarum eorum, and iumenta
eorum in monte conclu^t.

Et percussit omne primogenitum in terra Egypti, primitias omnis laboris eorum
in tabernaculis Cham.

Et abstulit sicut oues populum suum, et perduxit eos tanquam gregem in deserto.

Et deduxit eos in spe, et non timueru^t, and inimicos eorum operuit mare.

Et eduxit eos in montem sanctificationis sue, montem quem acquisiuit dextera
eius.

Et eiecit a facie eoru^ ge^tes, et sort dimisit eis terram in funiculo
distributionis.

Et habitare fecit in tabernaculis eorum tribus Israel.

Et tentaueru^t and exacerbauerunt deum excelsum, and testimonia eius non
custodierunt.

Et auerterunt se, et non seruauerunt pactum que^admodum patres eorum, co^uersi
sunt in a^cum prauum.

In iram concitauerunt eum in collibus suis, and in sculptilibus suis ad
emulationem eum pro^ocauerunt.

^udiuit dens and spreuit eos, and ad mihilum redegit valde Israel.

Et repulit tabernaculu^ Sylo, tabernaculum suu^ vbi habitauit in hoibus.

Et tradidit in captiuitatem virtute^ eorum, and pulchritudinem eorum in manus
inimici.

Et co^clusit in gladio populum suum, and hereditate^ suam spreuit.

^uuenes eorum comedit ignis, and virgins eorum non sunt lamentate.

Sacerdotes eoru^ in gladio cecideru^t, and vidue eorum non plorabantur.

Et excitatus est tanqua^ dormiens dominus, tanquam potens crapulatus a vino.

Et percussit inimicos suos i^ posteriora, opprobriu^ sempiternum dedit illis.

Et repulit tabernaculu^ Joseph, and tribu^ Ephraim non elegit.

(...) elegit tribum Iuba, montem Sion quem dilexit.

Et edificauit sicut vnicornis sanctificium suum, in terra quam fundauit in
secul^.

Et elegit David seruum suum, and sustulit eu^ de gregibus ouium, de post
feta^tes accepit eum.

Pascere Jacob seruum suum, and Israel hereditatem suam.

Et pauit eos in innocentia cordis sui, and in intellebus manuum suarum deduxit
eos.

(...)
DEus venerunt gentes in hereditatem tuam, polluerunt templu^ sanctum tuum,
posuerunt Jerusalem in pomorum custodiam.

Posuerunt morticina seruorum tuorum escas volatilibus celi, carnes sanctorum
tuorum bestiis terre.

^ffuderunt sanguinem ipsorum tanquam aquam in circuitu Jerusalem, and non
erat qui sepeliret.

^acti sumus opprobrium vicinis nostris, subsannacio and illusio his qui in
circuitu nostro sunt.

^squequo domine irasceris? in finem? accendetur velut ignis zelus tuus?

Effunde iram tua^ in gentes que te non nouerunt, and in regna que nomen tuum
non innocauerunt.

Quia comederu^t Jacob, et locum eius desolauerunt.

^e memineris iniquitatum nostrarum antiquarum, cito anticipent nos
misericordie tue, quia pauperes facti sumus nimis.

Adiuua nos deus salutaris noster, and propter gloriam nominis tui domine
libera nos, et propitius esto peccatis nostris propter nomen tuum.

^e forte dicant in gentibus: vbi est deus eorum? and innotescat in nationibus
coram oculis nostris:

^ltio sanguinis seruoru^ tuorum qui effusus est: introeat in conspectu tuo
gemitus compeditorum.

Secundum magnitudine^ brachij tui posside filios mortificatorum.

Et read vicinis nostris septuplum in sinu eorum improperium eorum quod
exprobauerunt tibi domine.

^os autem populus tuus and oues pascue tue confitebimur tibi in seculu^.

In generatione and generationem annu^ciabimus laudem tuam.

Dn^e deus virtutu^, quousque irasceris super orationem serui tui?

^ibabis nos pane lachrimarum, and potum dabis nobis in lachrimis in mensura.

Posuisti nos in contradictionem vicinis nostris, and inimici nostri
subsannauerunt nos.

Deus virtutu^ convert nos, and ostende facie^ tuam, and salui erimus.

^ineam de Egypto transtulisti, eiecisti gentes, and plantasti eam.

^ux itineris fuisti in co^spectu eius, and plantasti radices eius, and
impleuit terram.

Operuit montes vmbra eius, et arbusta eius cedros dei.

Extendit palmites suos vsque ad mare, and vsque ad flumen propagines eius.

Vt quid destruxisti mace riam eius? and vindemiant eam omnes qui pretergre
diuntur viam.

Exterminauit eam aper de sylua, and singularis fe^us depastus est eam.

Deus virtutum conuertere, respice de celo et vide, and visita vineam ista^.

Et perfice eam quam pla^tauit dextera tua, and super filium hominis quem
confirmasti ribi.

Incensa igni and su^fossa: ab increpatione vultus tui peribunt.

Exultate deo adiutori nostro, iubilate deo Jacob.

Sumite psalmum, and date tympanum, psalteriu^ incundum cum cithara.

Buccinate in neomenia tuba, in insigni die solennitatis vestre.

Hestimonium in Joseph posuit illud cum exiret de terra Egypti: lingua^ quam

Diuertit ab oneribus dorsum eius, manus eius in cophino seruierunt.

In tribulatione inuocasti me, and liberaui te, exa^ d^^ te in abscondito

Audi populus meus et contestabor te: Israel si me audieris, non erit in te

Ego enim sum dominus deus tuus, qui eduxi te deterra Egipti: dilata os tuum,
and implebo illud.

Et non audiuit populus meus vocem meam, and Israel non intendit mihi.

Et dimisi eos secundum desideria cordis eorum, ibunt in adinuentionibus suis.

Si populus meus audisset me, Israel si in vijs meis ambulasset:

^ro nihilo forsitan inimicos eorum humiliassem, and super tribulantes eos

^nimici domini mentiti sunt ei, and erit tempus eorum in secula.

Et custodia in nocte: que pro nihilo habentur eoru^ anni erunt.

Mane sicut herba transeat, mane floreat and transeat, vespere decidat, induret

Quoniam ipse liberauit me de laqueo venantium, and a verbo aspero.

Scapulis suis obumbrabit tibi, and sub pemus eius sperabis.

Scuto circundabit te veritas eius, non timebis a timore nocturno.

A sagitta volante in die a negotio perambulante in tenebris, ab incursu and
demonio meridiano.

Cadent a latere tuo mill, and dece^ milia a dextris tuis, ad te autem non

Veru^tame^ oculis tuis co^ siderabis, and retributione^ peccatorum videbis.

Quoniam tu es domine spes mea, altissimum posuisti refugium tuum.

Non accedet ad te malu^, and flagellum non appropin quabit tabernaculo tuo.

Quoniam angelis suis mandauit de te, vt custodi ant te in omnibus vijs tuis.

In manibus portabu^t te ne forte offendas ad lapidem pedem tuum.

Super aspidem and basiliscum ambulabis, et conculcabis leonen et draconem.

Populum tuum domine humiliauerunt, and hereditatem tuam vexauerunt.

Miduam and aduenam interfecerunt, and pupillos occiderunt.

Et dixerunt: no^ videbit dominus, nec intelliget deus Jacob.

Intelligite insipientes in populo, and stulti aliqua^do sapite.

Beatus homo que^ tu erudieris dn^e, et de lege tua docueris eum.

Et effuderunt sanguine^ innocentem, sanguinem filiorum suorum and filiaru^
suarum, quas sacrificauerunt sculptilibus Chanaam.

Et interfecta est terra in sanguinibus, and contaminata est in operibus eorum,
and fornicati sunt in adinue^tionibus suis.

Et iratus est furore dominus in populum suum, and abhominatus est hereditatem
suam.

Et tradidit eos in manus gentium, and dominati sunt eorum qui oderunt eos.

Et tribulaueru^t eos inimici eorum, et humiliati sunt sub manibus eorum.

Sepe liberauit eos, ipsi autem exacerbaueru^t eu^ in consilio suo, and
humiliati sunt in iniquitatibus suis.

Et vidit cum tribularentur, and audiuit orationem eorum.

Et memor fuit testamenti sui, and penituit eum secundum multitudinem
misericordie sue.

Et dedit eos in misericordias, in conspectu oim qui ceperant eos.

Saluos fac nos domine deus noster, and congrega nos de nationibus.

Vt confiteamur nomini sancto tuo, and gloriemur in laud tua.

Benedictus dominus deus Israel a seculo and vsque in seculum, and dicet omnis
populus: fiat, fiat.

Confiremini domine quoniam bonus, quo niam in seculum misericordia eius.

Dicant qui redempti su^t a domino, quos redemit de manu inimicorum: de
regionibus congregauit eos.

A solis ortu and occasu, ab aquilone and mari.

Errauerunt in solitudine, in inaquoso, viam ciuitatis habitaculi non

Esurientes and sitientes, anima eorum in ip^is defecit.

Et clamauerunt ad dominum cum tribularentur, et de necessitatibus eoru^
^ripuit eos.

Et deduxit eos in viam rectam, vt irent in ciuitatem habitationis.

Confitea^tur domino misericordie eius, and mirabilia eius filijs hominum.

Quia satiauit animam inanem, and animam esurientem satiauit bonis.

Sedentes in tenebris and vmbra mortis, vinetos in mendicitate and ferro.

Quia exacerbaueru^t eloquia dei, and consilium altissimi irritauerunt.

Et humiliatum est in laboribus cor eorum, and infirmati sunt, nec fuit qui

Et clamauerunt ad dominum cum tribularentur, et de necessitatibus eoru^

Et eduxit eos de tenebris and vmbra mortis, et vincula eorum dirupit.

Confitea^tur domino misericordie eius, and mirabilia eius filiis hominum.

Quia contriuit portas ereas, and vectes ferreos confregit.

Suscepit eos de via iniquitatis eorum: propte^ iniusticias etenim suas

Omne^ escam abhominata est anima eorum: and appropinquauerunt vsque ad portas
mortis.

^t clamauerunt ad domi^um cum tribularentur, and de necessitatibus eorum
liberauit eos.

^isit verbum suum, and sanauit eos, and eripuit eos de interitionibus eorum.

Confiteantur domino misericordie eius, and mirabilia eius filijs hominum.

Et sacrificent sacrificiu^ laudis, and annuncient opera eius in exultatione.

Qui descendunt mare in nauibus, facientes operationem in aquis multis.

Ipsi viderunt opera domini, and mirabilia eius in profundo.

Dixit, and stetit spiritus procelle, and exaltati sunt fluctus eius.

Ascendunt vsque ad celos and descendunt vsque ad abissos, anima eoru^ in malis
tabescebat.

Turbati sunt and moti su^t sicut ebrius, and omnis sapientia eorum deuorata
est.

Et clamauerunt ad dominum cum tribularentur, and de necessitatibus eoru^
eduxit eos.

^t statuit procella^ eius in auram, and siluerunt fluctus eius.

Et letati sunt quia filuerunt, and deduxit eos in portum voluntatis eorum.

Confiteantur domino n^^sericordie eius, and mirabilia eius filijs hominum.

Et exaltent eum in ecclesia plebis, and in cathedra semorum laudent eum.

Posuit flumina in desertum, and exitus aquarum insitim.

^erram fructifera^ in salsuginem a malicia habitantium in ea.

Posuit desertum in stagna aquarum, et terram sine aqua in exitus aquarum.

Et collocauit illic esurientes, and constituerunt ciuitatem habitationis.

Et seminauerunt agros and plantauerunt vineas, and fecerunt fructum
natiuitatis.

Et benedixit eis, and multiplicati sunt nimis, and iumenta eorum non minorauit.

Et pauci facti sunt, and vexati sunt a tribulacione malorum et dolor.

Effusa est conte^tio super principes, and errare fecit eos in inuio and no^ in

Et adiuuit pauperem de inopia, and posuit sicut ones familias.

Videbunt recti and letabu^tur, and omnis iniquitas opilabit os suum.

^uis sapie^s and custodiet hec, and intelliget misericordias domini.

PAratum cor meum deus, paratu^ cor meum, cantabo and psallam in gloria mea.

Quia magna est super celos misericordia tua, et vsque ad nubes veritas tua.

Exultare super celos deus, and super omnem terra^ gloria tua.

Et libere^tur dilecti tui: saluum fac dextera tua and exaudi me.

Deus loquutus est in sancto suo: Exultabo and diuidam Sichimam, and conuallem

Deus est Balaad, and meus est Manasses, and Ephraim susceptio capitis mei.

Judah rex meus: Moab lebes spei mei.

In Idumeam extendam calciamentum meum: mihi alienigene amie^ facti sunt.

Quis deducet me in ciuitatem munitam? quis deducet me vsque in Idumeam.

Son tu deus qui repulisti nos? et non exibis deus in virtutibus nostris?

DEus laudem meam ne tacueris, qui os peccatoris and os dolosi super me apertum

Loquuti sunt aduersum me lingua dolosa, and sermonibus odij circunderunt me,

Pro eo vt me diligerent detrahebant mihi, ego autem orabam.

Et posuerunt aduersum me mala pro bonis, and odiu^ pro dilectione mea.

Co^stitue super eum peccatorem, and diabolus steta dextris eius.

Cum iudicatur, exeat co^demnatus, and oration eius fiat in peccatum:

Fiant dies eius pauci, and episcopatum eius accipiat alter.

Fiant filij eius orphani et vxor eius vidua.

Nutantes transfera^tur filij eius, et mendicent, eijciantur de habitationibus
suis.

Scrutetur fenerator omnem substantiam eius, et diripiant alieni labores eius.

Non sit illi adiutor, nec sit qui misereatur pupillis eius.

Fiant nati eius in interitum, in ganeratione vna deleatur nomen eius.

In memoriam redeat iniquitas patrum eius in co^spectu domini, and peccatum
matris eius non deleatur.

Fiant contra dn^m semper, et dispereat de terra memoria eorum, pro eo quoth nou

Et persequutus est hominem inopem and me^dicum, et compunctum cord,

Et indu^t maledictionem sicut vestime^tum: and intrauit sicut aqua in

^olite confidere in principibus, in filiis hominu^ in quibus non est salus.

^xibit spiritus eius, erreuertetur in terram suam: in illa die per omnes
cogitationes eorum.

^eatus, cui^s deus Jacob adiutor eius: spes eius in domino deo ipsius, qui
fecit celum and terram, mate and omnia ^ in eis sunt.

Qui custodit veritate^ in se culum, facit indiciu^ iniuriam parie^tibus, dat
esca^ esurientibus.

Domi nus soluir compeditos, dominus illuminat cecos.

Dominus erigit elisos, dominus diligit iustos.

Dominus custodit aduenas, pupillum and viduam suscipiet, and vias peccatorum
disperdet.

Regnabit dominus in seculum, deus tuus Sion in omni generatione et
generationem.

Halleluya.

Psalmus.cxl^^.
LAudate dominum, quoniam bonus est psalmus deo nostro: sit in cunda decoraque
laudatio.

Edificans Jerusalem dominus, dispersiones Israel congregabit.

Qui sanat contritos cord, and alligat contritiones eorum.

Qui numeratmultitudinem stella^um, and omnibus eis nomina vocans.

Magnus dominus noster et magna virtus euis, et sapientie eius non est numerus.

Suscipiens mansuetos dominus: humilians au^t pecoatores vsque ad terra^.

Preciuite domino iu co^fessione, psallite deo nostro in cithara.

Qui operit celum nubibus, et parat terre pluuiam,

Qui producit in montibus fenum, and herbam seruituti hominum.

Qui dat iume^tis escam ipsoru^, and pullis coruorum innocantibus eum.

Non in fortitudine equi voluntatem habebit, nec in tibijs viri beneplacitum
erit ei.

Beneplacitu^ est domino super timentes eum, and in eis qui sperant super
misericordia eius.

Halleluya.

BLessed is ye man, that has not gone in the cou^saill of the ungodly, and
has not stand in the way of sinners, and has not sit in the chair of

^ut his delight is in the law of the lord, and in his law will he exercise
him self day and night.

And he shall be as a tree yt is planted by ye ryuers of waters, which shall yield
his fruit in his due time.

And his leaf shall not fall away, and all things whatsoever he shall take
in hand shall prospere.

So shall not ye ungodly do, they shall not do so: but they shall be even as the
dust which the wind dryueth from of the earth.

Therefore do not ye ungodly stand up in judgment, nether sinners in the
cou^saill of the ryghteous.

For the lord knows ye way of the ryghteous, and the way of the ungodly

The (...) Psalm*
THy have the heythen raged, and the people ymagined vain things.

The kings of the earth stand up, and princes are assembled together against
ye lord and against his Christ.

^et us break up their bonds, and cast away their yoke from us.

^e that dwells in heaven, shall laugh them to scorn, and the lord shall

THe God of my ryghteousnes heard me, when I called upon him: In my trouble

and be ye sure, that the Lord has dealt wonderfully with his saint: the

^et them fall from their own ymaginacions, expel thou them according to the
multitude of their vngodlynesses, for ye o lord have they provoked unto anger.

and let all them rejoice yt put their trust in ye: they shall be glad for

The.vi. Psalm.
Lord, rebuke not me in thy heuye indignacyon, nether chasten thou me in thy

^y soul aso is very sore troubled, but Lord how long?

Turn the O Lord, and deliver my soul: save thou me for thy mercyes sake.

For in death there is no man myndfull of thae: who will give thanks unto
thae in hell?

I have labored in my groaning: every night will I wash my bed: with my
tears will I water my couche.

^yne eye is troubled for very inward grefe: I am consumed away among al
mine enemies.

^ way from me al ye that work iniquite, for the Lord has herd the voice
of my weeping.

The Lord has heard mine humble peticio^, the Lord has received my prayer.

Let all mine enemies be confounded and vered sore, let them be converted and

The.vii. Psalm.
O my Lord God, in thae have I put my trust: save thou me and deliver me from
all them that persecute me.

Lest at any time he devour my soul as a lyo^, while there is none to deliver
ner to save me.

O Lord my God if I have done this thing, if there be unrighteous in my

If I have recompensed evil to the^ yt reward me, let me be worthily
discomfyted of mine enemies without any profit.

Let the enemy persecute my soul, let him take and tread down my life in the

^ryse Lord in thy wrath, and set up thy self in the coasts of mine enemies.

And stand up O Lord my God in the commandment that thou have given, and

For ye same co^gregacio^s sake al so set up thy self on hye again: The Lord
judges the people.

Judge me O Lord after my ryghteousnes, and according to mine innocence upon

The wickedness of sinners shall be consumed: and thou O God (that searchest the

My sure help comes of the Lord, which saves the^ that are true of heart.

God is a righteous judge, mighty and pacient: will he be wroth for ever?

Except ye turn, he has whet his swearde, his bow has he bent, and made it
ready.

and in it has he prepared the instruments of death, his arowes has he

O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all ye earth. For thy glory is
extolled above the heavens.

^ut of ye mouth of babes and suclinges have you ordained praise, because of
thine enemies, yt thou may destroy ye enemy and aue^ger.

For I will consider the heue^s ye works of thy fyngers, ye Moan and stars
which thou have made.

That is man yt thou art mind full of him: or the son of man that thou
visitest him?

Thou made him somewhat inferior the^ the angels: with glory and honor
have thou crowned him, and set him above the works of thy hands.

All things have thou subdued under his fete, al sheep and oxen, ye and the
beasts of the field.

^he birds of the air and fysshes of the sea, which walk through the paths
of the sea.

O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all ye earth?

(...).
I Will give thanks unto y^ O Lord in my whole heart I will tell al thy
wonderful works.

I will be glad and rejoice in thae thy name will I praise, O thou most highest.

In turning mine enemy aback: they shall be discomfyted and peryshe out of thy
presence.

For you have maintened my right and my cause, thou art set upon ye trone that
iudgest ryghteously.

Thou have rebuked ye Heythe^ and ye ungodly is destroid, their name have you
abolyshed for ever and ever.

The swerdes of the enemy have failed at the last, and their cities have thou
destroyed.

The memorial of them perished with a sound, and the Lord endures for ever.

He has prepared his trone in judgment, and he shall judge the co^pase of ye
earth in equite, ye people shall he judge in righteousness.

And the Lord is become a refuge unto the poor, and helper at due seasons in
trouble.

And let them that know thy name, put their trust in ye, for thou have not
forsaken them that seek the O Lord.

^rayse the Lord which dwells in Sion, show among the nacyons what things
he goes about.

For in making inquysicyo^ for their blood, he has remembered them, he has
not forgotten the complaynt of the poor.

^aue mercy on me O Lord, consider my low estate from among mine enemies.

^hou that lyftest me up from the gates of death, ye I should show all thy
praises in the gates of y^ daughter Sion.

I will rejoice i^ thy saluacyo^: the heythen stick fast in ye destruction yt
they them selves have p^pared.

In the same snare which they hyd, is their own foot taken.

The lord shall be known in executynge judgment: The sinner is taken in the
works of his own hands.

^ et the sinners be turned back unto hell, even all heythen that forget god.

^or the poor shall not be out of mind at the last, the pacient abiding of
the poor shall not peryshe for ever.

(...) lord, let no man prevail: let the heythen be judged in thy sight.

O lord, set a lawemynister over them, ye the heythen may know them selves
to be but men.

Thy art thou gone so far of, o lord? Thou, regardest us not in trouble,
when it were hye time to help.

^hyle ye ungodly is aloft, the poor man is brent: They are taken even in the
counsails yt they ymagen upon.

^or the sinner is commended in the lusts of his own soul, and the
unrighteous man is well spoken of.

^he sinner has provoked the lord: his malice is so great, that he will not
seek after him.

God is not in his sight, his ways are defiled at all seaso^s.

^hy judgments are removed out of his sight, he wylbe Lord of all his
enemies.

For he has said in his heart: I will not be stered from generacio^ to
generation without harm.

those mouth is full of cursynge, and bitterness and disceate: under his tongue
is travail and sorrow.

^e sits preuely layenge wait with the rich, that he may put the innocent
to death.

^ys eyes are set upon the poor: he lurketh preuely, eue^ as it were a lion in
his den.

^e lays wait to rauyshe the poor, even to rauyshe the poor while he may
get him.

In his snare will he keep him low, he will bow down him self, and fall
when he has dominyon of the poor.

^or he has said in his heart: God has forgotten, he turns his face away,
lest he should se it at the last.

^to^de up o Lord God, and let thy hand be exalted, lest you forget ye pore

^hy has ye ungodly provoked god unto wrath? For he has said in his heart:
he will not care for it.

This thou seyst, for thou considrest travail and sorrow, that thou may
bring them in to thine own hands.

The poor is left unto the, thou wylt be an helper to the fatherless.

^reake thou the arm of the sinner and ungodly: his sin shall be sought out,
and he shall not be found.

The Lord shall reygne for ever and world without end: ye heythen shall
peryshe out of his land.

The Lord has heard the desire of the poor, thine ear has heard even the
preparacyon of their heart.

^o give judgment with the fatherles and poor, that man take not upon him any
more to magnifye him self upon earth.

(...)
IN the Lord put I my trust: how say ye then to my soul, Take thy flight as
a sparowe into the mountain?

^or lo, sinners have bent their bow, their arowes have they prepared in the
quyuer, that they may shote in the dark at those which are true of heart.

For the things that thou have set up, have they destroyed: but what has the
ryghteous done?

The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lords seat is in heaven.

His eyes have respect unto the poor, his eye lyddes mark the children of
men.

The Lord examyneth the righteous and ungodly, who so loves iniquyte, hates
his own soul.

He shall rain snares upon sinners: fire, brymstone, and stormy wyndes shall be
the porcyon of their drink.

^or the Lord is ryghteous, and has loved righteousness: his countenance
has had respect unto equity.

(...)
Save me O Lord, for there is not a saint left: for the truth is wasted from
among the children of men.

They have spoken vain things every man to his neighbor: In their heart and
from the heart have they spoken with disceatfull lyppes.

^he Lord rote out all disceatfull lyppes, and the tongue that speaks proud
things.

Which have said: our tongue will ^e magnify, our lyppes are our own, who is
Lord over us.

For the myserie of the needful, and for the co^playnte of ye poor, I will
now stand up says the Lord.

I will help him, faithfully will I deal with him.

The words of the lord are pure words, they are even silver tried in ye
fire, laid to the earth purifyed seven times.

Thou lord shall save us, and preserve us from this generation for ever.

The ungodly walk on every side: The children of men have you multiplied as hye
as thy self.

The.xii. Psalm.
HOw long wylt thou forget me o lord? for ever? how long turnest thou thy
face away from me.

How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, abiding woo i^ my heart all the
day long?

How long shall mine enemy be exalted above me? Consydre and hear me o lord
my God.

Lyghten thou myneeyes yt I never fall on sleep in death, lest at any time
mine enemy say: I have prevailed against him.

They that trouble me, will be glad if I be cast down: nevertheless I have put
my trust in thy mercy.

My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation: I will sing unto ye lord which has
given me good things, and I will praise the name of the lord the most
highest.

The.xiii. psalm.
THe unwise man has said i^ his heart: there is no god. Corrupt they are, and
become abominable in their minds: there is not one that does good, another is
not one.

The Lord has looked down from heaven upon the children of men to se if there
be any that has understanding or seeks after God.

They are al gone out of ye way together, they are become unprofitable, there
is not one that does good, no there is not one.

^eyr throat is an open sepulcre, with their to^ges have they dealt
disceatfully, ye poisons of addrs is under their lyppes.

Those mouth is full of cursynge and bytternesse, their fete are swyfte to shed
blood.

Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace have
they not known: there is no fear of god before their eyes.

Shall not all they feel it yt work iniquyte, which eat up my people, as it
were a refectio^ of bred?

They have not called upon the lord: Even there have they stombled through
fear, where no fear was.

For the Lord is in the ryghteous generation: ye have blasphemed the counsayll
of ye poor, because the Lord is his hope.

Who shall grant salvation unto Israel out of Sion? When y^ Lord h^th turned
ye captyuite of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

The.xiiii. psalm.
Lord, who shall dwell i^ thy tabernacle, or who shall rest in thy holy mount?

Eue^ he y^ enters in without blemyshe, and works ryghteousnes. that
speaks truth i^ his her^ that has not meddled with disceate in his tongue.

^ether has done his neighbor harm, and has received no slander against
his neighbors.

The wicked is brought to no reputacion in his sight, but he makes much of
the^ yt fear ye lord.

Which swears unto his neighbor, and dysapoynteth him not: Which has not
given his money unto usury, and has taken no rewards over yt innocent.

Who so does these things, shall not be removed for ever.

The.xv. psalm.
^ Reserve me o lord, for I have put my trust in y^. I have said unto ye
lord: you art my God for thou nedest not my goods.

All my delight has he wonderfully set in those his saints, which are in the
earth.

Many are y^ infirmyties of the^ (ye) have made hayst after other.

Their bloudye congregacyons will not I gather together, nether will I make
mention of their names out at my lyppes.

The lord is ye portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: Thou art he yt
shall restore mine inheritance to me again.

The lines are fallen unto me in goodly places, for mine inheritance is
excellent unto me.

I will praise the lord yt has given me understanding: my reins also have
rebuked me eue^ until the night.

Before hand saw I the lord allwaye before me, for he is on my right hand
lest I should be removed.

Therefore was my heart glad, and my tongue reioysed: my flesh also shall rest in
hope.

For you shall not leave my soul in hell, nether shall thou suffer thy holy one
to se corrupcyon.

Thou have declared unto me the ways of life, thou shall make me full of
gladness with thy countenance: at thy right hand are pleasures for evermore.

The.xvi. psalm.
Hear my ryghteousnes O Lord, considre thou mine humble peticion.

Pondre with thine ears my prayer (which I make) not in disceatfull lyppes.

Let my sentence proceed from thy countenance, let thine eyes have respect
unto equity.

Thou have proved my heart, and visited me in the night: thou have tried me with
fire, and there is no iniquyte found in me.

In so much that my mouth talks not of y^ works of men: for the words sak^
of thy lyppes I have observed hard ways.

Order you my goynges in thy paths, yt my steps be not moved.

I have cried, because thou have heard me: enclyne thine ear unto me O God,
and hear my words.

Show they wonderful mercies, thou that sauest the^ which put their trust in
the.

Preserve thou me even (as the apple of thine eye) from the^ that resyste thy
right hand.

Defend me under the shadow of thy wings, from the sight of the ungodly that
have vexed me.

Mine enemies have compaced my soul round about: their own fat have they
mainteyned, their mouth has spoken proudly.

They have expeled me now, and are come round about me: they are appointed to
cast down their eyes unto the ground.

As a Lion ready unto the pray have they caught me, and as a lions whelpe
lurkynge secretly.

Up Lord, preuente him, and overthrow him: deliver thou my soul from ye
ungodly, thine own soul from the enemies of thy hand.

Lord from a few of ye earth divide y^ the^ in their life: ye their belly is
filled with thy treasures.

They are full of children, and ye rest of their goods have they distributed
unto their babes.

But I will appear in righteousness before thy p^se^ce: wha^ thy glory
appears, I shall be satisfied.

The.xvii. Psalm.
I will love the O Lord my strength: the Lord is my succor, my refuge also
and my deliverer.

My God, my helper, and I will put my trust in him.

My protector, and horn of my salvation, and my defender.

I will praise the Lord and call upon him, and I shall be safe fro mine enemies.

The sorrows of death co^paced me, and the brokes of iniquyte put me to trouble.

The pains of hell came about me, y^ snares of death took hold upon me.

In my trouble I called upon the Lord, and co^playned unto my God,

And he heard my voice out of his holy temple, and my co^playnte before him
entered into his ears.

The earth tre^bled and quaked, ye fou^dacio^s of ye mountains were moved and
shaken, because he was wroth with them.

The smoke went up i^ his wrath, and at his presence the fire brent, coals
were kyndled at it.

He bowed ye heavens, and came down and it was dark under his fete.

He gat him up also upon ye Cherubins, and did fly: he did fly upon the
wings of the wyndes.

And he made darkness his pauilio^ round about him: his tent was dark water i^
ye clouds of ye air.

For brightness at his presence the clouds departed, so did the hayle and
coals of fire.

The Lord also tho^dred out of ye heaven, and ye most highest gave his noise:
there was hayle stones and coals of fire.

And he sent out his arowes, and scatred the^* he increased the lightenynges,
and vexed them.

The springes of the waters appeared also, and the foundacio^s of y^ round
world were discoured.

At thy rebukinge O Lord, even at the blasting of the breath of thy displeasure.

He sent from above and received me, and took me out of many waters.

He delivered me fro my strongest enemies, and from the^ that hated me, for
they vere to mighty for me.

They prevented me in the day of my trouble, and the Lord becam my defender.

He brought me forth also in to liberty: he saved me, because he had a mind
to me.

And the Lord shall reward me after my righteousness, ye even according to
the elennesse of my hands shall he recompense me.

Because I have observed the ways of ye Lord, and have not behaved my self
wickedly against my God.

For all his judgments have I had in my sight, and his righteousnesses have I
not cast out fro me.

^ndefyled also will I be in his sight, and keep my self from mine own iniquite.

And y^ Lord shall reward me according to my righteousness, and after the
cle^nesse of my hands in his eye sight.

With ye holy you shall be holy, and with y^ innocent man you shall be innocent.

With the elect also thou shall be elect, and with the froward thou shall
deal roughly.

For thou shall save the humble people, and the looks of the proud shall thou
bring down.

For you lyghtest my ca^dle o Lord, lyghte^ you my darkness of my god.

For in the shall I be delivered from tentacion, and in my God shall I leap
over the wall.

He is my God whose way is undefiled: The words of ye lord are tried in ye
fire: he is ye defendour of all the^ that trust in him.

For who is god but y^ Lord? or who is God, but only our god?

It is God yt has gyrded me with stre^ght, and made my way undefiled

Which has made my fete sure as y^ fete of hertes, and set me on hye

Which instructs my hands to the battayll, and as a stele bow have thou
made mine arms.

Thou have given me also the defense of thy salvation, and thy right hand has
taken me up.

And thy instruction has reformed me at the last, ye thine instruction, that
shall teach me.

Thou have enlarged my goinges under me, and my footsteps have not failed.

I will follow upon mine enemies and overtake the^, and I will not turn again
till they be discomfyted.

I will al to beat them, they shall not be able to stand, they shall fall
under my fete.

^hou have gyrded me also with strength to the war, and the^ yt rose up
against me haste thou thrown down under me.

Thou have made mine enemies also turn their backs upon me. and the^ that
hated me have thou destroyed.

They cried, but there was none to help them: ye even unto the Lord, but he
heard them not.

And I will beat them as small as dust before the wind, even as the claye of
the streets will I cast them out.

Thou shall deliver me from the sedicio^s of the people, thou shalt make me
head of the heythen.

^ people whom I knew not, has served me, eue^ in y^ hearing of the ear
have they obeyed me.

The strange children have dissembled with me, the strange children are waxen
old, and are gone halting out of thy paths.

The Lord lives, and blessed be my God, and praised be the God of my
salvation.

It is thou O God that au^gest my quarrel, and subduest the people under me:
thou art the delyuerer of me fro my cruel enemies.

And thou shall lift me up from the^ that rise against me, from the wicked man
shall thou deliver me.

Therefore will I give thanks unto the O Lord among the nations and praise
thy name.

Great prosperity gives he unto his king, and shows mercy unto David his
anointed, and unto his sede for evermore.

The.xviii. Psalm*
THe heavens declare ye glory of God, and the firmament shows his handy
works.

One day tells another, and one night certifyeth another.

There are no speches ner la^guages, but their voices are heard among them.

The sound of them is gone out into every country, and their words into the
ends of the world.

In ye su^ne has he set his tabernacle, and he hi^ self is as a brydegro^
coming out of his chamber.

He has taken unto him a courage as a gyaunt to run his course: his going
forth is from the highest heaven.

And his recourse is unto the heygth thereof, nether is there any man that can
hyde him self from the heat of him.

The law of the Lord is undefiled, converting souls: the testimonye of the
Lord is true, geuynge wisdom unto babes.

The statutes of the Lord are right, making glad hertes: ye commandments of
ye Lord is clear geuynge light unto the eyes.

The fear of the Lord is holy, endurynge for ever and ever: the judgments
of ye Lord are true justified of them selves.

They are to be desired above gold and much precious stone, and sweter then
honey and the honye comb.

For thy servant keeps them, and in observing of them there is great reward.

Who can tell the offenses that are done? Cleanse thou me fro my secret
faults, an keep thy servant from strange fynnes.

If they have no dominion of me then shall I be undefiled, and cleansed from the
greatest offense.

And the words of my mouth shall be such as shall be acceptable in thy sight,
and so shall also the medytacion of my heart be evermore.

Lord thou art my helper, and my redemer.

The.xix. Psalm.
THe Lord hear the in the day of trouble, the name of the God of Jacob
defend the.

Send the help from the holy place, and defend the out of Sion.

The Lord be myndful of al thy sacrifyce, and fat be the brent offering.

The Lord grant the thy hearts desire, and confirm all thy counsayll.

We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we shall be made
great.

The Lord perform all thy p^^cyons: now have I perceived, that the Lord
has saved his anointed.

He shall hear him out of his holy heaven: myghtie is the salvation of his
right hand.

Some trust in charettes, and some in horses: but we will make inuocacion in ye
name of the Lord our God.

They are in bondage and fallen but we are risen and set up right.

Lord, save thou the king, and hear us in the day wherein we call upon the.

The.xx. Psalm.
Lord, in thy power shall y^ king rejoice, and upon thy salvation shall he
triumph exceadingly.

Thou have granted him his hertes desire, and have not put him from the
request of his lyppes.

For thou have prevented him in the blessings of swetnesse: thou have set upon
his head a ^owne of precious stone.

He asked life of the, and thou gave him the length of days for ever ad ever.

Great is his glory in thy salvation: honor and great worship shall thou
lay upon him.

For you shall make a very blessing of him for ever: thou shall make him glad
in joy with thy countenance.

For the king puts his trust in the Lord, and in the mercy of the highest
shall he not myscary.

Let thy hand be found among al thine enemies, let thy right hand find out
all them that have hated the.

Thou shall make them as a fire even in the time of thy countenance: the lord
in his wrath shall vex them, and the fire shall consume them.

Thou shall destroy their fruit from the earth, and their sede from among the
children of men.

For they intended myschefe against the: they ymagyned deuyces which they were
not able to perform.

Therefore shall you put them back: in the rest of thine instruments shall thou
prepare for the countenaun^^ of them.

^p lord in thy stre^ght, so will we sing and praise thy powers.

The.xxi, Psalm.
MY God, my God, have respect unto me: why have thou forsaken me? The words
of my trespaces are far fro my health.

My god, shall I call by day time, and thou wylt not hear? And by night, and
that not for any foolyshnesse of mine.

Yet dwell thou in the holy place, thou worship of Israel.

Our fathers hoped in the, they put their trust in the, and thou have
delivered them.

They called upon the, and were saved: they put their trust in the, and were
not confounded.

As for me, I am but a worm, and no man: the very scorn of men, and the out
cast of the people.

All they that have looked upon me, have laughed me to scorn: they talked with
their lyppes, and shoke their head.

He has trusted in the Lord, let him deliver him: let him save him, sith he
has a mind unto him.

For thou art he that have taken me out of the womb, thou haste been my hope
even fro my mothers breasts: I have been left unto the ever sens I was borne.

Thou art my God even fro my mothers womb, O go not thy way fro me.

For trouble is hard at hand, and here is none to help me.

Many calves are come about me fat bulls have closed me in on every side.

They have ope^ed their mouth upon me, eue^ as a rampyng, and roarynge lion.

I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint.

My heart is become like moltyng wax in the mids of my body. My strength is
dried up like a potsherde, and my tongue has cleued to my goomes, and you have
brought me into the dust of death.

For many dogs are come about me: the counsel of the wicked has beseged me.

They pearsed my hands and my fete: they told all my bones.

As for them, they stared and looked upon me: they parted my garments among
them selves, and cast lottes upon my vesture.

But lord, wythdrawe not thou thy help from me: have respect unto my defense.

Deliver my soul from ye sword, O God, and my dearlynge out of the dogs
hand.

Save me from ye lions mouth, and my low estate from the horns of the
vnycornes.

I will declare thy name unto my brethren, even in ye myddest of the
congregacyon will I praise the.

Ye yt fear ye Lord, praise him: magnify him al ye sede of Jacob.

Let all the sede of Israel fear him, for he has not despised ner lightly
regarded the humble peticyon of the poor.

Nether has he turned away his face fro me: and when I called unto him, he
heard me.

I will praise the in the great co^gregacyo^: my vows will I perform in the
sight of them that fear him.

The poor shall eat and be satisfied: and they shall praise the Lord that
seek after him, their hertes shall live for ever.

All the ends of the earth shall remember themselves, and be converted unto
the Lord.

And all ye kynreds of ye heythen shall worship in his sight.

For the kingdom is ye Lords, and he shall have dominion of the heythen.

All the welthye men of ye earth have eaten and worshypped: all they that go
down into ye earth shall fall in his sight.

My soul also shall live unto him, and my sede shall serve him.

The generacyo^ for to come shall be showed unto the Lord, and the heavens
shall declare his ryghteousnes to a people that shall be borne, whom ye Lord
has made.

The.xxii. Psalm.
THe Lord governs me, and I shall lack nothing: in a place of pasture even
there has he set me.

Upon ye water of refection has he norished me, my soul has he converted.

He has led me forth upon the paths of ryghteousnes, even for his own name
sake.

For though I walk i^ y^ mids of the shadow of death, I will fear no
evil, for you art with me.

^hy rod and thy staff, those have comforted me.

Thou have prepared a table before me, against them that trouble me.

Thou have soupled my head in oil: my cup also is full and exceadynge fair.

And thy mercy shall go with me all the days of my life.

That I also may dwell in the house of the Lord long and many days.

The.xxiii. Psalm.
THe earth is the Lords and all that therein is, the co^pase of the world and
all they that dwell therein.

For he has grounded it upon the sees, and upon the floudes has he builded it.

Who shall go up into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy
place?

Even he yt has innocent hands and a pure heart, which has not received his
soul i^ vain, ner sworn unto his neighbor in disceate.

He shall receive blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his sauyoure.

This is the generation of them that seek him, even of them that seek the face
of ye God of Jacob.

Open your gates ye princes, and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors, and ye
king of glory shall enter in.

Who is this king of glory? It is the strong and mighty lord, the lord
mighty in battayll.

Open your gate ye princes, and be ye lift up ye eternal doors, and the king
of glory shall enter in.

Who is this king of glory? Even the lord of powers, he is the king of
glory.

The.xxiiii. Psalm.
Unto the O Lord, have I lift up my soul, my God I trust in the, let me not
be ashamed.

^ether let mine enemies laugh me to scorn, for all they that hope in the,
shall not be confounded.

Let all such be confounded as take wicked things in h^nde, and that in vain.

Show me thy ways O Lord, and teach me perfectly thy paths.

Lead me in thy truth and teach me, for you art God my sauyoure, and in the
have I hoped all the day long.

^all to remembrance O Lord thy tender mercyes, and thy loving kyndnesses
which have been ever of old.

Remember not thou the faults of my youth, and mine ignorau^ces.

According to thy mercy think upon me O Lord, for thy goodness sake.

The Lord is sweet and just, therefore will he give a law unto the^ that
trespace in the way.

Them that are gentle herted, will he order right in judgment, he will teach
the meke his ways.

All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth, to them that seek after his
covenant and his testimonye.

For thy names sake O Lord you shall be merciful unto my sin, for it is
much.

That man is he that fears ye Lord him does he teach in the way which he
has chosen.

His soul shall dwell in good things, and his sede shall inheret theerthe.

The Lord is a sure stay for them that fear him, and his testamente shall be
declared unto them.

Mine eyes are allwaye lokynge unto the Lord, for he shall pluck my fete out
of the snare.

Have respect unto me and pytie me, for I am desolate and poor.

The troubles of my heart are increased, deliver thou me out of my necessites.

Consydre my low estate and travail, and forgive me all my trespaces.

Look upon mine enemies, for they are increased, and with a cruel hate have
they hated me.

Preserve you my soul, and deliver me: let me not be confounded, for my trust

For thy mercy is before mine eyes, and my delight is in thy truth.

I have not sytt with the cou^sail of vanyte, nether will I enter in with them
that take wicked things in hand.

I have hated the congregacyon of the wicked and with the ungodly will not I
sytt.

I will wash my hands among innocents, and go round about thine altar, O
Lord.

That I may hear the voice of praise, and tell of al thy wonderful works.

Lord, I have loved the bewtye of thy house, and the place of the habitacion of
thy glory.

O God, destroy not you my soul with the ungodly, ner my life with the men of
blood.

In whose hands are vnrighteousnesses, their right hand is filled with
rewards.

But as for me, I have walked in mine innocencye, deliver thou me, and have
mercy on me.

For my foot has sto^de right: I will praise the (O Lord) in the

Ila battayl! be pytched against me, my trust shall be in him.

One peticyon have I desired of the Lord, the same will I require: that I may
dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.

That I may se the pleasure of the Lord, and visyte his temple.

For in the day of aduersyte he hyd me in his tabernacle: even in the secret
place of his tabernacle has he defended me.

In a stonye rock has he set me up, and now has he lift up my head above
mine enemies.

I have gone about and offered in his tabernacle the sacrifyce of
thankesgeuynge: I will sing and praise the Lord.

Hear my voice (o Lord) wherewith I have cried unto the: have mercy upon me and
hear me.

My heart has spoken unto the: my face has sought the: thy face O Lord will I

Turn not thou thy face away fro me, and depart not in displeasure from thy
servant.

Thou art my helper, forsake me not, nether despys me O God my savior.

For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord has taken me up.

Teach thou me O Lord in thy way, and be thou my gyde in the right pathe

Give them according to their works, and according to the wickedness of
their own inue^cio^s.

Recompense them according to the works of their hands, pay them their
reward.

For they have had no regard unto the works of the Lord, ner toward the
works of his hands: thou shall destroy them, and not build them up.

^lessed be the Lord, for he has heard the voice of mine humble peticyon.

^he Lord is my helper and my defendoure: my heart also trusted in him, and I

He also shall hew the^ in pieces as a calfe of Libanus, and the beloved shall be
as a young unicorn.

It is the voice of the Lord, that deuydeth the flamme of the fire: even the
voice of the Lord that shakes the wilderness, and the Lord shall shake the
wilderness of Cades.

It is the voice, even of that Lord which has ordained the wild hearts, and

among them that go down into the pytte.

^rayse the Lord al ye his saints, and give thanks for a memoryall of his
holiness.

For in his indignacion there is punishment, and life in his good pleasure.

^epynge shall continue in the evening, and in the morning there shall be
gladness.

As for me, I said in my wealth: I shall never be removed.

Thou Lord of thy good will gave strength unto my bewtye.

Thou turnedste thy face away fro me, and I was vexed.

Unto the O Lord will I cry and unto my God will I make mine humble peticion.

large rowme.

^aue mercy on me O Lord, for I am troubled: mine eye is vexed in displeasure,
so is my soul and my body.

For my life is waisted away in sorrow, and my years in gro^ynges.

My strength is weakened i poverty, and my bones are disquieted.

Above all mine enemies I am become an exceadynge rebuke unto my neghboures,
and a fearfulnes to mine acquayntaunce.

They that saw me, fled out from: and I am clean forgotten: even in manner
dead out of mind.

I am become like a broken vessel for I have herd the blasphemy of many that
dwell on every side.

While they assembled together against me, they were minded to take away my
soul.

But my trust have I set in ye O Lord: I have said thou art my God, my lottes
are in thy hands.

Deliver thou me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute
me.

Show ye light of thy cou^tenau^ce upon thy servant, save me in thy mercy O
Lord, let me not be co^fou^ded, for I have called upon ye?

Thou shall hyde the^ in the preuy place of thy presence, from the vexacion of
men.

In thine own tabernacle shall thou defend them, from the stryuynge of tongues.

Blessed be the Lord, for he has wonderfully showed his mercy unto me in a
strong fenced city.

I said in ye excess of my mind I am cast out from the sight of of thine
eyes.

Therefore have thou heard the voice of my prayer, while I cried unto the.

O love the Lord al ye his saints, for the Lord will require ye truth, and
plenteously reward them that be proud doers.

The.xxxi. Psalm.
BLessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.

Blessed is the man, unto whom the Lord has not imputed sin, nether is there
disceat in his sprete.

while the thorn is sharp.

Ishewed my trespace unto the, and hyd not mine unrighteous.

I said: I will confess mine unrighteousness unto the Lord against my
self, and thou forgauest the ungodliness of my sin.

For this shall every saint make his prayer unto the in due season.

^et in the floude of many waters they shall not come nigh unto him.

Thou art my refuge from the trouble that has compassed me: you art my joy,
deliver thou me from them that are come about me.

I will give the understanding, and instruct the in this way wherein thou

The Lord loves mercy and judgment: the earth is full of ye mercy of the
Lord.

By the word of the Lord were the heavens stablyshed, and all the power of
them by the sprete of his mouth.

He gathers the waters together as it were in a bottell, and lays up the
deep in stoare.

^et all the earth fear the Lord, and let all them that dwell in the world
stand in awe of him.

For he spoke ye word, and they were made: he commanded, and they were
created.

The Lord scatreth ye counsaills of the heythen, he condempneth the
ymaginacyons of the people, and dysaloweth the counsaills of princes.

But the cou^saill of the Lord endures for ever, the thoughts of his heart
continue from generacyon to generacyon.

Blessed is the nacyon y^ takes the Lord for their God: that is the people
whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.

The.xxxiiii. psalm.
IVdge them O Lord, yt hurt me: fight thou against the^ that fight against me.

Take thy weapons and shylde, and stand up to help me.

Draw out thy sword, and stop the way against them that persecute me: Say
you unto my soul: I am thy salvation.

Let them be confounded and put to shame, that seek after my soul.

Let them be turned back and put to confusion, that ymagen evil against me.

Let the^ become like ye dust before the wind, and the angel of ye Lord to
keep them in.

Let their ways be darcke and slyppery, and the Angel of the Lord to
persecute them.

For they have hyd their snare to destroy me without a cause: my soul have
they condemned unworthily.

Let a snare come to him that he knows not of, let the trappe also that he
has laid preuely, catch him, and let him fall in to the snare him self.

But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord, and delight in his salvation.

All my bones shall say: Lord, who is like unto the?

Thou delyuerest the desolate from the hand of them that are to strong for
him: the nedye and poor from them that spoil him.

False witnesses standing up, laid things to my charge yt I knew not of.

They rewarded me euel for good to ye great disco^fort of my soul.

But when they were importune upon me, I put on a hayrye clothe.

I humbled my soul in fasting, and my prayer shall turn in to mine own
bosom.

Even as a neighbor and as a brother of ours so did I gently entreat him: as
one that mourns and is heuye, so humbled I my self.

And against me they reioysed and assembled together: plages were gathered upon
me, and I wist it not.

They were scatred abroad, and without any remorce they tempted me: they
laughed me to scorn, and gnasshed upon me with their tethe.

Lord, when wylt thou look upon th^s? O restore my soul from the wickedness
of them: my dear lynge from the lions.

I will give thanks unto the in the great congregacyon: among much people
will I praise the.

O let not them triu^phe over me, that are wrongfully against me: which hate me
without a cause, and wyncke with their eyes.

For verily they spoke peaceably unto me: and in erthly displeasure (while they
talked) they ymagined disceate.

Their mouth also held they wide open upon me. They said: There there, our
eyes have seen it.

This have thou seen O Lord, hold not thou thy tongue: Lord, go not thou
away fro me.

Stand up and labor in my right my God and my Lord for my cause.

Judge thou me after thine own righteousness O Lord my God, and let them not
tryumphe over me.

Let them not say in their hertes: there there, so would we have it. Nether let
them say: we will eat him up.

Let them be confounded and ashamed together, that are glad of my harm.

Let them be clothed with confusion and shame, that speak wicked things upon
me.

Let the^ rejoice and be glad that would my righteousness, and let the^ say all
way: the Lord be praised, that would the wealth of his servant.

My tongue also shall exercise it self in thy righteousness, and thy praise
all the day long.

(...).
^he unrighteous has determined in him self to do amysse: the fear of God is
not before his eyes.

For he has dyssembled in his syghte, so that his inyquyte, may be found
out, and is to be hated.

The words of his mouth are inyquyte and disceate: he has had no mind to
understand to do well.

He has ymagyned myschefe in his bed: he has maynteyned every way that is
not good: but wickedness has he not hated.

Lord, thy mercy is in heaven, and thy truth reaches unto the clouds.

Thy righteousness is as ye mountain of God, thy judgments are a great
deapth.

Men and bestes shall thou preserve O Lord, according as thou O God have
multiplied thy mercy.

But the children of men shall trust in the covering of thy wings.

They shall be filled with ye plenteousnesse of thy house: and out of ye river of
thy felycite shall thou give them drink.

For with the is the fountain of life, and in thy light shall we se light.

Sprede forth thy mercy unto them that know the, and thy ryghteousnes to them
that are true of heart.

Let not the foot of pride overtake me, and let not the hand of a sinner cast
me down.

There are they fallen yt work inyquyte, they are cast out, and shall not be
able to stand.

The.xxxvi. psalm.
^Ret not thy self at the wicked, nether bear thou evil will against the
doers of inyquyte.

For they shall swyftly fade as does the grass, and as the grene herbs shall
they soon fall away.

^ut thou thy trust in the Lord and be doing good, and dwell in the earth, and
thou shall be fed in the riches thereof.

^elyte thou in the Lord, and he shall give the the peticyo^s of thy heart.

show thy way unto the Lord, and trust in him, and he shall take the marter in
hand.

He also shall bring forth thy ryghteousnes as the light, and thy just
dealing as the noone day: Submytte thy self to the Lord, and make thy
prayer unto him.

^ret not thy self at him which has prosperyte, at the man that does
vnryghteously.

^easse thou from wrath, and leave displeasure: be not gelous to do evil.

For they that do wickedly, shall be roted out: but they that patiently abide the
Lord, those shall inheret the earth.

And yet a little while, and the sinner shall be clean gone: thou also shall
seek his place, and shalt not find it.

But the meke hearted shall inheret the earth, and have their pleasure in the
multitude of peace.

The sinner shall wait for the righteous, and gnasshe upon him with his teth.

But the Lord shall laugh him to scorn, for he seyth that his day is
coming.

Sinners have drawn out their swearde, they have bente their bow.

To disceaue the poor and helpelesse, eue^ to slaye the^ that be true of heart.

Let their swearde enter into their own hearts, and let their bow be broken.

Better is a little thing to the ryghteous, then the great riches of sinners.

For the arms of ye sinners shall be all to broken, but the Lord up holds
the ryghteous.

The Lord knows the days of the undefiled, and their enheritaunce shall
endure for ever.

They shall not be confounded in time of aduersyte, and in days of derth they
shall be satisfied: for sinners shall peryshe.

As for the enemies of the Lord, as soon as they are in honor and at the
highest immediately they shall wayst away and consume like smoke.

The sinner shall borowe and not pay, but the ryghteous has pytie and wylbe
lyberall.

For they that bless him, shall inheret the earth: but they that curse him,
shall utterly peryshe.

The Lord will order a just ma^s going, and have pleasure in his way.

Than he falls, he shall not be hurt, for the Lord lays his hand under
him.

For I have been young, now am I old: and I have not sen^ the righteous
forsaken, ner his sede seeking after bread.

All the day long shows he mercy and lends, and his sede shall be blessed.

^urne thou away from euel, and do good, and dwell for ever and ever.

For the Lord loves judgment, and will not forsake his saints: they shall be
preserved for ever.

The ryghteous shall be punyshed and the sede of the ungodly shall peryshe.

But the ryghteous shall inheret the earth, and dwell upon it for evermore.

The mouth of ye ryghteous shall exercise wisdom, and his tongue shall talk of
judgment.

The law of his God is in his heart, and his goynges shall not be overthrown.

The sinner marketh y^ ryghteous, and seeks to bring him unto death.

But ye Lord will not leave him in his hands, ner condemn him when he is
judged.

^ayte thou the Lords leisure and keep his way: and he shall exalte the that
thou may inheret the earth: Thou shall se wha^ the sinners shall peryshe.

I saw the ungodly exalted on hye ^ set up aloft, even as ye Ceder trees of
Libanus.

And I went by, and lo, he was gone: I sought him also, and his place was not
found.

^epe innocencye and take heed unto equity, for those be things that remain
unto a peaceable man.

As for the unrighteous, they shall utterly peryshe, the re^nauntes of the
ungodly shall be destroyed together,

But the salvation of the righteous comes of the Lord, and he is their
defender in the time of trouble.

The Lord also shall help the^ and deliver them, ye he shall ryd the^ from
among sinners, and shall save them, because they have put their trust in him.

The.xxxvii. Psalm.
Lord rebuke me not in thy heavy indignacio^, nether chasten thou me in thy
wrath.

For thy arowes stycke fast in me, and thou have laid thyene hand sore upon
me.

There is no health in my flesh at the syghte of thy displeasure: my bones
have no rest at ye sight of my sins.

^or my iniquites are gone over my head, and lie sore upon me like a heuye
burden.

My wounds styncke and are corrupt at the sight of my foolyshnesse.

I am in mysery and brought low even to the vttemooste: I went mourning all
the day long.

For my loins are full of illusions, and there is no health in my flesh.

I am troubled and brought very low: I roared for very disquietnes of my heart.

Lord thou know all my desire, and my gronyng is not hyd from the.

My heart is troubled, my strength has failed me, and so has the light of mine
eyes, and the same is gone fro me.

My friends and my neghbours approached nigh and stood against me.

They also yt were nigh me stood afar of: and they that sought after my soul
used violence.

And they yt sought my harm, talked of vanities, and ymagined dysceat all the
day long.

As for me, I herd not, but was as a deaf man, and as one that is do^me not
openyng his mouth.

And I became as a man that hears not, and has no resistaunce in his mouth.

For in the O Lord have I set my trust, thou shall hear me O Lord my God.

Seeing I have required that mine enemies tryu^phe not over me at any time: And
while my fete slyppe they speak great words over me.

For I am prepared to be scourged, and my heaviness is allwaye in my sight.

For I will declare my iniquite and take thought for my sin.

But mine enemies live and are made strong above me: and they that hate me
without a just cause are many in nombre.

They that recompense evil for good, spoke evil of me, because I followed the
thing yt good is.

Forsake me not O Lord my God: go not thou far fro me.

Apply thy self to help me, O Lord God of my salvation.

The.xxxviii. Psalm*
I Said: I will keep my ways, that I offend not in my tongue.

I set a watch before my mouth, when the sinner stood styflye against me.

I held my tongue, and humbled my self: I kept silence also, eue^ from good
words, and my pain was renewed.

My heart was whote within me and in my musyng the fire kyndled.

^ spoke in my tongue: Lord show me mine end, and the nombre of my days, what
it is, that I may know what thing I lack.

Behold, thou have set my days within a certain compace, and my substance
is as it were nothing before the.

Nevertheless all is but vanyte: vain is every man living.

But man passes away in a shadow, and in vain disquyeteth he him self.

He heapeth up riches, and woteth not unto whom he shall gather them.

And now what is my hope? is not the Lord? and my substance is with the.

Deliver thou me from all mine iniquyties: thou have made me even a rebuke to
the unwise.

I held my to^g, and opened not my mouth, because it was thy doing: Turn
away thy plages fro me Through ye strength of thy hand I consumed away i^ thy
rebukes: For sin have you chastened man.

And even as a spyder have thou made his life to wayst away: but i^ vain is
every man troubled.

Hear you my prayer O Lord, and mine humble peticyon: mark my wepynges with
thine ears.

Hold not you thy tongue, for I am a stranger, and pilgrem with y^, like as all
my fathers have been.

O grant me forgyuenesse, that I may be refreshed, before I go hence, and be
no more seen.

The.xxxix. Psalm.
I Waited pacie^tly for y^ Lord, and he regarded me.

He has heard my prayers also, and brought me out of ye pit of myserye and
from the filthye claye.

My fete has he likewise set upon a rock, and ordered my goynges.

And into my mouth has he put a new song, even a dytie unto our God.

^any shall se this and fear, and put their trust in the Lord.

Blessed is ye man whose hope is the name of ye Lord, and yt has not regarded
vanities and false illusio^s.

Thou have multiplied thy wonderful works O Lord my God, and in thy thoughts
there is no man that may be like the.

^ have told and spoken of the^, they are multiplied beyond no^bre.

^acrifyce and offrynge thou would not have, but ears have thou ordained me.

^urntofferynge also for sin have you not required. Then said I: lo, I come.

^n the beginning of the book it is written of me, that I should perform thy
will O my God. I have consented there to and thy law have I in the mids of
my heart.

(...) have declared thy ryghteousnes in the great co^gregacyon: behold, my
lyppes will I not restrain O Lord, thou know.

Thy ryghteousnes have I not hyd in my heart, I have spoken of thy truth and
thy salvation.

I have not hyd thy mercy and thy truth from ye great co^gregacyon.

But Lord, wythdrawe not thou thy loving kyndnesses from me: thy mercy and
truth has allwaye sustained me.

For innumerable troubles are come about me: my sins have taken hold of me,
and I have had no power to look up.

They are moo in no^bre then the hears of my head, and my heart has failed me.

Let it (...) thy good pleasure o lord to deliver me, have respect O Lord to
help me.

Let them be confounded and ashamed together, that seek my soul to take it
away.

Let them be turned back and put to shame, that would me evil.

Let the^ soon bear their own confusyon, yt say unto me: There, There.

Let all them yt seek the, rejoice and be glad of the, and let them that love
thy salvation, say allwaye: the Lord be praised.

As for me, I am nedye and poor, the Lord cares for me.

Thou art my helper and my defender: make no long taryeng O my God.

The.xl. Psalm.
BLessed is he that co^sydreth the nedye and poor: In the evil day shall the
Lord deliver him.

The Lord preserve him, and hold him in life, and make him blessed in the
earth, and deliver him not over into ye will of his enemies.

The Lord succoure him upon the bed of his own disease: all his couche have you
turned in his infirmytie.

^ have said: Lord have mercy on me, heal my soul, for I have sinned against
the.

^yne enemies spoke evil on me: when shall he dye? and when shall his name
peryshe?

And if he came into se, he talked of vain things, his heart gathered
wyckednes to him self.

^e went out, and commened of the same.

All mine enemies whyspred against me, ye even against me ymagined they, to do
me hurt.

(...) wicked sentence have they given against me: shall not he that is laid
down to sleep rise no more again?

^or the man of my famyliarite whom I trusted, even he that did eat my bread,
made much adoo to overthrow me.

But have thou mercy on me O Lord, and raise thou me up again, and I shall
reward them.

By this have I known y^ thou have had a mind unto me, because mine enemy
shall not triumph over me.

But me have thou vpholden because of mine innocencye, and have set me sure in
thy sight for ever.

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel world without end: So be it, so be^.

(...)
EVen as the wyld heart, has a desire to the water springes, so longs my
soul for the, O God.

My soul has been eue^ a thyrst for God the fountain of life: When shall I
come and appear before the face of God?

My tears have been my bred day and night, while it is said unto me daily:
where is thy God?

These things have I remembered, and poured out my soul within me: for I shall
go through unto the place of the wonderful tabernacle, even unto the house of
God.

The voice of gladness and tha^kesgeuynge, even a noise of such one as keeps
holy day.

Why art thou heuye O my soul, and why disquietest thou me?

Put thy trust in God, for I will yet give thanks unto him: he is the salvation
of my countenance, and my God.

My soul is disquyeted within me, therefore will I be myndefull of the from the
land of Iordane and Hermon, even from the little mountain.

One depth calls upon another in the voice of thy water pypes.

^ll thy waves and thy floudes have gone over me.

The lord sent out his mercy in the day, and in the night shall he have his
song.

My prayer will I make unto ye God of my life, I will say unto God: thou art
my defendoure.

Why have thou forgotten me? and why go I up and down heuely, while the enemy
vexes me, even while my bones are allto broken?

Mine enemies that trouble me, have cast me in the tethe, while they say unto
me day by day: where is thy God.

Why art thou heuye O my soul, and why disquyetest thou me? Put thy trust in
God, for I will yet give thanks unto him: he is the salvation of my
countenance and my God.

The.xlii. Psalm.
Be thou my judge O God, pondre my cause from the unholy nacyon: deliver me
from the wicked and disceatfull man.

For you art my strength O God: why have thou cast me of? and why go I up and
down heuely, while the enemy oppresses me?

O send thou out thy light and thy truth: it is eue^ they that have been my
gyde, and have brought me to the holy mount and to thy tabernacles.

And I will go into the altar of God, even unto God that makes my youth glad.

In the harp will I give thanks unto the O God my God: why art you heuye O my
soul? why do thou disquyete me?

Put thy trust in God, for I will yet give thanks unto him: he is the health of
my countenance, and my God.

The.xliii. psalm.
WE have heard with our ears (o god) our fathers declared unto us.

The work that you have wrought in their days, and in old time.

Thy hand destroyed the nacyons, and thou have planted them: thou have
troubled y^ people and cast them out.

For they possessed not the land in their sword, and their own arm saved
them not.

But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance,
because thou had a favor unto them.

Thou art even y^ same, my king and my God, which sendest out help unto Jacob.

In the shall we blow away our enemies with a horn, and in thy name shall we
despise them that rise up against us.

For in my bow will I not trust, and it is not my sword that shall save me.

For thou have saved us from among them that oppressed us, and those yt hated
us have you brought to confusyon.

In god shall wobe much made of all ye day long, and in thy name shall we
give thanks for ever.

But now have thou cast us of, and put us to confusion: and thou O God wylt
not go forth in our hoostes.

Thou have turned us back behind our enemies: and they yt hated us, did
spoil us, for their own profyt.

Thou have made us even as sheep to be eaten, and among the heythen have thou
scatred us.

Thou have soled thine own people without money, and there has been no
multitude in the exchaunges of them.

Thou have made us a very rebuke unto our neghbours, a derisyon and scorn to
them that are round about us.

Thou have made us a by word unto the heythen: a very shaking of the head
among the people.

All the day long is my shame against me and the confusion of my face has
covered me.

At the voice of the slaunderer and blasphemer, at the sight of the enemy and
persecuter.

All these things are come upon us, yet have we not forgotten the ner behaved
our selves vnryghteously in thy conenaunt.

Our heart also has not gone back, and thou have removed our paths from thy
way.

For thou have brought us low in the place of affliction, and the shadow of
death has covered us.

If we have forgotten the name of our god, and we have holden out our hands
to a strange god, shall not god make search for such things? for he knows
the secrets of the heart.

For why, for thy sake we are put to death all ye day long: we are counted
even as slaughter sheep.

Up Lord, why slepest thou? up, and cast us not of for ever.

Why turnest thou away thy face, and forgettest our mysery and our trouble?

^or our soul is brought down even in the dust, our belly stycketh fast in the
earth.

^p Lord, help us, and deliver thou us for thy names sake.

(...)
^y heret has dyteed a good matter, my works do I dedycate unto the king.

My tongue is the pen of a swyft writer.

^ayre art thou of bewtye above the children of men: there is grace poured out
in thy lyppes, therefore has God blessed y^ for ever.

^yrde the with thy sword upon thy thyghe, O you most mighty.

^n thy bewtye and in thy fayrnesse apply thy self prosperously, go forth and
raygne.

For thy truth and meekness and righteousness: and thy right hand shall
bring the forward wonderfully.

Thine arowes are sharp: the people under the shall fall into ye hertes of the
kings enemies.

Thy seat O God endures for ever: the scepter of thy kingdom is the scepter
of equity.

Thou have loved righteousness and hated inquyte: therefore God (even thy God)
has anointed ye with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

^yrre and sweet ointment and the herb Cassia do smell out of thy garments,
even out of thy yuery houses, wherewith the kings daughters have made the
pleasant in thine honor.

The queen stood at thy right hand in a vesture wrought with gold, brodered of
diverse fashio^s Hear o daughter and behold, and enclyne thine ear and
forget thine own people and thy fathers house.

And the king shall delight in thy bewty, for he is y^ Lord thy God and they
shall worship him.

So shall the daughters also of Tire in their prese^tes: al ye rich of the
people shall make humble intercessyon to thy countenance.

All the glory of the same kings daughter is from within, even in borders of
gold, set round about with diverse colors.

After her shall the virgins be brought unto the king: eue^ they that be next
her, shall be brought unto the.

They shall be brought in gladness and joy: even into the kings temple shall
they be brought.

In stead of fathers, they are sons borne unto the: them shall thou make
princes upon all the earth.

They shall be myndful of thy name through out all generacions.

Therefore shall the people give thanks unto the for ever and ever.

(...)
OUr God is our refuge and strength, our helper in the troubles that have come
upon us very sore.

Therefore will we not fare, whyl the earth shall be troubled, and the mountains
removed into the mids of the sea.

^heyr waters raged and were troubled, the mountains shoke in the strength of
him.

^he vehemence of the floude reioyseth the city of god: ye most highest has
sanctified his own tabernacle.

God is in the mids thereof, it shall not be moved: god shall help it, and that
very early.

The nations are vexed, and the kingdoms are moved: he showed his voice, the
earth quaked.

The Lord of powers is with us, the God of Jacob is our defender.

Come ye, and se the worckes of the Lord what wonders he has showed upon
earth, taking wars away unto the vttemooste part of the world.

The bow shall he bruste asunder, and all to break the weapons, and the
bucklers shall he burn with fire.

Consydre and behold, for I am God: I wylbe exalted among the Heythen, and I
shall be exalted in the earth.

The Lord of powers is with us, the God of Jacob is our defender.

The.xlvi. Psalm.
ALl ye Heythen clappe with your hands: sing merely unto God in the voice of
thankesgeuynge.

For the hye Lord is to be feared: he is the great King upon all the earth.

He has subdued the people unto us, and the Heythen under our fete.

Among us has he chosen his inheritance, even the bewtye of Jacob which he
has loved.

God is gone up in a joyful noise, and the Lord in the voice of the trompe.

O sing ye praises, sing praises unto our God: O singe praises, sing praises
to our king.

For God is king of all ye earth: sing ye praises with understanding.

God shall be king over y^ heithe^: God sytteth upon his holy seat.

The princes of the people are gathered together with the God of Abraham: for
the strong gods of the earth are myghtely exalted.

(...)
^Reat is the Lord, and hyghly to be praised in the city of our God, even in
his holy mount.

(...) Sion is founded for the comfort of all the earth: on the north side is
the city of the great king.

God shall be known in the houses thereof, wha^ he shall receive it.

For lo, the kings of the earth assembled: they gathered the^ selves together.

They seeing it thus, wondered, they were at their wits ends, they were
astonnyed: fear came upon them.

Even there came pains upon the^ as of a woman in travail: in a vehement wynd
shall you al to break the ships of Tharsis.

As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of powers, even
in the city of our God: God has laid the foundation of it for ever.

We have received thy mercy O God in the mids of thy temple.

According to thy name (o god) eue^ so likewise is thy praise unto the
vtmooste parts of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.

O let mount Sio^ be glad, and let the daughters of Judah rejoice (O Lord
because of thy judgments.

Walk about Sion and go round about it: be telling among the towers thereof.

Co^sydre ye strength of it, and dyscerne well her houses, yt ye may show it
in another generation.

For here is God, even our God for ever and ever: he shall be our gyde for
evermore.

The.xlviii. Psalm*
Hear these things al ye nations, mark the^ with your ears all ye yt dwell
in ye world.

All ye inhabiters of the earth and children of men, both rich and poor
together.

My mouth shall speak wysdom and the exercise of my heart shall be upon
prudence.

I will enclyne mine ear to the parable, my darck speech will I open in the
psaltery.

Why shall I be afraid in the day of aduersyte? The iniquite of my hele will
compace me round about.

They that trust in their own strength, and rejoice in the multitude of their
riches.

One brother delyuereth not another: shall one man redeem another? He shall not
make agreement for him unto God.

The price of his redemption also shall he not give him: and he shall always
labor, and live yet at the last,

^e shall not se destruction wha^ he has respect unto the wise: the unwise
and the foolysh shall perysh together.

Their riches also shall they leave unto strangers, and their graves shall be
their habitacyon for ever.

Those shall be their dwelling places in all generacio^s: their names have they
proclaimed in their lands

And when man was in honor he did not consydre it: he is compared unto brute
beasts, and become look unto them.

This way of theyrs is an occasyon of falling unto them: and afterward shall
they speak fair in their mouth.

They are laid in hell like sheep, death shall gnawe upon them.

The ryghtuous also shall have dominyon of them by times in the morning, and
their help shall consume in hell after their glory.

But God shall deliver my soul from the hand of hell, when he receaueth me.

Be not you afraid when a man is made rich, and when the glory of his house
increases.

For when he dies, he shall not take all away: nether shall his glory go
down with him.

For in his life shall his soul be well spoken: be will give thanks unto the
when thou do him good.

He shall enter into the generacyons of his father: he shall never se light.

When man was in honor, he did not consydre it: he is compared unto brute
beestes, and become like unto them.

The.xlix. Psalm.
THe God of gods, eue^ the Lord has spoken, and called the earth.

From y^ rysynge of y^ son un y^ going down: The fayrenesse of his beauty
comes out of Sio^.

God, even our god, shall come manifestly, and shall not keep syle^ce.

A fire shall burn in his sight, and a mighty sore tempest shall there be
round about him.

He shall call to the heaven from above, and also the earth, to judge his people.

Gather unto him his saynctes, which mynystre his covenant upon the sacrifyces.

and the heavens shall declare his righteousness, for God is the judge.

Hear O my people, and let me speak O Israel, and I will testifye unto y^: I
am god, even thy god.

I will not reprove the in thy sacrifyces: As for thy burnt offerynges, they
are allwaye i^ my sight.

^ will not receive calves out of thy house, nether gootes from among thy
flocks.

For all the wild beasts of the woddes are mine, ye catell in the mountains,
and the oxen.

I have knowledge of all the birds of the air, and the bewtye of the field is
in my sight.

If I be hongrye, I will not tell the: for the compass of the earth is mine and
all that therein is.

Shall I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink y^ blood of goats?

Offer thou unto God the sacrifyce of praise, and pay thy vows to the most
highest.

And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver the, and thou shall
give me the praise.

But unto ye sinner said God:

Why do y^ preach my ryghteousnesses, and take my testament in thy mouth?

As for y^, you have abhorred instruction, and cast my words behind y^.

^f thou saw a thief, y^ rannest with him, and laydest thy porcyon with the
aduoutrers.

Thy mouth has abou^ded in malyce^ thy tongue set out disceate.

Thou sattest y^ down and spakest against thy brother, and dyddest slander
thy mothers son: These things have thou done, and I have holden my tongue.

Thou have thought ungraciously that I wylbe like unto the: I will reprove the,
and set my self against thy face.

Understood these things ye yt forget god, lest he pluck you away and there
be none to deliver you.

The sacrifyce of praise shall worship me: and there is the way wherein I will
show him y^ salvation of God.

The.l. Psalm.
Have mercy on me o god, according to thy great mercy and according to the
multitude of thy loving kyndnesses do away mine iniquyte.

^ash me yet more fro mine iniquyte, and cleanse me fro my sin.

^or mine iniquite do I know, and my sin is always i^ my sight.

Against the only have I sinned, and done evil before y^: so that thou may
be found true in thy sayenges, and over come when thou art judged.

^or behold, I am conceived in iniquyties, and in sins did my mother
conceive me.

^or lo, you have loved truth: ye secrets and pryuities of thy will ^ome have
thou declared unto me.

^hou shall sprynkle me with ysope O Lord, and I shall be cleansed: you shall wash
me, and I shall be whyter then snow.

^o my hearing thou shall give joy and gladness, and y^ bones which are
brought low, shall rejoice.

^urne away thy face from my sins, and put out al mine i^i^ties.

Make a new heart wtin me o god, and renew a right sprete i^ my body.

^ast me not out of thy sight, and take not thy holy ghoost away fro me.

Grant me the gladness of thy salvation again, and stablishe me with thy
princypall sprete.

I will teach the wicked thy ways, and the ungodly shall be converted unto the.

Deliver me from blood O God thou God of my salvation, and my tongue shall
tryumphe of thy righteousness.

^orde thou shall open my lyppes, and my mouth shall show forth thy praise.

For if it had been thy pleasure, I would have geuyn the sacrifyce: in burnt
offeringes verily will thou have no delight.

A sacrifyce unto God is a troubled sprete: a contryte and humbled heart, O God,
wylt thou not despise.

Deal graciously unto Sion O Lord, in thy good will, that the walls of
Jerusalem may be builded.

Then shall thou accept the sacrifyce, oblacyons and burnt offerynges of
righteousness: then shall they lay calves upon thine altar.

The.li Psalm.
WHy reioysest thou in malice, thou that art mighty in inio^yte.

All the day long has thy tongue ymagined unrighteousness, even as with a
sharp raysure have you exercysed disceate.

Thou haste loved malice more then gentleness: even to talk of
unrighteousness rather then equity.

All hurtful words have thou loved, thou disceatfull tongue.

Therefore shall God destroy y^ at the last: he shall pluck the up and from
thy tabernacle shall he remove the, and thy rote out of y^ land of the living.

The ryghteous shall se it and fear, and shall laugh him to scorn and say:
lo, this is the man that took not God for his helper.

But trusted in the multitude of his riches, and prevailed in his own vanytie.

As for me, I am as a fruitful Olyue tree in the house of God: I have put my
trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.

I will give thanks unto the for evermore because it is thy doing: and in thy

The.lii. psalm.
THe unwise man has said in his heart: there is no god.

Coorrupte they are, and become abominable in their iniquities: there is not
that does good.

Good has looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to se if there be
any y^ has understanding or seeks after god.

They are al gone out of y^ way together, they are become unprofitable, there
is not one that does good, no there is not one.

Shall not al they feel it yt work iniquyte, which eat up my people, as it
were a refeccyon of bred?

They have not called upon God: even there have they sto^bled through fear,
where no fear was.

For God has scatred y^ bones of them that please men: they are brought to
co^fusyo^, because God despised them.

Who shall grant salvation unto Israel out of Sion? when y^ Lord has turned
the captiuyte of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

The.liii. psalm.
Save me (O God) in thine own name, and give thou sentence for me in thy power.

Hear my prayer O God, mark the words of my mouth with thine ears.

For strangers are risen up against me, and the myghtie have sought after my
soul, and have not set God before their eyes.

For lo, it is God that helps me, and the Lord is ye defendour of my soul.

^urne thou aduersite unto mine enemies, and destroy them in thy truth.

Of mine own fre mind will I do sacrifyce unto the and unto thy name will I
give thanks O Lord, for it is good.

^or out of all trouble have thou delivered me, and mine eye has seen his
desire upon mine enemies.

(...)
^Eare my prayer O God, and despise not mine humble peticyon: have respect
unto me, and hear me.

^ am vexed in my weerynesse, and troubled through the voice of the enemy and
disquyetnesse of the sinner.

^or they have laid iniquyties to my charge, and in wrath they were tedious
unto me.

My heart is disquyeted with in me, and y^ fear of death is fallen upon me.

^earfulnesse and trembling are come upon me, and darcknesse has covered me.

And I said: who shall give me wings like a dove? and I will fly, and take my
rest.

Behold, I gat me far of and fled, and remained in the wilderness.

My taryenge was for him, which has saved me from the feblenesse of sprete
and from the tempeste.

Destroy their tongues O Lord: deuyde thou them, for I have seen iniquyte and
sedicion in y^ city.

Day and night shall iniquyte go round about it upon the walls thereof: sorrow
also is in ye mids of it, and so is unrighteousness.

^sury likewise and disceate has not been lacking from out of y^ streets
thereof.

For if mine enemy had reuyled me, I could have borne it verily.

And if he that ought me evil will, had threatened me, I should peradventure
have hidden my self from him.

But it is thou, a man that wast after mine own mind, my guide, and mine own
famylier friend.

Which also dyddest receive pleasant meats with me: In y^ house of God have
we walked with one consent.

Let death come upon them, and let them go down quycke unto hell.

For there are wyckednesses in their dwellynges, even in y^ mids of them.

^s for me, I complained unto God, and the Lord saved me.

In the evening and morning and at the noone day, will I show and tell my
mind unto him, and he shall hear my voice.

^e shall deliver my soul in peace from them that approach nigh unto me, for
they were with me among many.

^od yt is without beginning, shall hear me, and bring the^ down.

^or they will not convert and God have they not feared: he holds out his
hand in recompencynge them.

They have broken his covenant, they are divided from the wrath of his
countenance, and his heart has approached nigh.

^he words of him are softer then oil, and the same are very darts.

^ast thy care upon the Lord and he shall noryshe the, and shall not suffer the
ryghteous to be overthrown for ever.

But y^ O God, shall bring the^ down into y^ pytte of destruction.

Bloudthyrstye and disceatfull men shall not come to the half of their days:

The sinners are clean gone eue^ from their mothers womb: they have erred,
ever sense they were borne: they have spoken lies.

Their furye is like the furye of a serpent, even as the furye of an adder that
is deaf and stops her ears.

Which will not hear the voice of the enchaunter, and of the sorcerer that
charmeth wisely.

God shall altobreake their tethe within their mouth, y^ Lord shall altobrust
the lions chawbones.

They shall come to naught even like water that runs down: he bends his
bow, till their strength be taken from them.

Even as wax that melts shall they be taken away: fire fell upon them, and
they saw not the Sun.

^fore your thorns could prycke: even so in displeasure shall he ^walowe them
up, in manner even alive.

The righteous shall rejoice wha^ he seyth the vengeance: his hands shall he
wash in the blood of the sinner.

verelye is there a God, that judges them in the earth.

Yet have they ymagyned to cast out my price: I have re^ne i^ thirst with their

Hear thou my prayer, O God when I make mine humble peticyon: O deliver my

My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long, wha^ they
yt seek to do me euel shall be co^fou^ded and brought to shame.

The.lxxi. psalm.
Give the king thy judgment O God, and thy righteousness, to the kings son.

To judge thy people i^ righteousness and thy poor in judgment.

Let the mountains receive peace, and the little hills righteousness for the
people.

He shall judge the poor of the people, and save ye children of the poor, and
bring down the wrong doer.

And he shall endure with y^ son and before the Moon, from generacyon to
generayon.

He shall desce^de eue^ as ye rain into the flece of woll, and as the drops
ye drop upon ye earth.

In his days shall spring righteousness and abondau^ce of peace, till the
Moon be taken away.

He shall have dominion also from see to see, and from the river un till the
coasts of the world.

Before him shall the moria^s fall down, and his enemies shall lycke the earth.

The kings of Tharsis, and of the I Will shall offer gifts: the kings of
Arabians and of Saba shall bring presents.

And all kings shall worship him, all nacyons shall serve him.

For he shall deliver ye poor from the myghtie, and the poor yt had no helper.

He shall spare the poor and helpless, and the souls of the poor shall he
save.

From extorcyon and wrong shall he deliver their souls, and honorable shall
their name be in his sight.

He shall live also, and to him shall be given of the gold of Arabye, and their
worshyppynge shall be allwaye of him, all ye day long shall they give thanks
unto him.

He shall be the strong hold in earth in the tops of the mountains: his fruit
shall be extolled above Libanus, and they shall sloryshe out of the city even as
the grass of the earth.

Blessed be his name for ever: bebefore the Son endures his name.

And all the kynreds of the earth shall be blessed in him, all nations shall
magnifye him.

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which only does wonders.

And blessed be the name of his majesty for ever, and with his majesty shall
all the earth be filled so be it, so be it.

The.lxxi^. psalm.
O How good is God unto Israel, even unto the^ that are of a true heart?

But my fete were allmoost removed, my goynges had well nigh slypte.

For I was grieved at y^ unrighteous, seeing the prosperyte of sinners.

For their death is not looked upon, and in their aduersyte they have a stay.

They are not in the travail of men and with men will they not be scourged.

Therefore has pride taken hold on them, they are overwhelmed with their own
iniquite and ungodliness.

Their iniquite is come out even as it were from fatness, they are clean gone
to their own hertes lust.

They have ymagyned and talked of wickedness, inyquyte have they spoken an hye.

Their mouth have they extended unto heaven, and their tongue has gone
through in the exthe.

Therefore shall my people be turned here, and full days shall be found in them.

And they have said: how does God know it? and is there knowledge in the highest?

Behold, these sinful and well thy men in the world have opteyned riches.

And I said: then have I directed my heart, and washed my hands among
innoce^tes, in vain.

I have been scourged also all the day long, and punished was I in the
mornings.

If I said: I will talk even so, behold, then have I condemned the nation of
thy children.

I thought that I should understand this thing, but it was hard for me.

Till I might enter into the holy place of God, and consydre ye end of those
men.

But because of their disceatful nesses you have appointed for the^, thou have
cast them down when they were set up alofte.

How are they waysted away? suddenly are they consumed, they perished because
of their iniq^te.

Even as a dream of them that awake out of sleep, shall thou (O Lord) bring
their image to naught in the city.

For my heart was set on fire, et my reins were changed, ye even to nothi^ge
was I brought, and knew it not.

I became eue^ as it were a be in thy sight, and yet am I allwaye with the.

Thou have holde^ me by my right hand, and in thy will have thou led me forth,
and with glory have thou received me.

For what have I in heaven, and what have I desired upon earth, without the?

My flesh and my heart has failed me: God is ye God of my heart and my portion
for ever.

For lo, they that withdraw the^ selves away from the, shall perish: you have
destroyed all such as commit fornicacyon against the.

But unto me it is good to stick fast unto God, even to put my trust in the
Lord God.

That I may show forth al thy praises in ye gates of the daughter Sion.

The.^xxii^. psalm.
WHy haste thou utterly cast us away O God? thy heuye indignacyon is moved
over the sheep of thy pasture.

O be myndful of thine own co^gregacyon, which thou have possessed from the
beginning.

Thou have delivered the rod of the inheritance: even mount Sion is it that
thou have dwelt in.

Lift up thine hands against their pride for ever: how great things has ye
enemy wickedly devised in the holy place?

And they that have hated the, have made their boaste, even in the mids of
thy solemn feast.

They have set up banners, even their own banners, and knew not how it
should come to pass in the end above.

Even like as in a wod of trees, so have they hewn down the doors of it
together with axe and b^^ll have they cast it down.

Thy holy place in earth have they brent with fire: they have de fyled the
tabernacle of thy name.

The kynred of the^ together have said in their heart: let us make all the
feastfull days of God to cease out of the earth.

We se not our own banners, now is there not a prophet, and us will he know
no more.

How long shall the enemy blaspheme O God? the adversary does utterly
provoke thy name unto wrath.

Why do thou utterly withdraw thine hand and thy right hand from the mids
of thy bosom.

But God is our king of old: he has wrought salvation in the mids of the
earth.

Thou in thy power have stablysshed the sea, the heads of the drago^s haste
thou all to troubled in the waters.

Thou haste broken the dragons heads, thou haste given him to be meat unto
the people of Ethiopia.

Thou have broken up the fountaynes and ryuers, thou have dried the floudes of
Ethan.

The day is thine, and thine is the night: thou have ordained ye morning
light, and the Sun.

Thou have made all the borders of the earth, the Summer and the spring of the
year those haste thou fourmed.

Be thou myndfull of this: the enemy has blasphemed y^ Lord, and the unwise
people has provoked thy name.

O eve not over unto beasts the soul yt praise y^: forget not thou the souls
of thy poor for ever.

Have respect to thine own covenant: for the dark men of the earth are
filled with houses of iniquyties.

Let not the humble be turned away ashamed: the poor and helpelesse shall
praise thy name.

Arise o God, judge thine own cause, remember the blasphemies that the unwise
co^mytteth against the all the day long.

^orget not the voices of thine enemies: the pride of them that have hated the,
increaceth always.

The.(...). Psalm.
WE will give thanks unto the O God, we will give thanks and call upon thy
name.

We shall tell of thy wondrous worckes: when I may have a time, I shall judge
according unto right.

The earth waysteth away, and all that dwell in it, I have stablished the
pylers thereof.

I have said to the unrighteous: do not vnryghteously, and to the^ that
offend: exalte not ye your own horn.

Set not up your horn on hye, talk not of iniquyte against God.

For promocion comes nether from the east, nether from the west, ner from the
wayst mountains, for God is the judge.

Some one puts he down, and some one sets he up: for y^ cup of pure wine
in the hand of the Lord is myngled full.

And he has holden it down out of one into another: but the dregs of it is
not emyed out all the sinners of the earth shall drink it.

Nevertheless I wylbe talking for ever, I will sing unto the God of Jacob.

And all the horns of sinners will I break asonder, and the horns of the
ryghteous shalke exalted.

The.lxx^^. Psalm.
GOd is known in Iewrye, great is his name in Israel.

His place also is made in peace, and his dwelling in Sion.

There has he all to broken the powers, the buckler, the swearde and the war.

Thou gave light wonderfully out of the eternal mountains: all the unwise in
heart are vexed.

They have slepte their sleep, and nothing have al rich me^ found in their
hands.

At thy rebukynge (O God of Jacob) all they that rode on horses are fallen a
sleep,

Thou art fearful, and who shall resyste the? thy wrath comes immediately.

From heaven haste thou caused judgment to be heard: the earthquaked and was
still.

When God rose up into judgment, that he might save all the meke herted of the
earth.

For the mind of man shall praise the, and the remnauntes of the thought shall
keep holy day unto the.

^owe and pay unto the Lord your God, all ye that bring presents round
about him.

To him that is fearful, and to him that takes away the breath of princes,
even to him that is fearful among all the kings of the earth.

The (...). psalm.
WIth my voice have I cried unto ye Lord, eue^ with my voice have I cried unto
god, and he had respect unto me.

In ye day of my trouble I sought after God, with my hands up toward him in
the night, and I was not dysceaued.

My soul refused comfort, I was myndfull of god, and it refreshed me I was
vexed, and my sprete failed.

Mine eyes prevented ye watches: I was troubled, and spoke not.

I thought of the days of old, and the eternal years had I in mind.

I mused also in the night with mine own heart, and exercysed my self, and
examyned mine sprete.

Will God cast out for ever? Or will he take in hand to be no more entreated?

Or will he utterly withdraw his merry from all generacions?

Or will God forget to have compassion, or will he hold still his mercyes in
his wrath?

And I said: now have I begone, this is a change of the right hand of the
highest.

I remembered the works of the Lord, for I will be myndfull of thy wonders
from the beginning.

I will muse also upon all thy works, and be exercysed in things of thy
deuysynge.

Thy way (o God) is holy: what God is great as our God is? It is thou O God
that workest wonders.

Thou have declared thy power among ye people: eue^ in thine own arm have
thou delivered thy people y^ children of Jacob and Joseph.

The waters saw the (O God) the waters did se the, and were afraid, the
depthes also were troubled.

Great was the sou^de of the waters, the clouds made a noise.

For thy arowes went abroad, so did the noise of thy thonder rouude about.

Thy lyghtnynges shyned bright unto the ronnde compase of the earth: the earth
shoke and quaked.

Thy way was in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters, and thy
footesteppes shall not be known.

Thou broughteste thy people forth, even as a sheep, in the hand of Moses and
Aaron.

The.lxxvii. Psalm.
LYsten to my law (o my people enclyne your ear unto the words of my mouth.

I will open my mouth in parables, I shall speak of darcke speches from the
beginning.

How great things we have heard, and known the same, and our fathers have
told us.

They have not been hyd from their children in the next generacyon.

They have showed the praises of the Lord, his noble acts also, and wonderful
works that he has done.

And he set up a testymonye in Jacob, and made a law in Israel.

How great things has he commanded our fathers, to show them unto ye
children, ye the next generacyon might know theme?

The children yt shall be borne and come up, shall show them unto their children.

That they may set their trust in god (and not forget y^ works of god) and
seek out his commandments.

Lest they become like their fathers a froward and ouerthwarte generacyon.

A generacyon that has not set their heart a right whose sprete also is not
steadfast in believe with god.

The children of Ephraim bendynge ye bow and shotynge, turned back in the
day of war.

They kept not the covenant of God, and in his law would they not walk.

They forgate also his benefits, and his wonders that he showed for them.

Before their fathers did he wonderful things in y^ land of Egypt, even in
the field of Thaneos:

He brake up ye see and brought them through, and made the waters to stand as
it were in a bottell.

He brought the^ forth also in the cloud of the day, and all the night long
in the light of fire.

He did cleue y^ hard rock in the wilderness, and gave them water to drink
as it had been in the great deep.

And he brought water out of the hard rock, ye even waters brought he out
like ryuers.

And they took in hand to sin yet against him, they provoked the highest unto
wrath in the wilderness.

And they tempted God in their hertes, in that they asked meat after their own
minds.

And they spoke evil of God, and said: Might God prepare a table in the
wilderness?

For he smote the rock, and the waters gusshed out, and the ryuers flowed
abroad.

Shall he be able also to my^^ystre bred, or to provide a table for his people?

Therefore the Lord heard it, and took delyberacio^: a fire also was kyndled in
Jacob, and ascended up in Israel.

For they believed not in god, nether trusted they i^ his salvation.

And he commanded the clouds from above, and opened ye doors of heaven.

He rayned down Manna upon them also for to eat, and gave the^ bred of heaven.

Man did eat a^gels bred, he sent them meats and that plentye.

He removed y^ south wind out of the air, and in his power he brought in the
west.

He rayned flesh upon them also even as dust, and fethered fowls as the sonde
of the sea.

And they fell among their hoostes, eue^ round about their te^tes.

And they did eat and were sufficiently satisfied, and he gave them their
request, they were not dispoynted from their desire.

Their meats were yet in their mouth, and the wrath of God came upon them.

He slew also their welthy men, and hyndred ye chosen of Israel.

I^ al these things they sinned yet more, and believed not his wonderful
works.

And their days waysted away in vanyte, and so did their years with hayst.

When he slew the^, they sought him, and were turned again, and came early
unto him.

And they called to remembrance that God is their helper, and that the hye God
is their redemer.

They loved him also in their mouth, and in their tongue dissembled with him.

Their heart was not true with him, nether were they counted faithful in his
covenant.

But he is merciful, and will be gracyous unto their sins, and not utterly
destroy them.

And he took upon him again to turn away his dyspleasure, and kyndled not
all his wrath.

And he co^sydred yt they are but flesh, even a breath going and not coming
again.

How often have they grieved him in y^ deserte? they provoked him to wrath in the
wilderness.

They turned also and tempted God, and provoked y^ holy one of Israel.

They thought not of his hand, what time as he delivered them out of the hand
of the enemy.

How he wrought his miracles in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Thaneos.

And he turned their ryuers in to blood, and their showers of rain yt they
should not drink.

He sent upon them a noisome fly, and it did eat them: the frogg also, and it
destroyed them.

And he gave their fruits to the blastynge, and their labors to the
greshopper.

He killed their vynardes also in the hayle, and their molbery trees with frost.

And he gave their catel over unto the hayle, and their possession unto the
fire.

He sent upon them the wrath of his indignacio^, even heavy displeasure, and
anger and trouble, brought in by evil angels.

He made away for the path of his wrath, he spared not their lives from death,
and in death shut up their catell.

And he smote all the first borne in the land of Egypt, the first fruits of
all their labor in the tents of Cham.

He brought away his people also even as sheep, and brought the^ through as a
flock in the desert:

And he brought them out in hop^, and they were not afraid, and the sea
overwhelmed their enemies.

And he brought them in unto y^ mount of his Holiness, even to y^ mount that his
right hand purchaced.

And he cast out the nacyons before them, and distributed the la^d unto them by
lot, even in the line of distribueyon.

And he made y^ trybes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

They also tented and provoked the hye God, and kept not his testimonies.

And they turned away the^ selves, and kept not the covenant (even as did
their fathers) but turned to a wicked bow.

They provoked him unto wrath in their little hills, and stered him to
displeasure in their graven images.

God heard it, and abhorred the^, and brought Israel utterly to naught.

And he forsook y^ tabernacle in Sylo, even his awnc tabernacle where he dwelt
among men.

Their power also gave he over in to captyuyte, and their bewtye into ye hands
of the enemy.

And he shut the people fast in ye sword, and despised his own inheritance.

The fire consumed their young men, and their virgyns made no lamentacyon.

Their prestes fell in the sword, and their wedowes were not mourned for.

And the Lord awoke even as it were from sleep, even as a myghtie man refreshed
after wine.

And he smote his enemies on y^ hinder parts, an everlasting rebuke gave he
them.

And he forsook the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the trybe of Ephraim.

But did chose the trybe of Judah, even mount Sion which he loved.

And eue^ as an unicorn builded he his holy place, in the lord that he
founded for ever.

He chose also David his servant, and took him from the flocks of sheep, even
from after the ewes (great with young) took he hi^.

To feed Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance.

He fed them also in the innocencye of his heart, and gyded them forth
according to the experience of his hands.

. The lxxvi^^. psalm.
O God, the Heythen are come into thine inheritance, they have poluted thy
holy temple, they have made Jerusalem a custody of apples.

The deed bodies of thy servants have they laid out to be meat unto the
fowls of the air, the flesh of thy saints to ye beestes of the earth.

Their blood have they shed even as water round about Jerusalem, and there
was none to burye them.

We are become a rebuke unto our neghbours, a very scorn and derysyon to them
that are round about us.

How long will thou be displeased O Lord? for ever? shall thy gelousy be
kyndled like fire?

Pour out thy wrath upon the nacyons that have not known the, and upon the
kyngdoms which have not called on thy name.

For they have devoured Jacob, and made his place wayst.

Remember not thou our old iniquities, let thy mercyes preuente us, and that
soon, for we are become exceadynge poor.

Help us O God our savior, and for the glory of thy name O Lord deliver us,
and be merciful unto our sins for thy names sake.

^est they say among the nacyons: where is their God? and let it be known
among the nacyons before our eyes:

Even the vengeance of thy servants blood which has been shed: Let the
heuye syghynge of them that be in bonds enter in to thy sight.

According to the greatness of thine arm, take thou the children of them
that are slain in to thine own possessyon.

And reward our neghbours seuenfolde in their bosom, even their blasphemy
wherewith they have blasphemed the O Lord.

So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thanks un to the for
ever.

From generacyo^ to generation shall we show forth thy praise.

The.lxxi^. psalm.
O Lysten thou that gouernest Israel, even thou that leadest Jacob forth as it
were a sheep.

Thou that syttest upon the Cherubins, show thy self before Ephraim, Benjamin
and Manasse.

^tere up thy power O Lord, and come, that thou may save us.

Sonuerte thou us O God, and show thy countenance, and we shall be safe.

O Lord God of powers, how long will thou be angrye over the prayer of thy
servant.

Thou shalt feed us with the bread of tears, and in tears shall thou give us
drink plentifully.

Thou haste made our neighbors to speak against us, and our enemies have
laughed us to scorn.

^onuerte thou us O God of powers, and show thy countenance, and we shall be
safe.

Thou have brought a vynyarde out of Egypt, the nations have you cast out, and
planted it.

Thou wast gyde of the journey before it, and have planted the rotes thereof, and
it filled the land.

The shadow of it covered the mountains, and the pla^tes thereof the ceders of
God.

She stretched out her branches unto the sea, and her bowe^ unto the river.

Why have you destroyed her hedge? and all that go by the way, pluck of her
grapes.

Why wild box out of the wod has roted it up, and one special tyrant has
devoured it.

Turn the O God of power^, look down from heaven and behold, and vysyte this
vyneyarde.

And make it up that thy right hand has planted, and look upon the son of
man whom thou have set for thy self.

It is brent with fire and dygged up: After the rebuke of thy countenance they
shall perysshe.

Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, and upon ye man whom thou
have made much of for thy self.

And we depart not away from the: Thou shall quycken us, and we will call
upon thy name.

Turn thou us O Lord God of powers, and show thy countenance and we shall be
safe.

The.lxxx. Psalm.
Rejoice before God our sauyoure, sing ye merely unto the God of Jacob.

Take a psalm, and reach the tabret, the pleasant psaltery with the harp.

Blow with the trompet in the new Moon even in the great day of your
solemn feast.

For it is a commandment in Israel, and a law unto the God of Jacob.

That testimony ordained he in Joseph when he went out of the land of Egypt:
he herd a speech that he knew not.

He turned away his back from burdens, his hands did service in the basket.

In trouble dyddest thou call upon me, and I delivered the, and heard the in a
preuy tempest, I proved the at the water of strife.

Harken O my people and I will proteste unto ye: Israel if you wylt harken unto
me, there shall be in ye no strange God, nether shalt thou worship any other
God.

For I am the Lord thy God, yt have brought the out of the land of Egypt:
open thy mouth wide and I shall fill it.

And my people harkened not unto my voice, and Israel had no regard unto me.

And I let them depart after the lusts of their own heart: they shall go in
their own inuencyons.

If my people had harkened unto to me, if Israel would have walked in my ways.

(...) should peradventure have brought their enemies down as a thing of
naught, and have laid my hand upon such as trouble them.

^he enimyes of the Lord have dissembled with him, and their time shall be
perpetual.

He also did feed them with fine flower of corn, and out of ye stonye rock
did he satysfye them with honye.

(...)
GOd has stand in the congregacyon of the gods, even among the gods does

How long do ye judge wrongfully, and accept the countenau^ces of sinners?

Defend the poor and fatherless, se that he which is brought low and in
pouerte, have right.

Deliver the poor, and save the nedye from the hand of the sinner,

They have been ignorant, and had no understanding, they walk in darkness,
all the foundacions of the earth shall be moved.

I have said: ye are gods, and children of the Highest altogether.

But ye shall dye like men, and as one of the princes shall ye fall.

^ryse O God, judge thou the earth, for thou shall have enheritaunce in all
nations.

The.(...) psalm.
O God, who shall be like unto the? hold not thy tongue, nether be thou put to
silence, O God.

For lo, thine enemies have made a noise, and they that have hated the, have
lift up their head.

Upon thy people have they taken a wicked cou^sayll, they have ymagined it
against thy saints.

They have said: come, and let us destroy the^ out of the nacyon, and let the
name of Israel be no more had in remembrance.

For with one assent have they ymagyned a bond of truce together against the:
The tents of the Edomytes and the Ismaelites have made it.

Moab and the Agarenes, Gebal and Amon and Amalech, the alyau^tes with the
inhabiters of Tire.

For the Assyra^s came with the^, they are become an help to the children of
Loath.

Do unto the^ as unto Madian and Sysare, even as unto Iabin at the broke Cyson.

They peryshed in Endor, they became even as the donge of the earth.

^ake their princes like Oreb, and zeb, and zebee, and Salmana.

Enen al their princes that have said: let us possess the holy place of God by
inheritance.

My God, make them like a whele and as the stuble before the wind.

Eue^ as the fire that burns up the wod, and as the flamme that consumes the
mountains.

So shall thou persecute them in thy tempest and trouble them in thy wrath.

^yll thou their faces with shame, and they shall seek thy name O Lord.

Let the^ be shamed and troubled to gether for evermore, let the^ be confounded
also and peryshe.

And let the^ know yt thy name is the Lord: thou only art ye highest above all
the earth.

The.lxxxiii. psalm.
O How beloved are thy tabernacles thou Lord of powers? my soul desires and
longs for the courts of the Lord.

My heart and my flesh have reioysed in the living God.

For the sparow has found her a house, and the turtle dove a nest for her
self where she may lay her young ones.

Even thy altars O Lord of powers, my king and my God.

Blessed are they yt dwell in thy house, they shall praise the for ever.

Blessed is the man whose help comes of the: the mocyons in his heart has he
ordered in the valley of tears, eue^ in the place that he has set.

For the lawmaker shall give blessings: they shall go from virtue to virtue,
the God of gods shall be in Sion.

Hear you my prayer o Lord god of powers: pondre it with thine ears thou God
of Jacob.

Behold O God our defender, and consydre the face of thine anointed.

For one day in thy courts is better then thousands.

I have chosen to be an abiecte in the house of my God, rather then to dwell in
the tabernacles of sinners.

^or God loves mercy and truth, grace and glory shall the Lord give.

He shall not dyisaponte them of good things that walk in innocence: O Lord
of powers blessed is the man that puts his trust in the.

(...)
THou have blessed thy land O Lord, thou have turned away the captivity of
Jacob.

Thou have forgeuen ye iniquyte of thy people, al their sins have thou
covered.

Thou haste swaged all dyspleasure, thou haste turned away from the wrath of
thine indignacyon.

^onuerte thou us O God our sauyoure, and turn away thy wrath from us.

Wylt thou be angrye with us for ever? Or wylt thou stretche out thy wrath from
generacio^ to generation?

Thou must turn (O God) and quycken us, and thy people shall rejoice in the.

Show us thy merry O Lord, and grant us thy salvation.

I will harken what the Lord God speaks in me, for he will speak of peace
toward his people.

Both upon his saints, and upon them that are turned to a better mind.

But his salvation is nigh them that fear him, that glory may dwell in our
land.

Mercy and truth have met together, righteousness and peace have kyssed one
another.

Truth is spro^ge out of ye earth, and ^^^^hteousnes has looked down from
heaven.

For the Lord shall show loving kyndnesse, and our land shall give her
fruit.

Righteousness shall walk before him, and in the way shall she set his

The.lxxxv. Psalm.
Bow down thine ear O Lord and hear me, for I am helpless and poor.

Preserve you my soul, for I am holy: my God, save thy servant that puts

^or thy mercy is great upon me, and my soul have thou delivered from the

THe foundacio^s of her are in holy mountains: ye Lord loves ye gates of

Very excellent things are spoken of the thou city of God.

there.

Shall not a man tell this unto Sion? he also was borne in her, and he him
self (even the most highest) has laid the foundacyon of her.

The Lord shall declare it in the scriptures of ye people, and of those
princes which have been in her.

In the is the dwelling of all such, as are joyful.

The.lxxxvii. Psalm.
O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before the.

Let my prayer enter i^ thy sight, enclyne thine ear to my peticio^.

For my soul is filled with troubles, and my life is come nigh unto hell.

I am reputed as they be that go down into ye pit, I am become even as a man
fre without help among the deed.

Like as wounded men lyenge in graves, whom no man thinks upon any more, and
are cast away from thy hand.

They have laid me in ye lower pit, even in darck places, and in the shadow
of death.

Thy heavy indignacyo^ lies sore upon me, and all thy floudes have thou brought
over me.

Thou have put away mine aquayntaunce far fro me, they have even abhorred me.

I was utterly given over, and went not out: mine eyes failed for very miserye.

I cried unto ye o lord, all y^ day long held I out my hands unto ye.

Wylt you do wonders for the^ that be deed? Or shall physicia^s raise them up
again, and they then give thanks unto the.

Shall any man declare they mercy in his grave, and they truth in destruccyon?

Shall thy wonderful works be known in darkness, and thy justice in the
land of forgetfulness?

And I cried unto the O Lord, and earlye in the morning shall my prayer come
before the.

Why doste you refuse my prayer O Lord? thou turnest away thy face fro me.

I am poor, and in labors fro my youth up: I was exalted, but I am brought
low and in trouble.

Thy displeasures have gone through in me, and thy terrors have vexed me sore.

They have come about me like water all the day long, they have compassed me
together on every side.

Thou have put away fro me my friend and neighbor, and mine aquayntaunce
because of my miserye.

The.lxxxviii. psalm.
My singing shall be allwaye of the loving kyndnesses of the Lord.

From generacyon to generacio^ will I be telling of thy truth in my mouth.

For thou haste said: Mercy shall be set up in the heavens for ever, thy truth
shall be prepared in them.

I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant:
thy sede will I prepare for ever.

and thy seat will I set up from generacyon to generacyon.

^he heavens shall praise thy wonderful works O Lord, yee^, and thy truth in
the congregacyons of saynctes.

^or who shall be compared unto the Lord among the clouds? who shall be like
unto the Lord among the children of God?

^od which is gloryfyed in the counsayll of saints, is great and to be
feared, above all those that are round about him.

^ Lord God of powers, who is like unto the? Thou Lord art mighty, and thy
truth is round about the.

^hou have domynyon over the power of the sea, thou styllest the ragynge of his
floudes.

^hou have brought down the proud even as a wounded man: in the arm of thy
power haste utterly destroyed thine enemies.

The heavens are thine, and the earth is thine, y^ co^pace of ye earth and the
fullness thereof have you builded, the north and the sea have thou created.

Tabor and Hermo^ shall rejoice in thy name: thine arm is not without power.

Let thy hand be strengthed, and thy right hand exalted: righteousness and
judgment are the garnyshynge of thy seat.

Merly and truth shall go before thy face: blessed is the people yt can be
thankful.

In the light of thy countenance (O Lord) shall they walk, in thy name also
shall they rejoice all the day long, and in thy righteousness shall they be
exalted.

For thou art the glory of their power, and in thy good pleasure shall our
horn be set up on hye.

For our promocyon comes of the Lord, even of the holy one of Israel our
king.

Thou spakest then in a vysyon unto thy saints, and saydest: I have appointed
help in one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of the people.

I have found David my servant, with my holy oil have I anointed him.

For my hand shall help him, and mine arm shall strength him.

The enemy shall prevail nothing in him, and the child of inyquyte shall
not take in hand to hurt him.

His enemies also shall I smite down before his face, and turn them to
flyghte that hate him.

Both my truth and my mercy shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be
exalted.

And I shall set his hand in the sea, and his right hand in the floudes.

He has called upon me: Thou art my father, my God, and the defendour of my
salvation.

And I will make him my first borne, hyer then the kings of y^ earth.

My mercy shall I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall be sure unto
him.

His sede also will I make to endure for ever, and his trone as ye days of
heaven.

But if his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments.

If they break mine ordinances, and keep not my commandments.

I shall visyte their inyquytyes with the rod, and their sins with stryppes.

But my mercy will I not with draw from him, nether will I hurt him in my truth.

Nether will I break my covenant: and the words that proceade out of my
lyppes, will I not dysanulle.

Once have I sworn in my holiness: I will not lie unto Danid, his sede shall
endure for ever.

His seat also shall be as the son in my sight, and as the moon which is
perfect for ever and a faithful witness in heaven.

But thou have cast away and destroyed thine anointed, thou have pro^onged the
time with him.

Thou have turned back the covenant of thy servant, his sanctuary have you
unhallowed in earth.

All his hedges have thou destroyed, his strong hold haste thou made to shake.

All such as went by the way, have spoiled him, he is become a rebuke unto
his neghbours.

Thou have set up the right hand of them that suppress him, you have made all
his enemies glad.

Thou have turned away the succoure of his swerd, and have not helped him in
the war.

Thou have destroyed hi^ clean, and broken down his seat in earth.

Thou haste shortened the days of his time, thou have filled him with shame.

How long turnest thou away? for ever? shall thy wrath burn as hot as fire?

Remember what my substance is: for have thou ordained all the children of men
in vain?

That man is he, that shall live and not se death? shall one deliver is own
soul from hell?

There are thy old mercyes O Lord, as thou have sworn unto David in thy
truth?

Remember Lord the rebuke yt many nacyons have done to thy servants, which I
have kept still in my bosom.

Where as thine enemies have slaundred, where as they have slaundred the
conuersyon of thine anointed.

^lessed be the Lord for evermore: so be it, so be it.

^^^^^ psalm.
THou O Lord art become a refuge unto us from generacyon to generacyon.

Before the mountains were made, or the earth, and ye round world fashioned,
thou art God from everlasting and world without end.

Turn not man away al to low and thou saydest: be converted ye children of
men.

For a thousand years are in thy sight but even as yesterdaye that is past.

And as a watch in the night: Their years shall be things which are esteemed
for nothing.

In the morning let it fade away like the herb, let it floryshe early and be
gone: in the evening let it fall away, let it wax hard and be dried up.

For in thy wrath we are consumed away, and in thine indignacion are we
troubled.

Thou have laid our iniquities in thy sight, ye course of our time in the
light of thy countenance.

For all our days are waysted away, and we are consumed in thy displeasure.

Our years shall labor as does the spyder, the days of our years are in
them selves three score years and ten.

But if four score years be in our powers, then is ye remnaunt of them both
labor and pain.

For meekness comes upon us, and we shall be chastened.

Who knows ye power of thy displeasure, and can express thy wrath how
fearful thou art?

Even so declare thou thy right hand, and in heart make us learned in wisdom.

Turn the O Lord: how long? and be entreated of thy servants.

We have early been replenished with thy mercy, we have been glad and
refreshed in all our days.

We have been in gladness for the days in the which thou dyddest humble us,
and for ye years wherein we saw aduersyte.

Look upon thy servants and upon thine own works, and gyde their children a
right.

And let the bryghtnesse of the Lord our God be upon us, and order thou the
works of our hands over us, and prospere the work of our hands.

The.xc. Psalm.
WHo so dwells within the help of the most highest, shall remain in the
proteccion of the God of heaven.

He shall say unto the Lord: you art my defender and my refuge, my God, my
trust shall be in him.

For he has delivered me from the snare of the aunters, and from the sharp
sword.

With his wings has he over shadowed the, and under his feathers shall thou
put thy trust.

His truth shall be round about the for a shylde, thou shall not be afraid for
any fear in the night.

For the arowe flyeng in ye day time, for any busynes yt walks in darkness,
for any violence and deuell of the none day.

A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand on thy right hand, but
it shall not draw nigh unto the.

Yet shall thou behold with thine eyes, and se the reward of sinners.

For thou Lord art my hope, thy house of defense have thou set most hye of all.

There shall no harm come to the and the scourge shall not draw nigh unto thy
tabernacle.

For he has given a charge unto his angels concerning the, to keep the in all
thy ways.

In their hands shall they bear the, lest thou hurt thy foot against a stone.

Thou shall go upon the adder and noisome serpent, and shall tread down the
lion and the dragon.

Because he has put his trust in me, I shall deliver him: I shall defend him
because he has known my name.

He has cried unto me, and I shall hear him, I am with him in his trouble, I
shall deliver him and bring him to honor.

With length of days shall I endewe him, and show him my salvation.

The (...) Psalm.
IT is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to praise thy name, O
most highest.

To declare thy mercy earlye in the morning, and thy truth by night.

^po^ the psaltery of ten stringes with a song upon the harp.

^or thou have made me to delight in thy ha^dy work, and in the works of thy
hands will I rejoice.

^howe excellent are thy works O Lord? thy thoughts are exceadynge deep.

^n unwise man will not know these things, and a fool will not understand
them.

When sinners spring up as grass, and wha^ they that work iniquyte have an
outward show.

That they may peryshe for ever: but thou Lord endurest for evermore the most
Highest.

For lo, thine enemies Lord, for lo, thine enemies shall peryshe: and all such
as work iniquite, shall be scatred abroad.

And my horn shall be exalted as the horn of an unicorn, and so shall my age in
abundaunce of mercy.

Mine eye also has seen his desire upon mine enemies, and so shall mine ear
hear of the wicked that rise up against me.

The ryghteous shall flourish like a palm tree, even as a Cedre of Libanus
shall he increace.

They that be planted in ye house of the Lord, shall floryshe in the courts
of the house of our God.

They shall yet increace more, eue^ in a plentyfull age, and very well content
shall they be to show.

How that the Lord our God is true, and that there is no unrighteousness in
him.

The.xcii. Psalm.
THe Lord is king, he has clothed him self with worship: y^ Lord is clothed
with strength and he has gyrded him self.

For he has made sure ye round compase of the earth, which will not be
removed.

Thy seat has been prepared of old, thou art from everlasting.

The floudes (O Lord) have lift up, the floudes have lift their voice.

The waves of the sea are wonderful, wonderful is the Lord on hye.

The testymonies are become exceadynge faithful: holiness becomes thy house
(O Lord) for evermore.

The.xciii. Psalm.
GOd is the Lord of vengeance, the God of ve^geau^ce has dealt graciously.

Set up thy self thou that iudgest the earth, give the proud their reward.

How long shall sinners O Lord, how long shall sinners tryumphe?

They will commen and speak of iniquite: all such as work unrighteous,
will talk thereof

Thy people (O Lord) have they brought low, and thine inherytaunce have they
vexed.

The wedowe and stranger have they slain, and put fatherless children to
death.

And they have said: the Lord shall not se it, nether shall ye God of Jacob
understand it.

Understand this ye ignorant among the people, and be wise once ye fools.

He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? or he that made ye eye, does not
he se?

He that chasteneth the nations, even he that teaches man knowledge, shall not
he rebuke?

The Lord knows the thoughts of men, that they are vain.

Blessed is the man whom thou lernest O Lord, and teach him out of thy law.

That thou may ease him in the days of aduersite, till ye pit be dygged up
for the sinner.

For ye Lord will not cast away his people, and his inheritance will he not
forsake.

Till righteousness be turned into judgment: and they yt be nigh it, are all
such as be true of heart.

Who shall rise up with me against ye wicked? Or who will ^^and with me against
the workers of unrighteousness?

If the Lord had not helped me, my soul had allmoost dwelt in hell.

If I said: my foot is slypte, thy mercy (O Lord) helped me.

After the greatness of my sorrows in my heart, thy comfortes have refreshed my
soul.

Does the seat of iniquyte cleue unto the, thou that ordeynest diligence in the
commandment?

They shall hunt for the soul of the ryghteous, and condemn innocent blood.

The Lord also is become my refuge, and my God is become the help of my hope.

And he shall reward the^ their iniquyte, and in their malice shall he
destroy the^, even ye Lord our God shall bring them to naught.

will not cast away his people.

^or in his hand are all the borders of the earth, and the tops of the
mountains are his.

For his is the sea, and he made it, and his hands fashioned the dry land.

O come, let us worship and fall down flat, and weep before the Lord that
made us, for he is the Lord our God.

We also are ye people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.

To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hertes:

As in the prouocacyon: even as at the day of tentacyon in the wilderness.

Where your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works.

Fourtye years was I grieved with that generacyon, and said: they do ever err
in their heart.

And they regarded not my ways, so yt I swear i^ my wrath: they shall not
enter into my rest.

sanctifyeng.

Ascrybe unto the Lord ye nacyons of the heythen, ascrybe unto the Lord
worship and honor, ascrybe unto y^ Lord the glory of his name.

Bring sacrifyces, and enter into his courts, worship ye the Lord in his
holy court.

Let all the earth tremble at his presence: tell it out among the nacyons, that
the Lord is king.

For he has reformed the compace of the earth which shall not be removed: he
shall judge y^ people in equity.

Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea stere and all
that therein is: the feldes shall joy and things that be in them.

because he comes, eue^ because he comes to judge y^ earth.

He shall judge the round world in equity, and y^ people i^ his truth.

The.xcvi. Psalm.
THe Lord is king, let the earth be glad, let many yles rejoice.

The heavens have declared his righteousness, and all people have seen his

Confounded be all they that worship graven images, and they that rejoice in

For thou art the highest Lord above all the earth, you art exalted far above all

He has remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel.

All the borders of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

Rejoice before God all ye earth, sing and be glad, and give thanks.

Praise the Lord upon ye harp, even upon the harp and with singing of
psalm, in trompettes and in playenge upon the shaume.

Rejoice ye in the syghte of the king, even the Lord: let the sea move and

spoke he unto them.

They kept his testimonies, and the commandment that he gave them.

O Lord our God, thou heardest them, thou O God wast merciful unto them, and
a punysher of all their own inuencyons.

Magnyfye ye ye Lord our God, and worship him in his holy mountain, for the
Lord our god is holy.

The.^^^^. psalm.
BE joyful in God the whole earth, serve the Lord in gladness.

Praise ye his name, for sweet is the Lord: his mercy endures for ever, and
his truth through out all generacyons.

The.c. psalm.
I will sing of mercy and judgment, the O Lord will I praise.

And in the way that is undefiled, shall I have understanding, when thou
come unto me.

In the innocencye of my heart did I walk through out my house.

I meddled with no unrighteous matter before mine eyes: unfaithful doers have I
hated.

A froward heart has not cleued unto me: a wicked man that shroncke fro me,
would not I know.

Who so preuely bacbyted his neighbors, him did I persecute.

A proud look and an insatiable heart, with such one did not I eat.

Mine eyes shall look for such as be faithful men of the earth, that they
may sit with me: who so walks in the way that is undefiled, he shall be my
servant.

He that medleth with pride, shall not dwell within my house: who so speaks
unrighteous words, has not sped in the sight of mine eyes.

I slew all ye sinners of the land, and that right soon: to ye intent that I
might destroy out of the cite of the Lord, all workers of iniquyte.

The (...).
LOrd hear thou my prayer, and let my co^playnte come unto the.

Turn not away thy face from: in what day so ever I am troubled, enclyne
thou thine care unto me.

In what day soever I call upon the, hear thou me, and that soon.

For my days are waysted away like somke, and my bones are dried up as it
were a fyrebrand.

I am smytten down like grass, and my heart is withred away, for I have
forgotten to eat my bred.

Through the voice of my gronynge, my bone has hanged to my flesh.

I am become like a pellycane of the wilderness, I am even as the night crow
in a little house.

I have watched, and am become like a sparow sitting alone in the house top.

All the day long did mine enemies reuyle me, and they that praised me, were
sworn against me.

In so much yt I did eat ashes as bred, and myxte my drink with weeping.

At the sight of ye wrath of indignacyo^, for where as thou had dest lift me
up, you have thrown me down.

My days are past as a shadow, and I am wethred away like grass.

But thou Lord endurest for evermore, and so does thy memorial from
generacyon to generacyon.

When thou stondest up, you must have mercy upon Sion, for ye time to have mercy
upon her is come, for the time is come.

For her stones do like thy servants, and they will have pytye on her land.

The nations also shall fear thy name O Lord, and all the kings of the earth
thy glory.

For the Lord has builded Syon, and shall appear in his glory.

He has had respect unto the prayer of the lowly, and has not despised
their petycion.

Let these things be written in another generation, and the people that shall be
borne, shall praise the Lord.

For he has looked down from his hye holy place, out of heaven did the Lord
behold the earth.

To hear the gronynges of such as be in captivity: even to deliver the
children of the slain.

That they may declare ye name of the Lord in Sion, and his praise in
Jerusalem.

In gatherynge the people together, and kings to serve the Lord.

He answered him in the way of his power: O show me the shortness of my days.

Call me not away in ye mids of my days: thy years endure from generation
to generation.

Thou Lord in the beginning laydest the foundation of ye earth and the
heavens are the works of thy hands.

They shall peryshe, but thou endurest still, and they all shall wax old as
does a garment.

As a covering also shall thou change the^, and they shall be changed: but
thou thy self art one still and thy years shall not fail.

The children of thy servants shall continue, and their sede shall prospere
for ever.

The.(...) Psalm.
Praise the Lord o my soul and let all that are within me, praise his holy
name.

Praise thou the Lord O my soul, and forget not all his benefytes.

Which has mercy on all thine iniquities, and heals all thine infirmities.

Which saves thy life from destruction, which crowns the in mercy and
loving kyndnesse.

Which satisfyeth thy desire in good things: thy youth shall be renewed as ye
youth of an Aegle.

The Lord shows mercies and judgment for all such as suffer wrong.

He shows his ways unto Moses, his pleasures unto the children of Israel.

The Lord is full of pity and compassion, longsuffrynge, and very merciful.

He will not always be angrye, nether will he threaten for ever.

He has not done unto us acordynge to our sins, nether has he rewarded us
after our iniquities.

For according to the heyght of heaven from the earth, he has stablyshed
his mercy upon them that fear him.

As far wide as the east is from the west, even so far has he set our
iniquities from us.

Like as a father pytyeth his children, so has the LORD had compassion on
the^ that fear him, for he knows whereof we be made.

He has remembered that we are but dust: a man is eue^ grass, his day shall
floryshe as the flower of the field.

For the breath shall go through him, and he shall vanyshe away, and know his
place no more.

Bnt the mercy of the Lord shall endure from everlasting and for evermore upon
them that fear him.

And so shall his righteousness upon their chylders children: even unto such
as keep his covenant.

And are mindful of his commandments, to fulfill them.

The Lord has prepared his seat in heaven, and his kingdom shall have
dominion over all.

O praise the Lord all ye angels of his, ye mighty in power fulfyllynge his
word, that men may hear the voice of his sayenges.

O praise the Lord all ye his powers, ye ministers of his, which execute his
will.

Praise the Lord all ye works of his in every place, of his domynion: Praise
thou the Lord O my soul.

Praise the Lord o my soul: O Lord my God thou art become exceadynge
glorious.

^hou have clothed thy self with praise and bewtye, thou art deckte with light
as with a garment.

^tretchynge out the heaven like a skin, thou that couerest the upper parts
thereof with waters.

Thou that make y^ cloud thy charet, thou that walk upon ye feathers of
the wyndes.

It is thou that make thine angels spretes, and thy mynisters a burning
fire.

It is thou that haste laid the earth upon her foundacio^, it shall never
shrynke.

The deep is as it were a coueri^g of the garment thereof: ye waters will stand
above the hills.

At thy rebuke they shall fly, at the noise of thy tho^der they shall be afraid.

They rise up to the mountains and come down to the place of the plain that
thou have ordained for them.

Thou have set them their bonds which they shall not ouerpasse, nether shall
they turn again to cover the earth.

It is thou that castest up sprynges among the valleys: even in the mids
between the hills shall the waters go through.

All the beasts of the field shall drink, the wild asses shall wait for
them in their thyste.

Above them shall the fowls of the air have their habytacyon, they shall
sing from among the stonye rocks.

Thou waterest the mountains from above, the earth shall be filled with the
fruit of thy works.

Thou bryngest forth grass for catell, and herb for the use of men.

That thou may bring forth bread out of the earth, and that wine may
make glad the heart of man.

To make ma^s countenance cheerful with oil, and that bread may strength
the heart of man.

The trees of the field shall be full of sap, and so shall the Ceders of
Libanus which he has planted: there shall sparowes make their nestes.

There is the Gryffons house, he is the chief of them: the hye mountains are a
refuge for wild hertes, the stonye rock for the hedge hogs.

He ordained the Moon in time: the Sun has known his going down.

Thou have appointed darkness and it is night wherein al beasts of the wod
wylbe sterynge abroad.

The lions whelps roarynge that they may get a pray, and seek their meat at
God.

The sun aryseth, and they are gathered together, and will lay themselves
down in their couches.

Man will go forth to his work and to his labor until the evening.

Bow excellent are thy works O Lord? thou have ordained all things in
wisdom: the earth is filled with thy riches.

^oo is also this see, great and large of power, there as be crepynge things,
whereof there is no no^bre.

Small beestes with y^ great: ships shall there be going through.

There is yt dragon, whom you have made to take his pastyme with it: All things
do wait on the, that you may give the^ meat in time. When thou geuest it
them, they shall gather it up: wha^ thou openest thine hand, all things shall be
replenyshed with goodness.

But when thou turnest away thy face, they shall be troubled: thou shall take
away their sprete, and they shall dye, and return again into their dust.

Send out thy sprete, and they shall be created, and thou shall renew the face
of the earth.

Let the glory of the Lord endure for ever: the Lord will rejoice in his
own works.

It is he that looks on the earth, and makes it to shake: even he which
touches the mountains, and they smoke.

I will sing unto the Lord in my life, I will praise my God, aslonge as I
have my being.

Let my words be pleasant unto him, and my delight shall be i^ y^ Lord.

Let the sinful and unrighteous be consumed out of the earth, so that they have
no more being: praise thou y^ Lord O my soul.

Praise ye the Lord.

The.ciiii. Psalm.
O Give thanks unto the Lord, and call ye upon his name, show his works
among the nacyons.

O sing unto him, and praise him, be telling of all his wonderful works.

The praise yt ye have, is in his holy name:: let their heart rejoice that seek
the Lord.

O seek the Lord, and ye be sure, seek his face allwaye.

Think upon his marvelous works which he has brought to pass, his wonders,
and judgments of his mouth.

The sede of Abraham are his servants, and the children of Jacob are his
chosen.

^e is the Lord our God, hys^ judgments are in all the whole earth.

He has been ever myndfull of his covenant, even the word yt he has
commanded to a thousand generacyons.

Which he ordained for Abraham, and his ooth yt he swear unto Isaac.

And appointed it unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting
testament.

Saying: unto the will I give the land of Chanaan, the measure of thine
inheritance.

When they were of a small no^bre, very few, and sogeourners of the land.

And they went through from nacyon to nacyon, and from one kingdom to another
people.

He suffered not a man to hurt them, ye he reproved even kings for their sakes.

Touch not ye mine anointed, and do no harm among my prophets.

He called for a derth also upon the land, and destroyed all the substance of
bred.

He sent a man before the^, Joseph was sold to be a bond servant.

They kept down his fete in fetters, the iron pierced his heart till his word
came.

The word of ye lord tried him: the king sent, and delivered him: the prince
of the people sent, and let him go.

He made him master of his house, and ruler of all his possessyon.

That he should instruct his prices as him self, and teach his elders
prudence.

Israel also came into Egypt, and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Cham.

And he increased his people exceadyngly, and made them stronger then their
enemies.

Their heart turned, so that they hated his people, and dealt craftily with his
servants.

He sent Moses his servant, and y^ same Aaron whom he did chose.

He put in them y^ words of his miracles and wonders in the land of Cham.

He sent darkness and stopte their light, and used no bitterness in his
words.

He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fyshes.

And their land brougthe forth frogs, eue^ in their kings preuye chambres.

He spoke the word, and their came noisome flies and lyce in all their borders.

He turned their raynes i^to hayle stones, even into a consumynge fire in their
land.

He smote their vyneyardes also and their fygtrees, and brake down the wod of
their coasts.

He spoke the word, and there came the greshopper and the locuste, of whom
there was no nombre.

And in their land it did eat up all the grass, and devoured all the fruit
of their land.

And he smote every first borne in their land, even y^ first fruits of all
their labor.

He brought the^ forth also with silver and gold, and among their trybes
there was none sick.

Egypt reioysed in their departing, for they were afraid of them.

He spread out a cloud to couerthe^, and a fire to show the^ light in the
night season.

They desired, and the quayle came, and he filled them with the bread of heaven.

He brake up the stonye rock, and the waters flowed out, ryuers came forth in
the dry land.

For he was myndfull of his holy word, which he spoke unto Abraham his servant.

And he brought out his people in joy, and his elect in gladness.

The lands of the Heythen gave he unto them, and they possessed the labors of
the people.

That they should keep his statutes, and seek after his law.

Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.

The.cv. psalm.
O Give ye thanks unto the Lord for he is gracyous, for his mercy endures
ever.

Who shall express the powers of y^ Lord? who shall show forth all his
praises?

Blessed are they y^ observe judgment, and execute righteousness at all times.

Remember us O Lord, according to the good will that thou bear unto thy
people: visyte you us in thy salvation.

That we may behold the felycyte of thy chosen, that we may rejoice in the
gladness of thy people: to the intent that thou may be praised with thine
inheritance.

We have sinned with our fathers, we have done unjustly, we have committed
inyquyte.

Our fathers understood not thy wonderful works in Egypte^, they were not
myndefull of the multitude of thy mercy.

And they provoked him when they went up into the sea, even y^ reed see.

And he saved them for his names sake, that he might declare his power.

And he rebuked the reed see, and it dried up, and he led them forth in the
depthes as in the wilderness.

And he saved them from y^ hand of such as hated them, and delivered them from
the hand of the enemy.

And the water overwhelmed those that troubled them, not one of them remained.

And they believed in his words, and extolled his praise.

They had soon done, they for gat his works, and would not abide his
counsayll.

They fell to lustynge also in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desrete.

And he gave them their desire, and sent them enough after their minds.

And they angered Moses in y^ tents, and Aaron the sayncte of the Lord.

The earth opened, and swalowed up Dathan, and overwhelmed the congregacyon of
Abiron.

And the fire kyndled in their assemble, the flamme brent up y^ sinners.

And they made a calfe in Oreb* and worshypped the graven image.

And they turned their glory in to the symilitude of a calfe that eats hay.

They forgot God yt saved them, even him that did great acts in Egypt,
wonderful works in y^ land of Cham, fearful things in the reed see.

And he said that he would destroy them, if Moses his elect had not stand
before him in the grappe.

To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them: and they thought
scorn of that pleasant land.

They gave no credence to his word, and murmured in their tents: they
harkened not unto the voice of the Lord.

And he lift up his hand over them, to overthrow them in the wilderness.

And to cast out their sede among the nacyons, and destroy the^ in the lands.

They joined the^ selves also unto Beel Phegor, and did eat the sacryfyces of
the deed.

And they angered him in their own inuencyous, and the plage increaced among
them.

And Phinees stood up, and was accepted, and the plage ceased.

And it was counted unto him for righteousness through out all generacyons for
evermore.

And they angered him at the waters of strife, and Moses was vexed for their
sakes, for they provoked his sprete.

And he spoke plainly with his lyppes: They destroyed not the nacyons of whom
the Lord (...) unto them.

They were myxte also among the Heythen, and learned their works, and served
their graven images, and it turned to their own decay.

And they offered up their sons and their daughters unto deuels.

And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their
daughters, whom they offered up to the graven images of Chanaan.

And the land was utterly stained in blood, and defiled in their works, and
they committed fornicacio^ in their own inuencyo^s.

And the Lord was angrye with heuye indignacyon against his people, and he
abhorred his own inheritance.

He gave them over also into y^ hands of the Heythen: and they that hated
them, had dominyon over them.

And their enemies troubled them, and they were brought in subjection under
their hands.

Many a time did he deliver the^, but they provoked him in their own
counsayll, and were brought down in their iniquyties.

And he saw when they were troubled, and herkened unto their (...).

He thought also upon his testament, and it repented him according to the
multitude of his mercy.

Ye he granted them favor in the sight of all those that had taken them
captyue.

Gave you us O Lord our God, and gather us together from among the nacyons.

That we may give thanks to thy holy name, and rejoice in thy praise.

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel world without end, and all people shall
say: So be it, so be it.

Praise ye the Lord. O Praise the Lord.

(...).
O Give thanks unto y^ Lord, for he is gracyous, for his mercy endures ever.

Let them speak that are redeemed of the Lord, eue^ they whom he has
delivered out of the hand of the enemies: from among the nacyons has he
gathered them together.

Out of the east and west, out of the north and south.

They went astraye in the (...) wilderness, they found not the way of ye
city of their habitacio^

Hongry and thyrstie, their soul faynted in them.

They cried also unto the Lord when they were troubled, and he delivered them
out of their necessyties.

And he led them forth into the right way, that they might go into the city
of their habitacion.

O that me^ would praise y^ goodness of the Lord, and the wonders that he
does for the children of men.

For he has satisfied the emptye soul, and filled the hongrye soul with good
things.

Even them that sat in ye darkness and shadow of death, bound in misery and
iron.

For they provoked ye words of God, and angered the counsayl of the most Highest.

And their heart was humbled in labors, and their strength was abated, nether
was there any man to help them.

And they cried unto the Lord when they were troubled, and he delivered them
out of their necessyties.

He brought them also out of darkness and shadow of death, and (...) up
their bonds.

O that men would praise ye mercy of the Lord, and the wonders that he does
for the children of men.

For he has broken down the brazen gates, and smytten ye iron bars asunder.

He took them from the way of their inyquyte, for by reason of their
vnryghteousnesses were they brought down.

Their soul abhorred all manner of meat, and they drew nigh unto the gates of
death.

and they cried unto the Lord when they were troubled, and he delivered them
out of their necessyties.

He sent his word, and healed them and delivered them from their destruccyons.

^that men would praise ye mercy of the Lord, and the wonders that he does
for ye children of me^.

And offer the sacrifyce of thankesgeuynge, and declare his works in gladness.

They that go down to the sea in ships, doing their business in the great
waters.

These have seen ye works of ye Lord, and his wonders in the deep.

He spoke the word, and the stormy wind arose, and the waves thereof were
alofte.

Up they go to the heavens, and down they come to the depthes, their soul
faynted in ye trouble.

They were vexed, and reled to and fro like a dronken man, and all their
wisdom was consumed.

And they cried unto the Lord when they were troubled, and he brought them
out of their necessyties.

He turned his storm also to fair wether, and his waves were still.

And they reioysed because they were at rest, and he brought the^ forth to the
haven of their desire.

O that me^ would give thanks to the Lord for his mercy, and wonders done for
the children of me^.

That they would magnifye him also in the congregacyon of the people, and
praise him in the seat of the elders.

He turned the ryuers into a wilderness, and the yssues of water into drouth.

A fruitful land made he bare^ for the wickedness of them that dwelt therein.

He made of the wilderness, po^des of waters: and of dry land, water
sprynges.

There also set he the hongrye, and they made them a city of habytacyon.

And they sowed feldes and planted vynyardes, and they yielded fruit of increace.

And he blessed the^, and they were multiplied exceadyngly, and their catell
did not he mynishe.

And they became few, and were vexed through the trouble and sorrow of
aduersyte.

Strife was poured out upon princes, and he made them to go astraye in the
wilderness out of the way.

He helped the poor also from mysery, and made him housholdes like sheep.

The just shall se this and rejoice and all inyquyte shall stop his mouth.

Who is wise and will observe these things? and understand the mercyes of the
Lord.

The (...). Psalm^.
MY heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready: I will sing and give thanks in
my glory.

Up thou psaltery and harp: I will arise and that early.

I will give thanks unto the (O Lord) among the people, and praise the among
the nations.

For thy mercy is great above y^ heavens, and thy truth extends unto the
clouds.

Be thou exalted (O God) above the heavens, and thy glory above all the earth.

That thy beloved may be delivered: save me with thy right hand, and hear
me.

God has spoken in his holy one: I will tryumphe and deuyde Sichem, and mete
out the valley of the tabernacles.

Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine, Ephraim also is the strength of my head.

Judah is my king, Moab is the pot of my hope.

Into Idumea will I stretch out my shoe: the strangers are become my friends.

Who shall bring me into the strong city? Who will bring me unto Idumea?

Shall not thou o God that have cast us of? and shall not thou go for the
among our armies, O God.

Grant thou us help out of trouble, for vain is the help of man.

In God we shall do myghtely, and he shall bring our enemies to naught.

The.^^iii. Psalm.
Keep not thou my praise in syle^ce O God, for y^ mouth of the sinner and the
mouth of the dysceatfull is opened upon me.

They have spoken against me with a dysceatfull tongue, and with words of
hatred have they compassed me about, and fought against me without a cause.

In stead of the love that they ought to have borne unto me, they slaundred
me, but I gave my self to prayer.

They yielded me also evil things for good, and hatred for my love.

Apoynt thou a sinner to be ruler over him, and let the deuell stand on his
right hand.

When he is judged, let him go forth condemned, and let his prayer be turned
into sin.

Let his days be few, and his bisshopryke another take.

Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a wedowe.

Let the children wandre like vagaboundes and go a beggynge: let them be
thruste out of their dwellynges.

Let the credytoure search out all his substance, and let strangers spoil
his labor.

Let him have no helper, and let there be none to pytie his fatherless children.

Let his children come to destruction, let his name be abolyshed even in one
generacyon.

Let the iniquyte of his fathers be remembered in the sight of the Lord, and
let not his mothers sin be put out.

Let them be allwaye in ye sight of ye Lord, and let the remembrance of them
peryshe from out of the earth, because he was not myndfull to do mercy.

He persecuted also the helpless and poor man, and him that was vexed in
heart, to slaye him.

And he loved cursynge, and it shall come to him: ye he had no mind unto
blessing, and it shall be kept away from him.

And he put on cursynge as a garment, and it entered into his bowels as water,
and as oil in his bones.

Let it be unto him as ye rayme^t wherwyth he is covered, and as the gyrdle yt
he is ever gyrded with.

Let the^ be thus handled i^ ye sight of ye lord, yt blaspheme me, and that
speak evil against my soul.

And have thou to do with me O Lord for thy names sake, for sweet is thy mercy.

Deliver me, for I am nedye and poor, and my heart is troubled within me.

I am taken away, even as the shadow when it departs: and am shaken of as
the greshoppers.

My knees are weak through fasting, and my flesh is altered for lack of
fatness.

And I am become a rebuke unto them: they looked upon me, and wagged their
heads.

^elpe me o Lord my God, save thou me according to thy mercy.

and let them know, that this is thy hand, and that thou have done it.

^hey shall curse, and thou shall bless: let them yt rise up against me be
confounded, and thy servant shall rejoice.

^et them that slander me, be clothed with shame: and let them be covered with
their own confusion as with a cloak.

^ will give great thanks unto the Lord in my mouth, and among many will I
praise him.

Which has sto^de at the right hand of the poor, to save my soul from
persecutours.

THe Lord said unto my lord: sit thou on my right hand.

Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.

The rod of thy power shall the Lord send out of Sion: be thou Lord among

With the was the beginning in the day of thy power in the bryghtnesse of
saynctes: out of the womb before the day star have I begotten the.

The Lord has sworn, and it shall not repent him: Thou art a pressed for ever
after the order of Melchisedech.

The Lord on thy right hand, has destroyed even kings i^ the day of his
wrath.

He shall be judge among the nacyons, he shall make up the things that be
decayed, he shall smyt a sunder the heads in the land of many.

He shall drink out of yt broke in the way, therefore shall he lift up his
head.

Praise ye the Lord.

The (...) Psalm.
Unto y^ o Lord will I give thanks with my whole heart, in the counsel and
co^gregacyon of the ryghteous.

Great are the works of ye Lord, chosen out according to all his pleasures.

Thankesgeuynge and praise is a work of his, and his righteousness endures
for ever.

The merciful and gracyous Lord has ordained a memorial of his wonderful
works: he has given meat to them yt fear him.

He will allwaye be myndfull of his testament, the power of his works shall he
declare unto his people.

That he may give them the inheritance of y^ heythen: the works of his

Good understanding have all they that do thereafter: the praise thereof

Where is spro^ge up in darkness a light to them yt be true of heart, he is

Cheerful is the man that has pytie and lends, he shall order his words in

The righteous shall be in an ever lasting remembrance, he shall not be afraid
for any evil tydinges.

His heart is ready to trust in the Lord, his heart is stablysshed, he will
not shryncke, till he se his desire upon his enemies.

He has distrybuted, he has given to the poor, his righteousness endures

The sinner shall se it, and be angrye, he shall gnasshe with his tethe and
fret him self: the desire of sinners shall perisshe.

Praise ye the Lord.

The.cxii. Psalm.
Praise the Lord O ye children, O praise the name of the Lord.

Blessed be the name of the Lord from hence forth and for evermore.

Praise worthy is the name of the Lord from the risynge up of the Son to the

The Lord is hye above all nacyons, and his glory above the heavens.

Who is like unto the Lord our God, which dwells on hye, and beholds

^aysynge up the helpless from the ground, and lyftynge up the poor out of

To set him with the princes, even with the princes of his people.

Which makes the baren woman to dwell in the house, a glad mother of children.

AT the departing of Israel out of Egypt, at y^ departing of the house of
Jacob from among the rude people.

Iewrye was his sanctuary, Israel his dominyon.

The sea saw it and fled, Jordan turned back.

The mountains leapte for joy like rams, and the little hills like young
sheep.

What ayleth the thou see, that thou fleddest? and thou Iordane, that thou
waste turned back?

He mountains leapte for joy like rams, and ye little hills as the young
sheep.

The earth trembled at the presense of the Lord, at the presence of the God of
Jacob.

Which turned ye hard rock in to pondes of waters, and the flynt stone in to
water sprynges.

Not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give thou the glory.

For thy mercy, and thy truth, lest at any time the nacyo^s say where is
their God?

As for our God, he is in heaven, he has done all things what so ever has
pleased him.

The ydols of the Heythe^ are silver and gold, the works of men's hands.

They have mouth, and will not speak: eyes have they and shall not se.

Ears they have, and shall not ear: nastrels have they, and shall not smell.

Hands they have and shall not handle: fete have they and shall not walk,
they shall not cry in their throat.

Like unto the^ be they that make them, and all that trust in them.

The house of Israel has put their trust in the Lord, he has been their
helper ad their defendoure.

The house of Aaron has trusted in the Lord, he has been their helper and
their defendoure.

They that fear the Lord, have put their trust in the Lord, he is their
helper and their defendoure.

The Lord has remembered us, and has blessed us.

He has blessed the house of Israel, he has blessed ye house Aaron.

He has blessed all them fear the Lord, the small with the great.

The Lord increace you more and more, you and your children.

Blessed be you of ye Lord, which made heaven and earth.

All the heavens are the Lords, but the earth has he given to the children of

The deed shall not praise the O Lord, nether all they yt go down in to hell.

But we that be living, give thanks unto the Lord, from this time forth and
for evermore.

Praise ye the Lord.

The.^xiiii. psalm.
I Am in love with the Lord, for he will hear the voice of my prayer.

For he has enclyned his ear unto me, and in my days will I call upon him.

The sorrows of death came about me, and the dangers of hell found me out.

I found trouble and heaviness, and called upon the name of the Lord.

O Lord, deliver thou my soul: gracyous is y^ Lord and righteous, and our God
is merciful.

The Lord preserves the little one: I was brought low, and he delivered me.

Get the to thy rest O my soul, for the LORD has done the good.

I will please the Lord in the land of the living.

Let all ye house of Aaron now confess, that his mercy endures ever.

Let all such as fear the Lord, now confess that his mercy endures for

From out of my trouble I called upon the Lord, and the Lord heard me at
large.

The Lord is my helper, I shall not fear what man may do unto me.

The Lord is my helper, and I will not set by mine enemies.

It is good to trust in the Lord, rather then to put any confydence in man.

It is good to trust in the Lord* rather then to trust in princes.

All nations came about me, and in the name of the Lord (it is come to pass)
that I am avenged of them.

They compassed me and kept me in on every side, and in the name of the Lord
(it is come to pass) that I am avenged of them.

They came round about me like bees, and were as hot as fire among the
thorns, and in the name of the Lord (it is come to pass) that I am avenged

I was thrust at, and undermined, to the intent that I should fall, and the
Lord held me up.

The Lord is my strength and my praise, and is become my salvation.

The voice of reioysynge and of salvation is in the dwellynges of the ryghteous.

The right hand of the Lord has done the deed, the right hand of the Lord
exalted me, the right hand of the Lord has done the deed.

O let me not dye, but live, and I shall show the works of ye Lord.

The Lord with his correccyon chasted me, and gave me not over unto death.

Open ye unto me the gates of righteousness, and when I am come into the^, I

I will give thanks unto the, for thou have heard me, and art become my

Save thou me o Lord: O Lord send us good prosperyte: blessed be he that

I have been myndfull of thy name in the night (O Lord) and have kept thy
law.

It is become mine own, for I have dilygently sought out thy statutes.

Heth.
THou art my porcyon (o lord) I am determined to keep thy law.

I have humbly made my peticyon to thy presence in my whole heart: O have thou
mercy upon me according to thy word.

I have called mine own ways to remembrance, and have turned my fete into
thy testimonies.

I am ready, and it greueth me not, to keep thy commandments.

The roapes of sinners have co^pased me round about, and thy law have I not
forgotten.

At mydnyght rose I up to give thanks unto the, for the judgments of thy
ryghteousmakynge.

I am partaker of all them yt fear the, and keep thy commandments.

The earth (Lord) is full of thy mercy: o teach you me thy statutes.

^eru.
GRaciously have thou dealt with thy servant (o Lord) even according to thy
word.

O teach thou me goodness, and nourtour, and knowledge: for I have believed thy
commandments.

Before I was brought low, I did amysse: therefore have I kept thy word.

Thou art good, and in thy goodness teach thou me thy statutes.

The iniquyte of y^ proud is increaced upon me: but I in my whole heart will
search out thy commandments.

Their heart is crudded like milk: but my study has been in thy law.

It is good for me that thou have brought me low, to y^ intent that I may
learn thy statutes.

The law of thy mouth is a good thing unto me, above thousands of gold and
silver.

(...).
THy hands have made me and fashioned me: O give thou me understanding, yt I
may learn thy commandments.

They that fear the, shall se me. and be glad, because I have had great trust
unto thy words.

^ have known (lord) yt thy judgments are eq^te, and in thy truth have
thou brought me low.

O let thy mercy be so, yt it may comfort me, according to thy word unto
thy servant.

O let thy louinge kyndnesses come to me, and I shall live, for thy law is my
meditacyon.

Let the proud be confounded, for cruelly have they handled against me without
any just cause: but I wylbe occupied in thy commandments.

O let such as fear the, and have known thy testimonies, be converted unto
me.

Let my heart be undefiled in thy statutes, that I be not confounded.

(...).
My soul has longed sore for thy salvation, and in thy word have I had a
fervent trust.

Mine eyes have longed sore for thy word: saying: when wylt thou conforte me?

For I am become even as a bottell that is brent up: thy statutes have I not
forgotten.

How many are the days of thy servant? when wylt thou execute judgment of my
persecutours?

The unrighteous have showed me fables, but they are not after thy law.

All thy commandments are the truethe: the unrighteous have persecuted me,
help thou me.

They allmoost made an end of me in the earth, but I have not forsaken thy
commandments.

O quicken thou me according to thy mercy, and I shall observe ye testimonies
of thy mouth.

O Lord, thy word endures for ever in heaven.

From one generacio^ to another does thy truth remain: you laydest the
foundacyon of the earth, and it abides.

Through thine ordinance do the days continue: All things serve the.

If thy law were not my study, then should I happly have perished in mine
aduersyte.

Thy statutes will not I forget for ever, for in them have you quyckened me.

I am thine, O save me, for I have diligently sought out thy statutes.

Sinners have waited for me to destroy me: thy testymonyes have I understand.

I have seen an end of every thing at the last: thy commandment is
exceadynge broad.

(...).
O How have I loved thy law O Lord? All the day long is it my meditacyon.

Thou through thy commandment have made me wyser then mine enemies, for it is
mine for ever.

I have had more understanding then all my teachers, for thy testimonies are my
study.

I have had more understanding then old men, for I have sought out thy
commandments.

I have refrayned my fete from every evil, that I may keep thy words.

I have not swarued from thy judgments, for thou have taught me.

O how sweet are thy words unto my throat? ye more then honey unto my mouth.

Out of thy commandments have I gotten understanding, therefore have I hated
every way of iniquyte.

(...).
THy word is the lantern to my fete, and the light to my paths.

I have sworn, and am determined, to keep the judgments of thy
righteousness.

I am brought low on every side, Lord quycken thou me according to thy word.

Accept thou the frewyll offerynges of my mouth O Lord, and teach me thy
judgments.

My soul is allwaye in my hands, and thy law have I not forgotten.

Sinners have laid a snare for me, and I have not gone astraye from thy
commandments.

Thy testymonies have I obtained by enheritaunce for ever, for they are the
joy of my heart.

I have applied my heart to acco^plishe thy statutes for ever, because of the
reward.

(...).
I Have hated the unrighteous, and thy law have I loved.

Thou art my helper, and maynteyner, and in thy word have I trusted
exceadingly.

Away fro me ye wicked, and I will search out the commandments of my God.

O receive thou me according to thy word, and let me live, and put me not to
confusyon fro my hope.

Help thou me, and I shall be safe, and shall occupye my self allwaye in thy
statutes.

Thou haste despised all the^ that depart away from thy judgments, for their
ymagynacyon is unrighteous.

All the sinners of the earth have I esteemed unfaithful transgressors,
therefore have I loved thy testimonies.

O pearce thou my flesh through with the fear of the, for I am afraid of thy
judgments.

(...).
I Have executed judgment and righteousness: O give not thou me over to my
oppressors.

Beceaue thy servant to good: O let not the proud oppress me.

Mine eyes have longed sore for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
righteousness.

O deele with thy servant according to thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.

I am thy servant: O give me understanding, yt I may know thy testymonyes.

It is time (Lord) to be doing: they have destroyed thy law.

Therefore have I loved thy commandments about gold and precious stone.

Wherefore I was up right toward all thy commandments: every unrighteous
way have I hated.

Phe.
THy testimonies are wonderful, therefore has my soul searched them out.

The declarynge of thy words gives light, and minystreth understanding unto
babes.

^ opened my mouth, and drew in my breath, for I lo^ged after thy
commandments.

^oke thou unto me, and have mercy upon me, according to the judgment of them
that love thy name.

Order my goynges after thy word, and let no unrighteousness have rule of me.

O deliver me from the wrongful dealings of men, that I may keep thy
commandments.

^hewe the light of thy face upon thy servant, and teach me thy statutes.

Mine eyes gusshed out with water, because they kept not thy law.

(...)
Ryghteous art you O Lord, and true is thy judgment.

Of thy righteousness, thy testimonies, and thy truth, haste thou given
strayte commandment.

My zele has made me even to consume away, because mine enemies have forgotten
thy words.

Thy word is tried in the fire exceadyngly, and thy servant has loved it.

I am small and despised: thy statutes have I not forgotten.

Thy righteousness is a righteousness for ever, and thy law is the truth.

Trouble and sorrow have found me out, thy commandments are my meditacion.

Thy testimonies are equity for evermore: O give me understanding, and I shall
live.

(...).
I Have cried in my whole heart hear me O Lord: I will seek after thy
statutes.

I have called unto the: O save me, that I may keep thy commandments.

I came by times and cried, for my fervent trust have I set in thy words.

Mine eyes prevented the morning earlye unto the, yt I might occupye my self
in thy words.

Hear my voice (O Lord) after thy mercy, and quycken thou me according to
thy judgment.

My persecuters drew nigh to iniquite, but they are far from thy law.

Thou art nigh O Lord, and all thy ways are truth.

As touching thy testimonies, I knew not at the first, that thou have
stablyshed them for ever.

(...)
O Look upon my low estate, and deliver me, for I have not forgotten thy law.

^e thou judge in my cause, and deliver me: O quycke^ me for thy words sake.

Salvation is far from wicked sinners, for they have nor dilygently sought
out thy statutes.

Great are thy mercyes o Lord, quycken thou me according to thy judgment.

Many they be that pesecute me and trouble me: I have not swerued from thy
testimonies.

I saw the unfaithful tra^sgressours, and it grieved me, because they kept not
thy words.

Consydre (O Lord) how that I have loved thy commandments: quycken thou me
in thy mercy.

The sum of thy words: all ye judgments of thy righteousness endure for
evermore.

(...)
Princes have persecuted me without cause, and my heart stood in awe of thy
words.

Over thy words will I rejoice even as one that has found great spoils.

I have hated and abhorred iniquyte, but thy law have I loved.

Seven times in the day have I praised the, for the judgments of thy
righteousness.

Great peace have they that love thy law, and they are not offended.

I looked for thy salvation O Lord, and thy commandments have I loved.

My soul has kept thy testimonies, and loved the^ exceadingly.

I have kept thy commandments, and thy testimonees, for all my ways are in
thy sight.

(...)
LEt mine humble prayer draw nigh in thy sight O Lord: give me understanding
according to thy word.

Let my request have intraunce in thy sight: O deliver me according to thy
word*

My lyppes shall fall to thankesgeuynge, when thou have taught me thy statutes.

My tongue shall plainly declare thy word for all thy ways are truth.

O let thine hand be so that it may save me, for thy commandments have I
chosen.

I have longed for thy salvation O Lord, and thy law is my study.

My soul shall live and praise the, and thy judgments shall help me.

I have gone astraye even as a sheep that is lost: O seek thou thy servant,
for thy commandments have I not forgotten.

(...).
When I was in trouble, I cried unto the Lord, and he heard me.

Lord, deliver thou my soul from unrighteous lyppes, and from the dysceatfull
tongue.

What thing may be given the or what may be laid on for the, even for the
dysceatfull tongue?

The sharp arowes of the mighty, with coals of desolacion.

^oo is me, for my dwelling in a strange country is prolonged: I have dwelt with
the inhabitours of Cedar, my soul has dwelt long as a stranger with them
that hated peace.

I labored for peace: when I spoke unto them, they resisted me without a cause*

The.cxx. psalm.
I Have lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: from whence shall my help come?

My help comes eue^ from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.

O that he which keeps ye would not suffer thy foot to slide, nor fall a
sleep him self.

Behold, he that preserves Israel, will nether slo^ber nor sleep.

The Lord preserves the, the Lord is thy defense on thy right hand.

The Sun shall not burn y^ by day, nether the Moon by night.

The Lord keeps the from all euel, the Lord preserve thy soul.

The Lord preserve thy coming in and thy going out from this time forth and
for evermore.

The.cxxi. psalm.
I Rejoice in the words that were said unto me: we will go into the house of
the Lord.

Our fete were standing in thy courts O Jerusalem.

It is Jerusalem that is builded as a city, which is at unity in it self.

For thither came up the trybes, even the trybes of the Lord, the testimony of
Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord.

For there were set the seats in judgment, the seats upon the house of David.

O pray ye for the prosperyte of Jerusalem, and plenty have they that love the.

Peace be in thy power, and welthe be in thy strong holds.

Because of my brethren and my neghboures, I spoke peaceably on thy behalf.

Because of the house of ye Lord our God I have sought good things for the.

(...).
Unto the that dwell in y^ heavens, have I lift up mine eyes.

Behold as y^ eyes of servants are in the hands of their masters, even as
the eyes of an ha^dmayde in the hands of their mastresse, so are our eyes
lokynge unto the Lord our God, till he have mercy upon us.

Have mercy on us O Lord: have mercy on us, for we are greatly abhorred.

For our soul being greatly filled therewith, is even a rebuke unto the
welthy, and a despyte unto the proud.

The.cxxiii. Psalm
Except the Lord had been among us (may Israel now say) except the Lord
had been among us:

When men rose up against us happly they would have swalowed us up quycke.

When their heuye dyspleasure was moved against us, ye water peradventure had
drowned us up.

Our soul went through ye broke, peradventure our soul had gone through an
intolerable water.

Blessed be the Lord, which has not given us over for a pray unto their tethe.

Even as a sparowe is our soul escaped from ye snare of ye hu^ters.

The snare is broken, and we are delivered.

Our help stands in ye name of ye lord, which made heaven and earth.

The.^^^iiii. Psalm.
THey that put their trust in the Lord, are even as mou^t^^ion: he shall not be
shaken for ever, yt dwells in Jerusalem.

There are mountains round about it, and the Lord is on every side of his
people from this time forth and for evermore.

For ye lord will not leave ye rod of sinners upon ye lot of ye ryghteous, that
ye ryghteous put not forth their hands to iniquyte.

Do well O Lord, unto those that be good and true of heart.

As for those yt depart away, the Lord shall bring them into bonds with
the workers of iniquyte: Peace be upon Israel.

The.cxxv. Psalm.
When the Lord was a turnyng ye captyuite of Sion we became as they that are
comforted.

Then was our mouth filled with joy, and our tongue in gladness.

Then shall they say among the nacyons: the Lord has dealt excellently with
them.

Wonderfully has ye Lord dealt with us: we are become glad men.

Turn you our captyuite o Lord: let it be as a water broke in the south.

They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy.

In their going, they went and wept, casting out their seeds.

But in their return, they shall come with joy, bringing their sheaffes with
them.

The.cxxvi. Psalm.
Except ye Lord be ye buylder of ye house, they have labored in vain that
build it.

Except the Lord preserve the city, he watches in vain that keeps it.

A vain thing is it for you to rise before day: get you up after ye have sit,
ye that eat the bred of carfulness.

Seeing he gives sleep to his beloved: behold, children, goods, the fruits
of the womb, are an heretage of the Lord.

Even as the arowes in the hand of the mighty, so are ye children of such as
be sent out.

Happy is the man yt has filled his desire with them: he shall not be
confounded when he shall speak unto his enemies i^ ye gate.

The.cxxvii. Psalm.
BLessed are all they that fear the Lord, even they that walk in his ways.

The labors of thine own hands shall you eat: happy art thou, and thou
shall prospere.

Thy wife shall be as a plentiful vine within the walls of thy house.

Thy children shall be as young olyues round about thy table.

Lo, thus shall the man be blessed that fears the Lord.

The lord bless the out of Sion, that you may se the prosperity of
Jerusalem all ye days of thy life.

That thou may se also thy chylders children, and peace upon Israel.

The.cxxviii. Psalm.
MAny a time have they fought against me from my youth (may Israel now say.)

Many a time have they fought against me fro my youth, because they might not
overcome me.

^ynners have builded their works upon my back, they have prolonged their
iniquyte.

^he ryghteous Lord shall cut down ye hard necks of sinners: let them be
confounded and turned backward, all they that have hated Sion.

^et them be as the grass of the house tops, yt withers away before it be
plucte up.

Therwyth, he that shall mow it, shall not fill his hand: nether he his
bosom, that shall gather up the sheafes.

and they that went by said not: the blessyng of the Lord be upon you, we
have wyshed you good in the name of the Lord.

(...)
OVt of the deep have I cried unto ye O Lord, Lord hear thou my voice.

^ let thine ears mark ye voice of mine humble peticyon.

^f thou lord wylt look extremely to our iniquities, lord who shall be able to
abide it?

For with ye (O Lord) there is mercy, and because of thy law I have waited for
the.

My soul has been pacie^t in his word, in the Lord has my soul trusted.

From the morning watch until ye night: let Israel put their trust in the
Lord.

For with the Lord there is mercy, and with him there is plenteous redempcyon.

And he shall deliver Israel from all their inyquyties.

(...)
Lord, my heart is not exalted, nether are mine eyes set up alofte.

I have nether walked in great matters, ner in things to hye for me.

If I have not been of a lowly mind, but exalted my soul.

Even as a child is weened from his mother, so let me be rewarded in to my
soul.

^et Israel put their trust in the Lord, from this time forth now and for
evermore.

The.cxxxi. psalm.
Lord, remember David, and all his lowly meekness.

^owe he swear unto the Lord, and vowed a vow unto the God of Jacob.

I will not enter into the tabernacle of my house, I will not clyme up upon the
bed where I lie.

I will give mine eyes no sleep, mine eye lyddes no slombring, and rest to my
temples.

Till I find out a place unto ye Lord, even a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.

Behold, we have heard of it in Ephrata, and found it in the plain feldes
of the wodde.

We will go in to his tabernacle, we will worship in the place where his fete
stood.

^ryse (O Lord) into thy rest, thou and the arc of thy sanctifyenge.

O let thy prestes be clothed with righteousness, and let thy saynctes rejoice.

For David thy servant sake turn not thou away the face of thine anointed.

The Lord has sworn ye truth unto David, and shall not disapoynte him: of
the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy seat.

If thy children will keep my covenant, and these my testimonies that I shall
teach them.

Then shall their children also sit upon thy seat for evermore.

For the LORD has chosen Sion, he has chosen her for an habitacyon unto him
self.

This shall be my rest for ever here will I dwell, for I have chosen her.

^yr wedowe will I surely bless, and her poor will I satisfye with bred.

^yr prestes will I deck with salvation, and her saints shall be glad for joy.

^hyther will I bring forth ye horn of David, I have prepared a lantern for
my anointed.

^ys enemies will I clothe with confusyon, but upon him shall my holiness
floryshe.

Behold, how good and how pleasant, a thing it is, brethren to dwell

It is he that brings forth the wyndes out of his treasuryes, even he that
smote the first borne of Egypt, from man to beast.

The.cxxxviii. psalm.
THou hasttryed me (o Lord) and known me, thou have known my down sitting
and my vprysynge.

Thou have understand my thoughts afar of: my path and my live have thou

And all my ways haste you seen before hand, for there is not a word in my tongue.

Behold, thou Lord have known all things, last and first: thou have
fashioned me, and laid thine hand upon me.

Thy knowledge is to wonderful for me, it is to hye, and I shall not be able to
atteyne unto it.

Whyther shall I go from thy sprete? and whyther shall I fly out of thy sight?

If I go up into heaven, thou art there: if I go down to hell, thou art
present.

If I take my wings earlye in the morning, and remain in the vttemoost
parts of the sea:

Even thither shall thy hand bring me, and thy right hand shall take hold
upon me.

And I said: peradventure the darkness shall cover me, and then was my night
turned unto light in my pleasures.

For the darcknesse shall not be hyd from the, and the night shall be as light as
the day, even as is y^ darkness of it, so is also the light thereof.

For thou have possessed my reins, thou have taken me up, even fro my mothers
womb.

I will give thanks unto the, for thou art magnifyed exceadingly: wonderful

From the is not my bone hyd, which thou made in secret, and my substance

The.cxxxix. Psalm.
Deliver me O Lord from the evil man, ryd me from the unrighteous man.

Whyh have ymagined iniquyties in their heart, all the day long did they stere
up strife.

They have sharpened their tongues like serpents, the poison of Adders is under
their lyppes.

Preserve me O Lord from the hand of the sinner, and deliver me from
unrighteous men.

Whch have ymagined to undermine my goynges: the proud have preuely layede a
snare for me.

And coardes have they spread out for a snare, even by the way side have they
layede a trappe for me.

I have said unto ye Lord: thou art my God: hear O Lord the voice of mine
humble peticyon.

O Lord Lord the power of my salvation, thou have covered my head in the day
of war.

Deliver me not over (o lord) unto ye sinner, ^trarye to my desire: they are
minded against me, O forsake me not, lest they tryu^phe.

The head of their compasynge, the labor of their own lyppes shall
ouerwhelme them.

Coals shall fall upon the^, thou shall cast them forth into the fire in there
myseries, they shall not be able to stand.

An evil tonged man shall not prospere in earth, plages in destruction shall
come upon the unrighteous man.

Sure I am, that the Lord will maynteyne the cause of the helpless, and avenge
the poor.

But ye ryghteous shall give thanks unto thy name, and the just shall dwell
with thy cou^tenau^ce.

(...).
Unto ye o lord have I cried: O hear me, consydre my voice when I cry unto
the.

Let my prayer be direct in thy sight as incense: let the lyftynge up of my
hands be an evening sacrifyce.

Set a watch (O Lord) unto my mouth, and a door of aduyseme^t unto my lyppes.

Suffer not thou my heart to enclyne unto the words of malice, to cloak
excuses in sins:

With men that work iniquyte, and I will not be partaker with their chosen.

The ryghteous shall refourme me in mercy, and rebuke me: but the oil of ye
sinner shall not anoynte my head.

For yet also shall my prayer be to do them good: their judges being nigh unto
the hard rock, were swalowed up.

They shall hear my words, for so might they have done: Even as the fatness
of the ground is broken up upon the earth.

porcyon in the land of the living.

look for me till you reward me.

i^ thy treuth, even i^ thy righteousness.

justified in thy sight.

the works of thy hands did I exercise my self.

water.

^eare me O Lord, and ye spedely: my sprete is waxed faint.

down into the pytte.
