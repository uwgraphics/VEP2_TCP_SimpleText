Certain godly / learned / and comfortable conferences / between the two
Reverend Fathers / and holy Martyrs of Christ / D. Nicolas Rydley late
Bishop of London / and M. Hughe Latymer Sometime Bishop of Worcester /
during the time of their emprysonmentes.

Whereunto is added.

A Treatise against the error of Transubstantiation / made by the said
Reverend Father D. Nicolas Rydley.

M.D.LVI.

Right dear in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.

Psalm. 116. To The Reader.
GRace and peace / etc. Good Christian Reader her are set forth for thine
instruction / and comfort / certain learned / and comfortable conferences /
Between the two Reverend / and godly fathers M. Rydley / and M. Latymer: whose
bodies the Romish tyranny of late has tormented / and fire has consumed:
whose sowles mercy has embraced / and heaven has received / yelding the one
unto the enemy to death / for testimony of the truth / commending the other
unto god in suer hope of life. Where unto is also added a learned treatise / and
a clear confutation of the fond / and wicked opinion of Transubstantiation
written by the said M. Ridley. And forasmuch as these their scrolles / and
writings were by gods good providence preserved / and as it were raked owte of
the ashes of thauthors: co^teini^ge as well comfortable co^solatio^ for such
as are in the schole of the cross / as also good / and profitable admonition
for them which either of ignorance / either of infirmity / or by flattering of
them selfs with vain pretenses / do yield unto the wicked world: the
reverence due to the reverend fathers / the zeal toward the setting forth
of the tried truth / and the ready good will to conforte / and confirm
weak consciences / would not suffer the any longer to want these small
treatises / and yett no small treasures. That as in life they profited the by
teaching / and in death by example / so after death they may do the good by
writing. And albeit the matter of it self is sufficient to commend it self /
yet it cannot be but the worthiness of the writers / will increase creditte /
and give no small authority to the writings. M. Latymer came earlier in the
morning / and was the more ancient workman in the lords vineyarde / Matt. 20.
who also may very well be called (as diverse learned men have termed him) the
Apostle of England: as one much more worthy of that name / for his true
doctrine / for his sharp reprouinge of sin / and superstition / then was
Augustine bishop of Canturburie for bringing in the popes monkerie / and false
religion. M. Ridley came later about theleuenth hour / but no doubt he came
when he was effectuallye called / and from the time of his calling / became a
faithful / labourer terrible to the enemies for his excellent learning / and
therefore a meet man to rid owte of the lords vineyarde the sophistical
thorns of the wrangling adversaries / which did well appear in all
disputations / and conferences that were in his time / and partlye does appear
in these short treatises following. But what shall it need in many words to
praise them / whose lyfes were most commendable / whose deaths were most
glorious? in office and vocation both like / in labor and trauail both
faithful / in learning and judgment both sound: in mind and manners both
mild / but in gods cause both stout. For neither threatened death /
neither love of present life / could shake the foundation of their faith /
firmly grounded upon the suer rock Christ. Matt. 7.
They redeemed liberty of conscience / with the bondage of the body / and to
save their lyfes / they were content to lose their lyfes. This was not the work
of the flesh / but the operation of gods mighty spirit: who has ever
from the beginning not only builded / but also enlarged his church by the
sufferance of his saints / and sealed his doctrine with the blood of his
martyrs: as S. Augustine speaking of the persecutions in the primative church
does well declare in these words.

Ligabantur, includebantur, caedebantur, De ciuita. Dei lib. 22 cap. 6.
torque bantur, urebantur, and multiplicabantur. That is to say. The
Christians were bound / were emprisoned / were beaten / were tormented / were
burnt / and yet were multiplied.

If Justinius Martyr when he was yet an heathen Philosopher (as he confesses of
him self) was moved to embrace the faith and religion of Christ / Apolog. 1
in beholding the constante patience of the martyrs which suffered for Christ
in his time: how much more ought the patiente suffringe / and voluntary
death of these notable fathers / with many other learned / godly men / in our
days / whose names are written in the book of life / not only move / but also
pearce / and persuade all godly hearts constantely to remain in the truth
known? For undoubtedly the truth of the cawse they suffered for / is most
euidente by gods word / and has been so fully taught / so clearly set
forth by many and sundry writings / that it is open to the Consciences of
all the world / even of the very adversaries themselfes that persequute it
(greater is their damnation) except it be to such / whom the godde of this
world / 2. Cor. 4.
malice / ambition / avarice / or ignorance has blinded. Which thing needs
none other proof (especially for the realm of england) but only to call to
mind with what conscience and constancy / these pyllers of the church that
can not err / have walked in Religion these twentye years by paste / how
they not long agoo received and allowed things / which with fire / and
fagotte / they persequute now / and shranke from that the^ / which now they
most earnestly mainteyne. And allthoughe there appeared in the latter days a
shadow of stowtenesse in a few / yet it was in deed nothing. For it sprange
not owte of any zeal to the cawse / or clearenesse of conscience / but rather
owte of a like subtylle / and foxye presumption / as the Syrians once conceived
/ when they put themselfes in the danger of King Achab saying. 3. Reg. 20.
Behold we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are pitefull /
and merciful. For owte of all dowte K. Henry theyghte could as easily have
obtained at winchesters hands / and others a conformytee in puttyng down the
Mass / and all the reaste / what so ever has been done (by order) sense / if
he had earnestly minded it / as the abolisshinge of the pope / monkerye /
pylgremages / relics / with like baggage: all which are now again / things
well esteemed / and covered (as all the resydew is) with the clooke of the
Catholic church. But to return to the matter we have in hand / in this
littel treatise (good read) thou shalt perceive another ma^er of spirit thou
shalt think (if thou thy self be not very dulle) that thou hear men
speak which had learned the lesson of thapostles / that is / Acto. 4.
to obei godde rather the^ man: and had not learned the Romisshe Epicures
lesson / to apply faith / and religion to the present state of policy / to
turn with the time / and serve all seasons: men before death / dead unto the
world / accowmptynge with S. Paul / all other things to be damage / loss /
and vile / Phil. 3.
that they might win Christ: me^ zealouse for the house of godde / and the
glory of his name: such as had allreadye laid open their consciences / and
infirmitees before the iudgeme^te seat of godde / and had again (through
Christ) received the effect of faith and true righteousness / that is / peace
of conscience / and ioyfullnes in the holy ghooste: Romans 14.
and so had a fulle taste in this mortalle body of immortalitee / in misery
of happiness / in earth of heaven. O England / England / how great is thy
loss for the want of them? how horrible is thine offense for killinge of
them? how greuouse will thy plage be / when the revenger of innocente blood
shall call the to an accowmpte for them / if thou do not repent in time?
Godde grant that the admonitions of these and other godly martyrs may so
warn us / their doctrine so instruct us / and their example so confirm us in
the true knowledge and fear of godde / that flyenge and abhorringe Idolatrye /
and superstition / we may embrace true religion and pierce / forsakinge the
phantasyes of men / we may humblye obey the written word of godde / and ruled
thereby / direct all our doyngs to the glory of his name / and our own
endeles salvation in Christ Jesus / Amen.

In the name of Jesus let every knee bow. Philip. 2.

For the wiseman says: Prou. 18.
One brother which is helped of another is Like a well defensed City.

The causes thatt move me to absteyne from the Mass be these.
It is done in a strawnge tongue which the people does not understand /
contrary to the doctrine off the Apostle / 1. Cor. 14. 1. Cor. 14.


Where is no understanding / H Latym.
there is neither edifyenge / nor conforte: for besides that they speak in to
the air / the mind receives no proffet: They are one to another as alienes /
the Parissheners will say their priests are mad / whereas all things owghte
to be done so as they may ediffie. Let every man know / that the things
which I write (says S. Paul) are the commandments of the lord. 1. Cor. 14.
Such absurditees are to be eschewed.

N.R.
There is also wantynge the showing off the lords death / contrary to the
mind off the Apostle: As often as ye shall eat this bread / and drink off
this Cup / 1. Cor. 11.
ye shall show the Lords death / till he come. What shewinge can be there /
where as no man hears / that it to say understands what is said: No man (I
mean) off the commen people / for whose proffet the prayer of the church
ought specially to serve.

H. L. Luc. 11.
Woo be unto you that take away the keye off knowledge. The Papists study by
all means to make the people ignorante / Lest their ignorante sir Ihons should
be had in Less estimation / or despised: which is clean contrary to Saint
Paul's practice / who wisshed that all men might be fulfilled with all
knowledge / and to be perfect in Christ Jesus / Coloss. 1.
etc. The institution of Christ / if it were rehearsed in the vulgar tongue /
should be / not only a Consecration / but also a fruitful preachinge / to the
edification off the hearers / where as in the popisshe Mass it is neither
understood / nor heard: whils the commen people are utterly ignora^te / what
their priests do / or what they goo abowte / whether they bless / or curse.
The Apostles understood Christ / when he celebrated his supper / Therefore do
these papists swerve from Christ in their Mass.

There is no Communion / but it is made a private Table / and in deed owght to
be a Communion. N. R
For S. Paul says. The bread which we break / 1. Cor. 10.
is the partakynge of the body of Christ. And Christ brake / and distributed
/ and said. Take / Matt. 26.
and eat / etc. But that they make it a private table / it is open. The
papists make the lords table, a private table
For where they be many priests which will communicate / they do it not in
one Table / or altar / but every one off them have their aultars / masses /
and tables.

To make that private which Christ made commen / and willed to be communicated
/ H.L.
may seem to be the workmanshippe of Antichriste him self. The Canons of
thapostles do excommunicate them / which being present at comme^ prayer /
etc. Cano. 10.
do not also receive the holy communion. De Cons. did. 1. cap. Epis.
And unto the same agrees the decree of Anacletus. When the consecration is
done (says) he let all such communicate / as entend not to be excommunicate.

That which is first / is true / that which is Latter / is cownterfayted /
says Tertulliane. But the papists say we do it privately Bicawse we do it
for others. Tert. contra Praxeam.
But where have you your Commission to Mass / and sacrifice for others?

N.R.
The lords commandment of communicating the cup unto the lay people is not
observed according unto the word of the lord: drink ye all of this. Matt.
26.


As often as ye shall eat this bread / and drink of this cup / H.L. 1 Cor.
11.
ye shall show the lords death etc. so that not the partaking of the one only
/ but of both is a showing of the lords death because in his death the
blood was divided from the body / it is necessary that the same division be
represented in the supper / The lords death is not shevued, except both
parts of the Sacra^. be ministered.

Thargument of K. Henry the 8. 2. Cor. 11.


otherwise the supper is not a sheuing of the lords death / etc. Let a man
examine him self / etc. But this word (Homo) is of both gendres / therefore
it is as well commanded to the woman to drink of the cup / as the man /
etc. But the Kings argument once against me was this. When ye come to gither
to eat. He says not / (saiethe he) to drink / I aunswerid it was not
neadfulle seeing that a little before he had made mention of both / in these
words. And so let him eat of that bread / and drink of that cup. Homo /
that is to say as well the woman as the manne. Under the name of bread which
betokenethe all sustinaunce of the body / drink is also understood in the
scriptures. Otherwise they would say that Christ did not drink after his
resurrection with his disciples except Peter had said: Acto. 10.
We did eat and drink with him after he arose from death.

They do seruyllye serve the holy sign (as S. Augustine speaks) in stead
of the thing signiffied / whiles the sacramental bread by a solenne or
commen error is adored / and worshipped / for the flessh taken of the son of
godde. N.R. L. 3. dedo. Chris. c. 9.


If ye deny unto them their corporal presence / H. L.
and transubstantiation / their fantastical adoration will by and by vanissh
away. Therefore be strong in denienge such a presence / and then ye have
won the field. Furthermore / in the first supper celebrated off Christ
himself / there is no mention made off adoration off theleme^tes / who said /
Eat ye / and drink ye / not worship ye. Therefore against Adoration may
be spoken that saying off Christ concerning divorce. Matt. 19.
From the beginning it was not so. But the devil secretly / and by little /
and little / infecteth all Christ's ordinances / and as for the private Mass /
with all the sinews theroff / what manner offthinge it is / may be easelie
perceived by the ready acceptance off the people / whose hearts are prone to
evil even from their yowthe. Genesis 8.


They pluck away the honor from the only sacrifice off Christ / N.R.
whiles this sacramental and Mass sacrifice is believed to be propitiatory
and such a one / as purges the sowles both off the qwicke and the dead.
Contrary to that is writton to the Hebrews. With one offringe has be made
perfect for ever them that are sanctified. Hebr. 10.
And again where remission off these things (that is off sins) is / there is
no more offering for sin.

H. L. Hebr. 2.
By his own person has he purged owr sins. These words (by his own person)
have an Emphasis / or vehemence / which drives away all sacrificinge priests
/ from such office off sacrificinge: saying that which he has done by
himself / he has not left to be perfited by other / so that the purging off
owre sins may more truly be thowgthe paste / and done / then a thing to
comme / and to be done. Yff any man sin / etc. He says not / ^. Joan. 2.
Let him have a priest at home to sacrifice for him / But / We have an
Advocate / the virtue off whose one oblation / endures for ever. S. Paul
says / ^. Cor. 9.
They that serve the Aultare / etc. even so the Lord has ordained / that they
which preach the gospel / should live off the gospel. Why does he not rather
say / they that sacrifice in the Mass?

There be manyfold abuses and superstitions / which are done in the Mass / N.R.
Coniuringe of salt, vuater, and bread.
and abowte the Mass. Salt is coniured / that it may be a coniured salt for
the salvation off the beleuers / to be a salvation / and health hoth off the
mind / and off the body unto everlasting lyffe / to all them that receive it.

Water is coniured / that it may be made a Coniured water / to chase away all
the power off the enemy / to chase away deuels / etc. Bread also has his
second blessinge / that it may be health off mind / and body / to all them
that receive it. Yff we do think that such strength is to be given / to
salt / water / and bread / or if we judge that these things are able to
receive any such virtue / or efficacy / what leave we to Christ our savior?
But if we think not so / why then do we pray on this sort? Forasmoch as all
prayer owght to be done in faith.

As towching the abuses off the Mass / H.L. A book against the mass made by
D. turner.
I refer you to a little book / the title wheroff / is (Mystresse Missa) where
she was justly condemned / and banisshed under pain off burning. But the
deuel has browght her in again / to bring us to burning.

The priest turns himself from the Altar / N.R.
and speaks unto the people in an unknown tongue / sainge / Dominus vobiscum
/ orate pro me fratres et sorores / etc. that is the Lord be with you / and
pray for me brothers and susters / and turnyng from the people / he says in
Latin: Let us parye / and / The peace off the Lord be always with you: Also
the people (or at least / he wihch supplieth the place off the people) is
compelled three times to say Amen / when he has heard never a word off that
the priest has prayed / or spoken / except these few words / Per omnia
secula seculorum / Where as to the answering off Amen / S. Paul wills the
answerer not only to hear / ^. Cor. 14.
but also to understand the things that were spoken.

H. L.
Yea / and Ite Missa est / must be song to them with a great rollinge up and
down off notes / So bydding the^ goo home fasting / when he has eaten / and
dronken up all himself alone. A fellow ones rebuked for goinge away before
Mass was ended / answered / that it was not good manner to tarry till he were
bydden goo. After that he was blamed for not taking holy bread / he answered /
that he was bydden goo away before.

N.R. Vuordes ovute of the Cano^ of the Mass.
The preeste when he lifts up the sacrament / he murmureth to himself these
words: Hec quotiescunque feceritis in mei memoria^ facietis. That is / As
often as ye do these things ye shall do it in remembrance off me. He seems
by his words to speak unto the people / but he suffers not his voice to be
heard off the people.

H. L.
I can not tell to whom the Mass man speaks as he is a lyfftynge / saying
that neither Christ badde him lift / neither is the people allowed to do
those things / and as for that form of words / it is off their own
framinge. But the papists do all things well / be they never so much
deceiptefull workers / taking upon them the viser and Title off the church /
as it were shepes clothing / as though they were the ministers of rigteousnesse /
2. Cor. 11*
where as in deed they are the deuels ministers / whose end shall be according
to their deeds. They roll owte their Latin Language by heart / but in so
doing they make the poor people of Christ altogether ignora^te: and so
much as in them lies / they keep them back from that which S. Paul calls
the best knowledge: 1. Cor. 2
which is / to know rightly the things which are given unto us of Christ.
Butt this is the matter / so long as the priests speak Latin / they are
thought of the people to be meruelouse well learned.

Upon the which vouche safe to look with thy merciful and cheerful
cowntenance. N. Rydl.


What means this prayer for the sacrament it self / if it be / as they say
/ the body off Christ / Vuordes ovute off the Cano^ off the Mass.
if it be godde and man? How should the father not look with a cheerful
countenance upon his only well-beloved son? Why do we not rather pray for
owre selfs / that we / for his sake / may be looked upon off the father /
with a cheerful countenance?

To this let them answer / that so pray: H. L.
Except parauenture this prayer was used long before it was esteemed to be the
body of Christ / really / and corporally: and then this prayer makes well to
destroy the popissh opinion / that it is not the opinion off the church / nor
so awncye^t / as they babble. There be other prayers off the mass / which
parauenture be off like effect / but I have forgotten all Massing matters / and
the Mass it self I utterly deteste / and abhor / and so I confessed openly
/ before our Diotrephes / and other.

A another piece of the Canon of Mass. N.R.
Commawnde these to be carried by the hands of thy holy Awngell unto thy high
Altar / etc. If we understand the body and blood of Christ / wherefore do we
so soon desire the departure off them / before the receipte off the same? and
wherefore brought we them theder by making of them / to let them goo so soon?

Write again I beseech you / fathers / and brethern / most dearly beloved in
Christ / spare not my paper: For I look er it be long / that owr commen
enemy will first assault me / and I wissh from the botome off my heart / to
be helped / not only by your prayers / but also by your wholesome cownsayles.

H L. Matt. 17.
As Peter. Wha^ he said (let us make her three tabernacles) spoke and wiste not
what / so parauenture our Mass men can not tell what they say / speaking so
manifestly against the^ selfs: So that the old proverb may very well be
spoken of the^ / Liars had need to have good memories. A proverb.


Against the sacrifice of the mass yet more by Hughe Latymer.
Ihon Bapt: says / Joan. 3.
A man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven / and S. Paul.
No man takes honor unto himself / butt he that is called of godde / as was
Aaron / etc. Hebr. 5.
But to offer Christ is a great and weyghtie matter / there fore ought no man
to take it upon him withowte a manifest calling / and commission. Butt where
have our sacrificers so great an office committed unto them? Let them show
their commission / and then sacrifice. Parauenture they will say (Do this) is
all one to say / as (offer this) Then I ask what was there done? what was
demonstrated by this pronowne (This) or what did they see done / to whom these
words (Do this) were spoken? if the hole action off Christ / if all that
Christ did / be mente by this word (This) and (Do) is nothing else but
(offer) then the hoole action off Christ is to be offered off the priests:
neither can they / but in so doing satisfy the co^mawndeme^t: And so it should
appear / that neither was there any sacrament instituted for the lay people /
seeing that no such sacrifice / has been done at any time / or is to be done /
of the lay people: neither does it avail much to eat or drink it / butt
only to offer it. Now the text has not that any part of Christ's action was
to offer / forasmoch as the text does not declare that Christ himself did
then offer. And so the action off offering is not contained in this pronowne
(This) Goo thoroughe every word. First / to take / is not to offer / to
break / is not to offer / to give to the disciples / is not to offer / etc.
Worcester said ones to me / that to offer / was contained in (benedicere) which
is not true / for (benedicere) is to give thanks. But he had often given
thanks to godde before / withowte any such offering. And if in giuynge of
thanks Christ offered his body / saying after he had given thanks / he
said (this is my body) then in speaking those words / he did not chawnge the
bread into his body / for as much as he had offered / before those words
were spoken. Hebr. 2.
S. Paul has these words to the Hebr. speakinge off Christ. That he might
be merciful and a faithful high priest in things concerning godde / for to
pourge the peoples sins. So that it may appear that the pourgyng of owr
sins does rather hang heroff that Christ was the high priest offering /
then that he was offered / sauinge in that he was off himself willingly
offered. Then is it not necessary / he should be offered off others: I will not
say a meruelouse presumpteouse act / that the same should be attempted off
any / withowte a manifest vocation for it is no small matter to make an
oblation: And yet I speak nothing that it te^deth partly to the derogation
off Christ's cross / besides also that the offerer / owghte to be off more
excellencye then the thing offered.

The minister of the gospel has rather to do for Christ with the people /
the^ for the people with god / except it be in praynge / and giuinge of
thanks / and so has the people as well to do with god for the minister / the
office of reconciliation sta^dithe in preachi^ge / not in offeringe. We are
messangers in the rowme off Christ (Says S. Paul) he does not say / 2.
Cor. 5.
we offer unto godde for the the people.

If Christ offered in his supper: for whom I pray you? For all: Then his
latter oblation made on the cross / ca^ not be thought to be done for all me^
/. for it was not done for them / for whom the oblation was made in the supper
/ except perauenture he offerid twice for the self same. And that should
argue the vnperfectues of the sacrifice.

Feed ye as much as in you liethe the flock of Christ / 1. Petr. 5.
nay sacrifice raither for the flock of Christ / if the matter be as it is
pretended / and it is mervelle that Peter did forget so high an office saying
in these days sacrificinge is somuche esteemed / preachinge almost nothing at
all. Who art thou if thou ceaseste to feed? a good catholic. But who art
thou / if thou ceaseste to sacrifice and say mass? at the least an heretic.
From whence come these perverse judgments? except parauenture they think
that in sacrificinge they feed / and the^ what neadethe a learned pastoure?
saying no man is so folishe but he can sone learn to sacrifice / and say
Mass.

Paul wrote two Epistles to Timothy / one to Titus / two clergy me^ / he
made also a long sermon ad clerum / Act. 20. but not one word of this mass
sacrifice / Acto. 20.
which could not have been done / if there had been such a one and so highly
to be esteamed.

I have read over of late the new testamente three or four times deliberatly
/ yet can not I find there / The synevues of the mass can not be found in the
nevue test.
nether the popish consecration / nor yet their transubstantyacion / nor their
oblation / nor their Adoration / which be the very synewes / and mary bones
of the Mass. Christ could not be offered but propitiatorely / yet now (hoc
facite) do this: must be as much to say / as sacrifice / and offer my body
under a piece of bread / auaylable / but we can not tell how much. Ah
theafes. Have ye robbed the realm with your sacrifice of lands / and goods /
and now can not tell how much your sacrifice is auailable? as who say it is
so much auailable that the valeu ca^ not be expressed / nor to dear boughte
with both lands and goods. Esa. 64.
The eye has not seen / and the ear has not heard / etc. This is a fine
spunne threade / a conninge piece of work worthelie qualified / and blau^ched
be ye sure. But our nobility will not see / they will not have that religion
that has the cross annexed to it.

Al popish things for the most part are man's inventions where as they
ought to have the holy scripture for the only rule of faith. When Paul
made allegation for him self before Felix the high deputy / he did not
extend his faith beyond the word of god written believing all things (says
he) which are written in the law / Acto. 24.
and the prophets / making no mention of the Rabbis. Moreover they have Moses
and the prophets (says Abraham in the parable) not their persons / Luc. 16.
but their writings. Also faith comes by hearing / and hearing / by the
word of god. Romans 10. Luc. 11. Hieron. in. 23. Matthew. Aug. co^t. lit. Petil.
l. 3. c. 6.
And again: blessed are they which hear the word of god / etc. The things
which have not their authorite out of the scriptures / may as easily be
despised / as allowed / says S. Hierome. Therefore whether it be of Christ /
or of his church / or of any other manner of thing which belongs to our
faith / and liffe / I will not say / If we (says S. Augustine) which are
not worthy to be compared to him that said: Yff we / Gala. 1.
butt that also which forthwith he adds / If an Angel from heaven shall
teach any thing besides that ye have received in the scriptures of the law
and gospel / accursed be he. Diotreph* is described Joan. ep. 3.
Our Diotrephes / with his papists are under this Curse. But how are the
scriptures (say they) to be understood? De doctr. Christ.
S. Augustine answers giuynge this rule. The Circunstances of the scriptures
(says he) lyghten the scriptures / and so on scripture does expownde another
/ Li. 3. c. 28.
to a man that is studiouse / well willinge and often calling upon godde in
contynualle prayer / who gives his holy spirit to them that desire it of
him. Luc. 11. 2. Pet. 1.
So that the scripture is not of any private interpretation at any time. For
such a one though he be a lay man / fearinge godde / is much more fytte to
understand holy scriptures / then any arrogante and proud priest / yea /
then the bishop himself / be he never so great / and glystering in all his
Pontificalles. But what is to be said of the Fathers? How are they to be
esteemed? S. Augustine answers giuyng this rule also / that we should not
therefore think it true bicawse they say so / do they never so much excelle
in holiness / or learning: but if they be able to prove their saying by the
canonical scriptures or by good probable reason: Ep. 19. ad Hieron.
meaning that to be a probable reason (as I think) Which does orderly follow
upon a right collection and gatheringe out of the scriptures.

Let the Papists goo with their long faith / be you contented with the
short faith of the saints / which is reveled unto us in the word of god
written. Adieu to all popissh fantasies / Amen. For one man / having the
scripture and good reason for him / is more to be esteemed himself alone / then
a thousand such as they either gathered together / or succeding one another.

The fathers have both herbs and weeds / and papists commenly gather the
weeds / and leave the herbs. And they speak many times more vehemently in
sound of words / then they did mean in deed / or then they would have done /
if they had forseene what sophistical wra^glers should have succeeded them.
Now the papists are given to brawle about words / to the mayntenance off
their own inventions / and rather follow the sound of words then* atteyne
unto the meaning of the fathers / so that is daungerouse to trust them in
citynge the fathers.

In all aeges the deuel has styrred up some light heads to esteem the
sacraments butt lightly / as to be empty and bare signs / whom the fathers
have resisted so fearsely / that in their fervor they seem in sownde off
words to run to far the other way / and to give to much to the
sacraments / when they did think more mesurably. And therefore they are to be
read warely / with sownde judgment. But our papists / and they seem but a
little soundinge to their purpose / they will owte face / brace / and brag all
me^ / it must needs be as they will have it. Therefore there is no remedy /
namely now when they have the master bowl in their hand / and rule the roste
/ but patience. Better it is to suffer what crueltye they will put unto us /
then to incur gods high indignation.

Wherefore good my Lord be of good cheer in the Lord: with dew
consideration what he reqwireth of you / and what he does promise you. Our
comme^ enemy shall do no more then godde will permit him. 1. Cor. 10.
Godde is faithful which will not suffer us to be tempted above our strength /
etc. Be at a point what ye will stand unto / stick unto that / and let them
both say and do what they list. They can butt kylle the body / which
otherwise is off it self mortal. Neither yet shall they do that when they
list / but when godde will suffer them / when the hour appointed is comme. To
use many words with them / it shall be but in vain / now that they have a
bloudye and deadely law prepared for them. But it is very requisite that ye
give a reasonable accowmpte off your faith / if they will qwietly hear you
Else ye know in a wicked place off Judgment a man may keep silence / 1. Pet.
3.
after the example off Christ. Let them not deceive you with their
Sophistical Sophismes / Luc. 23.
and fallacies: you know that many false things / have more appearance of
truth / then things that be most true: therefore Paul gives us a watch
word. Coloss. 2. 2. Tim. 2.
Let no man deceive you with lyklynesse of speech. Neither is it requisite
that with the contentiouse / ye should follow strife of words / which tend to
no edification / butt to the subversion of the hearers / and the vain
bragginge and ostentation of the adversaries.

Fear off death does most persuade a great number. Be well ware of that
argument / for that persuaded Shaxton (as many men thought) after that he
had ones made a good profession / openly before the judgment seat. The
flessh is weak / but the willingness off the spirit / shall refressh the
weakness off the flessh.

The number off the cryars under the aultare must needs be fulfilled: Apoc. 6.
if we be segregated thereunto / happy be we. That is the greatest promotion /
that godde gives in this world / Phil. 1.
to be such Philippians to whom it is given / not only to believe / butt also
to suffer / etc.

But who is hable to do these things? Surely all our habilitee / all our
sufficience is off godde. He requires / and promyseth. Let us declare our
obedience to his will / when it shall be requisite / in the time of troble / yea
in the mids of the fire.

When that number is fulfilled / which I wene shall be shortly / then have at
the papists / when they shall say Peace / 1 Thessalonians. 5.
all things are safe / when Christ shall comme to keep his great Parlamente
/ to the redress off all things that be amysse. But he shall not comme as the
papists feign him / to hyde himself / and to play bopiepe as it were / under a
piece off bread: but he shall comme gloriously / to the terror and fear off
all papists / but to the great consolation and comfort of all that will her
suffer for him. 1 Thessalonians. 4.
Conforte your selfs one another with these words.

Lo sir / her have I blotted your paper vaynely / and played the fool
egregiously / but so I thought better then not to do your reqweste at this
time. Pardon me / and pray for me: pray for me I say / pray for me I say.
For I am sometime so fearful / that I would creape into a mowschoole /
sometime godde does visitte me again with his comfort. So he comes and
goes / to teach me to feel and to know mine infirmitee / to thintente to give
thanks to him that is worthy / least I should rob him of his duty / as
many do / and almost all the world. Fare you well.

What credence is to be given to papists it may appear by their rackynge /
wrythinge / wrynginge / and monstrously iniuryeng of gods holy scripture / as
appears in the popes law. But I dwell her now in a scoole of obliuiousnesse.
Fare you well ones again. And be you steadfast / and immovable in the Lord.
1* Cor. 15.
Paul loved Timothee meruelouse well / not withstanding he says unto him /
Be thou partetaker off the afflictions off the gospel: and again. 2. Tim. 1.
2. Tim. 4. Apoc. 2.
Harden thy self to suffer afflictions. Be faithful unto the death / and I
will give the a Crown of life / says the Lord.

To H. Latymer.
IN writing again ye have done me an unspeakable pleasure and I pray that
the Lord may reqwyte it you in that day. N. Rydl.
For I have received great comfort at your words / butt yett I am not so
filled withal / but that I thirst much more now the^ before / to drink more
of that Cup of yours / wherein ye mingle unto me profitable with pleasant. I
pray you good father let me have one draughte more to comfort my stomach.
For surely except the Lord assiste me with his graciouse aid in the time of
his service / I know I shall play but the part of a white lyuered knight.
But truly my trust is in him / that in mine infirmitee he shall try himself
strong / and that he can make the cowarde in his cawse to fight like a man.
Sir now I look daily when Diotrephes with his warriors shall assault me
wherefore I pray you good father / for that you are an old sowldyar / and an
expert warrior / and godde knows I am but a young sowldyar / and as yet of
small experience in these fyttes / help me I pray you to buckle on my
harness. And now I would have you to think / that these darts are cast at
my head off some one of Diotrephes or Antonius sowldyars.

The objection of the Antoniane.
All men meruelle greatly / why you / after the libertee which you have
granted unto you / Anton. object. 1.
more then the reaste / do not goo to Mass / which is a thing (as you know)
now much esteemed off all men / yea and off the Qwene her self.

The answer.
Bicawse no man that Lays hand on the plowghe and looks back / N. Ryd.
Luc. 9.
is fytte for the Kingdom off godde. And also for the self same cawse / why
S. Paul would not suffer Titus to be circumcised / which is that the truth of
the gospel might remain with us uncorrupted. Gal. 2. and again / Gal. 2.
If I build again the things which I destroyed / I make my self a
trespasser. This is also another cawse / least I should seem by owtewarde fact
to allow the thing / which I am persuaded is contrary to sownde doctrine:
and so should be a stumblynge stock unto the weak. But woo be unto him by
whom offense comes / it were better for him that a Milnestone were hanged
abowte his neck / and he cast into the mids of the sea. Matt. 18. Marc. 9.


Except the Lord help me ye say / Truth it is. For withowte me (says he)
ye can do nothing / much less suffer death off our adversaries / H. L.
Joan. 15.
through the bloudye Law now prepared against us. But it follows / if ye
abide in me and my words abide in you / ask what ye will / and it shall be
done for you. What can be more comfortable? Sir you make answer your self so
well / that I can not better it. Sir I begin now to smelle what you mean by
traueling thus with me. You use me as Bilney did ones when he converted me /
pretending as though he would be tawghte off me / he sowghte ways and means to
teach me: and so do you / I thank you therefore most heartily. For in deed
you minister armor unto me / whereas I was unarmed before / and unprovided /
sauinge that I give my self to prayour for my refuge.

What is it then that offends you so greatly in the Mass / Anto. object. 2.
that ye will not vouch safe ones either to hear it / or see it? And from
whence comes this new religion upon you / have not you used in times paste to
say Masses your self?

N. Ryd. Ansvu.
I confess unto you my fault and ignorance / But know you that for these
matters I have done open Penance Long agoo both at Paul's Cross / and also
openly in the pulpett at Cambridge / and I trust godde has forgeuen me this
mine offense / for I did it upon ignorance. But if ye be desyrouse to know / 1.
Tim. 1.
and will vouchsafe to hear / what things do offend me in the Mass / I will
rehearse unto you those things which be most clear / and seem to repugne
most manifestly against gods word. And they be these. The strange tongue:
The want off the showing off the Lords death: The breaking of the Lords
commawndement of having a communion: The sacrament is not communicated to all /
Matt. 26.
under both kinds / according to the word off the Lord: The sign is
seruyllie worshipped / for the thing signiffyed. Christ's Passion is iniuryed
/ forasmoch as this Mass sacrifice is affirmed to remain for the purginge off
sin^es: To be short / The manyfolde superstitions / and trifling fondness
which are in the Mass / and abowte the same.

H. Laty.
Better a few things well pondered / then to troble the memory with to much.
You shall prevail more with prayeng / then with studyeng / though mixture be
best. For so one shall alleuiate the tediousness off the other. I entend not
to contend much with the^ in words / after a reasonable accowmpte off my
faith given / for it shall be butt in vain.

They will say / as their fathers said / Joan. 19.
When they have no more to say. We have a law / and by our law he owght to
dye / Be ye steadfast and immovable says saint Paul / and again /
persistito / stand fast. 1. Cor. 15. 2. Tim. 3. Joan. 15. Col. 1.
And how often is this repeted / if ye abide / if ye abide etc. But we shall be
called obstinate / sturdie / ignorau^te / headye / and what not? So that a man
has need of much patience having to do with such men.

But you know how great a crime it is to separate your self from the
communion or feloushippe of the church / and to make a schism / or division.
Anton. object. 3.
You have been reported to have hated the sect of the Anabaptists / and
always to have impugned the same. More over this was the perniciouse error
of Nouatus / and of the heretics called (Cathari) that they would not
communicate with the church.

I know that the unity of the church is to be retained by all means / and
the same to be necessary to salvation. N. Ryd. Ansvu.
But I do not take the mass as it is at this day / for the communion of the
church / but for a popisshe deuyse / whereby both the commandment and
institution of our savior Christ for the often freque^ting of the remembrance
of his death / is eluded / and the people of god is miserablye deluded. The
sect of the Anabaptists / and the heresy of the Nouatians / ought of right
to be condemned / for as much as with out any just or necessary cause /
they wickedlye separated them selfs from the communion of the congregation /
for they did not allege that the sacraments were vnduelye ministered / but
turninge away their eyes from them selfs / where with according to saint
Paul's reule they ought to examine them selfs / 1. Cor. 11.
and castinge their eyes ever upon others / either ministers / or communica^tes
with them / they always reproved some thing / for the which they absteined
from the communion / as from an unholy thing.

H. Laty. Hilarious contra Auxent.
I remember that Calvin begins to confute the Interim after this sort with
this saying of Hilarie. The name of peace is beautiful / and the opinion of
unity is fair / but who doubts that to be the true and only peace of the
church / which is Christ's?

I would you had that little book there should you see how much is to be
given to unity. Romans 15.
S. Paul when he requires unity / he joins straight withal / Secundum
Iesum Christum / according to Jesus Christ / no further. Diotrephes now of
late did ever harp upon unity / unity. Yea Sir (quod I) but in veritee / not
in poperye. Better is a diuersitee / then an unity in poperye. I had
nothing again / but scornful gieres / with commandment to the Tower.

But admit there be in the mass that perauenture might be amended / or at
least made better / Anton. object. 4.
yea / seeing you will have it so / admit there be a fault / if you do not
consent thereto / why do you troble your self in vain? Cypr. l. ^. ep. 2. Au.
ep. 152.
do not you know both by Cyprian and Augustine that communion of sacraments
does not defile a man / but consent of deeds.

If it were any one trifling ceremony / N. Ryd. Ansvuer.
or if it were some one thing of it self indiffere^te (although I would
wish nothing should be done in the church which does not edify the same)
yet for the continuance of the commen quietness I could be content to bear
it. But for as much as things done in the mass tend openly to the overthrow
of Christ's institution / I judge that by no means either in word / or deed I
ought to consent unto it. As for that which is objected out of the fathers
/ I acknowledge it to be well spoken / if it be well understood. But it is
mente of them which suppose they are defiled if any secret vice be either in
the ministers / or in them that communicate with them. And is not mente of them
which do abhor superstition / and wicked traditions of men / and will not
suffer the same to be thruste up on them selfs / or upon the church / in
stead of gods word / and the trewethe of the gospel.

The very may bones of the mass are all to gither H. Laty.
detestable / and therefore by no means to be borne withal / so that of
necessitye the mendinge of it / is to abolisshe it for ever. For if you take
away oblation / and adoration / which do hang upon consecration and
transubstantiacion / the most papists of them all will not set a button by
the mass / as a thing which they esteame not / but for the gain that
follows thereon. For if the English communion which of late was used / were as
gainefull to them / as the mass has been heretofore / they would strive no
more for their mass: From thens grows the grief.

Anton. object. 5.
Consider into what dangers you cast your self / if you forsake the Church:
and you can not but forsake it / if you refuse to goo to Mass. For the Mass
is the sacrament off unity / withowte the Arc there is no salvation. The
Church is the Arc and Peter's ship. Ye know this saying well in oughe /
Aug. li. 4. de Sym. c. 10. In ep. post col. contra Donat.
He shall not have godde to be his father / which acknowlegeth not the Church
to be his mother. More over without the Church (says S. Augustine) be the
life never so well spente / it shall not enheritte the kingdom of heaven.

The holy Catholic or vniuersalle Church / which is the communion of
saints / N. Ryd. Ansvuer. 1. Tim. 3. Apoc. 21. Ephesians. 1.
the house of godde / the City of godde / the spowse of Christ / the body of
Christ / the pyller / and stay off the truth: This Church I believe according
to the Creed. This Church I do reverence / and honor in the Lord. But the
rewle off this church is the word off godde / according to which rewle / we
goo forward unto lyffe. And as many as walk according to this rewle / I say
with S. Paul / peace be upon them / Gala. 6.
and upon Israel which perteyneth unto godde. The guide off this Church is the
holy ghooste. The marks / whereby this Church is known unto me in this dark
world / Phil. 2.
and in the mids of this Crooked and froward generation / are these. The
sincere preachinge of gods word. The due administration off the sacraments.
Charitee / and faithful observing off Ecclesiastical discipline according to
the word off godde. And that Church or congregation which is garnisshed with
these marks / is in very deed that heavenly Jerusalem / which consists of
those / Apoc. 21. Joan. 3. Gala. 4.
that be borne from above. This / is the mother of us all. And by gods grace
/ I will Live / and dye the Child of this Church. Forth off this (I grant)
there is no salvation / and I suppose the residew of the places objected are
rightly to be understood of this church only. In op. im. Homi. 49. in Matthew.
In times paste (says Chrysostom) there were many ways to know the Church
of Christ / that is to say / by good lyffe / by miracles / by chastitee / by
doctrine / by mynistringe the sacraments. But from that time / that heresies
did take hold off the churches it is only known by the scriptures which is
the true church. They have all things in owtwarde show / which the true
church has in truth. They have temples like unto ours / etc.

And in the end concludes. Wherefore only by the scriptures do we know which
is the true church. To that which they say / the Mass is the Sacrament of
unity. I answer / The bread which we break / according to the institution
of the Lord / 1. Cor. 10.
is the sacrament off thunitee of Christ's Mystical body. For we being
many / are one bread / and one body / forasmuch as we all are partakers of
one bread. But in the Mass / the Lords institution is not observed / for we
be not all partakers of one bread / but one deuoureth all / etc. So that (as
is it is used) it may seem a sacrament off singularitee / and off a certain
special priuelege for one sect off people / whereby they may be discerned
from the reaste / rather then a sacrament off unity / wherein our knyttinge
together in one / is represented.

Yea / Whatt fellowship has Christ with Antichriste? H. Laty.
Therefore is it not lawful to bear the yoke with papists. Come forth from
among the^ / and separate your selfs from them / says the Lord. It is one
thing to be the church in deed / another thing to countrefayte the church.
2. Cor. 6.
Would godde it were well known / what is the forsakynge of the church. In the
kings days that dead is / who was the church of England? The king and his
fautors / or Massemongers in corners? If the king and the fautors of his
procedinges / why be not we now the church abidinge in the same procedinges?
If clancularie Massemongers might be of the church / and yett contrary the
kings procedinges / why may not we as well be off the church contrarienge the
qwenes procedynges? Not all that be covered with the title off the church / are
the church in deed. Separate thy self from the^ that are such says S.
Paul: from whom? 1. Tim. 6.
The text has before. Yff any man follow other doctrine / etc. he is pufte
up / and knows nothing / etc. Weighe the hole Text / that ye may perceive
what is the fruit of contentiouse disputations. But wherefore are such men said
to know nothing / when they know so many things? You know the old verses.

Hoc est nescire, sine Christo plurima scire.
Si Christum been scis, satis est, si caetera nescis.
That is / This is to be ignorante / to know many things without Christ.
If thou know Christ well / thou know enough / though thou know no more.
Therefore would S. Paul know nothing / 1. Cor. 2.
but Jesus Christ crucified. et c. As many as are papists / and massemongers
/ they may well be said to know nothing / for they know not Christ /
forasmoche as in their massinge they take much away from the benifite and
merit of Christ. Anton. object. 6.


That church which you have described unto me / is i^uisible / but christ's
church is visible and known. For else why would Christ have said / dic
Ecclesie / Tell it unto the church? Matt. 18.
For he had commanded in vain to goo unto the church / if a man can not
tell which is it.

N. Ryd. Ansvu.
The church which I have described is visible / it has members which may be
seen / and also / I have before declared / by what marks and tokens it may be
known. But if either our eyes are so daselled / that we can not se it / or
that Satan has brought such darkness into the world / that it is hardde to
discern the true church: that is not the fault of the church / but either of
our blindness / or of satan's darkness. But yet in this most deep
darkness / there is one most clear candle / which of it self alone is able
to put away all darkness. Thy word is a candle unto my feet / and a light
unto my steps. Psalm. 119.


The church of Christ is a Catholic or universal church dispersed
throughout the whole world: Anton object. 7. 2. Tim. 2. Matt. 25. Mat. 3.13.
This church is the great house of God / in this are good men and euel mingled
together / goats and sheep / corn and chafe / it is the net which ga:
thereth of all kind of fishes: This church can not err / because Christ
has promised it his spirit / which shall lead it into all truth / Joan. 16.
Mat. 16.28
and that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it / that he will be
with it unto the end of the world: What so ever it shall lose or bind upon
earth / shall be ratified in heaven / etc. 1. Tim. 3. Co^tra epi. funda. c. 5.
This church is the pillar / and stay of the treuth / this is it for the
which S. Augustine says he believes the gospel. But this universal church
allows the Mass / because the more part of the same allows it / Therefore
etc.

I grant that the name of the church is taken after three diverse manners in
the scripture. N. Rydl. Ansvu.
Sometime for the hole multitude of them which profess the name of Christ /
of the which they are also named christians. But as S. Paul says of the Jew /
Romans 2. Romans 9.
Not every one is a Jew / that is a Jew outwardly et c. Neither yet all that
be of Israel / are counted the seed. Even so not every one which is a
christian outwardly / is a christian in deed. Romans 8.
For if any manne have not the spirit of Christ / the same is none of his.
Therefore that church which is his body / and of which Christ is the head /
stands only of living stones / and true christians / 1. Pet. 2.
not only outwardly in name and title / but inwardli in heart and in truth.

But forasmuch as this church (which is the second taking of the church) as
touching the outward fellowship / is contained within that great house / and
has with the same / outward society of the sacraments and ministry of the
word / many things are spoken of that universal church (which S. Austen
calls the mingled church) which can not truly be understood / but only
of that purer part of the church. So that the rule of Tyconius concerning the
mingled church / may here well take place. Augu. de doc. Crist. l. 3. cap. 32.
When there is attributed unto the whole church / that which can not agree
unto the same / but by reason of the one part thereof: that is either for the
multitude of good me^ / which is the church in deed / or for the multitude of
evil men / which is the malignante church / and synagoge of Satan: Apo. 2.
And is also the third taking of the church / of the which / although there
be seldomer mention in the scriptures / in that signification yet in the world
/ even in the most famous assembles of christendom / this church has borne
the greatest swing. This distinction presupposed / of the three sorts of
churches / it is an easy matter / by a figure called Synecdoche / to give to
the mingled and universal church / that which can not truly be
understood / but only of the one part thereof.

But if any manne will stiflye affirm that universality does so pertain
unto the church / that whatsoever Christ has promised to the church / it
must needs be understood of that / I would gladly know of the same man /
where that vniuersalle church was in the times of the patriarchs / and
pophetes / Exodus 17. 3. Reg. 19. Hiere. 6.
of Noe / Abraham / and Moses (at such time as the people would have stoned him)
of Helias / of Hieremie: in the times of Christ / and the dispersion of the
Apostles / in the time of Arius when Constantius was Emperor / Theo. ecc. his.
l. 2. c. 15 61.
and Felix bisshoppe of Rome / succeeded Liberius. It is worthy to be noted /
that Lira writes upon Matthew. Lyra in Matt.
The church (says he) does not stand in men by reason off their power / or
dignitee / whether it be Ecclesiastical / or seculer / for many princes and
popes / and other inferiors have been fownde to have fallen away from godde.
Therefore the church consists in those persons / in whom is true knowledge /
and confession of the faith / and off the Truth. Evil men (as it is in a
gloss of the Decrees) are in the church in name / and not in deed. De poenit.
did. 1. c. ecclesia. Lib. 1. c. 33.
And S. Augustine / contra Crescomu^ gram^aticu^ says / Who so ever is
afraid to be deceived by the darkness off this qwestio^ / let him ask
cownsell at the same church of it: which church / the scripture does point
out without any doubtefulnesse. All my notes which I have written and
gathered owte of such authors as I have read in this matter / and such like
are com^e into the hands of such / as will not let me have the least of all
my written books: wherein I am enforced to complain of them unto godde / for
they spoil me of all my labors / which I have taken in my study these many
years. My memory was never good / for help wheroff I have used for the
most part / to gather owte notes of my readinge and so to place the^ / that
thereby I might have had the use of them / when the time required. But who
knows whether this be gods will / that I should be thus ordered / and
spoiled of the poor learning I had (as me thought) in stoore / to
thinte^te that I now destitute of that / should from he^ceforth learn only to
know with Paul / 1. Cor. 2.
Christ / and him crucified. The Lord grant me herin to be a good young
scoler / and to learn this lesson so well / that neither death / nor liffe /
wealth / nor woo / etc. make me ever to forgette that. Ame^. Ame^.

I have no more to say in this matter / for you your self have said all that
is to be said. H. Laty.
That same vehemente saying of S. Augustine. I would not believe the gospelle /
etc. was wont to troble many men / as I remember I have read it well
qualiffied off Philippe Melanchton / but my memory is altogether slypperie.
This it is in effect. The church is not a judge / Mel. de eccles.
but a witness. There were in his time that lightly esteemed the testimony of the
church / and the owtwarde ministry of preaching / and rejected the owteward
word it self / stickinge only to their inward revelations. Such rasshe
contempt of the word / provoked and drove S. Augustine into that excessive
vehemence. In the which / after the bare sownd of the words / he might seem
to such as do not attain unto his meaning / that he preferred the church
far before the gospel / and that the Church has a free Authoritee over the
same: but that godly man never thought so. It were a saying worthy to be
brought forth against the Anabaptists / which think the open ministry to
be a thing not necessary / if they any thing esteemed such testimonies. I
would not stick to affirm / that the moore part of the great house / that
is to say of the hoole universal church / may easily err And again / I
would not stick to affirm / that it is one thing to be gathered together in
the name off Christ / and another thing / to comme together with a Mass off
tholye ghooste going before. For in the first Christ rules / in the latter
the deuel bears the swinge: and how then can any thing be good that they
goo abowte? from this latter shall our Six Articles comme forth again into
the light / they them selfs being very darkness. But it is demanded / A
question
whether the fownder or better part of the catholyque church / may be seen of
men / or no? S. Paul says: Ansvuer.
The Lord knows them that are his. What manner of speaking is this in
comme^dation of the lord / if we know as well as he who are his? Well / thus
is the text: The Sure fowndation of godde stands still / and has this
seal: the Lord knows them that are his / and let every man that names the
name of Christ depart from iniquite. Now how many are there of the hoole
Catholic church of England which depart from iniquite? How many of the noble
men / how many of the bishops or clergy / how many of the rich men / or
merchauntes / how many of the qwenes cownsellers / yea / how many of the hoole
realm? In how small rowme then I pray you / is the true church within the
realm of England? and where is it? and in what state? I had a co^ceipte of
mine own well grownded (as they say) when I began / but now it is fallen by
the way.

Anton. object. 8. Matt. 18.
General Counsels represent the universal church and have this promise of
Christ / where two or three be gathered together in my name / there am I in the
mids of the^. If Christ will be present with ij. or iij. then much more
where there is so great a multitude / etc. But in general counsels Mass has been approved / and used Therefore / etc.

Off the universal church which is mingled of good / N. Ryd.
and badde / thus I think. Whensoever they which be chieffe in it / which rule
and govern the same / and to whom the reaste of the hoole mystical body of
Christ does obey / are the lively members of Christ / and walk after the
guydinge and rule of his word / and goo before the flock toward everlasting
lyffe: the^ undoubtedly Cownsels gathered together of such guydes and Pastors
of the Christia^e flock / do in deed represe^te the universal church / and
being so gathered in the name of Christ / they have a promise off the gift
/ and guydinge of his spirit into all truth.

But that any such counsel has at any time allowed the mass / such a one
as ours was of late / in a strange tongue / and stuffed with so many /
absurditees / errors / and superstitions / that I utterly deny / 2. Cor. 6.
and I affirm it to be impossible. For like as there is no agreement betwixe
light and darkness / betwixe Christ and Belial / so surely superstition /
and the sincere Religion of Christ / will worship / and the pure worshippinge
of godde / such as godde requires of his / Joan. 4.
that is / in spirit and truth / can never agree together.

But ye will say / where so great a Company is gathered together / it is not
credible / but there be two / or three / gathered in the name of Christ. I
answer If there be one hundredth good / and two hundredth badde / forasmoche as
the decrees / and ordinances are pronounced according to the greater number of
the multitude of voices / what can the less number of voices avail? It is a
known thing / and a comme^ proverb: Often times the greater part / A
proverb.
overcomes the Better.

As touching general counseils / H. Laty.
at this present I have no more to say / the^ you have said. Only I refer you
to your own experience / to think of our co^try parlaments and conuocations:
how and what ye have there seen / and heard. The inco^stancie of the Englissh
parlamentes and conuocations.
The more part in my time did bring forth the six articles / for the^ the king
would so have it / being seduced of certain. Afterward the more part did repel
the same / our good Josias willing to have it so. The same articles now again
(alas) another greater / but wurse part / has restored. O what an uncertainty
is this? But after this sort most commonly are man's procedings. God be
merciful unto us. Who shall deliver us from such torments of mind? Death, the
best physician to the faithful.
Therefore is death the best physitio^ / but unto the faithful / whom she
together / and at once / delivers from all grieffes. You must think (...)
this / written upon this occasion / because you would needs have your paper
blotted.

Anton. object. 9.
If the matter should go thus / that in general counsels men should not
stand to the more number of the whole multitude / I mean of them which ought
to give voices / then should no certain rule be left unto the church / by
the which controversies in weighty matters might be determined / but it is
not to be believed / that Christ would leave his church destitute of so
necessary a help and sauegarde.

N. Ryd. Ansvu. Ephesians. 5.
Christ / who is the most louinge spouse of his espoused the church / who also
gave himself for it / that he might sainctifie it unto himself / did give
unto it abundantlye all things which are necessary to salvation / but yet so
/ that the church should declare it self obediente unto him in all things /
and keep it self within the bounds of his commandments / and further / not
to seek any thing which he teaches not / as necessary unto salvation. Now
further / for determination of all controversies in Christ's religion / Luc. 16.
Christ himself has left unto the church not only Moses / and the Prophets
/ Esa. 8.
whom he wills his church in all doutes to go unto / and ask counsel at /
but also the gospelles / and the rest of the body of the new testamente: in
the which whatsoever is hard in Moses and the prophets / whatsoever is
necessary to be known unto salvation / is reveled and opened.

So that now we have no need to say / who shall clime into heaven / Romans 10.
or who shall go down into the depth / to tell us what is needful to be done.
Christ has done both / and has commended unto us the word of faith / which
also is abundantly declared unto us in his word written / so that hereafter
if we walk earnestly in this way to the ser / ching out of the truth / it
is not to be doubted / but through the certain benifite of Christ's spirit /
Luke. 11.
which he has promised unto his / we may find it / and obtain everlasting
life. Should me^ne ask counsel of the dead for the living says Esaie?
Esai. 8.
Let the^ go rather to the law / and to the testimony. et c. Christ sends
them that be desierouse to know the truth unto the scriptures / saiynge /
John. 5.
search the scriptures. I remember a like thing well spoken of Hierome. Hieron.
in 23. Math.
Ignorance of the scriptures is the mother / and cause of al erroures / and in
another place as I remember in the same authoure. The knoweledge of the
scripturs is the fode of everlasting life. But now me thinks I enter into a
very broad sea / in that I begin to show / either out of the scriptures
them selves / or out of the aunciente writers how much the holy scripture is
of force to teach the truth of our religion. But this is it / that I am now
about / that Christ would have the church his spouse in all doubts to ask
counsel at the word of his father written / and faithfully left / and
co^me^ded unto it in boeth testame^tes the old / and the new. Neither do we
reed that Christ in any place has laiede so great a burden upon the
members of his spouse / that he has commanded them to go to the universal
church. Romans 15.
What soever things are written (says Paul) are written for our learning.
And it is true that Christ gave unto his church / some Apostels / some
Prophets / some Evangelists / Ephe. 4.
some shepards / and teachers / to the edifiynge of the saints / till we all
come to the unity of faith / et c. But that all men should meet together /
out of all parts of the world / to define of the articles of our faith / I
neither find it commanded of Christ nor written in the word of God.

H. Latim.
There is a diversity betwixt things pertaining to God / or faith / and
Politic or Civil matters. For in the first we must stand only to the
scriptures / which are able to make us all perfect / and instructed unto
salvation / 2. Tim. 3.
if they be well under / standed. And they offer themselves to be well
understood only to them / which have good wills / and give themselves to
study / and prayer. Neither are there any men less / apt to understand them
/ then the prudent and wise men of the world.

But in the other / that is in Civil or Politic matters / often times the
magistrates do tolerate a less evil / for avoiding of a greater / as they
which have this saiynge often in their mouths. Better an inconvenience / then a
mischieffe: and it is the property of a wise man (says one) to dissemble
many things: And he that can not dissemble / can not rule. In which saiyngs
they bewraie themselves / that they do not earnestely weighe / what is just /
what is not. Wherefore / forasmuch as ma^s laws / if it be but in this
respect only / that they be devised by men / are not able to bring any
thing to perfection / but are enforced of necessity to suffer many things out
of sqware / and are compelled sometime to wynke at the worste things / saying
they know not how to maintain the common peace and quiet otherwise / Gal. 3.
1. Cor. 3. Romans 3. Psa. 116. Lib. 1. retr. cap. 10.
they do ordain that the more part shall take place. You know what these
kinds of speeches mean / I speak after the manner of men / ye walk after the
manner of men / all men are liers. And that of S Augustine / if ye live after
man's reason / ye do not live after the will of God.

If ye say / the councels have sometimes erred / Anton. object. 10.
or may err / how then should we believe the catholic Church? For the
councels are gathered by the authority of the catholic church.

From may be / to be in deed / N. Rid. ansvv.
is no good argument / but from being / to may be / no man doubts / but it
is a most sure argument. But now that councels have sometime erred / it is
manifest. How many councels were there in the east part of the world /
Socr. eccle. hist. l. 2.
which condemned the Nicene counceil? and al those which would not forsake the
same / they called by a scla^derouse name (as they thought) Homousia^s. Was not
Athanasius / Chrysostom / Cyrille / Eustachius / men very well learned / and
of godly life / Socr. eccl. H. l. 1. c. 24.32. Theod. l. 5. cap. 34. Objection.
banished / and condemned as famous heritiques / and that by wicked
cou^celles? How many things are there in the Canons and constitutions of the
counselles / which the papists them selves do much mislike? But here
paraduenture one man will say unto me: We will grant you this in prouincial
councelles / or councelles of some one nation / that they may sometimes err:
Forasmuch as they do not represente the universal church / but it is not to
be believed / that the general and full councelles have erred at any time. Here
if I had my books of the counselles / or rather such notes as I have
gathered out of those books / I could bring somthi^g which should serve for
this purpose. But now seeing I have them not / Ansvuer.
I will recite one place only out of S. Austen / which (in my iudgdment) may
suffice in this matter in stead of many. Who knows not (says he) that the
holy scripture is so set before us / l. 2. de bap. cont. don. cap. 3.
that it is not lawefull to doubt of it / and that the letters of Bishops /
may be reproved by other wiser men^es words / and by cou^celles: and that the
counsels themselves / which are gathered by proui^ces and countries / do give
place to the authority of the general and full cou^celles: and that the former
general councils are amended by the latter / when as by some experience of
things / either that which was shut up / is opened / or that which was hid is
known. Thus much of Augustine. But I will plead with our Autoniane / upon
matter confessed* Here with us when as papisttie reagned / I pray you how does
that book / which was called the Bishops book / made in the time of King
Henry the eighte / whereof the Bishop of Winchester is thought to be either
the first father / The Bisschops book.
or chief gatherer / how does it (I say) sharply reprove the florentine
counceile / in which was decreed the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome / and
that with the consent of the Emperor of constantinople / and of the
Grecians? So that in those days our learned / aunciente fathers / and
Bisshoppes of England / did not stick to affirm that a general counceile
might err. But me thinks I hear another manne despising all that I have
brought furthe / and saiynge. These which you have called counceiles / are
not worthy to be called counceiles / but rather assembles / and co^ue^ticles of
heritiques I pray you sir / why do you judge them worthy of so slanderouse a
name? Because (says he) they decreed things heretical / contrary to true
godliness / and sound doctrine / and against the faith of christen religion.
The cause is weighty / for the which they ought of right so to be caled. But
if it be so that all counceiles ought to be despised / which decree any
thing contrary to sound doctrine / and the true word / which is according
to godliness: forasmuch as the mass / 1. Tim. 6.
such as we have had here of late / is openly against the word of Godde /
forsothe it must follow of necessity / that al such councels / as have
approved such masses / ought of right to be fled / and despised / as
conuenticles / and assembles of men that straie from the truth.

The B. of Romes authoritee.
Another man alleges unto me the authority of the Bishop of Rome / without
which / neither can the counsels (says he) be lawefully gathered / neither
being gathered determine any thing concerning religion. But this objection is
only grounded upon the ambitoiuse and shameless maintenance of the Romish
tyranny / and usurped dominion over the clergy / England abiured the popes
supremacy.
which tyra^nie we Englisshe men / long ago / by the consent of the whole
Realm / have expulsed / and abiured. And how rightly we have done it / a
little book set forth / de vtraque potestate / (that is of booeth the powers)
does clerelye show. I grant that the Romish ambition has gone about to
challenge to it self / and to usurp such a privilege of old time. Co^c.
Carthag. 3.
But the counsel of Carthage / in the year of our Lord / 457. did openly
withstand it and also the counseil at Milcuyte: in the which S. Augustine was
present / Can. 22.
did prohibit any appellations to be made to Bisshoppes beyond the sea.

S. Augustine says the good men are not to be forsaken for the evil / Anton.
object. 11. Ep. 48.
but the evil are to be borne withal for the good. Ye will not say (I trow)
that in our congregations all be evil.

N. Ryd. Ansvuer.
I speak nothing of the goodness or euelnesse of your congregacions / but I
fight in Chrstes quarrel against the mass which does utterly take away
and overthrow the ordinance of Christ. Let that be taken quite away / and then
the particion of the wall that made the striefe shall be broken down Now to
the place of S. Austine / for bearing with the evil for the goods sake / there
ought to be added other words / which the same writer has expressedly in
other places. That is: Aug. l. 3. cont. literas parm. cap. 2.3.
if those evil men do cast abroad no seeds of false doctrine / nor lead
other / to destruction / by their example.

Yt is perilouse to atempt any new thing in the church / which lacks
example of good men. Anton. object. 12.
How much more perilouse is it / to commit any act / unto the which /
thexample of the prophets / of Christ / and of thapostles are contrary. But
unto this your fact / in abstaining from the church by reason of the mass /
the example of the prophets / of Christ / and of thapostles are clean
contrary. Therefore. et c. The first part of the argument is evident / and
the second part I prove thus. In the times of the Prophets / of Christ / and
his Apostels / all things were most corrupt. The people was miserablye given
to superstition / the priests despised the law of god: and yet not
withstanding / we neither read that the prophets made any schisms or
diuisio^s / and Christ himself hau^ted the temple / and taught in the temples
of the Jews. Luc. 21. Acto. 3. Acto. 13.
Peter and Ihon went up into the temple at the ninthe hour of prayer Paul
after the readinge of the law / being desired to say something to the people
/ did not refuse to do it. Yea / further no man can show / that either the
Prophets / or Christ / and his Apostles / did refuse to pray together with
others / to sacrifice / or to be partakers of the Sacraments of Moses law.

I grant the former part of your argument / and to the second part I say
/ N. Rydl. Ansvu.
that although it contain mani true things / as of the corrupt state in the
times of the Prophets / of Christ / and the Apostles / and of the temple
being hau^ted of Christ and his Apostels / yet notwithstanding the second
part of your argument is not sufficiently proved: For ye ought to have
proved / that either the Prophets / either Christ / or his Apostles did in the
temple / communicate with the people / in any kind of worshippinge which is
forbidden by the law of God / or repugnant to the word of god. But that can
no where be showed / And as for the church / I am not angry with it / and I
never refused to go to it / and to pray with the people / to hear the word
of God / and to do all other things whatsoever may agree with the word of
God. S Augustine speakinge of the Ceremonies of the Jews (I suppose in the
Epistle ad Ianuariu^) although he grant they greuousely oppressed that people
/ Ep. 119.
both for the number / and bondage of the same / yet he calls them burdens of
the law / which were delivered unto them in the word of God / not
presumptions of men / which notwithstanding if they were not contrary to gods
word / might after a sort be borne withal. But now / seeing they are
contrary / to those things which are in the word of god written. Whether
they ought to be borne of any Christian or no / let him judge which is
spiritual which fears God more then man / and loves everlasting life / more
then this short and transitory life. To that which was said that my fact
lacks example of the godly fathers that have goone before / the contrary is
most evident in the history of Tobie. Of whom it is said / Tob. 1.
that when all other went to the golden calves / which Hieroboam the King of
Israel had made / he himself alone fled all their companies / and got
him to Jerusalem / unto the temple of the Lord / and there worshipped the
Lord God of Israel. 3. Reg. 13.
Did not the man of God threaten greuouse plages both unto the priests of
Bethell / and to the altar which Hieroboam had there made after his own
fantasy? Which plages King Josias the true minister of god did execute at
the time appointed. 4. Reg. 23.
And where do we read that the Prophets / or thapostles / did agree with the
people in their Idolatry? When as the people went a whoring with their hill
aulters / for what cause I pray you did the prophets rebuke the people so
much / as for their false worshipping of god after their own minds / and not
after gods word? For what was so much as that was? wherefore the false
prophets ceased not to malign the true prophets of God: Therefore they bet
them they bannisshed them. Hier^. 20. Hebr. 11.
et c. How else I pray you can you understand that S. Paul alleges?
When he says. What concord has Christ with belial? 2. Cor. 6.
Either what part has the beleuer with the infidele? or how agrees the
temple of God with Images? For ye are the temple of the living God / as god
himself has said: Leuit. 26.
I will dwell among them / and walk among them / and will be their godde /
and they shall be my people. Wherefore come owte from among them / and
separate your selfs from them (says the Lord) and towche none unclean
thing / Esa. 52.
so will I receive you / and will be a father unto you / and ye shall be my
sons and dowghters says the Lord Allmightye.

Wherefore the Machabees put them selfs in danger of death for the defense
of the law / yea and at Length died manfully in in the defense of the same.
Yff we do praise (says S. Augustine) the Machabees / and that with great
admiration / Conr 2. Ep. gaude^ tij cap. 23.
bicawse they did stoutely stand even unto death / for the laws of their
Cowntrey: how much more owghte we to suffer all things for our Baptism / for
the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ? etc. But the supper of the
lord / such a one (I mean) as Christ commands us to celebrate / the
mass utterly abolisheth and corrupts most shamefully.

Who am I / that I should add any thing to this which you have so well spoken.
Nay / H. Laty.
I rather thank iou that iou have vouch safed to minister so ple^tiful armor
to me / being otherwise altogether unarmed saving that he ca^ne not be left
destitute of help / which rightly trusts in the help of God.

I only learn to die in reading of the new testament and am ever now and then
praiyng unto my god / that he will be an helper unto me in time of need. Psalm.

Seeing you are so obstinatly set against the mass / Anton. obiec. 13.
that you affirm / because it is done in a tou^ge not understood of the
people / and for other causes / I ca^ not tell what / therefore it is not the true
sacrament / ordained of Christ / I begin to suspect you / that you think not
catholiquely of baptism also. Is our baptism which we do use / in a tou^ge
unknown to the people / the true baptism of Christ or no? If it be / the^ does
not the strange tou^ge hurt the mass. If it be not the baptism of Christ /
tell me how were you baptized? Or whether ye will (as the anabaptists do) that
all which were baptized in latin should be baptized again in the English
tongue.

Although I would wisshe baptism to be given N. Rydl. Ansvu.
in the vulgar tongue for the peoples sake which are present / that they may
the better understand their own profession / and also be more hable to teach
their children the same / yet notwithstanding there is not like necessitee of
the vulgar tongue in Baptism / and in the lords supper. Baptism is given to
children / who by reason of their aege are not able to understand what is
spoken unto them what tongue soever it be. The lords supper / is / and ought
to be given to them / that are wexen. More over / in Baptism which is
accustomed to be given to children in the Latin tongue / all the substantial
points (as a man would say) which Christ commawnded to be done / are
observed. And therefore I judge that Baptism / to be a perfect and true
baptism: and that it is not only not needful / but also not lawful / for
any man so Christened / to be Christened again. Butt yet notwithstanding /
they ought to be tawghte the Cathechisme of the Christen faith / when they
shall come to years of discretion: Which Cathechisme / who so ever despises /
or will not desirously embrace / and willingly learn / in my judgment he
plaieth not the part of a Christian man. But in the popisshe mass are
wantynge certain substantialles / that is to say / things commawnded by the
word of godde to be observed in ministration of the lords supper: of the
which there is sufficient declaration made before.

H. Laty.
Where you say (I would wisshe? surely I would wisshe / that you had spoken
more vehemently / and to have said it is of necessitee / that all things in
the congregation should be done in the vulgar tongue / for thedyffyenge and
comfort of them that are present. Nottwithstandinge that the child it self
is sufficientlye baptized in the Latin tongue.

Forasmoche as I perceive you are so stifflie / Anton. object. 14
I will not say obstinately bente / and so wedded to your own opinion / that
no gentle exhortations / no wholesome cownsayles / no other kind of means can
call you home to a better mind: there remains / that which in like cases was
wont to be the only remedy against stiff necked / and stubburne persons /
that is / you must be hampered by the laws / and compelled either to obey
whether ye will or no / or else to suffer that / which a rebelle to the laws
ought to suffer. Do you not know that whosoever refuses to obey the laws
of the realm / he bewrays himself to be an enemy to his cowntrey? Do you
not know that this is the redyest way / to stir up sedition / and ciuille
war? Yt is better that you should bear your own sin / then that through
thexample of your breach of the comme^ laws / the common qwiette should be
disturbed. How can you say / you will be the qwenes true subject / when as
you do openly profess / that you will not keep her laws?

N. Ryd. Ansvuer.
O heavenly father / the father of all wisdom / understanding / and true
strength / I beseech thee for thy only son our savior Christ's sake / look
mercifulli upon me wretched creature / and send thine holy spirit into my
breaste / that not only I may understand according to thy wisdom / how this
pestilent and deadly dart is to be borne of / and with what answer it is to
be beaten back / but also when I must join to fight in the field for the
glory of thy name / that then I being strengthened with the defense of thy
right hand / may manfully stand in the confession of thy faieth / and of thy
truth / and continue in the same unto the end of my life / through the same
our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

Now to the objection. I grant it to be reasonable / that he which by
words and gentilnesse can not be made yealde to that is right and good /
should be bridled by the strait correction of the laws: that is to say /
he that will not be subject to gods word / must be punished by the laws. It
is true that is commenly said. He that will not obeie the gospel / must be
tamed and taught by the rigor of the law. But these things ought to take
place against him / which refuses to do that is right / and just /
according to true godliness: not against him / which can not quietelye bear
superstitions / and the overthrow of Christ's institutions / but does hate /
and detest from his heart / such kind of procedinges / and that for the
glory of the name of God. To that which ye say a transgressour of the commen
laws / bewraieth himself to be an enemy of his country / suerly a man ought
to look unto the nature of the laws / what manner of laws they be which are
broken. For a faithful Christian ought not to think alike of all manner of
laws. But that saying ought only truly to be understood of such laws
as be not contrary to gods word. Otherwise whosoever love their contrie in
treuth / (that is to say in God) they will always judge (if at any time the
laws of god and manne be the one contrary to the other) that a man ought rather
to obeie God then manne. Acto. 4.
And they that think otherwise / and pretend a love to their contrie /
forasmuch as they make their contrie to fight as it were against Godde in
whom consists the only stay of the country / surely I do think that
such are to be judged most deadly enemies / and tratours to their country.
For they that fight against Godde / which is the safety of their country /
what do they else but go about to bring upon their country a present ruin
and destruction. But they that do so are worthelie to be judged enemies to
their country / and betraiours of the Realm / Therefore etc.

But this is the rediest way (ye say) to stir up sedition / to trouble the
quiet of the commen wealth / therefore are these things to be repressed in
time / by force of laws. Behold Satan does not cease to practice hisolde
giles / Satan and his ministers do alvuayes charge the godly vuith sedition.
3. Reg. 18. Hiere. 26.
and accustomed subtilties. He has ever this darte in a readiness to whorle
against his adversaries / to accuse them of sedition that he may bring them
(if he can) in danger of the higher powers. For so has he by his ministers
always charged the Prophets of Godde. Achab said unto Elias art thou he that
troubles Iraell? The false prophets also complained to their Princes of
Hieremie that his words were seditious and not to be suffered / Did not the
Scribes / and Pharisees falselye accuse Christ as a seditious person / Luc.
23. Joan. 19, Acto. 24.
and one that spoke against Caesar? Did they not at the last cry if you let
this manne go you are not Cesars friend? The Oratoure Tertullus how does he
accuse Paul before Felix the high deputy? We have found this man (says he)
a pestilent fellow / and a sterer of sedition unto all the Jews in the whole
world etc. But I pray you were these men as they were called seditious
persons. Christ / Paul / and the Prophets? God forbid. But they were of false
men / falsely accused. And wherefore I pray you? but because they reproved
before the people their giles / superstition / and deceites. And when the other
could not bear it / and would gladly have had them taken out of the way /
they accused them as seditious persons / and troublers of the commen wealth /
that being by this means made hateful to the people / and Princes / they
might the more easily be snatched up to be tormented / and put to death.
But how far they were from al sedition / their whole doctrine / life / and
conversation does well declare. For that which was objected last of all /
that he can not be a faithful subject to his prince which professes openly
that he will not observe the laws / which the prince has made: here I would
wish that I might have an indifferente judge / and one that fears god / to
whose judgment in this cause I promise I will stand. I answer therefore a
man ought to obeie his prince / but in the Lord / and never against the
Lord. For he that knowingly obeith his prince against god does not a duty to
the prince / but is a decieuer of the Prince / and an helper unto him to work
his own destruction. He is also unjust which gives not the prince / that is
the princes / and to god that is gods. Here comes to my remembrance / that
notable saiynge of Valentinianus / the Emperor for chosinge the Bishop of
Millaine. Set him (says he) in the bishops seat / Theodor. eccl. hist. l. 4.
cap. 5. Euse. eccl. histo. l. 4. cap. 4. Niceph. li. 3. cap. 35.
to whom if we (as man) do offend at any time / we may submit our selves.
Policarpus the most constante Martyr when he stood before the chief Ruler and
was commanded to blaspheme Christ / and to swear by the fortune of Caesar
etc. He answered with a mild spirit: we are taught (says he) to give
honor unto princes and those powers which be of god / but such honor as
is not contrary to gods religion.

Hitherunto ye see good father / how I have in words only made as it were a
florishe before the fight which I shortelie look after / and how I have
bego^ne to prepare certain kinds of wepo^s / to fight against the
adversaries of Christ / and to muse with my self / how the darts of the
old enemy may be borne of / and after what sort I may smite him again with
the sword of the spirit. Ephesians. 6.
I learn also hereby to be in ure with armor / and to assaie how I can go
armed.

In Tyndall where I was borne / not far from the scotishe borders / I have
known my contreiemen watch night and day in their harness / such as they
had / that is in their Iackes: and their spears in their hands (you call
the^ northen gads) specially when they had any priuye warninge of the coming
of the scotts. And so doing / although at every such bickeringes some of
them spente their life's / yet by such means like pretty men they defended
their country. And those that so died / I think that before God they died in
a good quarrel / and their ofspringe and progeny / all the country loved them
the better for their fathers sakes. And in the quarrel of Christ our savior
/ in the defense of his own divine ordinances / by the which he gives unto
us life and immortality / yea / in the quarrel of faith / and Christian
religion / wherein rests our everlasting salvation / shall we not watch?
shall we not go always armed? ever lokinge when our adversary (which like
a roaringe Lion seeks whom he may devour) shall come upon us by reason of
our slothfulness. 1. Pet. 5.
Yea / and woe be unto us / if he can oppress us at unawares / which
undoubtedly he will do / if he find us slepinge. Let us awake therefore / for
if the good manne of the house knew what hour / the thief would come / he
would surely watch / and not suffer his house to be broken up. Ma^^.
Let us awake therefore I say / and let us not suffer our house to be
broken up. Resist the Devil says S. James and he will fly from you. Iaco. 4.
Let us therefore resist him ma^fullie / and taking the cross upon our
shoulders / let us follow our captain Christ / who by his own blood / has
dedicated and hallowed the way which leads unto the father / that is to the
light which no man can attain / 1. Tim. 6.
the fountain of everlasting joys. Let us follow I say / whither he calls
and allureth us / that after these afflictions / which last but for a momente
/ whereby he tries our faith / as gold by the fiere / we may euerlastinglye
reign / and triumph with him in the glory of the father / and that through
the same our Lord / and Savior Jesus Christ / to whom with the father and
the holy ghooste be all honor and glory now and for ever. Amen. Amen.

Good father / forasmoch as I have determined with my self / to power forth
these my cogitatio^s into your bosom / her me thinks I see you suddenly
liftyng up your head toward heaven / after your manner / and the^ lookynge
upon me with your prophetical countenance / and speaking unto me / with these
or like words. Trust not my son (I beseech you vouchsafe me the honor of
this name for in so doing I shall think my self both honored / and loved of
you.) Trust not I say my son to these word weapons: 1. Cor. 4.
for the kingdom of godde / is not in words / but in power. And remember
always the words of the lord / do not imagine before hand / Matt. 10.
Marc. 11.
what and how you will speak / for it shall be given you / eue^ in that same
hour what ye shall speak / for it is not ye that speak / but the spirit of
your father which speaks in you. I pray you therefore father / pray for me /
that I may cast my hoole care upon him / and trust upon him in all perilles.
For I know / and am surely persuaded / that / what soever I can imagine or
think before hand / it is nothing / except he assiste me with his spirit
when the time is. I beseech you therefore father / Ephesians. 6.
pray for me / that such a complete harness of the spirit / such boldness
of mind may be given unto me / that I may owte of a true faith say with
David. Psalm. 44.
I will not trust in my bow / and it is not my swearde that shall save me. For
he has no pleasure in the strength of an horse / etc. Psalm. 147.
But the lords delight is in them that fear him / and put their trust in
his mercy. I beseech you pray / pray / that I may enter this fight / only
in the name of godde / and that when all is paste / I being not overcome
through his gratiouse aid / may remain / and stand fast in him / till
that day of the lord / Apoc. 2.
in the which to them that obtain the victory / shall be given the lively
Manna to eat / and a Tryumphante Crown for evermore.

Now father I pray you help me to buckle on this gear a little better. For
you know the depenes of Satan / being an old souldyar / Apoc. 2.
and you have collered with him or now: blessed be godde / that has ever aided
you so well. I suppose he may well hold you at the baye / but truly he will
not be so willing (I think) to join with you / as with us yongelynges.

Sir I beseech you / let your servant read this my bablinge unto you / and
now and then / as it shall seem unto you best / let your pen run on my
book / spare not to blotte my paper I give you good leave.

As touching this Antoniane / whom I have here made mine adversary / lest
paraduenture any ymagination might carry you amiss / and make you think
otherwise then I meant: Know you that I have alluded to one Antonie a most
cruel Bisshoppe of the Arianes / and a very violent persecuter of them that
were Catholic / Victor. li. 3. de persequut. Aphricae.
and of a right judgment. To whom Hunericus a Tyrante of the Vandales /
knowing Antonies fearcenes committed his whole authority / that he should
either turn the Christians which believed well / unto his false Religion / or
else to punish and torment them at his pleasure. Which thing Antonius took in
hand to do / and executed the same against a great number / but specially
against two most godly Bisshoppes / and most constante in the doctrine
which was according to godliness. Tit. 1.
The name of the one was Eugenius an aged man / the other was named Habet deum.
This Latter as it appears by Victors History of the persecutions of the
Vandales booth the Tyranne / and the false counterfaicte Bisshoppe desiered
much to have turned unto their most pestilent heresy. This Habet deum / was
bisshope of the City Tamallune / where Antonie had been bisshoppe before. And
when Antonie had vexed him (as the story says) with diverse and sundry
persequutions / and had fownde the soldier of Christ allwaies constante in
his Confession / it is said / that at length in a great rage he swoore / and
said to his friends on this wise: if I make him not of our Religion / then am I
not Antonie: it is incredible what harms and troubles he put him to / what
crueltye he practiced against him / and it were to long now / to describe the
same unto you. But the man of god stood always immovable / and in the
confession of Christ's faith remained ever unto the end / the constante and
vnfoyled souldyare of Christ. This good Bisshoppe Habet deum / I pray to
godde our heavenly father to give me grace that I may fathefully follow /
through our Lord Jesus Christ / Amen.

Sir I have cawsed my man not only to read your armor unto me / but also to
write it owte / H. Laty.
for it is not only no bare armor / but also well buckled armor / I see not
how it could be better. I thank you eue^ from the botome of my heart for it /
and my prayer you shall not lack / trustinge that you do the like for me. For
in deed there is the help. etc. Many things make confusion in memory. And
if I were as well learned as was Saint Paul. I would not bestow much
amongst them / further then to gaul them / and spurgall to / when / and where
as occasion were given / and matter came to mind / for the law shall be
their shote anchour / stay and refuge.

Fare you well in Christ.
A treatise against the error of transubstantiation / made by the fornamed
Reverend father Nic. Rydley Bishop of London / in the time of his emprisonmente
Many things co^founde the weak memory. A few places well weighed and
perceived / lightneth the vndstandinge. Truth is there to be searched with
diligence / where it is certain to be had. Though God do speak the truth
by man / yet in man's word which God has not reveled to be his / a man may
doubt without mistruste in God. Christ is the truth of God / reueiled unto man
from heaven by God himself / and therefore in his word the truth is to be
found / which is to be embraced of all that be his. Christ bids us ask
and we shall have / Search and we shall find / Knock and it shall be opened
unto us. Therefore O heavenly father autour and fountain of all truth / the
bottomeles Sea of al true understanding / send down we beseech thee thy holy
spirit into our hearts / and lighten our understanding with the beams of
thy heavenly grace. We ask the this O heavenly father not in respect of our
deserts / but for thy dear Son our Savior Jesus Christ's sake. Thou
knoweste O heavenly father / that the controversy about the Sacrament of the
blessed body and blood of thy dear Son our Savior Christ / has
troubled not of late only thy church of England / France / Germany / and
Italye / but also many years ago. The fault is ours no doubt thereof / for
we have deserved thy plage. But O Lord be merciful and relieve our misery /
with some light of grace. Thou knoweste O Lord how this wicked world rolleth
up and down / and rieleth to and fro / and cares not what thy will is / so it
may abide in wealth. If truth have wealth then who are so stout to defend the
truth as they. But if Christ's cross be laiede on truethes back / then they
vanishe straighte away as wax before the fiere. Truth in time of affliction
has sevin friends.
But these are not they O heavenly father for whom I make my most moan / but
for those selye ones O Lord / which have a Zeal unto thee / those I mean
which would and wisshe to know thy will and yet are let / hold back / and
blinded by the subtilties of Satan / and his ministers / the wickedness of this
wretched world / and the sinful lusts and affections of the fleashe. Alas
Lord / thou know that we be of our selves but fleash / wherein there
dwells nothing that is good. How then is it possible for man / without thee
(O Lord) to understand thy truth in deed. Can the natural man perceive the
will of God? 1. Cor. 2.
O Lord to whom thou geuest a Zeal of thee / give them also we beeseche the
knowledge of thy blessed will. Suffer not them O Lord blindelie to be led
for to strive against thee / as thou did those (alas) which crucified thine
own dear son. Forgive the^ O Lord for thy dear sons sake / for they
know not what they do. They do think (alas) O Lord for lack of knowledge /
that they do unto thee good service / even when against thee they do most
greuouselie rage. Joan. 16.
Remember O Lord we beseech the for whom thy Martyr Steven did pray? Acto. 7.
and whom thy holy Apostle did so truly and earnestly love / that for their
salvation he wished himself accursed from thee. Romans 9. Luc. 23.
Remember O heavenly father the prayer of thy dear son our Savior
Christ upon the cross / when he said unto thee / O Father forgive them /
they know not what they do. With this forgiveness (O good Lord) give me I
beseech the thy grace so here briefelye to set forth the saiyngs of thy son
our Savior Christ / of his evangelists / and of his Apostles / that in this
aforesaid controversy the light of thy truth / by the lantern of thy word
may shine unto all them that love thee.

Of the Lords last Supper do speak especially three of the Evangelists /
Matt. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 10.11.
Mathewe / Mark / and Luke. But none more plainly / nor more fully
declarethe the same / then does S. Paul / partly in the 10. but especially
in the 11. Chapter of the first Epistle unto the Corinthianes

As Mathewe and Mark do agree much in form of words: So does likewise
Luke and S Paul. But all four no doubt / as they were all taught in one
schole / and enspired with one spirit so taught they all one truth. God
grant us to understand it well.

Mathewe sets forth Christ's Supper thus.

Matthev.
When even vuas comme he satt dovune vuith the 12. etc. Matt. 26.
As they did eat Ihesus took bread and gave thanks, brake it, and gave it to
the disciples and said, Take, Eat, This is my body. And he took the cup,
gave thanks and gave it to them sayng: Drink ye all of this. For this is my
blood of the nevue testament, that is shedd for many for the remission of
sins. I say unto you I vuill not drink henseforth of this fruit of the
vine tree, until that day when I shall drink that nevue in my fathers
kingdom. And when they had said grace, they vuent out.

Mark.
Now Mark speaks it thus, And as they ate. Jesus took bread, blissed and
brake, Mark. 14.
and gave to them, and said. Take eat, This is my body. And he took the
cup, gave thanks and gave it them, and they all drank of it, and he said
unto them, This is my blood of the nevve testamente, which is shed for
many. Verelie I say unto you, I vuil drink no more of the fruit of the
vine, until that day that I drink that nevve in the kingedome of God.

Here Matthew and Mark do agree not only in the matter / but also almost
fullye in the form of words. Saving that for thies words in Matthew (gave
thanks) Mark has one word (blessed) which signefieth in this place al one.
And where Matthew says (drink ye al of this) Mark says: and they all drank
of it. And where Matthew says (of this fruit of the vine) Mark leaves out
the word (this) and says / of the fruit of the vine.

Now let us see likewise what agreement in form of words is betwixt S. Luke
and S. Paul.

Luke.
Luke vuriteth thus. He took bread, gave thanks, brake it and gave it to them
saing: This is my body vuich is given for you. This do in remembrance of me
Likevuise also when they had supped he took the cupp saying, Luc. 22.
This cupp is the nevue testament in my blood vuich is shed for you.

S. Paul.
S. Paul sets fourth Christ's supper thus, the Lord Ihesus the same night
in the vuich he vuas betrayed, took bread, and gave thanks, and brake. and
said, ^. Cor. 11.
Take, eat, this is my body vuiche is broken for you. This do in remembrance
of me. After the same manner he took the cupp when supper vuas done saing,
This cupp is the nevue testament in my blood. This do as often as ye drink
it, in the remembrance of me: for as often, as ye shall eat this bread, and
drink this cup, ye shall shevue the Lords death till he comme.

Here where Luke says (which is given) Paul says (which is broken). And as
Luke adds to the words of Paul spoken of the cup (which is shedd for you)
so likewise Paul adds to the words of Luke (this do as often as ye shall
drink it in the remembrance of me). The rest that follows in S. Paul both
there and in the x. chapter / pertains to the right use and doctrine of the
Lords supper.

Thus the Evangelists and S. Paul have rehearsed the words and work of
Christ / whereby he did institute and ordeine this holy Sacrament of his
blessed body and blood to be a perpetual remembrance of him self until his
coming again: of him self (I say) that is of his body given for us / and
of his blood shed for the remission of sins.

But this remembrance thus ordained as the awthor thereof is Christ both god
and man: so by thallmighty power of god / far passes all kind of
remembraunces that any other man is able to make / either of him self / or of
any other thing / for who so ever receueth this holy sacrament thus ordained
in remembrance of Christ he receives therewith either death or life / In this
I do trust we all agree. For saint Paul says of the godly receuers in the
x. chapter of his first epistle to the Corinthians. 1. Cor. 10.
The cup of blessing which we bless / is it not the partaking or felowshipp
of Christ's blood? And also he says: the bread which we break (and means
at the Lords table) is it not the partaking or fellowship of Christ's body?
Now the partakinge of Christ's body and of his blood unto the faithful and
godly / is the partaking or fellowship of life and of immortality. And again
of the bad and ungodly receivers / S. Paul plainly says thus. 1. Cor. 11.
He that eats of this bread and drinks of this cup unworthily / he is
gilty of the body and blood of the Lord. O how necessary then is it / if
we love life and would eschew death / to try and examine our selves before
we eat of this bread / and drink of this cup. For else assuredly / he that
eats and drinks unworthily / eats and drinks his own damnation /
because he estemeth not the Lords body / that is he receives not the Lords
body with the honor which is due unto him. And yet by that which was said
/ that with the receipte of the holy Sacrament of the blissed body and
blood of Christ / is received of every one good or badde / either life or
death: it is not meant that they which are dead before God / hereby may
receive life / or the living before God / ca^ herby receive death. For as none
is meet to receive natural food / whereby the natural life is norished /
except he be borne / and live before: so no man can feed / by the receipte of
this holy Sacrament / of the food of eternal life / except he be
regenerated and borne of god before. And on the other side / no man her
receives damnation / which is not dead before God.

Thus hitherto without all doubt God is my witness (I say so far as I know)
there is no controversy among the^ that be learned in the church of England
/ concerning the matter of this Sacrament / but all do agree / whether they
be new or old (and to speak plain / and as some of them odiouslye either do
call other) whether they be protestants / papists / pharisees or Gospellers.

And as all do agree hitherto in the aforesaid doctrine: so all do deteste
the wicked herisie of the Messalians which be otherwise called Euchites /
Triparti. histo. lib. 7. cap. 11.
which said that the holy sacrament can neither do good nor harm.

All do also condemn these wicked Anabaptists which put no difference
between the Lords table and the Lords meat / and their own.

And because charity would we should if it be possible / and so far as we
may with the safegarde of good conscience / and maintenance of the truth to
agree with all men: therefore me thinks it is not charitably done to burden
any manne either new or old as they call them / Charity vuil belie no man.
further then such do declare themselves to dissente from that we are
persuaded to be the truth / and pretend there to be controversies / whereas
none such are in deed / and so to multiply the debate / the which the more
it does increase / the further it does depart from the unity that the true
Christian should desire. And again this is true that the truth neither
needs nor will be maintened with lies. It is also a true commen proverb /
that it is even sin to lie upon the deuell. For though by thy lie thou doeste
seame never so much to speak against the deuell / yet in that thou lieste in
deed / thou workest the deuelles work / thou doste him service / and takeste
the devils part.

Now / whether then do they godly and charitablye / The papists do belie the
prechars of the gospel.
which either by their pen in writing / or by their words in preaching / do
bear the simple people in hand that these which thus do teach and believe:
do go about to make the holy Sacrament ordained by Christ himself / a
thing no better then a piece of commen baken bread / or / that do say / that
such do make the holy sacrament of the blessed body and blood of Christ /
nothing else but a bare sign / or figure to represente Christ / none otherwise
then the Iuie bushe does represente the wine in a tavern / or as a vile
person gorgiouslie appareled may represente a king / or a prince / in a
play? Alas let us leave liyng / and speak the truth every man not only to
his neighbor / Ephe 5.
but also of his neighbor / for we are members one of another says S Paul.
The controversy no doubt which at this day troubles the church (wherein
any mean learned man either old or new does stand in) is not whether the
holy sacrament of the body and blood of Christ is no better the^ a piece of
co^me^ bread or not? Or whether the Lords table is no more to be regarded
then the table of any earthlye man or not? or whether it is but a bare sign or
figure of Christ and nothing else or no? For all do grant that S Paul's
words do require / that the bread which we break / is the partakinge of the
body of Christ. And all also do grant him that eats of that bread or
drinks of that cup unworthily / to be guilty of the Lords death / and to
eat and drink his own damnation / because he estemeth not the Lords body.
All do grant that these words of S Paul when he says (if we eat it
auantageth us nothing / or if we eat not / we want nothing thereby) are not
spoken of the Lords table / but of other commen meats. 1. Cor. 8.


Thus then hitherto yet we all agree. But now let us see wherein the
dissension does stand. The understanding of that wherein it does chiefly
stand is a step to the true searching forth of the truth. For who can seek
well a remedy / if he know not before the disease?

It is neither to be denied nor dissembled / that in the matter of this
Sacrament there be diverse points / wherein men counted to be learned can
not agree. The chieffe points off controversy abovute the sacrament.
As whether there be any transubstantiation of the bread or no? Any corporal
and carnal presence of Christ's substance or no? Whether adoracion only due
unto God / is to be done to the sacrament or not? And whether Christ's body
be be there offered in deed unto the heavenly father by the priest or not?
Or whether the evil man receive the natural body of Christ or not?

Yet nevertheless as in a man diseased in diverse parts / commenlie the
original cause of such diverse diseases which are spredde abroad in the body
do come from some one chief membre / as from the stomach or from the head:
even so al those five aforesaid points do chiefly hang upon this one
question / which is / what is the matter of the Sacrament / whether is it the
natural substance of bread / or the natural substance of Christ's own body.

The treuth of this question truly tried out and agreed upon / no doubt
shall cease the controversy in all the reaste. For if it be Christ's own
natural body / borne of the virgin / then assuredly (seeing that all
learned men in England / (so far as I know) both new and old / grant
there to be but one substance / then I say / they must needs grant
Transubstantiation / that is a change of the substance of bread into the
substance of Christ's body: then also they must grant the carnal and
corporal presence of Christ's body: then must the sacrament be adored with
the honor due unto Christ himself / for the unity of the two natures in one
person: then if the priest do offer the sacrament / he does offer in deed
Christ himself: and finallye the murderer / the adulterer / or wicked man /
receiuinge the Sacrament / must needs there receive also the natural
substance of Christ's own blessed body / both / fleash and blood.

Now on the other side / if after the truth shall be truly tried owte / it be
fownd / that the substance of bread / is the material substance of the
sacrament (althowgh for the change of the use / office / and dignity of the
bread / the bread in deed sacramentally is changed into the body of Christ /
as the water in Baptism is sacramentally changed into the fountain of
regeneracion / and yet the material substance thereof remains all one as was
before) if (I say) the true solutyon of that former question / wheruppon all
these controversies do hang / be / that the natural substance of bread / is
the material substance in the holy sacrament of Christ's blessed body: then
must it follow of that former proposition confessed of all that be named to be
learned / (so far as I know) in England / which is / that there is but one
material substance in the sacrament of the body / and one only likewise in
the sacrament of the blood: that there is no such thing in deed / and in truth
/ as they call transubstantion (for the substance of bread remains still in
the sacrament of the body) then also the natural substance of Christ's humane
nature which he took of the virgin Marie is in heaven / where it reigns now
in glory / and not here enclosed under the form of bread: then that godly
honor which is due unto God the creator / and may not be done to the
creature / without Idolatry and sacrilege / is not be done to the holy
Sacrament / then also the wicked (I mean) the impenitent murderer / adulterer
/ or such like do not receive the natural substance of the blissed body and
blood of Christ: finally then does follow that Christ's blissed body and blood
which was once only offered / and shed upon the cross / being auailable for
the sins of all the world / is offered up no more in the natural substance
thereof / neither by the priest nor any other thing.

But here before we go any further to search in this matter and to wade (as
it were) to search and try out (as we may) the truth thereof in the
scripture / it shall do well by the way to know / whether they that thus make
answer and solution to the former principal question / do take away
simplye and absolutlye the presence of Christ's body and blood / from the
sacrament ordained by Christ / and duly ministered according to his holy
ordinances and institution of the same.

Undoubtedly they do deny that utterly / either (...) to say / or to mean
the same. And thereof / if any (...) do or will doubt / the books which are
written already in this matter of them that thus do answer / will make the
matter plain.

Now then you will say / what kind of presence do they grant / and what do
they deny? Vuhat ki^de of presence is to be granted in the lords supper.
Briefelye they deny the presence of Christ's body in the natural substance
of his human and assumpte nature / and grant the presence of the same by
grace. That is / they affirm and say / that the substance of the natural
body and blood of Christ / is only remainynge in heaven / and so shall be
until the latter day when he shall come again in glory accompained with the
angels of heaven / Matt. 24*
to judge both the quick and the dead: And the same natural substance of the
very body and blood of Christ / because it is united to the divine nature
in Christ / the second person of the Trinity / therefore it has not only
life in it self / but it is also able and does Joan. 6.
give life unto so many as be or shall be partakers thereof / that is / that
to all that do beeleue on his Joan. 1.
name / which are not born of blood (as John says) or of the will of the
flesh / or of the will of man / but are borne of God / though the self same
substance abide still in heaven / and they for the time of their pilgremage
dwell here upon the earth / by grace I say / that is by the life mentioned in
Ihon / Joan. 6.
and the properties of the same / meet for our pilgremage here upon earth /
the same body of Christ is here present with us: Eue^ as for example we
say / the Sun which in substance never remoueth his place out of the
heavens / is yet present here by his beams / light / and natural influence /
where it shines upon the earth. For gods word and his Sacraments be as it
were the beams of Christ which Malach. 4
is Sol Iustiticie / The Sun of righteousenes.

Thus thou haste heard of what sort or sect soever thou be wherein does
stand the principal state and chief point of all the controversies which
do properly perteine unto the nature of this Sacrament: As for the use thereof
I grant there be many other things whereof here I have spoken nothing.

And now lest thou justly may complain / and say that I have in openinge
of this matter done nothing else but dug a pit / and have not shutt it up
again / or broken a gap / and have not made it up / or opened the book and
have not closed it again / or else to call me what thou listest / as Newtrall
/ Dissembler / or what soever else thy lust and learning shall serve thee to
name me worse: Therefore here now I will by Gods grace not only shortly /
but also so clearly and plainly as I can / make the now to know whether of
the foresaid two aunsweres to the former principal state and chief point
does like me best. Yea and also I will hold all those accursed which in this
matter that now so troubles the church of Christ / have of God received
the Keye of knowledge / and yet go about to shut up the doors / so that
they them selves will not enter in / nor suffer other that would

And as for mine own part I considre / boeth of late what charge and cure of
soul has been committed to me whereof God knows how soon I shall be called
to give an accoumpt / and also now in this world what peril and danger of
the laws concerning my life I am now in at this present time / what folly
were it then for me now to dissemble with God of whom assuredlye / I look /
and hope / by Christ / to have everlasting life. Seeing that such charge and
danger both before God and manne do compass me in round about on every side
/ therefore God willing I will franklye and freelye utter my mind. And though
my body be captive / yet my tongue / and my pen / as long as I may / shall
freelye set forth that which undoubtedly I am persuaded to be the truth of
Gods word. And yet I will do it under this protestation / call me a
protestante who list / A protestation.
I do not pass thereof: My protestation shall be this that my mind is / and
ever shall be (God willing) to set forth syncerlye the true sense and meaning to
the best of mine understanding / of Gods most holy word / and not to decline
from the same / either for fear of worldly danger / or else for hope of gain.
I do protest also dew obedience / and submission of my judgment in this my
writing / and in all other mine affairs / unto those of Christ's church
which be truly learned in Gods holy word / gathered in Christ's name and
guided by his spirit. An answer to the chief question*
After this protestation I do plainelye affirm and say / that the second
aunsweare made to the chief question and principal point I am persuaded to be
the very true meaning and sense of Gods holy word: That is / that the
natural substance of bread and wine / is the true material substance of the
holy sacrament of the blissed body and blood of our savior Christ.

And the places of scripture whereupon this my faith is grownded / be these /
both concerning the Sacrament of the body / and also of the blood.

First let us repete the beginning of the institution of the Lords supper
wherein all the three Eua^gelistes and S. Paul almost in words do agree /
sayng that Ihesus took bread / gave thanks / brake / and gave it to the
Disciples sayng / take eat / This is my body. Christ calls very bread
his body.
Here it appears plainlye / that Christ calls very bread his body. For
that which he took was very bread (in this all me^ do agree) and that which he
took / after he had given thanks / he brake / and that which he took and
brake / he gave it to his disciples: and that which he took brake / and gave
to his disciples / he said him self of it: This is my body. So it appears
plainlye that Christ called very bread his body. But very bread can not be
his body in very substance thereof / therefore it must needs have an other
meaning / which meaning appears plainlye what it is / by the next sentence
that follows immediately both in Luke and in Paul / and that is this / Luc.
22. 1. Cor. 11.
Do this in remembrance of me: where upon it seameth unto me to be evident /
that Christ did take bread / and called yt his body / for that he would
institute thereby / a perpetual remembrance of his body / specially of that
singular benefyte of our redemptyon / which he would then procure and purchase
unto us by his body / upon the cross. But bread retayning still his own
very natural substance / may be thus by grace / and in a sacramental
signification his body / whereas else / the very bread which he took / brake
/ and gave them / could not be in any wise his natural body / for that were
confusyon of substances. And therefore the very words of Christ joined with
the next sentence following / both enforces us to confess the very bread
to remayn still / and also opens unto us how that bread may be / and is
thus by his divine power / his body which was given for us. But here I
remember I have read in soome writers of the contrary opinion / An objection.
which do deny / that that which Christ did take / he brake. For (say
they) after his taking he blessed it / as Marcke does speak / Marc. 14.
and by his blessing he changed the natural substance of the bread into the
natural substance of his body: and so althowgh he took the bread and blessed
it / yet because in blessing he changed the substance of it / he brake not the
bread which then was not there / but only the form thereof.

Unto this objection I have ij. plain answers / Ansvuer.
boeth grounded upon Godds word. The One I will here rehearse / the other
aunsweare I will differ until I speak of the Sacrament of the blood.

Mine aunsweare here is taken out of the plain words of S Paul / which does
manifestly confound this fantastical invention / first invented (I wene) of
Pope Innocentius / and after confirmed by the subtle sophister Dunse / and
latelye renewed now in our days with an eloquent style and much finesse of
wit. It is mente of a book first set forth under the name of M. Antonius
Constantius. And after vuard of Ste* Guard. Bishop of Vuinch.
But what can crafty invention / subtlety in sophismes / eloquence or finesse
of wit prevail against the infallible word of god.

What need we to strive / and conte^d / what thing we break / for Paul says
speking undoubtedly of the Lords table / the bread (says he) which we
break / is it not the partakinge or fellowship of the Lords body? Whereupon it
follows that after the thanks giving / it is bread which we break. And how
often in the Acts of the Apostles is the Lords supper signified by breakinge of
bread. They did persevere (says S Luke) in the Apostles doctrine / communion
/ and breakyng of bread. Act. 2. ibidem
And again they brake bread in every house.

And again in an other place. When they were come together to break bread.
Act. 20.
S Paul which sets forth most fullye in his writing / boeth the doctrine
and the use of the Lords supper / and the sacramental eating / 1. Cor. 10.11.
and drynkinge of Christ's body / and blood / calls it five times / bread
/ bread / bread / bread / bread.

The sacramental bread is the mystical body / The 2 reason.
and so is called in scripture / 1 Cor. 10. as it is called the natural body
of Christ: But Christ's mystical body is the congregation of Christians. 1.
Cor. 10.
Now no man was ever so fond / as to say that that sacramental bread is
transubstantiated and changed into the substance of the congregation. Wherefore
no man should likewise think or say that the bread is transubstantiated /
and changed into the natural substance of Christ's human nature.

But my mind is not here to write what may be gathered out of scriptures
for this purpose / but only to write here briefelye those which seem to me
to be the most plain places. Therefore contented to have spoken thus much of
the sacramental bread / now I will speak a little of the Lords cup.

And this shall be my third argument grounded upon Christ's own words. The.
3. argument.
The natural substance of the sacramental wine remains still / and is the
material substance of the sacrament of the blood of Christ / therefore it is
likewise so in the sacramental bread. I know that he that is of a contrary
opinion will deny the former part of my argument. But I will prove it thus /
by the plain words of Christ himself: Matt. 26. Mar. 14.
both in Mathewe and in Mark Christ's words be thus / after the words said
upon the cup. I say unto you (says Christ) I will not drink henseforth
of this fruit of the vine tree / until I shall drink that new in my fathers
kingedome. Here note / how Christ calls plainelye his cup the fruit of the
vine tree / but the fruit of the vine tree is very natural wine / wherefore the
natural substance of the wine / does remain still in the sacrament of
Christ's blood.

And here in spekinge of the Lords cup / it comes unto my remembrance / the
vanitye of Innocentius / his fantastical invention / which by Paul's words
I did confute before / and here did promise somewhat more to speak / and that
is this If the Transubstantiacion be made by this word (blissed) in Mark
said upon the bread / as Innocentius that Pope did say / then suerlie seeing
that word is not said of Christ / neither in any of the Evangelists / nor
in Paul / upon the cup / there is no Transubstantiation of the wine at all /
for where the cause does fail there can not follow the effect. But the
sacramental bread / and the sacramental wine do both remain in their
natural substance alike / and if the one be not changed / as of the
sacrame^tall wine / it appears euidentlye then there is noe such
Transubstantiation in neither of them boeth / All that put and afferme this
change of the substance of bread and wine into the substance of Christ's body
/ and blood (called transubstantiation) do also say / and affirm / this
change to be made by a certain form of prescript words and none other / but
what they be that make the change either of the one or of the other /
undoubtedly even they that do write most finely in these our days /
almost confess plainly / Vuinch. in the ansvuer to the 48. objection.
that they can not tell. For although they grant to certain of the old
Soctours / as Chrysostom / and Ambrose / that these words (This is my body)
are the words of Consecration of the sacrament of the body / yet say they /
these words may well be so called because they do assure us of the
Consecration thereof / whether it be done before these words be spoken or no.
But as for this their doubt concerning the sacrament of the body I let it
pass.

Let us now consider the words which pertain unto the cup / This is first
evident that as Mathewe much agrees with Mark / and likewise Luke with Paul
does much agree herein in form of words: so in the same / the form of
words in Mathewe and Mark is diverse from that which is in Luke and Paul.
The old Authors do most rehearse the form of words in Matthew / and Mark /
because (I wene) they seemed to them most clear. But here I would know /
whether it is credible or no / that Luke / and Paul / when they celebrated the
Lords supper whith their congregations / that they did not use the same
form of words at the Lords table which they wrotte / Luke in his Gospel /
and Paul in his Epistell.

Of Luke because he was a Physician / whether some will grant that he might
be a Priest or no / and was able to receive the order of Priesthode which (they
say) is given by virtue of these words / said by the Bishop (take thou
authority to sacrifice for the quick and the dead) I can not tell. Vuith vuhat
vuordes, the popish priestehod is given.
But if they should be so strait upon Luke / either for his craft or else for
lack of such power given him by virtue of the aforesaid words / then I wene
both Peter and Paul are in danger to be deposed of their priestehode for the
craft / either of fishing / which was Peter's / Peter, and Paul, vuere no
priests of the popish order.
or of maki^g te^ts / which was Paul's / were more vile then the science of
phisike. And as for those sacramental words of the order of priesthod / to
have authority to sacrifyce both for the quick and the dead / I wene Peter
and Paul / if they were both a live were not able to prove that ever Christ
gave them such authority / or ever said any such words unto them. But I will
let Luke go. And because Paul speaks more plainly for him self I will
rehearse his words.

That (says Paul) which I received of the Lord I gave unto you: 1. Cor. 11.
for the Lord Ihesus etc. And so he sets fourth the whole institucio^ and
right use of the Lords supper. Now seeing that Paul here says / that which
he received of the Lord / he had given them / and that which he had received /
and given them before by word of mowthe / now he reherseth and writes the
same in his epistle / is it credible that Paul would never use this form of
words upon the Lords cup / which (as he says) he received of the Lord /
that he had given them before / and now reherseth in his epistle? I trust no
man is so far from all reason butt he will grawnt me that this is not likelye
so to be. Now then if you grant me that Paul did use the form of words
which he writes / let us the^ rehearse and consider Paul's words / which he
says Christ spoke thus upon the cup: This cupp is the new testament in my
blood / this do as often as ye shall drink it in the remembrance of me.

Here I would know whether that Christ's words spoken upon the cupp were not
as mighty in work / and as effectual in signification to all ententes /
constructions / and purposes (as our parlyame^t men do speak) as they were
spoken upon the bread? If this be grawnted / which thing I think no man can
deny / then further I reason thus: But the word (is) in the words spoken
upon the Lords bread / does mightelye signefye (say they) the change of the
substance of that which goes before yt / into the substance of that which
follows after / that is / of the substance of bread into the substance of
Christ's body / when Christ says / This is my body / Now the^ if Christ's
words which be spoken upon the cupp / which Paul here reherseth / be of
the same might and power / both in working / and signefyinge / then must this
word (is) when Christ says / This cup is the new testament / etc. turn the
substance of the cup into the substance of the new testament.

And if thou willt say that this word (is) neither makes nor signefieth any
such change of the cup / althowgh it be said of Christ / that this cup is
the new testament / yet Christ meant no such change / as that: Mary sir even
so say I / when Christ said of the bread which he took / and after thanks
given brake / and gave them saying take / eat / This is my body: he meant no
more any such change of the substance of bread / into the substance of his
natural body / then he meant of the change and transubstantiacion of the
cup / into the substance of the new testament. And if thou wilt say / that
the word (cup) her in Christ's words does not signefye the cup it self /
but the wine / or thing contained in the cupp / by a figure called Metonymia /
for that Christ's words meant / and so must needs be taken / thou say very
well. But I pray the by the way here note two things / first that this word
(is) has no such strength or signification in the Lords words to make or to
signify any transubstantiacion: 2. necessary Notes.
secondly that in the Lords words whereby he instituted the sacrament of his
blood / he uses a figurative speech. How vain then is it that some so
earnestlye do say / as it were an infallible rule / that in doctrine / and in
thinstitution of the sacraments Christ uses no figures / but all his words are
to be streined to their proper significations: when as here / what soever thou
saieste / was in the cup / yet neither that nor the cup it self was
(taking every word in his proper signification) the new testament: But in
understanding that which was in the cup / by the cup / that is a figurative
spech. Yea and also thou canste not verify or truly say of that (whether
thou saiste it was wine / or Christ's blood) to be the new testament /
without a figure also: Thus in one sentence spoken of Christ in the
institution of the sacrament of his blood / the figure must help us twice.
So untrue is it that some do write / that Christ uses no figure in the
doctrine of faith / nor in the institution of his sacraments. But some say if
we shall thus admit figures in doctrine / then shall all the articles of our
faieth by figures and allegories / shortly be transformed and vnloused. I say
it is like fault / and eue^ the same / to deny the figure where the place so
requires to be understood / as vainelye to make it a figurative speech /
which is to be understood in his proper signification.

The rules whereby the speech is known when it is figurative / and whereby it is
none / Augu. de doc. Chri. l. 3. cap. 16.
S Austine in his book called de doctrina Christiana / gives diverse learned
lessons very necessari to be known of the studente in Gods word. Of the
which one I will rehearse / which is this: If (says he) the scripture does
seame to command a thing which is wicked or ungodly: Or to forbid a thing
that charity does require / then know thou (says he) that the spech is
figurative. And for example he brings the saying of Christ in the 6 Chapter
of Saint Ihon. Except ye eat the fleash of the son of man and drink his
blood / ye can not have life in you* It seameth to command a wicked or an
ungodly thing / wherefore it is a figurative speech / commaundinge to have
communion and fellowship with Christ's passion / and deuoutelye and
wholesomelie to lay up in memory / that his fleashe was crucified and wounded
for us.

And here I can not but marvel at some men / suerelye of much excellent
finesse of wit / Vuinch. in his ansvuers to the 16. and 226. objection.
and of great eloquence / that are not ashamed to write and say that this
aforesaid saiynge of Christ is (after Saint Austen) a figurative speech in
deed / but not unto the learned / but unto the unlearned / here let any man
that indifferently understands the latte^ tongue / read the place in S
Austen / and if he per / ceiue not clearlye S Austens words and mind to be
contrary / let me abide thereof the rebuke.

This lesson of S Austen I have therefore the rather set forth / because as it
teaches us to understand that place in Ihon figuratiuelye / even so suerlye
the same lesson with the example of S Austens exposition thereof teaches us /
not only by the same to understand Christ's words in the institution of the
Sacrament both of his body / and of his blood figuratiuelye / but also the
very true mening and understanding of the same. For if to command to eat the
fleashe of the son of man / and to drink his blood / seems to command an
inconvenience / and an ungodliness / and is even so in deed / if it be
understood as the words do stand in their proper signification / and
therefore must be understood figuratively and spirituallye / as S Augustine
does godly / and learnedlie interpretate them: Then suerlie / Christ
commaundinge in his last supper to eat his body / and to dri^ke his blood /
seems to command in sound of words / as great and even the same inconvenience
and ungodliness as did his words in the 6. Chapter of S. Ihon / and therefore
must even by the same reason be likewise understood and expounded
figuratiuelye and spirituallie / as S Austin did the other. Whereunto that
exposition of S Austen may seame to be the more mete / for that Christ in his
supper / to the commandment of eatinge and drinkinge of his body / and blood
/ adds / do this in remembrance of me / which words suerlye were the keye
that opened and reveled this spiritual and godly exposition unto S Austen.

But I have tarried longer in settinge fourth the form of Christ's words upon
the Lords cup written by Paul and Luke then I intended to do. And yet in
speaking of the form of Christ's words spoken upon his cup / it comes now
unto my remembrance the form of words used in the lattin Mass upon the
Lords cup: Whereof I do not a little marvel what should be the cause /
seeing the latten Mass agrees with the Evangelists and Paul in the form of
words said upon the bread / Vuordes of the latin Mass.
why in the words saiede upon the Lords cup / it differs from them all: yea
and adds unto the words of Christ spoken upon the cup / these words /
Misterium fidei / that is / the Mystery of faith / which are not read to be
attributed unto the sacrament of Christ's blood / neither in theuangelistes nor
in Paul / nor so far as I do know in any other place of holy scripture /
yea and if it may have some good exposition / yet why it should not be as well
added unto the words of Christ* upon his bread as upon his cup / suerlie I
do not see the mystery.

And because I se in the use of the lattin Mass / the sacrament of the blood
abused / when it is denied to the lay men / The abuse of the sacrament in he
latin Mass.
clean contrary to gods most certain word: For why I beseech the should
the sacrament of Christ's blood / be denied unto the lay Christian / more
then to the priest? did not Christ shead his blood as well for the lay godly
man / as for the godly priest? if thou wilt say / yeas / that he did so / but
yet the sacrament of the blood is not to be received with out the offering up
and sacrifycing thereof unto god the father / both for the quick / and for the
dead / and no man may make oblatyon of Christ's blood unto god / but a priest
/ and therefore the priest / and that but in his mass only / may receive the
sacrament of the blood. And call ye this (masters) mysterium fidei? alas /
alas / I fear me this is before god / mysteriu^ iniquitatis the mystery off
iniquitee / such as saint Paul speaks of in his epistle to the Thessalonia^s.
2 Thessalonians. 2 Psalm. 67.
The lord be merciful unto us / and bless us / lighten his cowntenaunce upon
us / and be merciful unto us. That we may know thy way upon earth / and
among all people thy salvation. This kind of oblation stands upon
transubstantyacion his germayne coosyn / and do grow both upon one grownd /
the lord weed it out of his vyneyard shortly (if it be his blessed will and
pleasure) that bitter root.

To speak of this oblation how much it is iniuryous unto Christ's passion /
The Mass sacrifice is iniuriouse to Christespassio^.
how it can not but with high blasphemy / and heinous arrogancy / and
intolerable pride be claymed of any man / other then of Christ him self / how
much / and how plainly it repugneth unto the manifest words / the true sense
and meaning of holy scripture in many places / especially in thepistle to the
Hebrews: Hebr. 9.10.
The matter is so long and other have written in it at large / that my mind
is now not to entreat thereof any further. For only in this my scribbling I
intended to search out and set forth by the scriptures / according to gods
gracious gift of my poor knowledge whether the true sense and meaning of
Christ's words in the institution of his holy supper / do require any
transubstantiation (as they call it) or that the very substance of bread and
wine do remain still in the Lords supper / and be the material substance
of the holy sacrament of Christ our sauioures Blissed body and blood.

Yet there remains one vain Quiddite of Duns in this matter / the which
because some that write now do seem to like it so well / Vui^ch. in the
aunsvuere to the 15 objection.
that they have strypped him out of Dunses dustie and darcke terms / and
pricked him and painted him in fresh colores of an eloquente style / may
therefore deceive the more except the error be warely escheued.

Dunse says in these words of Christ / this is my body / this pronoune
demonstratiue / meaning the word (this) if ye will know what it does show or
demonstrate / whether the bread that Christ took or no: he answers no / but
only one thing in substance it points / whereof the nature or name it does
not tell / but leaves that to be determined and told by that which follows
the word (is) that is by predicatum / as the Logician does speak / and
therefore he calls this pronowne demonstratiue (this) indiuiduum vagum / that
is a wandering proper name / whereby we may point out and show any one
thing in substance / what thing soever it be.

That this imagination is vain and untruly applied unto those words of Christ
(this is my body) it may appear plainly by the words of Luke / and Paul /
said upon the cup / conferred with the form of words spoken upon the cup
in Matthew and Mark / for as upon the bread it is said of all / this is my
body / so of Mathewe and Mark is said of the cup / this is my blood. Then if
in the words This is my body / the word (this) be as Dunse calls it a
wandering name / to appointe and show furthe any one thing whereof the name
or nature it does not tell: so must it be likewise in those words of
Mathewe and Mark upon the Lords cup / This is my blood. But in the words of
Mathewe and Mark / it signifies / and points out the same / that it does in
the lords words upon the cup in Luke / and Paul / where it is said: This
cup is the new testamente in my blood / etc^ Therefore in Mathewe and Mark
/ the pronowne demonstratiue (this) does not wander to point only one
thing in substance / not showing what it is / but tells it plainly what
it is / no less in Mathewe and Mark to the eye / then is done in Luke and
Paul / by putting to this word (cup) boeth unto the eye / and unto the ear*

For taking the cup and demonstrating or showing it unto his disciples by
this pronowne demonstratiue (this) and sayng unto them: drynk ye all of this /
it was then all one to say / This is my blood: as to say. This cupp is my
blood: meaning by the cup as the nature of the spech does require the thing
contained in the cupp: so likewise withowt all dowbte when Christ had taken
bread / given thanks / and broken it / and giving it to his disciples / said /
Take / and so demonstrating and showing that bread which he had in his hands /
to say then. This is my body / and to have said this bread is my body. As it
were all one if a man lacking a knyffe and going to his oysters would say to
another / whom he saw to have ij. knyfes. Sir I pray you lend me the one of
your knyfes: were it not now all one to answer him / Sir hold I will lend you
this to eat your meat / but not to open oysters with all: and hold I will
lend you this knyf to eat your meat / but not to open oysters. This similitud
serves but for this purpose / to declare the nature of spech whithall / where
as the thing that is demonstrated and showed / is evidently perceived / and
openly known unto the eye. But o good Lord what a wonderful thing is it to
see / how soome Vuinch. in the ansvuer to the 13 objection
men do labor to teach / what is demonstrated and showed by the pronowne
demo^stratiue (this) in Christ's words / when he says / This is my body /
this is my blood / how they labor I say to teach what that (this) was then
in deed / when Christ spoke in the beginning of the sentence / the word (this)
before he had pronownced the rest of the words that followed in the same
sentence / so that their doctrine may agree with their transubstantiation
which in deed is the very foundation / wherein all their erroneous doctrine
does stand.

And here the transubstantiators do not agree amongst them selfs / The
papists them selfs do not agree.
no more then they do in the words which wrought the transubsta^tiacion when
Christ did first institute his sacrament. Wherein Innocentius Bisshopp of Rome
of the latter days and Duns (as was noted before) do attribute the work unto
the word (benedixit / blessed) But the rest for the most part to (Hoc est
corpus meum / This is my body) etc. Dunse therefore with his sect because he
puts the change before / must needs say that (this) when Christ spoke it
in the beginning of the sentence was in deed Christ's body. For in the change
the substance of bread did depart / and the change was now done in
(benedixit says he) that went before. And therefore after him and his / that
(this) was then in deed Christ's body / thowgh the word did not import so
much / but only one thing in substance / which substance after Duns / the
bread being gone / must needs be the substance of Christ's body.

But they that putt their transubstantiacion to be wrought by these words of
Christ / This is my body / and do say that when the hole sentence was
finished / then this change was perfected / and not before / they can not say
/ but yet Christ's (this) in the beginning of the sentence / before the other
words were fully pronounced / was bread in deed: For as yet the change was
not done / and so long the bread must needs remainer and so long as the
substance of the bread does remain / so long with the universal consent of al
tra^substantiators / the natural substance of Christ's body cannot come and
therefore must their (this) of necessity demonstrate and show the substance
which was as yet in the pronouncing of the first word (this) by Christ / but
bread.

But how ca^ they make and verify Christ's words to be true / demostrating the
substance / which in the demonstration is but bread / and say thereof: This
is my body / that is as they say / the natural substance of Christ's body
except they wolude say that the verb (is) signifies / is made / or is
changed into / and so the^ if the same verb (is) be of the same effect in
Christ's words / spoken upon the cup / and rehearsed by Luke and Paul / the
cup or the wine in the cup / must be made or turned into the new testament
/ as was declared before.

Vuinch. is become a Neutrall.
There be some among the transubstantiators which walk so wilely and so
warely / betwixt these ij. aforesaid opinions / allowinge them both and
holding plainelye neither of them boeth / that me think they may be called
Neutrals Ambidexters / or rather such as can shifte on boeth sides. They
play on boeth parts: for with the latter they do allow the doctrine of the
last syllable / which is that transubstantiation is done by miracle / in an
instante / at the sound of the last syllable (um) in this sentence / hoc est
corpus meum: And they do allow Dunses fantastical imaginacion of indiuiduu^
vagum / that demonstrateth (as he teaches) in Christ's words / one thing in
substance / then being (after his mind) the substance of the body of
Christ.

A marvelous thing how any manne can agree with both these two / they being
so contrary the one unto the other / for the one says the word (this)
demonstrateth the substance of bread / and the other says no not so. The
bread is gone / and it demonstrateth a substance which is Christ's body.
Tushe says this third man. Vuinch in the ansvuere to the 84 objection
Ye understand nothing at all they agree well enough in the chief point /
which is the ground of all / that is boeth do agree and bear witness /
that there is transubstanciation. They do agree in deed in that conclusion I
grant / but their profes and doctrine thereof do even as well agree together /
as did the false witnesses before Annas and Caiphas against Christ / or the
two wicked judges against Susanna. For against Christ the false witness
did agree no (doubt) to speak all against him: And the wicked judges were
both agreed to condemn poor Susanna / but in exa^inatio^ of their witnesses /
they dissented so far / that al was found false that they went about / both
that wherein they agreed / and also those things which they brought for their
proofs.

Thus much have I spoken in searchyng out a solution for this principal
question / which was / what is the material substance of the holy sacrament
in the Lords supper.

The consent of the old Authors.
Now lest I should seame to set by my own conceit more then is meet / or
less to regard the doctrine of the old Ecclesiastical writers / then is
convenient for a man of my poor learning / and simple wit for to do: And
because also I am in deed persuaded that the old ecclesiastical writers
understood the true meaning of Christ in this matter / and have both so truly
/ and so plainly / set it forth in certain places of their writings / that
no man which will vouchsase to read them / and without prejudice of a corrupt
judgment will indifferently wey them / and construe their minds none other
wise / then they declare them self to have meant / I am persuaded I say that
in reding of them thus / no man can be ignorant in this matter / but he that
will shutt up his own eyes and blind feld him self.

When I speak of ecclesiastical writers / I mean of such / as were before the
wicked vsurpatio^ of the Sea of Rome was growe^ so immeasurable great / that
not only with tyrannical power / but also with corrupt doctrine / yt began
to subuerte Christ's gospel / and to turn the state that Christ and his
Apostles set in the church / vpside down.

For the causes before said I will rehearse certain of their sainges / and yet
because I take them but for witnesses and expownders of this doctrine / and not
as the Authors of the same: and also for that now I will not be tedyous / I
will rehearse but few / that is / three old writers of the Greek church / and
other three of the latin church / which do seem unto me to be in this matter
/ most plain.

The Greek authors are Origin / Chrysostom and Theodoret / The Lattin / are
Tertullian / S. Austin / and Gelasius.

I know there can be nothing spoken so plainly / but the craftye wit furnished
with Eloquence can darcken it / and wrest it quite from the true meaning / to a
contrary sense: And I know also that eloquence / craft and finesse of wit
/ has gone about to bleare men's eyes / and to stop their ears in the before
named writers / that men should neither hear nor see / what those authoures
boeth write and teach so plainelye / that except men should be made both
stark blind / and deaf / they can not but of necessity if they will read
and weye them indifferentelye boeth hear and see what they do mean / when
eloquence / craft / and finesse of wit / have done all that they can. Now
let us hear the old writers of the greek church.

Origene
Origene / who lived above twelve hundredth and fifty years ago / a man for
thexcellencie of his learning so highly esteemed in Christ's church / that he
was counted and was judged the singular teacher in his time of Christ's
religion / the confounder of heresies / the scolemaster of many godly martyrs
/ and an opener of the high mysteries in scripture: Eccl. Hist. lib. 6, cap 3.
he writing upon the 15 Chapter of S Mathewes gospel / says thus.

But if any thing enter into the mouth / it goth away into the belly / and is
avoided into the draught yea and that meat which is santified by the word of
god and prayer / Orig. in 15. Matthew.
concerning the matter thereof it goes away into the bellye and is avoided
into the draught / but for the prayer which is added unto it / for the
proportion of the faith / it is made profitable making the mind able to
perceive and see that which is profitable. For it is not the material
substance of bread but the word which is spoken upon it / that is
profitable to the man that eats it not unworthily. And this I mean of the
typical and Symbolicall (that is) sacramental body.

Thus far goes the words of Origene / where it is plain first that
Origene speaking there of the sacrament of the Lords supper / as the last
words do plainelye sygnifie / does mean and teach that the material
substance thereof / is received / digested / and avoided as the material
substance of other bread / and meats is / which could not be / if there
were no material substance of bread at all / as the fantastical opinion of
transubstantiation does put.

It is a world to see the aunsweare of the papystes to this place of Origene.
The disputations in the perlamente house and in the Universities.
In the disputations which were in this matter in the Parliament house / and in
boeth the universities of Camebridge and Oxforde / they that defended
transubstanciation / said that this part of Origene / was but set forth of
late By Erasmus and therefore is to be suspected.

But how vain this their answer is / it appears plainly: for so may all
the good old authors which lay in old libraries / and are set fourth of
late / be by this reason rejected / as Clemens / Alexandrinus / Theodoretus /
Justinius / ecclesiastica Historia Nicephori / and other such.

Another answer they had saying that Origene is noted to have erred in some
points / and therefore faith is not to be given in this matter to him.

But this aunswear well weighed does minister good matter to the clear
confutation of it self. For in deed we grant that in some points Origene
did err / but those erroures are gathered out / and nooted boeth of S Hierom
/ and Epiphanius / so that his works (those erroures excepted) are now so
much the more of authority / that such great learned men / took pains to
draw out of him / what soever they thought in him to be written amiss. But
as concerning this matter of the lords supper / neither they / nor yet ever
any other ancient author did ever say that Origene did err.

Now because these two aunsweres have been of late so confuted and confounded
/ Vuinchester in the aunsvuer to the 166. objection.
that it is well perceived / that they will take noe place / therefore some
which have written sense that time / have forged two other answers eue^ of
the same mould.

The former whereof is / that Origene in this place spoke not of the
Sacramental bread or wine of the lords table / but of an other mystical
meat / of the which S. Augustine makes mention to be given unto them that
were taught the faith / before they were baptized. But Origenes own words in
two sentences before rehearsed being put to gether / proves this answer
untrue: For he says that he meneth of that figurative and mystical body /
which profits them that do receive it worthyly / alluding so plainly unto S
Paul's words spoken of the Lords supper / that it is a shame for any learned
manne once to open his mouth to the contrary. And that bread which S
Augustine speaks of / he can not prove that any such thing was used in
Origenes time: Yea and though that could be proved / yet was there never bread
in any time called a sacramental body saving the sacramental bread of the
Lords table / which is called of Origene / the typical / and symbolicall
body of Christ.

The second of the two new found answers / Vuich in the same place.
is yet most monstrous of all other / which is this. But let us grant (say
they) that Origene spoke of the Lords supper / and by the matter thereof was
understood / the material substance of bread / and wine. What then say
they? for though the ma / teriall substance was once gone / and departed by
reason of transubstantiation / whileste the forms of bread and wine did
remain / yet now it is no inconvenience to say that as that material
substance did depart at the entryng in of Christ's body under the aforesaid
forms / so when the said forms be destroyed / and do not remain / then
comes again the substance of bread and wine / and this (say they) is very
meet in this mystery / that that which began with miracle / shall end in a
miracle. If I had not red this fantasy / I would scarselye have believed /
that any learned man ever would have set forth such a folish fantasy / which
not only lacks all ground either of Gods word / reason / or of any anciente
writer / but is also clean contrary to the commen rules of school divinity
/ which is / that no miracle is to be affyrmed and put without necessity.
And although for their former miracle / which is their trasubstantiation /
they have some color / though it be but vain / saying it is done by the
power / and virtue / ofthese words of Christ / This is my body / yet to
make this second miracle / of returning the material substance again / they
have no colloure at all. Or else I pray them show me / by what words of Christ
/ is that second miracle wrought.

Thus ye may see that the sleigthes and shifts which craft and wit can
inuente to wreste the true sense of Origene can not take place. But now let
us hear / one other place of Origene / and so we shall let him go.

Origene in the 11. Homelye Super Leuiticum / saeth that there is also even in
the four gospelles / and not only in the old Testamente a letter / meaning a
litterall sense which kylleth / for if thowe follow the letter (says he) in
that saiynge: except ye eat the fleash of the son of man / and drink his
blood. The second authority forth of Origene.
etc. This letter does kill. Yfin that place the letter does kill / wherein is
commanded the eating of Christ's fleash / then suerlie in those words of
Christ / wherein Christ commands us to eat his body / the literal sense
theroflikewise does kill* For it is no less crime / but even the same / and
all one in the literal sense / to eat Christ's body / and to eat Christ's
fleashe. Wherefore if the one does kill / except it be understood
figuratiuelie / and spirituallie / then the other suerly does kill likewise.
But that to eat Christ's fleashe does kill so understood / Origene
affirms plainli in his words above rehearsed. Wherefore it can not be justly
denied / but to eat Christ's body literallie understood / must needs after
him kill likewise.

The aunsweare that is made to this place of Origene / of the papists is so
folishe / that it bewraeyeth it self without any further confutation. It is
the same that they make to a place of S Augustine in his book de doctrina
Christiana. Li. 3. ca.
Whereas S. Augustine speaks in effect the same thing that Origene does
here. The papists answer is this / to the carnal man the literal sense is
hurtful / but not so to the spiritual. As though to understand that in his
proper sense which ought to be taken figuratiuelie / were to the carnal
manne a dangerous perrill / but to the spiritual manne none at all.

Now to Chrysostom whom I bring for the second writer in the Greek church.
Chrysostom.
He speakinge against the unholy vsyng of man's body / which after S Paul
ought to bekepte pure / and holy as the very temple of the holy ghost /
says thus: If it be a fault says he to translate the holied vessels (in
the which is not contained the trwe body of Christ / In opere imperfect Hom.
11. in Matthew.
but the mystery of the body) to private uses / how much more offense is it
to abuse and defile the vesseles of our body. These be the words of
Chrysostom. But I trow that here many foul shifts are devised to defeat
this place.

The authoure says one is suspected: I answer but in this place never fault
was found with him unto these our days.

And whether this author were Ihon Chrysostom himself the Archbishop of
Constantinople / or no / that is not the matter: for of al it is granted /
that he was a writer of that age / and a man of great learning. So that it
is manifest / that this which he writes / was the received opinion of learned
men in his days / or else undoubtedly in such a matter his saying should have
been impugned / of some that wrote in his time / or nere unto the same.

Nay says another / if this solution will not serve / we may say that
Chrysostom did not speak of the vesseles of the Lords cup / Vuinch. in
theansvuer to the 198. objection.
or such as was then used at the Lords table / but of the vessels used in
the temple in the old law.

This answer will serve no more then the other. For here Chrysostom speaks
of such vessels / wherein was that which was called the body of Christ /
although it was not the true body (says he) of Christ / but the mystery of
Christ's body. Now of the vessels of the old law / the writers do use no
such manner of phrase: for their sacrifices were not called Christ's body /
for Christ then was / but in shadows and figurs / and not by the sacrament of
his body / revealed.

Erasmus which was a man that could understand the words and sense of the
writer / although he would not be seen to speak against this error of
transubstantiation because he durst not / yet in his time declares plainly /
that this saying of this writer / is none otherwise to be understood.

Yet can I says the third papist find out a fine and a subtle solution for
this place / and grant all that yet is said / both alowing here the writer /
and also that he mente of the vessels of the Lords table: Vuinch. in the
same place.
For says he the body of Christ is not contained in them at the Lords table
/ as in a place / but as in a mystery. Is not this a pretty shefte / and a
mistical solution. But by the same solution then Christ's body is not in the
Lords table / nor in the priests hand / nor in the pixe / and so he is here
no where / For they will not say that he is either here / or there / as in a
place. This answer pleases so well the maker / that he himself / after he
had played with it a little while / and showed the finesse of his wit / and
eloquence therein / he is contented to give it over / and say: But it is not to
be thought that Chrysostom would speak after this finesse or subteltie /
and therefore he returns again to the second aunsweare for his shootte
anchor which is sufficientlye confuted before.

Another short place of Chrysostom I will rehearse / which (if any
indifferency may be heard) in plain terms sets fourth the truth of
this matter.

Before the bread (says Chrysostom writing ad Cesarium Monachum) / Chriso:
stome ad Caesariu^ Monachum.
be hallowed / we call it bread / but the grace of Godde sanctifiynge it by
the means of the priest / it is delivered now from the name of bread / and
esteamed worthy to be called Christ's body / although the nature of bread
abide in it still. These be Chrisostomes words / wherein I pray you what
can be said or thought more plain against this error of
Transubstantiation / then to declare that the bread abides so still.

Vuin. in his aunsvucre to the 201. objection.
And yet this so plain a place some are not ashamed thus shamefullye to elude
it / Saiynge we grant the nature of bread remains still thus / for that
it may be seen / fealte / and tasted / and yet the corporal substance of the
bread therefore is gone / lest two bodies be confused together / and Christ
should be thought impanate.

What contrariety and falsehoode is in this answer / the simple manne may
easily perceive / is not this a plain contrariety to grant that the nature
of bread remains so still / that it may be seen / fealte / and tasted /
and yet to say the corporal substance is gone / to avoid absurdity of
Christ's impanation?

And what manifest falsehoode is this to say / or mean / that if the bread
should remain still / then must follow the inconuenyence of impanation / as
though the very bread could not be a Sacrament of Christ's body / as
water is of Baptism / except Christ should unite the nature of bread to
his nature in unity of person / and make of the bread God.

Now let us hear Theodoretus / which is the last of the three Greek
authoures. Theodorete.
He writes in his dialoge Contra Eutichen / thus. He that calls his natural
body / corn and bread / and also named himself a vine tree / Dialog. 1.
even he the same has honored the Symboles / that is the sacramental signs /
with the names of his body and blood / not chaunginge in deed the nature it
self / but adding grace unto the nature. What can be mor plainlye said then
this / that this old writer says / that although the Sacraments bear the
name of the body and blood of Christ / yet is not their nature changed / but
abides still / and where is then the papists transubstanciation?

The same writer in the 2. Dialoge of the same work / Dialog. 2.
against the aforesaid heretic Eutyches / writes yet more plainly against
this error of transubstantiation / if any thing can be said to be more plain:
for he makes theretique speak thus against him that defends the true
doctrine whom he calls Orthodoxus.

As the sacraments of the body and blood of our Lord are one thing before
the invocation and after the invocation they be changed / and are made
another: So likewise / the Lords body says the heretic is after the
assumption or ascension into heaven turned into the substance of Godde:
theretique meaning thereby that Christ after his assention remains no more a
man.

To this Orthodoxus answers thus / and says to theretique. Thou art taken
(says he) in thine own snare / for those mystical symbolles / or sacraments
/ after the sanctification / do not go out of their own nature / but they
tarry and abide still in their substance / figure / and shape / yea and are
sensiblye seen / and groped to be the same they were before. etc.

At these words the papists do startle / and to say the truth / these
words be so plain / so full / The Cutle is a sea fish vuhich casts as it
vuere an yncke about herand so by making the vuater black escapes taking.
Pli. li. 9. Cap. 29.
and so clear / that they can not tell what to say / but yet will not cease
to go about to play the Cutles / and to cast their colloures over them /
that the truth which is so plainly told / should not have place.

This author wrote say they before the determination of the church. As who
would say / whatsoever that wicked man Innocentius the Pope of Rome determined
in his congregacions / with his monks and friars / that must be (for so Suns
says) holden for an article / and of the substance of our faith.

Some do charge this author that he was suspected to be a nestorian / which
thing in Chalcedon Council was tried and proved to be false.

But the foulest shift of all / So ansvueres D. Morman, in the convocation
house.
and yet the best that they can find in this matter / when none other will
serve / is to say that Theodoret understands by the word substance /
accidents / and not substance in deed. This gloss is like a gloss of a laweyer
upon a decree the text whereof begins thus. Statuimus / that is we decree.
The gloss of the lawyer there / after many other pretty shifts there set
fourth / which he thinks will not well serve to his purpose / and therefore
at the last / to clear the matter / he says thus: Distinct. 4. Cap.
statuimus.
After the mind of one Lawyer / veldic (says he) statuimus / id est
abrogamus / that is / or expound / we do decree / (that is) we do abrogate /
or disanull. Is not this a worthy and Goodlye gloss? Who will not say but he
is worthy in the Law to be retained of Counsel / that can gloss so well /
and find in a matter of dyfficultie such fine shyftes / and yet this is the
Law / or at the least the gloss of the law. And therefore who can tell what
parrell a man may incur to speak against it / except he were a lawyer in
deed / which can keep himself out of the briars / what wind soever blow.

Hitherto ye have hard three writers of the Greek Church / not all what they
do say / for that were a labor to great for to gather / and to tedyous for
the reader / but one or two places of every one. The which how plain and
how full / and clear they be against the error of Transubstantiation I
refer it to the judgment of thindifferente reader.

And now I will likewise rehearse the sayings of other three old aunciente
writers of the Lattin Church / and so make an end.

Tertullia^.
And first I will begin with Tertullian / whom Cypriane the holy Martyr so
highly esteemed that whensoever he would have his book / he was wo^t to say /
give us now the Master. Lib. 4. contra Martione^.
This old writer in his 4. book against Martion the heritike / says thus:
Jesus made the bread / which he took and distributed to his disciples / his
body / saying: This is my body / that is to say / (says Tertullian) a figure
of my body. In this place it is plain / that after Tertullians exposition /
Christ meant not by calling the bread his body / and the wine his blood / that
either the bread was his natural body / or the wine his natural blood / but
he called them his body and his blood because he would institute them to be
unto us Sacraments / that is holy tokens and signs of his body / and of his
blood / that by them remembringe / and firmly believing the benefits procured
to us by his body / which was torn and crucified for us / and of his blood /
which was shed for us upon the cross / and so with thanks receiuinge
these holy sacraments / according to Christ's institution / might by the
same be spirituallie noryshed / and fed / to thencrease of all Godliness in us
/ here in our pylgremage and journey wherein we walk unto everlasting life.

This was undoubtedly Christ our Saviors mind / and this is Tertullians
exposition. The wranglynge that the papists do make to elude this saiynge of
Tertullian / is so far out of all frame that it even wearieth me to think on
it.

Vuinch in his a^suuer to the 161. object.
Tertullyan writes here say they / as none has done hitherto before him. This
saying is to to manifest false: S. Augustine and other old awthors likewise do
call the Sacrament a figure off Christ's body.

And where they say / that Tertullian wrott this / when he was in an heat off
disputation with an heretic / coveting by all means to ouerco^ his aduersarye.
As who say he would not take heed what he did say / and specialy what he would
write in so high a matter / so that he might have the better hand off his
adversary. Is this credible to be true in any godly wyseman? How much less
then is it worthy to be thowght / or credited in a man off so great wit /
lernyng / and excellency / as Tertullian is worthily / esteamed ever to have
been.

Lykwise this author in his first book against the the same heretic Martion
writes thus. God did not reject bread / which is his creature: for by it he
has made a representation off his body. Now I prai you what is this to say /
that Christ has made a representation by bread of his body / but that Christ
has / Lib. 1. co^tra Mar.
instituted and ordained bred to be a sacrament / for to represent unto us his
body Now whether the representation of one thing by another / requires the
corporal presence of the thing which is so represented / or no / every man
that has understanding / is hable in this point (the matter is so clear of
it lsefe /) to be a sufficient judge.

The second doctor and writer off the latin church whose sayings I promised
to set forth / S. August.
is S. Augustine / off whose lernyng / and estimation / I need not to speak:
for all the church of Christ both has / and ever has had him for a man of
most singular learning / wit and dilygence / both in setting fourth the true
doctrine of Christ's religion / and also in the defense off the same against
heretics.

This awthor as he has written most plenteously in other matters off our faith
/ so like wise in this argument he has written at large in many off his
works so plainli against this error of transubstantiation / that the
papistsloue least to hear of him off all other writers / partly for his
authority / and partly because he opens the matter more fully then any one
other does. Therefore I will rehearse more place off him / then heretofore I have
done of the other.

And first what can be more plain / then that which he writes upon the 89.
psalm speking of the sacrament of the Lords body and blood / and rehersing
(as yt were) Christ's words to his disciples affter this manner.

Yt is not this body which ye do see / that ye shall eat / neither shall ve
drink this blood / which the Soudiares that Crucefye me schall spille / or
shed: I do commend unto you a mystery or a sacrament / which spiritually
understood shall give you life. Now if Christ had no more natural and
corporal bodies but that one / which they then presently boeth hard / and
saw: And none other natural blood / but that which was in the same body /
and the which the soldiers cruellye did after shed upon the Cross / and
neither this body / nor this blood / was by this declaration of S. Augustine
/ either to be eaten / or dronken / but the mystery thereof spirituallye to be
understanded: Then I conclude / (if this saying and exposition of S. Augustine
be trwe) / that the mystery which the disciples should eat / was not the
natural body of Christ / but a misteri of the same / spirituallye to be
understood. For as S. Augustine says in his 20. book contra faustum. Cap.
21 Christ's fleashe and blood was in the old testament promised by
similitudes / and signs of their sacrefyces / and was exhibited in deed / and
in truth / upon the cross / but the same is celebrated by a sacrament of
remembrance upon the altar.

And in his book de fide ad Petrum. Cap. 19 / he saeth that in these
Sacrifices (meaning of the old law) it is figuratiuelie signified / what
then was to be given: But in this Sacrifice it is evidently signified what is
already given / understanding in the sacrifice upon the altar / the
remembrance and thanks giving for the fleashe / which he offered for us / and
for the blood which he shed for us upon the Cross / as is in the same
place / and euidentlye there it may appear.

Another euidente and clear place / wherein it appears that bythe
Sacramental bread / which Christ called his body / he meante a figure of
his body / is upon the third Psalm: Where Sancte Augustine speaks thus in
plain terms. Christ did admit Judas unto the feast / in the which he
commended to his disciples the figure of his body. This was Christ's last
supper before his Passion: Wherein he did ordain the Sacrament of his body
/ as all learned men do agree.

S. Augustine also in his 23. Epistle ad Bonifacium teaches how Sacraments
do bear the names of the things whereof they be sacraments / boeth in
Baptism / and in the Lords table. August. Epi. 23.
Even as we call every good friday / the day of Christ's passion: and every
Easter day the day of Christ's resurrection. When in very deed there was but
one day wherein he suffered / and one day wherein he rose. And why do we then
call them so which are not so in deed / but because they are in like time / and
course of the year / as those dais were wherein those things were done: Was
Christ (saeth S. Austin / offered any more but once? and he offered himself:

And yet in a sacrament / or representation / not only every solemn feast
of Easter / but also every day / to the people he is offered. For if
sacraments had not some similitude / or likeness of those things whereof they be
sacraments / they could in no wise be sacraments. And for their similitudes /
and likeness comme^ly they have the names of the things whereof they be
sacraments. Therefore / as after a certain manner of spech / the sacrament of
Christ's body / is Christ's body / the sacrament of Christ's blood / is
Christ's blood / so likewise the sacrament of faith is faith. etc.

After this manner of speech / as S. Augustine techeth in his questions Super
Leuiticum / et contra adimantum / Question 57.
it is said in scripture that seven ears of corn be seven years / seven
kyne be seven years / and the rock was Christ / and blood is the soul: The
which last saiynge (says S. Austen) in his book contra adimantum / is
understood to be spoken in a sign / or figure / for the Lord himself did
not stick to say / This is my body / when he gave the sign of his body.
Cap. 13.


For we must not considre in sacraments (says S. Augustine in an other
place) what they be / but what they do signify. Contra Maximium. lib. ca. 22.
For they be signs of things / being one thing in themselves / and yet
signifiyng an other thing. For the heavenly bread (says he) speakinge of the
sacramental bread / by some manner of speech is called Christ's body / when
in very deed it is the sacrament of the body / etc.

What can be more plain / or more clearly spoken / then are these places of
S. Augustine before rehearsed / if men were not obstinately bent to mainteyne an
vntrewth / and to receive nothing what so ever does set it fourth.

Yet one place more of S. Augustine will I allege which is very clear to
this purpose / that Christ's natural body is in heaven and not here
corporally in the sacrament / and so let him depart.

In his 50. Tract. 50. in Joan.
Treatise which he writes upon Ihon^ he teaches plainly / and clearlie how
Christ being both God and man / is both here after a certain manner / and yet
in heaven / and not here in his natural body and substance which he took of
the blessed virgin Marie speking thus of Christ and saing. By his divine
majesty by his providence / by his unspeakable and invisible grace / that is
fulfilled which he spoke: Behold I am with you unto the end of the world. But
as concerning his fleash / which he took in his incarnation / as towching
that which was born of the virgin / as concerning that which was apprehended
by the Jews / and crucified upon a tree / and taken down from the cross /
lapped in lynen clothes / and buried and rose again / and appeared after his
resurrecton / as coocerning that fleash he said / Ye shall not ever have me
with you / why so? For as concerning his fleashe he was conuersaunt with his
disciples 40. days / and they accompanying / seeing / and not following him /
he went up into heaven and is not here. By the presence of his divine majesty
he did not depart / as concerning the presence of his divine majesty we have
Christ ever with us / but as concerning the presence of his fleash he said
truly to his disciples / ye shall not ever have me with you. For as concerning
the presence of his fleashe / the church had him but a few days / now yt
holds him by faith / thowgh it sees him not.

Thus much S. Augustine speaks repeting one thing so often / and all to declare
/ and teach / how we should understand the manner of Christ's being here with
us / which is by his grace / by his providence / and by his divine nature / and
how he is absent by his natural body / which was born of the virgin Marie /
dyed / and rose for us / and is ascended into heaven / and there sits as is
in tharticles of our faith on the right hand of god / and thense / and from
none other place (says S. Augustine) shall comme on the latter day to judge
the quick and the dead. At the which day the righteous shall then lift up
their heads / and the light of gods truth shall so shine / that falsehood /
and errors shall be put to perpetual confusion. Righteousness shall have the
upper hand / and truth that day shall bear away the victory / all the
Enemies thereof quyte overthrown / to be trodden under foot for evermore.

O Lord / Lord / I beseach the / have this day / the^ shall thou be glorified
with the glory dew unto thy holy name / and unto thy divine majesty / and we
shall singe unto the in all joy and felicitee laud and praise for evermore.

Here now would I make an end / for methink S. Augustine is in this matter so
full / and plain / and of that authority / that it should not neade after
this his declaration / being so firmly grownded upon gods word / and so
well agreing with other awncyene awthours / to bring in for the confirmation of
this matter / any more. And yet (I said) I would allege three / of the Latyne
church / to testefye the truth in this cause.

Now therefore the last of all shall be Gelasius / Gelasius.
which was a Busshop of Rome / but one that was Busshopp of that Sea / before
the wicked usurpation / and Tyranny thereof spredde / and brast out abroad
into all the world. For this man was before Bonifacius / yea and Gregory the
first: In whose days / both corruption of doctrine / and tyrannical
vsurpatio^ did chiefly grow / and had the upper hand.

Gelasius in an Epistle of the two natures of Christ / contra Eutichen /
writes thus. The sacraments of the body and blood of Christ / which we
receue / are godly things / whereby / and by the same / we are made partakers
of the diui^e nature / and yet nevertheless the substance / or nature / of the
bread / and wine does not depart or go away.

Note these words I beseach you / and consider / whether any thing can be more
plainly spoken / then these words be against the error of Transubstantiation:
which is the grownd / and bitter root whervppon springs all the horrible
errors before rehearsed.

Wherefore seeing that (...) falsehood hereof does appear so manyfestly / and by
so many ways / so plainly / so clearelie / and so fullye / that no man needs
to be deceived / but he that will not see / or will not understand. Let us all
that do love the truth / embrase yt / and forsake the falsehed / for he that
loves the truth / is of god / and the lack of the love thereof / is the cause
why God suffers men to fall into errors / and to perish therein / yea and as
S. Paul says / why he sends unto them illusyons / that they believe lies /
unto their own condemnatyon: because (says he) they loved not the truth.
This truth / no dowbt / is Gods word / for Christ him self says / unto his
Father: Thy word is truth / the love / and light whereof / Almightye God
heavenly father give us / and lighten it in owr hearts / by his holy Spirit
/ throwghe Jesus Christ our Lord / AMEN.
