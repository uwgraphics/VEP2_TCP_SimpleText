To the Reader.
THE great care I have, being yet but a mean and inferior member of the body
of this our flourishing common wealth of England, that the same and all the
parts thereof might more and more in wealth and prosperity abide free from
thraldom and bondage, that might happen by foreign greedy governors. And the
fear that I have conceived, least some evil disposed persons, not content
with their own, might in this dangerous time, upon some hope to find us a
monstrous and unnatural body, attempt a disturbaunce, yea rather an utter
overthrow of us al: These things I say, have been the causes (gentle Reader) of
this my brotherlye Exhortation, dedicated unto thee, humbly beseching thee to
accept the same, as a welment token of my good will, though not stuffed with
eloquen style, yet stored with h^rtie and loving zeal toward thee, and the
rest of this our native Country. Farewell in the Lord.

AN EXHORTAtion to England.
A Wake each English Wight,
both high and low awake:
Fear not the froward boasting bragges,
that foreign foes do make.
Conspiring your distress, for
sticking to the troth,
And for refourming the abuse,
of such as lived in sloth.
But way the rightful ground,
and state wherein you stand:
And mark thaccursed cruel cause,
that they do take in hand.
You do your sacred faith,
and countries soil defend:
Tabolish faith, and conquer you,
they surely do intend.
Each cause of yours may cause
your heart great comfort take:
Each cause of theirs may justly cause
their coward heart to quake.
They hope perhaps to have,
some help within this I Will:
But sure I hope their firmest frindes,
will justly them beguyle.
For though they think that some,
do so digress from kind,
That tryfling toys and childish chattes,
can change their English mind:
I trust when trial happes,
they shall have their deserts.
Not Traitors aid, but sharp revenge
by trusty english hearts.
Think they we force so light,
the loss of English soil?
Our native country so long kept,
will we now lose with foil?
Our kindred and Alies,
our wives and children dear
Shall we not seek to shield from death?
shall we so vile appear?
Each brute and saluage beast
his kind will seek to save:
Shall Christians then? shall they be seen
more beastly minds to have?
I hope what ever cause
does cause debates to be,
The doubt to lose life, lands, and goods,
will cause us to agree
To join our willing minds,
our goods and greatest force:
Tannoy our foes, to shield our self
from bloody stained corse.
What should us daunt one ioate,
or make us be dismayed?
Let never threats of foreign foes
make English men afraid.
Look back to ancient writ
of valiant enterprise:
And see with how great foyles their foes
your Elders did agrise.
Read Froysart that did write
the Frenchmens happes that fell:
What ouerthro was by thenglish given
to France, does he there tell?
1 Let Cressy battle great
most joyful comfort yield:
Who there but manfull Englishmen
did win the foughten field?
King Edward third of name,
ematcht with eight to one,
Did yet prevail: shall we then quayle,
though Edward now be gone?
2 At Poytiers note our fight
with Bow and rested Lance:
Did not one handful (as it were)
beat all the force of France?
For as their Story tells,
no French were from the same,
But such as forced not too lose
their honor or their fame.
The king himself was taken,
each noble (welnigh) slain:
Right few or none but dint of sword
did put to deadly pain.
3 How dealt the Englishmen
in Britain at Alroy?
Did they not French and Britains both
full deadly there annoy?
4 The Spanyardes may not boast
to daunt an English heart,
If they to ancient history
their memory do reuart.
Prince Edwardes noble act
call unto mind again,
Who did discomfit Henrick, that
usurped the crown of Spain:
Did vanquish both the French
and Spanyardes there in fight:
And set king Peter in his seat,
and state of sovereign right.
5 Where had our hardy hearts
of courage greater use
For our avail, than on the sea
before the town of Scluse?
The fight was fierce, and we
there matched with four to one:
Did yet from French and Normans
both, win victory alone.
6 The field of Egincourt
the Frenchmen yet may rue:
Their greatest force our army small
did nobly there subdue.
7 The journey of the Spurs
so calde by hasty flight
The French did make, and by our
hot pursuit of them in fight
May make us to rejoice,
and passing comfort find:
As often as we the hap thereof
do happily call to mind.
Our king had then in France
that field in chase to scour
The most of his nobility
and other his chiefest power.
But yet the Scottish king
that sought this Realm to sack,
Found men ynow (huge though it were)
to beat his army back.
His chance each other Prince
by proved skill may teach
To govern well his own, not roanie
for that he cannot reach.
We that have thus so often
been used to victories,
Shall we now doubt for to subdue
such deadly enemies?
Nay rather think we sure,
that these their plagues forepast,
To deal with us on this side sea,
will make them sore aghast.
I trust as of one realm,
even so they shall us see
Of one allegiaunce, of one heart,
and firm fidelity.
Behold the woeful state,
our neighbors stand now in:
By cloked craft, with show of sooth,
their sorrows did begin.
Those that did nothing doubt
defended for to be,
Do now with bitter tears lament
their heavy hap, you see.
Their land and riches great,
confiscate to the spoil,
That they and theirs in many years
have won with painful toil.
And shall we think to find
more courtesy than those,
If we permit, and not withstand
the force of foreign foes?
Nay rather, this deceit
may drive us for to dreed,
And of such like most subtle slight
to take most careful heed.
Our foes like friends will feign
to come for our soul health;
But God does know their foul pretense,
they shoot but at our wealth.
The help they hope to have,
for that we not agree
(As they suppose for sacred writ)
most justly forces me,
To call to mind thaduice
of Scorios host alone
The Romans in dissension then.
that he would set upon.
Not so said Scorio,
I not allow your reed:
For that were even the nearest way
to make them soon agreed.
For argument whereof
two Mastiffes forth he brought,
And deadly foes he did them make,
by cause right aptly sought.
A Woolfe put forth in place
no sooner in their sight,
But they as friends their common foe,
did set upon with spite.
Let then our foes forecast,
in seeking us to sack,
That natural love in English hearts
shall not be seen to lack.
And lack we men to fight?
nay were there ever more?
More active or more firmly bent,
to kill their common foe?
Munition wants not,
nor ordinance for war:
Each storehouse stust, each private house
has furniture from far.
The Queen has courage stout,
her subjects to defend:
Her people have as willing minds,
their goods and life to spend.
The cause is chiefly Gods,
whom ever his elect
Have found most ready from their foes
to shield them and protect.
Examples manifold,
for proof thereof most strong
I might allege: but some, perhaps,
would think the work to long.
Let this therefore suffice,
and let us firmly trust,
God never did nor never will
forget them that be just.
Let each repent in heart,
and mend that is amiss:
Then God, no doubt, our chief defense
will take us to be his.
That we may grace obtain
by his most gracious will,
Let every well disposed Wight
cry out unto him still.
Look Lord on Englandes state,
we humbly pray thee then,
And grant that each true English heart
consent to say, Amen.
