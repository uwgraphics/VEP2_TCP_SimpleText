TO THE MOST NOBLE and Virtuous Lady, the Lady Arbella Stuart.
Madame.
THE deep understanding you have in all the Arts, and particular excellency in
this of Music, does by a certain kind of right, challenge the Dedication of
the better sort of Labors in that Faculty; especially in these times when
Music sits solitary among her sister Sciences, and (but for your Honor)
often wants the fortune to be esteemed (for so she is worthy) even among the
worthyest. But besides that general right, my true and zealous devotion long
since desirous to express it self in any humble duty to your Honor, and
borne up by the daily experience of your most Noble and singular disposition,
has never thought upon other Patron for this work, then your Honor, whose
neuer-failing Judgment in the depth of Music, I do wish might be pleased
with some of these; which happiness if they attain, I know not what judgment
can avow to mislike them. Howsoever they behave themselves, I humbly beseech
your Honor, to believe this truth; that they are the sincere oblations of a
heart ever prepared for your service. And so with all humble and due reverence
done to your Honor, I beseech the Almighty to make you in all the passages of
your life truly happy, as you are in the worlds true opinion virtuous.

Your Honors most humbly devoted and obliged: JOHN WILBYE.

TO THE MOST NOBLE and Virtuous Lady, the Lady Arbella Stuart.
Madame.
THE deep understanding you have in all the Arts, and particular excellency in
this of Music, does by a certain kind of right, challenge the Dedication of
the better sort of Labors in that Faculty; especially in these times when
Music sits solitary among her sister Sciences, and (but for your Honor)
often wants the fortune to be esteemed (for so she is worthy) even among the
worthyest. But besides that general right, my true and zealous devotion long
since desirous to express it self in any humble duty to your Honor, and
borne up by the daily experience of your most Noble and singular disposition,
has never thought upon other Patron for this work, then your Honor, whose
neuer-failing Judgment in the depth of Music, I do wish might be pleased
with some of these; which happiness if they attain, I know not what judgment
can avow to mislike them. Howsoever they behave themselves, I humbly beseech
your Honor, to believe this truth; that they are the sincere oblations of a
heart ever prepared for your service. And so with all humble and due reverence
done to your Honor, I beseech the Almighty to make you in all the passages of
your life truly happy, as you are in the worlds true opinion virtuous.

QVINTVS. THE SECOND SET OF MADRIGALES TO 3. 4. 5. and 6. parts, apt both for
Voyals and Uoyces.

Newly Composed BY JOHN WILBYE.

1609.

LONDON: Printed by Tho. Este alias Snodham, for John Brown, and are to be
sold at his shop in S. Dunstones Churchyard in Fleetstreet.

TO THE MOST NOBLE and Virtuous Lady, the Lady Arbella Stuart.
Madame.
THE deep understanding you have in all the Arts, and particular excellency in
this of Music, does by a certain kind of right, challenge the Dedication of
the better sort of Labors in that Faculty; especially in these times when
Music sits solitary among her sister Sciences, and (but for your Honor)
often wants the fortune to be esteemed (for so she is worthy) even among the
worthyest. But besides that general right, my true and zealous devotion long
since desirous to express it self in any humble duty to your Honor, and
borne up by the daily experience of your most Noble and singular disposition,
has never thought upon other Patron for this work, then your Honor, whose
neuer-failing Judgment in the depth of Music, I do wish might be pleased
with some of these; which happiness if they attain, I know not what judgment
can avow to mislike them. Howsoever they behave themselves, I humbly beseech
your Honor, to believe this truth; that they are the sincere oblations of a
heart ever prepared for your service. And so with all humble and due reverence
done to your Honor, I beseech the Almighty to make you in all the passages of
your life truly happy, as you are in the worlds true opinion virtuous.

Your Honors most humbly devoted and obliged: JOHN WILBYE.

TENOR. THE SECOND SET OF MADRIGALES TO 3. 4. 5. and 6. parts, apt both for
Voyals and Voices.

Newly Composed BY JOHN WILBYE.

LONDON: Printed by Tho. Este alias Snodham, for John Brown, and are to be
sold at his shop in S. Dunstones Churchyard in Fleetstreet.

TO THE MOST NOBLE and Virtuous Lady, the Lady Arbella Stuart.
Madame.
THE deep understanding you have in all the Arts, and particular excellency in
this of Music, does by a certain kind of right, challenge the Dedication of
the better sort of Labors in that Faculty; especially in these times when
Music sits solitary among her sister Sciences, and (but for your Honor)
often wants the fortune to be esteemed (for so she is worthy) even among the
worthyest. But besides that general right, my true and zealous devotion long
since desirous to express it self in any humble duty to your Honor, and
borne up by the daily experience of your most Noble and singular disposition,
has never thought upon other Patron for this work, then your Honor, whose
neuer-failing Judgment in the depth of Music, I do wish might be pleased
with some of these; which happiness if they attain, I know not what judgment
can avow to mislike them. Howsoever they behave themselves, I humbly beseech
your Honor, to believe this truth; that they are the sincere oblations of a
heart ever prepared for your service. And so with all humble and due reverence
done to your Honor, I beseech the Almighty to make you in all the passages of
your life truly happy, as you are in the worlds true opinion virtuous.

Your Honors most humbly devoted and obliged: JOHN WILBYE.

Madame.
THE deep understanding you have in all the Arts, and particular excellency in
this of Music, does by a certain kind of right, challenge the Dedication of
the better sort of Labors in that Faculty; especially in these times when
Music sits solitary among her sister Sciences, and (but for your Honor)
wants the Fortune to be esteemed (for so she is worthy) even among the
worthyest. But besides that general right, my true and zealous devotion long
since desirous to express it self in any humble duty to your Honor, and
borne up by the daily experience of your most Noble and singular disposition,
has never thought upon other Patron for this work, then your Honor, whose
neuer-failing Judgment in the depth of Music, I do wish might be pleased
with some of these; which happiness if they attain, I know not what judgment
can avow to mislike them. Howsoever they behave themselves, I humbly beseech
your Honor, to believe this truth; that they are the sincere oblations of a
heart ever prepared for your service. And so with all humble and due reverence
done to your Honor, I beseech the Almighty to make you in all the passages of
your life truly happy, as you are in the worlds true opinion virtuous.

Your Honors most humbly devoted and obliged: JOHN WILBIE.
