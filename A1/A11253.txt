THE Jesuits play at Lions in France, as it was there presented.

BOTH To the amazement of the Beholders, and the destruction of the Actors, in
August last past.

Credibly informed by a Factors Letter (who was an eye witness) to his right
worshipful Master in London.

At London, Printed for Nathaniel Butter, dwelling in Paul's Churchyeard, 1607.

To the Reader.
HE who ever has seen rebellions discovered, he that has known that
Traitors live like Moles, who work unseen till they be thrown up to their
deaths* and live abroad like Flies who suck the sweet of others, yet infect
them, shall find by this discourse that Religion is made the Target to defend
Treason: Ambition, the Original, and confusion the end. Yet for thy further
satisfaction (Reader) that this discourse and every particular relation
therein, may have credit in thy judgment, know, that there is nothing therein
mentioned, but is to be approved by diverse Merchants and men of credit, now
resident in this City, and that in reading thereof, thou may witness to thy
self, that this wonder and stroke of heaven upon them, is revealed and sent
unto thee as a warning piece shot off, to admonish thee that thou fall not into
the presumption into which these Jesuits and their Desciples run headlong. I
have as in a map or Dutth Lanskip, showed thee a Module in half an hours
reading, of what held them two days in action: as the manner of the place where
they played, the form of their representing heaven and hell, the dignity
wherein the Actors sat, the causes whereupon they prepared this judgment:
namely, Ambition (whose end is always as theirs was, destruction) In any part
of which, if thou be either satisfied or admonished, my pains were a
pleasure unto me.

Farewell
The Jesuits Play at Lions in France.
SIR, I received your letters and commodities, dated the seventh of August
last, and have dispatched that business, which by your letters you commanded
me, I have paid I. P. the six hundred French crowns, according as you
appointed, and have received a discharge of him, and dd. the goods you sent,
marked with the character of * to I. L. only I cannot receive according to the
Factors promise to you, the money he pointed at Paris. The commondities you
sent for, hold yet the same benefit, as my last Letters spoke of. I have
distributed all your wares, and look according to their day, (as I am your
Factour) for your money: only I cannot receive, though with my best labors,
that debt due unto you (and you charge me to be countable of, of F. G. though
a merchant that holds his ancient pre-eminence: your profits which I writ
unto you of, are still good, only if it may please you, add to them at your
next sending, the commodities marked in the latter end of my last letter. And I
pray ye pay the Exchange bill to that Gentleman, whom I found in my affairs
profitable, so as unto my master both in my beginning and in my ending, I
commend my humblest duty unto you. Yet sir, if you will give my idleness that
leave, to use, my self, and to make practice for my experience and your
benefit, I shall be bold to use so much paper, as to amaze you at that which
made me wonder, the act is as strange as the subject, for God was abused, his
servants threatened, Ceremonies displayed, and constancy ourthrown.

Sir, I shall in this scarce make you think my words being but from a servant
have sufficient credit, because you would think, that in men, who bear show
of Divinity in their souls, profession in their tongs, I, and see me lines in
the^r habit, would offer so great an outrage to the deity of God, to the
derogation of his saints, I, and to the dishonor of Princes, who, if they
serve him, are his people and ministers. Then sir to excuse my self, that I
was an eye witness, I hope this shall serve: to see all, because I may use the
best, for without having experience in the most, I cannot be a servant for your
good: for you know sir factors (because your worthy self have bin one) as they
have many eyes that look into the^, so they should have understanding to
prevent danger. If you condemn me for seeing of their play, I will excuse it
with this, I am Gods servant, and the kings subject, Nascimur pro patria, so as
I am born to obey God, I am borne to instruct my Country, of which sir we are
both members.

The Jesuits of France, and poison of the wo^ld, who live like Iuie, which
does hurt in growing, in a chief City of France, the City Lions, being as it
were a teeming mother, and chief nurse unto them, and being banished from that
Country for a murder intended against this king Henry the fourth in August
last, after much and great suit to his Majesty, made their back repair,
where having preached that without following their steps, their charity, their
devotion, their blessings, their cursings, their pilgrimages, their prayers,
nay all their ordinances, the unskillful people must attain to heaven, and by
no other way, which they persuaded confidently unto (since they who instructed
them herein, bare humility in their looks, decency in their apparel, God in
their tongues, though Hypocrisy in their hearts) both lived and died by their
direction, looking after no other salvation.

Thus sir in my judgment, and I hope your worship will credit, they are
bewitched men, in stead of God, they serve the devil, and thus blinded poor
people they run headlong to their own damnation, yet as we are Christians
and imitate our Savior Christ, I pity their misery, pray for their
conversion, and if your patience will but read, I Will report you a wonder most
true, because mine eyes did witness it.

These Jesuits coming back into France, whereas heretofore the g^ory of their
religion was builte, upon the publishing of the labors of Saint Christopher,
the sufferings of Saint Lawrence, the troubles, travails and charity of
another, spreading by turns their Legend over, and ripping up the whole fardle
of their superstitions, I, and to make them glorious, whom their own Church
had canonized: but custom since making them more bold, to give you news to
wonder at, that men who bare the show of sanctity as they do, who seems to
be as heavens Trumpets to proclaim the will of heaven, should dare as they
have done, as it were to dispossess God of his throne, to wrest the sword of
justice from his almighty hand, and undertake to be judges of others, who
sinful (miserable men) have in their vials not so much oil of vprightnes, as
to give them true light to look into themselves.

Sir, the Subject of their late play, was the day of Judgment, that general
Sessions, before which shall go a flood of fire to destroy the world, to which
Angels must be summoners* and not mortals, where devils (which of thousand
years have bin so) stand ready to catch souls unto their torture, and not
Devils, who by their present sinful actions, make themselves so, when all
things shall determine, but these two, eternal happiness, and perpetual
pain, this fearful tune, this burning hour, which makes the strongest
shake, but even to think on it.

These Jesuits (whom I sir, being instructed in true faith by you, may rather
call devils) presume to fashion their scene in. Think then this play to be at
Lions, their stage built in their College, galleries round about, at the four
corners four tents pitched as a tyring for the Actors, the Players many, but
thespectators infinite.

First, at the 4. corners, figuring the 4. winds, 4. trumpets sounded, when
presently drums ratled like to thunder hidiously, their in^e^ted fire works
flew forth like l^ghtning, he I did seem to open, and smoke rose from thence:
after which, as the fit child of such a womb, issued out flakes of fire,
shreekings were heard beneath and music above, and at one instant, many in
the shape of fiends rose from below, some having whippes in their hands, some
forks, some snakes, all roaring cast their eyes upward, at which a Cloud,
seemed to divide it self, the form of which cloud was thus, Two silken
vailes, which being spread, showed like a Rainbow, figuring all colors both
in heaven and earth, and on the top, and intermixed between, were spangling
stars of gold, as rich, as beautiful. This spread, a place was seen that
represented Heaven, the glories of which Palace, as no tongue can express, so
was the riches they had usurped there as infinite.

Upon the top of this throne, sat a reverend Jesuit called father Petronia del
Silua, a Spaniard, the prefect of the Jesuits college, who presented the
person of God, and from whose mouthal things were questioned and determined.
And on his right hand sat father Mauesta the 2. Jesuit in y^ rule of house,
named father Layola del Cruche, of a beautiful presence correspondent to the
picture by the^ imagined, representing God the son.

And on the left, sat a beautiful fair Nun taken out of the Nunnery of
saint Clare, named Apolonia del Cruche, descended of the great and illustrious
house of the Boneuenty, and she represented the person of the Virgin Mary the
mother of Christ, whom they termed A mediatris and Queen of heaven. About all
them thronged Angels all in white, crowned: beneath their feet sat Prophets and
Apostles, and many figuring Martyrs, upon whose breasts were Crosses red like
blood, bearing a sword in one hand, and a key in the other, crowned likewise:
under which Emblems this was to be read, I fought, I fought, and gained,
meaning thereby, as (so the plaiers expounded it) they fought against sin, they
sought heaven, and gained a crown.

Where after much Music, and many Hymns of joy, where on the other side
there was howlings and much fire works: upon a sudden all was whist, and Time
entered, who being called upon by the Judge, was commanded to turn back the
rolls of his records, and show the present world what had bin past: which
being done, that act consisted of the destruction of Cities, the ruin of
kingdoms, and the downfall of Princes.

How Agathocles of a potter, who had wrought in clay, obtained to graspe a
Scepter.

Dionysius of a Tyrant became a Schoolmaister. How Cre^ida was fair: yet her
p^^i^^y and inconstancy, made her foul and lepro^s*

How Tamberlane but at first a shepherd, and keeper of all creatures the
simplest, did after compel kings to draw his Chariot: and Baiaz^t surnamed the
great, to feed in a Cage.

How Lays was a wh^ore, yet wise men and Philosophers did dote on her. The
moral of all, which was, time is uncertain, beauty is but a strumpet, who
being trusted will deiei^e yo^: strength but a Reed, who^ the least wi^d
shakes, and such men as think themselves most wise, prove oftentimes the most
fools.

This act ended, instead of* Music to prepare another, the Devils rored,
which being checked by the frown of the upper Iudgs, they all hung down their
heads, and were silent, who finding time to speak, demanded the canfe* of their
disturbance: at which Lucifer (as it seems being thi^^ in that black Synod)
and as it ^as his fate to ^a^ first, so from the rest he had the fortune to
speak first, and she wing his duty (although he was a devil) after
obeisance made, refur^ed th^s answer, that they came not in that power from
their low Empire by the call of his trumpets, to hear Time rehearse to them
things so longpast, as of Agathocles, Tamberlane, and Lays, for he was
certain, they were all, or the most part of them there present in his army,
but their apera^c^ was and desire now is, to have a conclusion of the world,
and their Empire made up, they would be no (...) to take those they could
find, knowing that in the sifting from the Cradle to the Crasie, both in Court
City and country, the greater share to be his. In brief, he esteemed his Empire
strong enough, and could be content now to have hell gates closed up, which
had stood open so many thousand years, and might never be shut, souls had
pressed so fast into them: Nay, he was persuaded, that should the world go upon
her hinges any longer, there would be no room left, creaturs of all sorts came
thronging so fast thither.

At which, the Judge with a speaking frown seemed to rebuke the devil that
would Tutor him* the maker of all, how to dispose of any, and that it fitted
not him whom he hated to ask that of him, which he had not pertooke to those
Martyrs and Angels whom he loved: namely, the revolution of the world, though
in his secret knowledge he had determined of that hour long since* As which
period sit, as if indeed hell had been brook loose, the devils made the
greatest roar they could, and down they sunk.

When the Judge above demanding for a Book, which he called the register of
men's actions, spoke thus to the assembly at his feet. You whom I love, and
sharers in my glory, whose own deserts brought you this happiness, and makes
me joy in it, within this book all treasons which the world and worldly men
have done against heaven, I have ingrost, and looking in it, find the volume
full and not ^ t^nth man that is just to us. I long ha^^ put my mercy in the
scale, in stead of wrath, as greening they should perish, these hands created,
so that through ^ope of youth and suffera^ce t^^age, their vice is gr^^^e to
custom, they have awaked our anger, and b^ our peaceful soul, we will no
longer see iniquity and suffer it, or honor them with life, blessings, and our
mercy, which so disho^^^ all, but in (...) we will receive our ser^^nts in to
(...) and curse the rebels down to hell, a lasting damnation. At which the four
Trampeters* as if they had heard their Eve, founded against ^^ An^^ls
di^cended* departing fou^^ se^er^^ (...) interi^, Time, who was Co^us ^^r y^
whole play expressed thus, that those four Angels were s^^t to, the four
Elements, to confine ^. of them, in the place of their Empery nam^ly* ^a^th,
dyre, and water, but to gi^^ ^he^ty to the fir^ ^s the most raging to tyra^nize
over the rest, which charge of his in that twinkling performed* Time stooping
to the world, entreated the spect^tors to conceive that the hour past, was as
ter^ible as the general Sessions, and that fire and Brims^one had rained from
heaven to confound mankind, that the time was now come so long since prophesi^d
of, when the earthly glory of Princes should determine, and the pride of the
beautifullest conclude, that men should secke for shelter in the deepes but
find none, that the wretched stung with the worm of their own consciences,
should desire mountains to fall, and hills to cover them, from the resistles
wrath of that great, glorious and upright judge, nor was it now with the world,
being en^^^^tred with flames, (the Ar^^y and armor of the almighty) like the
de^^^dging of a City, when men sought to save their possessions, for now they
seek to shun them.

The Usurer whose gold was his God, and in whom he puts hes trust, saw
that now it deceived him, his foundation was rotten, the winds rose, and his
buildinge fell, his riches melted before his face, being tried in this furnace,
lik^its against the reflection of the sun, and reminding by what corruption
he had purchased them, he began to curse the time that ever he saw the^. The
unconscionable wish now their scales had been euener, their Waits truer, and
their measure larger. They which had shut their gates against Beggars, begged
now themselves and were not heard, the flames were as deaf as the Sea to their
Words, and more raging then his proper nature, being more forceably incenst
with the power which Brimstone gave to him. In brief the end and effect of
Times Corus was, that death had ended his Soueragntie, and all living creatures
were now dissolved, who had their building and being, either in the earth,
air, or water, only now remained.

The seas was to deliver and yield up her dead whom she had swallowed and
devoured, even all those that had layen soaking, and had made their Toombes in
her watery bosom, from Noyahs Floude, or the Worlds first foundation, the
earth must open her womb, and give forth her children, al dust, who ever had
feeling by the fire of life, and by this light of heaven (reason) knew good
from ill, must with the same bodies, the same eyes, the same knowledge, appear
before this judgment seat, and every soul receive his sentence, according to
his own works.

Time having thus ended his Corus, though not forsaken the Stage, the four
Trumpeters sommoned again, to awake both the old and new dead from their
tedious sleep, where while the music soundes, and the rest prepare
themselves ready for entrance, I pray you sir let me entreat your patience and
sufferance for your further satisfaction, to give me leave to show the cause
why these Jesuits make this or the like play, ere I proceed further to the
distinguishing of it.

It is not unknown to any which know goodness, that these Papists which
falsely term themselves Catholics, are like the Samaritans, who worship God
and Idols both together, they profess obedience and practice sedition and
rebellion. For what public war, or domesticke tumult has been raised this
many years in any part of Christendom, wherein these Jesus tes have not borne
a princ^pall part^? they profess Chastity, and maintain vnc eannes, witness
their custom both in allowing and frequenting brothell houses, they teach
voluntar epoue^tie, and live themselves in costly palaces, yea advance their
Arms above the Arms of Princes, their ^ule and outward profession is to save
souls, but their practice to kill souls: they call themselves lights, but
make others live in perpetual darkness: they insinuate themselves into
Princes Courts, and they enter into their secrets, where being embraced, they
thrive like Iuie, which desists not till it has sucked the heart out of the
most noblest Oak, they are indeed what badnes can be and such a poison, which
every palate should have judgment to contemn: they are like the Frogs of Egypt,
which leapt into all Pharaohs Chambers, and Closets: they swarm every where
l^ke lice, and are as noisome, they stir up wars, and preach the slaughter of
true Christians, wheresoever they come.

These Wolves as I say, in shepherds clothing under the pretense which they
make, they come to feed the flock, satisfy their ravening purposes, and feed
upon it: for sir this their doctrine is: first that it is her^^^e, and he in
the state of damnation, unless he be a Friar, Monk, Jesuit, or some other
of their sectaries, to read the bible translated, either into French, Latin
or English without their permission, or to say any other prayers, then what are
taught and instructed by them, that it is sufficient for a man's salvation, to
believe that which the Romish church believes, to hear their masses, trentals,
d^rges, to creep to the cross, to pray to the holy virgin Marie, mother of
christ and Queen of heaven, to kneel to their whole pester of Saints, to
observe their fastings, penance, and pilgrimages, and to obey all their
ceremonies, superstitions and traditions, to repeat their several Auies, and
use their 7. several sacraments, when Christ our true school master taught
but two, and his Apostles as his most faithful Disciples followed no more, to
pray as they pray, to hear as they hear, though they never understand what
they hear, what they pray, or what they believe.

How the Pope is a sp^rituall Magistrate, and has a higher degree of
authority then temporal Mag^strates, that being installed in his sanctified
seat, he does presently represent the power and person of Jesus Christ, that
he has power to give plenarie indulgence to all men, to disp^nce with all
sins, and for money to pardon, for, without money he will not do it, the
murder of children, of men, of women, of wives of nearest kindred*
fornications, adulteries, incest, and all abominations, and with an insinit
rabble, as signs, miracles (al which indeed are lies and illusions) with which
they have long blinded the eyes of many princes, and so possessed the hearts and
belief of many kingdoms, that they cannot now be taught to credit, that there
is a mediation, remission, access to Jesus Christ, or salvation without them,
their properties and new fangled inventions, making his blessed self, and his
most holy word, who proclaimed to the most wretched sinner, Come unto me all ye
that are heavy laden, and I will refresh you. And as they have long corrupted
many others, so this famous and ancient city Lions, and with sundry like
shows as this their play of late, so dazzled the eyes of the multitude, that
they cannot see beyond the mist that these have cast before the^, their ears
are deaf, their eyes blind, their memories dull, and their hearts so
obstinate, that to conclude, that whatsoever is the invention of those
seditious impostures, is now grown to be the peoples belief.

Here withal sir is to be noted, which let me entreat you to take note of,
that all their preachings, plays, and representations, consist of these two
subjects: to make others infamous, and to honor themselves, to approve the Sea
of Rome, the sole rock and foundation over which as from his masters mouth
Peter had the charge giu^n him, and since him for this many hundred years the
Po^e and Bishops of Rome, are the lawful heirs and successors, and have been
careful fathers, feeders, fost^rers, and governors thereof, having (as they
say) like power, and like dominion, though their pride witnesses against them,
they neglect to exercise the like doctrine, that he whose faith and confidence
was built on them, whose obedience and reverence was paid to them, might
persist in what villainy soever he intended, if but intending to the
advancement of their church, and the furthering of their ambition (though it
stretch to the murdering of princes, whom God himself anointed) and the Pope
as heavens Vicegerent, had full authority to pardon them, to remit them from
purgatory after death, and crown them with the glories of eternal happiness.

Where on the contrary sir, those that are faithful Christians of them in
derision, called Lutherans, Hugonites, Caluinists, and Protestants, from the
word Protest, meaning they profess much and do nothing, though we serve our
maker with uprightness of heart, though we rob him not of his glor^e giving it
to men, though we seek as he himse^fe has appointed, for no other intercessor
betwixt our sins and the fathers judgment, but his only begotten son,
though as much as lies in the frailty of man's flesh to do, we obey his
commandments, honor our Princes, submit to Magistrates, hurt no man
willingly, love our neighbor as ourselves, yet in their decrees, and not for
obeying their institutions, we are the dregs of sin, the bubbles of
religion, but risen of late, and ere long to be confounded, we dwell under the
wrath of heaven, and we shall feel it, we drink of the impoysoned cup, and
we shall perish, Angels, Saints and Martyrs have no favor with us, we are no
better then infidels, with whom it is unlawful to hold league, and lawful
to break oath or promise, we are blotted from out the book of heaven, as we
are excommunicated out of their Church, that we shall never have the happiness
to come to their Purgatory, for there is no other local place ordained for us
then hell, we are not so fortunate as beasts, for they live, die, and then
their labors at an end, but our end is without end, perpetual destruction.

Thus Sir, as in Books of large volumes, they have published against us, as in
their Sermons they do preach of us, so in this their Play they present us,
where by this time if your Worship would be but pleased to think, the
Trumpeters had left sounding, that all the dead had assumed new life, and were
now coming before this Tribunal, I will show as evidently to your judgment,
as it was apparent to my fight, to what sentence and execution they give us
Christians, our Princes, Prelates, Governors, I, even unto the meanest: and
how they glorify themselves from the Cardinal to the Friar Capochen: may your
good Worship but please to think then, that in this minute you are seated in
Lions, at this time you heard the sound of excellent music, when presently,
as in a show, you beheld all the Popes and Bishops who had governed in the
papal chair, since the time they profess Peter to have preached there, and
the decay of the Romain Empire, vshered in with conuents of Friars, companies
of Jesuits colleges of Cardinals, indeed of their needful ministers of all
sorts, who in their passage sung Anthems, Te Deum, and other songs of gladness,
every Pope and Bishop had his name and title written on his forehead, as thus,
sir: Some but Christ's vicar, others who enlarged to that Servant of servants,
other King of Kings, and so of their whole style, even unto this Pope, which
now governs, who though all the rest were glad to carry themselves in on
their feet, he was borne in on four Kings shoulders, and as that neither
death nor earth, had had power to pull them from their pride, or robes
pontifical, so though their play was of the general Sessions, before which
shall be a change from all earthly glories, they came expressing the greatest
power and command wherein they lived: who when they were all entered upon the
Stage, though they were as proud as Popes are, yet they themselves with the
whole assembly made their obeisance to the upper judge, who rising with the
greatest majesty he could set, and being adorned gorgeosly to beget wonder in
the spectators or beholders spoke to this purpose, yt they were the fathers of
his church, the shepherds of his flock, to whom he had given does the keys
of heaven and earth, and full power to bind and loose men's transgressions, and
having found in his register, they had been faithful in their charge, and
careful in his service, as his beloved on his right hand, he had prepared them
a glorious seat, and happiness everlasting, which they entertaining with a
Hymn of thanksgiving, according as he directed them, in great state seated
themselves.

Thus having beheld the Popes and all their disciples brought in by the hand of
Angels, and placed on the right hand of the throne, may you be pleased sir,
but to turne^ your eyes on the left hand, and view the great Turks, even from
their father Mahomet, to him now that reigns, with Bazzes, Ianizaries, and
other instruments, administers of his infidelity, brought in by devils, and
seated on the left hand, as also Prester John, the Emperor of Persia, and all
Protestant Princes, namely the Kings, and late Queen of England, the king of
Denmark, all those Princes of Germany that hold faith with us, Grave Morris,
and the States of the low Countries: to conclude, they were figured all, that
lived contrary to them in opinion, though they believe in the same Christ
which they profess, yet they rank them in the number amongst infidels, where
on the contrary, the Emperor of Germani^e, the Kings of France, Spain, and
Portugal, all Dukes and Princes of what province soever, had either their
presence or character, and were placed at the Popes feet, over whom he seemed
to spread his hands and blessed them, and looking up toward him that plaide the
Judge above, seemed to present them as servants to his* church, and obeyers of
his will, whom he graciously seeming to accept, there was a Canton sung of the
Angels and Martyrs above, and knit up with Mass Priests, Friars, and the rest
beneath: then was from the Popes hand delivered unto him that represented the
son of God, a book wherein was ingrost all pardons, curses, and
excommunications either for or against Princes, or their people, which he
delivering to him that presented the father, he rose up, and bowing to him,
entreated him with a speech of intercession, to rat^fie that which his servants
the Popes in his name had executed: the purpose of al which was, that they not
obeying Rome as the head Church, their Religion as the means of their
salvation, they were now to be damned without redemption, which no sooner
asked, but seeming obtained, the Judge rose up to pronounce their sentence:
before which, here Sir you must note, that there was many passages made of
several actions, which had happened in several kingdoms, as of such Jesuits
that in stirring sedition, and for moving Rebellion had lost their li^es, here
their deeds was confirmed meritor^ous, and many of them placed in the rank
of Martyrs, what treason soever had been kindled by them if tending to the
dignity of their Church, both them and the traitors had the same benefit. Of
which particulars it would be somewhat long to write, being two days in action,
yet (in their due place) I shall presume to express some of them to you,
namely, no treason against her late Majesty, as of Pa^rie, Campion,
Sommerfield, Ballard, Babbington, and those fourteen Traitors of that faction,
the pretense of Lopus to poison (conspiring even with Iew^s for the^r own
benefit.) In brief, they were all shown, their d^edes approved, and the
traitors glorified. The Friar Domini^ion called James Clement, that killed
Henry the 3. king of France, was not here amongst the number of their praises,
forgotten, nay they descended so low even to justify the late treason
practiced against our Noble Sovereign, and his Progeny, to wit, the blowing
up of the Parliament house, a practice so horred, and an invention so bloody,
that any man that ever has heard but the name of God, being ass^red of his
judgments, and trembled at hell, would have bin astonished to attempt, making
it lawful against Gods word to allow of any murders how ever so heinous for
their own benefit.

Thus hoping sir, as in a Map, you conceive a town by the name of it, so you
will think you have seen all the treasons you have heard of, practiced by
I^suites against Christian Princes, here at Lions acted, that you have seen
the tyrannies of the late Philip king of Spain deceased, by his inquisition in
the Low Countri^s, the slaughtering of the Hollanders, nay his attempts
against us in An. 88. all presented either in dumb shows, or in action and
their endeavors commended: I will only give a touch unto you yt betwixt the
Popes and Cardinals, Luther, Calvin, Bez^, and all the r^st, whom they term
their sent of Heresy: the Cathol^ke Princes, and the Protestan^ Princes, there
was some argument held touching the dignity of their religion, but you must
observe who prevailed, namely the Romish side, and I pray you then think you
behold the Judge rising, to pronounce sentence against them, first to make his
speech mo^e terrible, fire was thrown out of his seat, noises was heard like
thunder, in the end, the effect of his speech was this, that for disobeying the
authority of the Pope his faithful servant and pastor of his flock, and the
relinquishing their way to salvation, which he as their guide should have led
them unto, they are now for ever to loose the joys of heaven: which to prepare
their further grief, their eyes beheld them in chief glory asce^d into, and
all of them, King, Queen, and subject, to be thrown presently into hell, to
lie on beds of fire which shall never quench, to be still dying, yet never
dead, for their pains must be everlasting: at which Lucifer and his whole synod
of fiends that were beneath, taking his word for a law, first took hold of the
Turks, Persians, and Prester John, and making signs of rejoicing, threw them
into their hell, so as the ages had succeeded they seize don Christian princes,
as namely of our English kings, Henry the eight, whom they named under Lucifer,
the first founder of Heretics.

Edward the sixth, a prince whose life and death was virtuous, and our late
Queen of famous memory, the peaceful gouernes of this kingdom, 44. years.
the establisher of Christ's church, the relieuer of France from the invasion of
Spain, and their assistance the catholic league, a comforter of the oppressed
Christians in Geneua, defendres of the Low Countries, and in deed a pardoner of
her enemies: yet these Jesuitical sectaries, here in this their play,
presented her, justified the Traitors, and treasons against her, eternized them
in her sight, condemned her by the voice of their whole Synod to their Hell,
and made the figure of her, whose charity was so great, never but to think
mercifully of them, they made a ridiculous object to their bald-pate Friars,
and a scoffing spectacle to the papisticall multitude: and as that our gracious
Queen, so the Kings of Denmark, the Princes of Germany, the States of the
low Countries, in brief all as aforesaid, were by these Jesuits decree thrown
down into their hell (and imbrast by devils beneath) while the other seemed to
rejoice above.

But see the judgment of the true God, that even in the height of their
reioysings, whilst these Jesuits made ascorne and contempt of the Christians,
whilst they made false thundrings, and false lightnings, while they directed to
the people that now were the Lutherans and Hugonites, burning in perpetual
torments, now were they shreeking and not heard, now were lamenting and not
regarded* and as they were, should all mankind be that forsook their religion,
and built not their saluations upon them: our true God as I say, good sir, who
rules the clouds with his beck, who though he winks yet sleeps not, seeing
this their presumption, and in his upright justice not longer suffering that
his name should be profaned* his seat usurped, his judgments abused, out of
his Quiver of wrath* and armor of fire, whom no mortal man can resist, drew
one arrow to strike them down, who so rebelliously rose up against him.

For here sir, I pray you take knowledge, at the time when this Jesuit gave
his sentence ite maledicti, and their fained devil began to sease on
Christians, the day was as clear and as hopeful as a husband man would desire
in harvest, when in a minut one dark cloud as the forerunner of his true
Masters will vshered by fire and attended by darkness making eue^, that which
was but now the height of the day as pitchy and fearful as the blackest
night, when presently the people having scarce time to think of amazement,
thunder forerun with lightning, being heavens ordinance shot off, and stroke
from his seat he that presumed to take his name upon him, the Jesuit assumed
to be his son, and she that presented so boldly, the Virgin Marie, and he
that would before his time, play Lucifer the Prince of Devils.

Here sir, may you behold (what I beheld) the judgments of God, against these
arrogating Judges, they that but a minute since would make use of their breath
(ordained to glorify their maker) to be a help to make words to condemn
others, and they that would make he given from heaven as a helpefull Officer
for man's necessities, to be a tormentor of them, are now with fire from heaven
in the same twinkling, (whilst their glory stood at the highest) struck down
from their seat, deprived of their breath, and deposed of all, at the pleasure
of the highest, to what place, far be it from me to judge, for by any
instructions, I could stay to receive, for the have I had to Franckforde, they
were carried away, and while my residence there, not heard of: but to give you
further notice of what I saw, I am bold to proceed, and to signify, as the
day was on a sudden darkened, so after the thunder had sp^ken the power of his
wrath, it was as suddenly clear, when my self as the rest of the spectators,
might behold the top of their Celledge, over the throne torn with the
thunder, their new erected Gods, and he that assumed the Devil not to be
seen, at which euety eye being driven into amazement, by flight sought to
preserve themselves, in which press for safety, seven more found danger
being there smothered to death, and all coming forth into the City, found
heaven to have powered down such abundance of rain, that the City seemed
half drowned, where many, what with laboring to convey out the water, took
surfeits with heat, and others by intemperance of cold, which so much water
bred, had ingedred in their bodies, such coughes and Agues, that by the second
rod of heaven, many have been sent to their graves. Thus much I can certify
you sir to be of credit and truth. And for the strangeness, thought it my
duty to command unto you, which as it is a wonderful judgment of God, to
abate the pride of these Romish Priests, and rabble of the seditious, who put
their confidence in the virgin Marie, their trust in Saints, and in the merits
of their own works (and indeed the overthrow of their idolatry) so should
it be as a preservative, sent both to ours and other Nations, to see that their
words are deceit, their religion poison, and so contemn both them and it:
where on the contrary, it is a comfort and a confirmation of us in our
Christian faith and profession, to believe in Jesus Christ, and in him only to
put our trust.

Sir if at the receipt of your next Letters, I shall find this abstract of their
play sent unto you in this discourse acceptaple, I shall not fail in my next
business in a larger manner to recommend unto you the whole substance thereof,
both in the acts and scenes, as they presented it, which from a Gentleman of
Lions, whom I have some interest in, and he the like in the Iesuitical
College, I am promised to receive, if either it may be a pleasure to me, or
desired of your worship, till when sir, not to trouble you with other
particular occurrents which happened by the inundation of those waters.

I will only give you to understand, that what through the alteration this
strange play* has bred in men's minds, and the diseases the cold has
engendered in their bodies, at what private meeting soever happened betwixt any
of their Church and ours, there is little conference had, but about this their
late play, and the judgments which God in his uprightness sent unto them, all
of our faith affirming that being expulst France for the murder intended by a
merchants son named Chastle a scholar of the Jesuits, and instigated thereunto
by a Jesuit named Giniarda Jesuit to the College of Clerimount in Parris, that
first it partly appeared by the lawfulnes of the cause for which they were
expulst, that it was as unlawful for them to return, but it was evident by
the Justice which God himself showed upon them (in that means wherein they
begun to build themselves a new foundation, and to outreach the pride which
heretofore they had grown unto (namely to arrogate to themselves his divine
power, and his supreme pre-eminence) they are members so dangerous, and their
doctrineso seditious, that they are unfit subjects to have hospitality in any
Christian common wealth, where on the contrary, both they and their disciples
also continuing obstinate (as that is a point of their doctrine, which they
fail not to ground men in) they do not with modesty seem to excuse them in
their heresies, but as presumptuoustie, as if this blow of heaven had not wakte
them, they both confirm them, and as consta^tly believe in them, which
difference in that part of France, causes men's minds much to be troubled,
doubting what the success will attain unto, some doubting it will grow to a
public tumult, the least looking for private quarrels, and the rather because
these conferences having been often, and in several places, bordering in and
about Lions, many of theirown church have since upon private confideration had,
both of the^ and their religion, declinde themselves from them, to the great
comfort both of us that are Merchants, and all Christians in France, whereby we
likewise consta^tly believe, that this is a certain presagement, that ere long
the glory of their Romish pride will conclude, and no doubt as it is a comfort
here in France, it will be no less to all loyal Englishmen with you, and this
sign which heaven sent to their overthrow, will be a book for Gentlemen and
subjects of all sorts, from the highest to the lowest to read their follies in,
and from henceforth not to be seduced to build their faiths upon their
opinions, to be forward in their dangerous enterprises to the overthrow of
their ancient houses, and most worthy families.

Thus Sir both now and after I shall hear from you, bestowing my time
carefully and industriously in your affairs, and omitting no occasions for the
recovery of those moneys before mentioned. I take my leave.

From Franckford, your Worships Factor, R. S.

FINIS.
