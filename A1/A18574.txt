Cheapsides Triumphs, and Chyrones Crosses Lamentation.
To the tune of the Building.


SEe the guilding
Of Cheapsides famous building
the glorious Cross,
Trimd up most fairly,
With gold most rarely,
refined from dross:
A pleasing prospect to all beholders,
that shall but view it,
and lately knew it
Defaced of beauty,
but now a sumptuous thing:
Whose praise and wonder
Fame abroad does ring.
Tricked most neatly
With cost completely
adorned most rare,
Who^e shining beauty,
Shows the Cities duty
and tender care:
To preserve their rich and sumptuous buildings,
in stately manner,
such cost upon her
they bestow with honor,
Such is the love they bear
which now is seen
By Cheapside glistering fair.
The Cross there placed,
Is now much graced,
that it may be known,
How well the City,
With care and pity,
respects her own:
Brave Citizens of worthy London,
such love they owe it,
and now they show it,
freely bestow it
Upon their City fair,
with Cheapside Cross
There Is none can make compare.
Search England over,
From hence to Dover,
and so about,
The like to Cheapside,
Fair Londons chief pride,
you will not find out:
Newly beautified most neat and fairly,
all may admire,
and still desire,
to gaze up higher,
To see the glorious state
of this rare building,
Raised up v^ry late.
O sight most blessed,
To see Cheapside dressed,
in stately manner:
May you persevere
In love for ever,
it is for your honor,
To see your Cross excel in shining
all Cross^s elsewhere,
to this comes not near,
now trimmed most rare:
And glorious to behold,
whose shining bravery
Glistereth all of gold.
This golden splendour
Makes all men wonder,
to see Cheapside:
In sumptuous manner
For Londons honor,
and (...) beside:
Put down f^ire Oxfordshires chief beauty
Abing^ons fair Cross
was never graced thus,
as is bright Cheaps Cross,
Now shining fair and bright,
whose excellent splendour
Gives the city light.
The second part,
To the same tune.
KInd fri^nds pray turn ye,
With grief now mourn ye,
to behold and see
An ancient building
Now downwards yielding,
ah woe is me:
The proverb here is verified truly,
old things are worth naught,
but that is a bad thought,
for to forget ought
Once esteemed dear,
But yet al^sse
Too ^rue appears.
In lamentation,
I make my supplication
to great and small,
That erst have viewed me,
And now perused me,
then judge withal,
That ancient things in these days are
more is the pity
that such a city,
so wise and witty,
Should not regard their fame,
censure ^right,
Then tell me where is the blame.
I long have stood h^re,
Mary bad and good year,
pining away,
Expecting ever,
But I fear never
to see the day
Wherein my state again shall be advanced,
and all things made good,
of stone or else wood,
where I have long stood,
Expecting ^uery day
I should be once again
Made neat and gay.
Thou were a dear one,
Old noble Chyron,
that placed me here,
My first supporter
Of stone and mortar,
was seated ^are:
But now you see my top is downward bending
my state is reeling,
none has a feel^ng
to my appealing,
That now in sad distress
to court and city
My sad woes do expr^sse.
Some honest Courtier
Be my Supporter,
I now entreat,
Some Lord or Barrone,
Pity old Chyrone,
ere it be t^o late,
For now my state you see is down declining
my ancient building,
is downward yielding,
In woeful manner
I wail my wretched state,
Oh pity soon, for fear it be too late,
In time I crave it,
And feign would have it,
for mercies sake,
Take thou some pity,
Fair London City,
my foundation make,
Aged Paul's and I may wail together
and pray to heaven
all may be eauen,
and gifts be given
By charitable men,
to beautify
Our buildings fair again.
FINIS.
