Cum privilegio Regali.

TO HIS LOVING SISTER IN CHRIST, ELIZABETH CAMPBEL of KINYEANCLEVGH.
Grace and peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ his Son, with
the assistance of Gods holy spirit, to the end and in the end: Amen.
FInding this little Treatise, (Sister, dearly beloved in Christ) of late
years amongst my other Papers, which I made about twenty years and one ago,
Immediately after the death of your godly Parents of good memory, with whom
I was most dearly acquainted in Christ, by reason of the troble I suffered in
those days for the good cause, wherein God made them chief comforters unto me
till death separated us. As I vewed it over, and read it before some godly
persons of late, they were most instant with me, that I would suffer it to
come to light, to the stirring up of the zeal of Gods people amongst us, which
now begins almost to be quenched in all estates none excepted. So that the
saying of the worthy servaunt of God John Knox, (among many other his
fore-speakings) proves true, that is; That as the Gospel entered among us, and
was received with feruencie and heat: so he feared it should decay, and lose
the former beauty* through coldness, and lothsomnesse, howbeit (as he said many
times) it should not utterly be overthrown in Scotland, til the coming of the
Lord Jesus to judgment, in spite of Satan and malice of al his slaves. Howbeit
indeed it is not to be denied, but that the prophecy of that worthy Martyr M.
George Wishart, shall prove as true, who prophccying of the victory of the
truth shortly to follow in Scotland: said, but allace, if after so great
light and liberty of the Gospel in Scotland, the people shall become
unthankful, then fearful and terrible shall the plagues be that after shall
follow.

But to the purpose, to their request a length I yielded, although long
unwilling, in respect of the baseness of the form of writing, which yet at
the time of the making thereof, I thought most familiar according to the old
manner of our Country, to move our people to follow the example of these godly
persons according to their callings and estate. And so being yet put in good
hope that it would profit, I was contented it should be after this manner
published, committing the issue to our good GOD, who works sometimes by base
means to some profit of the Church, according to his good pleasure. The saying
also of Gregory Nazianzene, writing of Basile the great after his death, did
(...) a little encourage me, it being by Gods providence in my hands when I
was about to write this: The sense whereof follows.

It is a thing of most dutiful affection, to commend the memory of holy
persons that are departed, especially of such, as have been of most (...),
whether it be by friends or strangers: I have directed it unto you, dear
Sister, by name, that ye may make your profit of it in particular, for
confirming you by the worthy example of your Parents, in these evil and
declining days, in that Godly course of Christianity, wherein it has
pleased GOD to make you succeed unto them, no less than to the worldly
heritage, proceeding rightly from them to you, after the death of their only
Son Nathaniel your Brother: though not without your cross, your masters
loving badge, given to you to bear, no doubt for your profit: The Lord
strengthen you to bear it to his glory and your comfort: And so I end with
this sentence of BASILE, Take heed to your self, that ye may take heed to God:

Farewell in Christ: From Edinburgh the 24. of May. 1595. Your assured Friend
in Christ, I. D.

A MEMORIAL OF THE LIFE OF TWO Worthy Christians.
SEn Poets in all times before,
Set all their care and endeuore*
Of worthy persons for to write,
When ever they saw the^ delight,
In wisdom Justice or manheid,
Or any other virtuous deid:
Yea though virtue it had not been,
Gif they like virtue had it seen,
The Poets of all former days,
Would never cease it for to prays:
As of those Camptons most strong,
The Troianes and the Greeks among:
Did Homer write and Seneca,
Virgil, Ovid and many ma:
Renowned Romans to rehearse,
Wants not their worthies put in verse:
So we find deeds of vassalage,
Set forth by Poets in all age,
Even of Gray-Steill, wha list to luke,
Their is set forth a meikle buke,
Yea for to make it did them good,
Of that rank Rouer Robene Hude:
Of Robene Hude and little Iohne,
With sik like Outlawes many one:
As Clim of the Clewgh and Cliddislie,
Because of their fine archerie:
Sen men I say then in those days,
Took so great labor for to praise:
Men for these vain and earthly things,
That small or no true comfort brings:
Yea often times hurtful are and ill,
To sick as they are granted till:
Why should we not with all our might,
Write in their days of so great light:
Of faithful godly men and wise,
Who for the truth durst interprise:
To hazard at the Lords command,
All that they had, both life and land:
As David's worthies had their prays,
Ours should have theirs als in our days:
Sik doughtie deeds of Uassalage,
Should be remembered in all age:
Not to give flesh the praise therefore,
Bot only to give God the glore:
Who so his servants does endue,
Unto his work with all virtue:
That both virtue may praised be,
And also our posterity,
May find before them put in write,
Wherein their fathers did delight:
Not in the dark deeds of the night,
But in the comely ways of light:
In honest godly life and clean,
And sa the difference between
Us that lives now in time of light,
Professing truly in Gods sight:
And them that lived in Papistrie,
In blindness and Idolatry:
Unto our offspring shall appeir,
Whereby the lesson they may leir:
To fly from vice and vanity,
And to embrace the verity.
Likewise they that lives in this age,
Persauing deeds of Uassalage:
Stowtnes in God and constancy,
For to be put in memory:
And never man to be ouerseene,
That frak in the good cause hes been:
Sic as hes spirits heroycall,
Will be more moved herewithall:
To be mair valiant stowt and wise,
In every godly interprise:
The lying locusts als of Rome,
That spread their lies through Christendom:
By their Chronicklers calumnies,
Whom they hyre to write hystories:
Of us and our Religion,
Shall be brought to confusion:
When they shall be made to confess,
The good lives of some who profess,
The truth of Christ, spite of their (...),
Heir as well as in other parts.
So shall not we our labors lose,
That writes our works to this purpose:
Our Gods Name to glorify,
And Neighbors for till edify.
Then to begin but process more,
We have had worthy men before:
Of all degries these fyftene years,
As the good Regent with his feeres:
John Knox that valyant Conqueror,
That stood in many stalward stour:
For Christ his Master and his word,
And many more I might record:
Some yet alive, some also past,
Earl Alexander, is not last,
Of Glencarne, but these I pass by,
Because their deeds are alreddy,
By sundry Poets put in write,
Quhilk now I need not to recite:
But forward to my purpose fare,
That is, to speak without in mare:
Of two best liue^^ that led life,
Good Robert Campbel and his wife,
Departed both now of the late,
To heavens bliss richt well I wate:
Sic two I know not where to find,
In all Scotland left them behind:
Of sa great faith and charity,
With mutual love and amity:
That I wat an mair heavenly life,
Was never between man and wife:
As all that kend them can declair,
Within the shiresdome of Air.
But to be plainer is no skait^^
Of surname they were Campbells both:
Of ancient blood of this Cuntrie,
They were both of Genealogy:
He of the shirefs house of Air,
Long noble famous and preclair:
Scho of a good and godly stok,
Came of the old house of Cesnok:
Quhais Lard of many years bygaine,
Professed Christ's Religion plain:
Yea eighty years sensyne and mare,
As I heard aged men declare:
And als a cunning Scottish Clark,
Called Alisius in a wark,
Written to JAMES the fifth our King,
Dois this man for his purpose bring:
Quha being to the scaffold led,
In Edinburgh to have thold dead,
For Christ's Euangell quhilk he red,
by James the fourth from death was fred:
Some says death was alswel prepared,
For Priest and Lady as the Lard:
This story I could not pass by,
Being so well worth memory:
Whereby most clearlie we may see,
How that the Papists lovely lie:
Who our Religion so often called,
A faith but of fifty year ald:
When even in Scotland we may see,
It hes been mair than thrice fifty:
As by the story ye may know,
Of Reshby burnt before Paul Craw,
The thousand year four hundredth five,
In Perth, while Husse was yet alive:
Sa of their noble Houses ald,
Their two descended as is tald:
They had good heritage in deed,
Whereto justly he did succeed:
For any Gentleman aneuch,
Whais chief style was the Kinyeancleugh:
Standing be-sowth Machline in Kyle,
About three quarters of a mile.
But to our purpose to proceed,
And speak of him who was the heed
Of her a while holding our tongue,
When that Religion was but young,
And durst not plainly show her face,
For tyranny in publict place:
Some Preachers did till him resort,
Where mutuallie they gat comfort:
The truth on their part was declard,
No temporal benefits he spard:
They lacked not good intreatment,
In daily food and nurishment:
Gif there was mare necessity,
They needed not to crave supply:
Ha privately in his lodgeing,
He had both prayers and preaching:
To tell his friends he na whit dred,
How they had lang been blindlins led:
By shaueling Papists, Monks and Friars,
And be the Paipe these many years:
When some Barrones near hand him by,
And Noble men he did epsy,
Of auld who had the truth professed,
To them he quickly him addressed:
And in exhorting was not slak,
That consultation they would tak,
How orderly they might suppress,
In their own bounds that Idol mess:
In place thereof syne preaching plant,
To quhilk some noble men did grant:
And so their case did humbly meene,
Often to the Counsel and the Queen,
That this their suit might be effected,
But seeing it merely neglected:
They did their minds freely disclose,
In counsel set for that purpose:
Of Queen and whole Nobility,
Protesting in humility,
They sought no alteration
Of State, but of Religion:
That Papistrie being suppressed,
Christ might be preached East and West:
And seeing they were Magistrates,
As well as other of the States:
They would not suffer God his glore,
In their bounds thralled any more:
Quhilk they did soon perform in deed
And made them to the work with speed:
And had some preaching publictlie,
Where people came may frequentlie:
Whiles among woods in banks and brais,
Whiles in Kirkyards beside their fais:
Their Novells through the Country ran,
Quhilk stirred up both wife and man:
So for to damn that deuillish Mess,
That Papists could them not suppress:
Then Queers and cloisters were pulled down,
In sundry parts of this Regioun:
But whether it was night or day*
Good Robert was not mist away:
When they pulled down the Friars of Air,
Speir at the Friars gif he was their:
The Lard of Carnale yet in Kyle,
Quha was not sleipand all this while:
And Robert were made Messengers,
Send from the rest to warn the Friars:
Out of those places to deludge,
Howbeit the Earls began to grudge:
Either with good will or with ill,
The keys they gave their two until:
After their gudes they had out taken,
So greater harm the Friars had nane:
Far unlike to their cruelty,
In their massacring houtcherie:
Resembling well their old Father,
Who ever was a murderer:
Authority was hard to bide,
Quhilk Papists had upon their side:
Or rather to speak properly,
Chief persons in authority.
Therefore no time was for to sleuth,
To them who did profess the truth:
Howbeit they wanted not that tide,
Chief Counselors upon their side:
And greatest Nobles not a few,
And of all other States anewe,
Who rightly in defense might stand,
Of Gods own cause they had in hand:
Professing aye obedience,
In civil things unto their Prence:
In contrare whereof nane can say,
That they did practice night or day:
In cause of reformation,
Quhilk serves for confutation:
Of all our enemies each one,
That blames us with seditione,
As by the word of God is plain:
But that we may return again:
Then Robert like a busy Bie,
Did ride the post in all Country:
Both North and Sowth, both East and West,
To all that the good cause professed:
Through Angus, Pyfe and Lawthiane,
Late iournies had he many ane:
By night he would pass forth of Kyle,
And slip in shortly in Argyle:
Syne to Stratherne and to all parts,
Where he knew godly zealous hearts*
Exhorting them for to be stout,
And of the matter have no doubt:
For although said he we be few,
Having our God we are anew:
So no expenses he did spare,
Nor trauells to ride late and air;
To get concurrance from all parts,
Which was obtaind with willing hearts:
So great this wark was first to band,
To plant Religion in this land:
And tantae molis was this gear,
Religion this way to vprear:
Though we with ease the kirnell eat,
The shel was not broken but sweat:
Thus many mirk midnight raid he,
And that all for the liberty,
Of Christis Kirk and the Gospel,
Sic careful trauells I you tell:
Deserves well good memory,
And to be put in Poetry:
In English, Latin, Dutch and Dence,
To stir us up with diligence:
When men now are become so cold,
That it is shame for to be told:
But to return unto our tale,
When the Cuntrie was moved hale,
To make to wark with spear and shield,
He was not hinmost on the field:
Out of the West had any gane,
He missed never to be ane,
With wisdom manheid and counsall,
He comfort their conventions all:
Yea no Convention less nor mair,
Of any weight but he was their:
Als when the Gentlemen of Kyle,
As they were frakkest all the while:
In their assemblies would choose out,
Some for to ride the post about,
If he had seen them once refuse,
By any manner of excuse,
He would soon say, truth is doubtless,
My Brother hes sic business:
I know at this time he can noght,
But there shall be nane other sought:
I will ride for him verelie,
The nixt time he shall ride for me:
This was not once but almost ay,
So never did their purpose stay,
For fault of posting late or air:
Bot yet or I pass further mair,
I man speak something of his Wife,
Quha never made barrat nor strife:
Nor this his doing did disdain,
Was never man heard her complain
As many wives in the Cuntrie,
I trow had luked angerlie,
On her gude-man who at all tide,
Was ay so reddy for to ride:
For so often ryding could not miss,
Bot to procure great expensis:
He might look as they tell the tail,
When he came hame for evil cooled kail:
Ze have so meikle gear to spend,
Ze trow never it will have end:
This will make you full bare there ben,
Lat see (says she) what other men,
So often ryding a field ye find,
Leaving their own labor behind:
This and far mare had often been told,
Be many wives, yea that we hold:
Not of the worst in all the Land,
I speak not of that balefull band:
That Satan hes sent heir away,
With the black fleet of Norroway:
Of whom ane with her Tigers tongue,
Had able met him with a rong:
And reaked him a rebegeastor,
Calling him many warlds weastor:
Bot latting their evil wives alane,
This good wife murmuring made nane,
Bot ay may gladly did consent,
To that wherewith he was content:
Rejoicing that he had sic heart,
For Christis Kirk to take that part:
Quhilk doubtless was ane vertewe rare,
But to return to him but mair,
From ryding he did seldom rest,
Whiles in the east whiles in the west
To draw the godly in ane band,
Impiety for to withstand:
Quhilk doubtless did the cause great good,
For when al-quhare men understood,
What was the brethrens mind and will,
And what purpose they made them till:
They interprised in all parts,
More boldly knowing others hearts:
This day I think we may perceive,
What missing of sic men we have:
When any danger dois appeir,
To warn the godly far and neir:
Our foes now here do us prevent,
Who ever are most diligent,
And slips no time, though we be slaw,
Themselves together for to draw:
God steir some up sen he is gane,
That cost nor travel spared nane:
There was no gathering East nor West,
Saint Iohnestone raid with all the rest:
Bot he was ever there for ane,
The wars so endit then and gane:
His counsale in the reformation,
Was well heard be the Congregation:
At the Assemblies Generale,
He was aye with his good counsale,
What shall I say sen we began,
I wate well a mair careful man
(...) sparing travels, pains nor cost,
Was not in all the Lords host:
Because then he was so sincere,
And fervent both in peace and wear:
His Name grew famous in all art,
The godly loved him with their heart:
There was few but heard well aneugh,
Of Robert of the Kinyeancleugh:
But the good Regent by the rest,
Of all men loved Robert best:
He saw in him sic feruencie,
Sic stowtnes with sincerity:
He might often gotten great reward,
But no sic thing he did regard:
He was void of all couatyce,
And was least subject to that vice:
And to the love of worldly wrake,
Of any man that ever spoke:
His conscience he would not grieve,
No worldly goods for to atchieue:
The half teinds of hale VCHILTRIE,
He did give over most willingly:
Quhilk his forbears had possessed,
For Sacrilege he did d^^est:
The minister he put therein,
God grant that as he did begin,
That all the rest that dois possess,
The teinds of Scotland more and less,
May wrangouslie, wald them restore
As good Robert hes gone before:
Bot no appearance we can see,
That they will do it willingly:
For all the summoning hes been,
By Gods Heralds these years fyftene,
Though I think they should fear to touch them,
Because that teinds did never rich them:
That hes meld with them to this day,
Yet no appearance is I say,
That ever they shall with them twin,
While God of heaven himself begin:
With force quhilk no man may withstand,
To pluck them clean out of their hand:
Quhilk shall be to their wrak and woe,
Because they would not let them go:
For no fore warning he could send,
When they had time and space to mend:
Though now this Sacrilege seem sweet,
Their offspring shall have cause to greet:
When God shall call them for the wrong,
Done to him and his Kirk so long:
Bot to return again but more,
Good Robert did those teinds restore:
Whereby may clearly we may see,
That na ways covetous was he:
Bot gentle kind and liberal,
To all that needed great and small:
And chiefly to the godly house,
He liberal was and harberous:
Ane number of the poor nightlie,
In Kinyeancleugh gat harberie:
Whom after supper he gart call,
To be examined in the hall:
Of Lords prayer and Belief,
And ten Commands for to be brief.
Gif that he found them ignorant,
Unto his place they durst not haunt:
Unto the time they learned all,
Also his seruands he did call:
And every Sabbath him before,
To give a reckoning there but more:
Of chief heads of Religion,
So they got great instruction:
Wherefore John Knox, that man of God,
Perceauing Robert to be od:
In cairfulnes and feruencie,
In soundnes and integrity:
And for to be of gifts may rare,
With him was may familiare:
For his Religion was not vain,
Nor na lip-labor I make plain:
Bot it was both in heart and deed,
Quhilk from ane true faith did proceed:
When good John Knox for tyranny,
At some times was compeld to fly:
Good Robert was ay be his side,
Both night and day to be his gyde:
In trouble and adversity,
They kept others company:
While at the last death did them twin,
Quhilk at John Knox did first begin:
From time Robert saw him depart,
He thrifted ever from his heart:
That he might follow haistelie,
Quhilk wish he did obtain shortly:
For he had not long days here,
After John Knox was brought on bear:
As afterward I shall make plain,
Bot while on earth he did remain:
His only diligence and cair,
Was to serve God both late and air:
Alswell in weere as time of peace.
His godly courage did not cease:
As might be known when he did weild,
His wepons at the Lang-side Field:
When our men breisted up the bank,
He was there in the foremost rank:
Bot yet or they began to yoke,
Immediately before the choke,
His sloghorne I cannot pass by,
Our men on his left hand began cry:
A Hume, a Hume, with voces shill,
Ane other voce upon the hill:
He heard crying a Dowglasse fast,
Then bursted Robert forth at last:
And cried with mighty voice abroad,
O our good God, O our good God:
Quhilk was mair fearful to his Fais,
Nor all the voces there that raise:
We see in flesh he nothing bostis,
His trust was in the Lord of Hosts:
He was persuaded certainly,
Or they began of victory:
As the escheat quhilk he obteind,
Before the field of a chief friend:
Wha was upon the contrare side,
With all that there with him would ride:
Whais name I need not till express,
Of his foreknowledge bure witness:
Where also we have to considder,
How that their two spoke not togidder.
Before that Field many a day,
And yet Good Robert did not stay:
Before hand to take his escheit,
And that all for his Friends proffeit:
Quhilk was a taken on his part,
Of a most kind and loving heart:
I trow few men would have done so,
But to our purpose let us go:
He stood then in that stalward stowre,
Where there were many dintis dowre:
So in that brunt may valyantly,
That day he did full dowghtely:
While victory was on our side,
And enemies no more might bide:
That day ane pleasant Field fand he,
As his Sur-name dois signify:
So evermore sen we began,
He hes been ane may constant man:
Not whites on this side, whiles on that,
As barnes use to flae the wyld-cat:
Quhilk shall make his name last for ay,
In honor unto Domisday:
Where as starters from side to side,
Who be the good cause did not bide:
Shall leave their names eternally,
In shame to their posterity:
Because Gods cause they did bot mock,
Ay turning with the Wedder-cock:
Where they that with the Lord endure,
Shall find his love constant and sure:
As it appears well enough,
In Robert of the Kinyeancleugh:
Whom God did honor every way,
In life and death and shall for ay.
Now beside this great carfulness,
In reformations good success:
I wait a mare peaceable man,
Was never sen the world began:
Among Neighbors for to make peace,
God granted him a singular grace:
So wisely he could matters dress,
With Judgment and sic uprightness:
That even Papists would not refuse.
This Ireneus for to choose:
In warldly caces, for they kend,
Ane jot from right he wald not bend:
For no man leuand friend nor fa,
I trow he left few marrowes ma:
The Nobills haill out through the west,
Both Protestants and all the rest:
His great wisdom did reverence,
Sa that in things of importance:
His counsel they did suit and crave,
In their affairs and it receive:
His labors he did not deny,
To pure nor rich that dwelt him by:
So to the West he made sic ^^eade,
That they may sare lament his dead:
I trow sic missing of a man,
Was not in Kyle sen it began:
As the lamenting every whare,
Out through that Cuntrie dois declare:
Bot chiefly pity is to hear,
His tennants pure with drery cheer:
And heavy hearts making their moan,
That their good Master now is gone:
Quha in no sort did them oppress,
Bot was their comfort in distress:
He tuke payment aye as they might,
And never preassed them to hight:
Nor over their heads to set their rowmes,
Nor make them pure with great gressowmes:
He never warned man to flit,
Except himself had wit of it:
Be unthrift, sluggishnes and slewth,
Or by contempt of God his truth:
With sic na ways he could agree,
That they should tennants to him be:
Most like unto good David's deed,
The hundredth one Psalm as we reed:
Yea he wald craib and much disdain,
Gif they had taken Gods name in vain:
Their tennants dowbtles were happy,
That sic a Master had as he:
They wanted not, he had yneugh,
At hame within the Kinyeancleugh:
It did him good to see them thrive,
Quhilk made ilk ane with other strive:
Quha should best service to him make,
And for to please him be may frake:
His wife also was of his mind,
Though many be not of her kind:
Bot on their Husbands daily harp,
That to their tennants they be sharp:
Thinking their state can na ways lest,
Except their pure-anes be oppressed:
So that they have not vntane up,
Or Beltane come to byte or sup:
Syne hes their Summer maill to by,
Wherefore they man sell sheep and Ky:
Quhilk dois undo in this Cuntrie,
The may part of our Yeamanrie:
And brings great hurt ye may be sure,
Als to sic masters of their pure:
Who be this sharp nipping are wrakked,
While they themselves are far worse stakked:
And hes les luk both but and ben,
Nor when there was good husbandmen:
That to the Lard good service made,
And bakkit him unto the rade:
With bread and beef unto the boys,
That now I wat not wha destroies:
But to return again but mare,
Good Roberts Tennants sighs full sare:
That their good Master they do want,
Quhilk they do not but cause I grant:
But whairto should I speak of tha,
He was a Friend to many ma:
Yea, and ma than I can declare,
As men can best mean their own sare:
For in all parts both North and Sowth,
They have Good Robert in their mouth:
The godly chiefly in all arts,
His death lamented from their hearts:
John Iohnstone writer well might say,
He mist a special Friend that day:
BARGANIE als may say the same,
And many ma whom I could name:
Bot how and where he did disceace,
I will declare now in this place:
As I have shawen you heirtofore,
Of his great trauells evermore:
For rich and pure, for friend and fa,
He endit even his life time sa:
For last his chief and kins-man deir,
The young SHIREF of Air but weir:
Whom Robert loved tenderly,
For the many good quality:
In that young plant he saw appear,
Of age not passing twenty year:
Sic as wisdom and lawlinesse,
Kindness of heart with trustiness:
Actiuitie and good courage,
As may be found in sic ane age:
Quhilk gifts I pray God may incres,
With Gods true fear and zealousnes:
Now this his chief and kinsman toe,
Having some bissines ado:
In Galloway, therein welefar,
With his good Father Lochinvar:
Desired Robert for to ride,
With him in company that tide:
That there his counsel he might use,
Good Robert wald him not refuse:
Bot rayd with him may willingly,
To do all friendly dewitie:
On Gude-Fryday, when Sun was set,
All in Dammellintone we met:
For this time God provided me,
In Roberts company to be:
Where I saw all things more and less,
That came to pass in this progress:
In earth he only at that hour,
In trouble was my comfortoure:
The cause at length of all this case,
I have shawen in an other place:
There were we welcome with the heart,
Unto that kind Lord of Cathkart:
With whom we lodged all that night,
The nixt day raid to Rusko right:
Where that most noble Lord foretald,
Dwelt for the time with his houshald:
Now all that day while there we raid,
Good Robert was as blyth and glaid:
As ever he had been before,
So when we were come there but more,
The Princely house that we saw there,
I am not able to declare:
It wald consume large time and space,
To tell the order of that place:
What comely service but and ben,
With the great number als of men:
That do assemble in that Hall,
At melted time as we it call:
Whereto should I ought of it say,
For it is like a young Abbay:
Abundance both of meat and drink,
To man and boy at burde and binke:
With ordour and civility,
That might serve in the in country:
Now Robert at time of Supper,
According to his grave manner:
Did talk of matters modestly,
Quhilk always were to edify:
Quhairto the Larde gave right good ear,
The rest with silence als did hear:
So supper done our prayers red,
We bound us shortly to our bed:
For Robert had ane use al-whare,
With God to be familiare:
Be publict prayer Even and Morn,
His house and family beforne:
And by that, when he was at hame,
Twice in the day he thought no shame:
To pass until his wood neerby,
Upon his God to call and cry:
With many sobbe and sigh for sin,
That momently he did fall in:
And for the great rebellion,
Of this unhappy Nation:
So plain unthankful in all places,
To our good God for his great graces:
Gif this good man sight every day,
Allace what shall we wretches say:
Quha twice perchance enters not in,
In half a year to sigh for sin:
Gif this gude-man wha tuke sic care,
To serve his God both late and are:
Found so great matter of mourning,
Within and out Morn and Evening:
What ugly filth and floods of sin,
Think we wretches is us within:
That takes no thought of right or wrang,
Bot ane day come ane other gang:
And lets hale months whiles pass by,
Our selves or we begin to try:
^o what hudge heaps grows sin trow we,
In us this time that we oversee:
I speak not of mere godless men,
That God and all goodness misken:
And thinks their only happiness,
In wicked life and filthiness:
Bot of our selves now I speak here,
Professing us Gods Children dear:
Alace, what cause have we to murne,
For sin. Bot now let us return:
On Easter even, to beds we past,
Where all that night he gat good rest:
Bot mare rest he gat little heir,
While his body was brought on beir:
For on Pasche day after he raise,
In time of putting on his clais:
He says, my head is somewhat sare,
Quhilk sore sank in mind but mare:
The prayers done, he says but lane,
I trow I man lie down agane:
Bot yet I will go forth and see,
Gif that my head will better be:
Sa passing forth could not remain,
Bot forced till come in again:
In naked bed laid him down their,
It was his dead ill, what should mare:
Bot two days past or any kend,
What seiknes this was God him send:
Thairafter we persaued plain,
That the hot feauers brought that pain:
All means (...) used him to cure,
With diligence ye may be sure:
That were thought meet to make him hale,
Bot mannis travel cannot avale:
Against the purpose of the Lord,
Bot this one thing I man record:
The Larde and Lady of that place,
Were wondrous careful in this case:
And visit him both frequentlie,
Commanding things abundantly:
Be their seruands to be brought there,
That needful were and necessere:
The young Shireff seeing the case,
How his dear kinsman in that place:
Wha for his cause was then come their,
Sa far from hame handled sa sare:
With heavy heart did sigh and moan,
That he was like to lose sic one:
Wha was sa loving kind and wise,
And needful in all interprise:
The Shireffs wife with heart full sare,
Him visited also late and are:
Though I speak nothing of my sell,
There had I the strongst battle:
(...) to that day on earth I fand,
^uhilk few folk there did understand:
(...) man there bot only he,
(...) we my state and adversity:
(...) is not needful here to shaw,
Bot God quha did my trouble know:
(...) never left me in distress,
That time left me not comfortless:
Bot after fighting days thrie,
At length granted sic victory,
That I was gladly weill content,
To God his will far to consent:
Whether it should be death or life,
That God would send him without strife:
For like Heathen we should not be,
That mournes but (...) as we see:
Sen we know we (...) again,
In Heaven for ever to remain:
Whereto gif I had not taken tent,
I had great matter to lament:
To me he was so comfortable,
It to express I am not able:
Alswell in comfort spiritual,
As in these comforts temporal:
And that all for the lufe he (...),
To me in Christ ye may be sure:
In time of this his sickness sare,
He made me read both late and are:
The whole Psalms twice over in prose,
That served most for his purpose:
Als in the time that there he lay,
The weighty words that he did say:
And godly sentences (...) hie,
Were worthy of all memory.
Gif that the shortness of our Ryme.
Had us permitted at this time:
Yet this may well be mentiond here,
He said to me, brother ^awe near:
I have been fighting here this hour,
And now am standing in the stoure.
With Satan that old enemy,
Obiecting this most earnestly:
Though I did godliness pretend,
Gods gloir yet did I not defend:
When I heard men blaspheme his name,
In Land and Burgh, a Field, at hame:
Keeping silence and wist not why,
This in my care now he dois cry:
Urgeing my great hypocrisy,
Bot I am sure of victory:
In this point as in many other,
Through my dear Christ, yet hereof brother:
I thought good warning you to give,
That while on earth here ye do live:
Ye take heed how (...) run your race,
Again ye come to this my case:
God grant heir of I make true use,
Where ever I hear sic abuse:
That faithful here I may be found,
Sen God se straightly hes me bound:
To do my Christian dewitte,
In staying so great blasphemy:
Quhilk so abounds far and neir,
That sorrowful it is to heir:
Alace gif Satan durst accuse,
This fervent man who ay did use:
All means sic swearers to amend,
The most of any man I kend:
How fearful will his (...) be,
(...) many one in this Cuntrie:
The fear of God wha dois profess,
Yea mair, quhilk I vg to express:
Some that should season with their salt,
Others ar guilty of this falt:
Wha can sit still and smoothly here,
Their company both banne and swear:
Which evil custom draws on also,
Themselves to swearing or they go:
Great cause sall sic have to lament,
Except in time they do repent:
His other speeches all are pend,
In prose as after shall be kend:
He craved one thing fervently,
That he might end this misery:
From time he saw some of the Kirk,
Not uprightly begin to wirk.
Bot Christ his cause for to betray,
This speech on dead bed when he lay:
He uttered often with heart full sare,
Craving dissoluing without mare:
Bot cheiflie sen the Assembly,
Halden the date of seventy thrie:
And saxt of March where many man,
In Edinburgh assembled than:
The double dealing he saw their,
Past never from his heart but mare:
Na seiknes could make him forget,
That last Assembly as it set:
Touching the quhilk what he spoke their,
Now is not needful to declare:
Gods just Judgments he did foresee,
Approaching fast to this Cuntrie:
When some said Sir, why do ye crave,
So earnestly this life to laue:
He said Brethren, saw ye I wisse,
The sight I see of heavenly bliss:
And contrarewise, gif ye did see,
A blink of that great misery:
That unto Scotland fast does hy,
Ye wald wish death as well as I:
So great is our ingratitude,
Persauing then (...) to conclude:
That he was to depart this life,
He sent hame quickly for his wife:
Quha but all tarying came their,
Fra she got word with heart full sare:
She raid that wilsome weary way,
Neir forty miles on Law Sunday:
Be she had been there days thrie,
He parted from this misery:
Till heavens bliss I am right sure,
His soul on Thursday next did sure:
So good John Knox he followed sone,
Within a year and half was gone:
Then did the Lard of Lochinvar,
With all the Cuntrie far and na^^
In ane litter his corpse bring down,
On Friday to Dammellintoune:
That night fyfteene nights he didly,
There blyth and glaid as he came by:
That night his body brought on beir,
An ha^stie change we may see heir:
In earth is na mair constancy,
Then wherefore pride-full should we be:
Or in these earthly things confyde,
As we were ever heir to bide:
Sen we see all of women borne,
Bot this day h^ir away to morn:
Bot ane kennis not another good,
On Saturday then to conclude:
The four and twenty of Aprile,
The Lairds and Gentil-men of Kyle:
Yea both of high and law degrie,
Met him therewith sic Assembly:
As was not seen in Kyle before,
This hundredth years and many more:
Many wette cheaks at that meeting,
There might be seen with sare sighing:
It wald have made anes heart full sare,
To see the meeting that was their:
Though they knew he was well but doubt,
Yet their affections bursted out:
And could not let them to lament,
For loss of sic an Instrument:
So they received the corpse that day,
From Lochinvar and Galloway:
And with all honor did it bring,
Unto the Kirkyard of Machling:
Where they did bury him but mare,
And sa I leave him lyand their:
And will speak something of his wife,
Wha shortly after left this life:
For as they were both joined in heart,
Sa death almost could not them part:
And as in life they did agrie,
So death could not keep them sundr^^
For in April the twenty tway,
He did depart in Galloway:
In June next she gave up the ghost,
About the midst of it almost:
In the hot fever she also,
Out of this misery did go:
In James Bannareins house of Air,
For short before she had past their:
Thinking to live most quietly,
Among that godly company:
For the hale race of all that house,
Of Kinyeancleugh are right zealous:
And of lang time hes sa been kend,
The Lord assist them to the end:
For Robert and this James of Air,
Sister and brother barnis ware:
And sa nane meeter she could find,
For to remain withal behind:
Bot God had ordaind what should mair,
That she should end her life in Air:
Fra her husband was brought on beir,
She had no pleasure longer heir:
Bot did desire most hartfullie,
At Gods pleasure with him to be:
Quhilk she obtained in short space,
And so was carried to that place:
In the Kirkyarde where he dois ly,
Of Machling and laid hard him by:
Lang may ye seek to find sic tway,
As God there now hes taken away:
For what man he was I have told,
Of singular graces manifold:
And as for her the truth to tell,
Among women she bure the bell:
During her days in her degrie,
In godliness and honesty:
Of Judgment rypest in Gods Law,
Of any woman that I know:
In Gods buke she was so verse it,
That scarce wald men trow to rehearse it:
Of so excellent memory,
And als of sic dexterity:
Gods word to use to her comfort,
And theirs who did to her resort:
That her to hear it was delight,
In Scriptures she was so perfyte:
Quhilk was not words and babbling vain,
Bot words with knawledge joined certain:
Quhilk in her life she did express,
By doing as she did prosesse:
All Gods true servants far and neir,
She did esteem as Friends most deir:
And never loved society,
With any godless company:
Both wise and provident was sho,
In household things she had ado:
Quhat should I say, this woman od,
Was his great comfort under God:
And doubtless was of God a blessing,
Of special gifts after his wishing:
So for to end as I began,
I wait sic ane woman and man:
Of so many good properties,
Of rare and heavenly qualities:
Is not in Scotland left behind,
Whais waytaking we be not blind:
Should make us clearlie understand,
That Gods just Judgments are at hand:
To punish the Rebellion,
Of this may stubborn nation:
Who to Gods will dois not attend,
For no punition he dois send:
For we may easily considder,
The waytaking of their together:
Of so excellent behaueours,
And that almost bot in their flowers:
For nane of them was past thoroughly,
The age of forty years and thrie:
Is not for naught what ever it be,
That is to follow hastily:
For why sic as the Lord God loves,
Before the plague he often remoues:
According as the Scripture says,
Quhilk shortened good Josias days:
With many others that are past,
And that great plagues approached fast:
Good Robert as we heard before,
Foresawe and plainly did deplore:
As all man grant as well as he,
That hes Judgment or eyes to see:
Therefore sen they are taken away,
For to fore warn us all I say:
That God is reddy for to come,
With plagues to punish all and some:
That dois delight in wickedness,
In reif, murder and filthiness:
And covatyce whereof they grow,
Quhilk this hale Cuntrie dois ouerflow:
And all the lang rebellion,
To God within this Nation:
Whose Judgments now we see appear,
And their forerunners drawing near:
Let us with all the speed we can,
Go hide us with the prudent man:
That seis the plague while it is far,
And hydes himself or it come nar:
By turning unto Christ our King,
And hyding us under his wing:
Wha in all tempest, wind and preace,
Is our refuge and hyding place:
As Isay in the thirty tway,
Of that his Prophecy dois say:
So we of safety shall be sure,
What ever plagues evil men endure:
On whom that great day but releif,
Shall suddenly come as a theif:
And turn in twinkling of ane eye,
Their Joy and mirth to misery:
And we shall pass for evermore,
To reign with Christ our King in glore:
Who saved us, and none but he,
Bearing our sins upon the tree:
To whom therefore ever be praise,
And to the Father eik always:
And to the holy Spirit most free,
One only God and persons three.
FINIS.
