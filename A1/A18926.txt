THEOLOGICAL AXIOMS OR CONCLVSIONS: PVBLIKLY CONTROVERTED, DISCVSSED, AND
CONCLVDED BY that poor English Congregation, in Amstelredam: To whom H.C. For
the present, ad-ministreth the Ghospel.

Together with an Examination of the said Conclusions, by HENOCH CLAPHAM.
Hereunto is added a little Tractate entitled. THE CARPENTER.

Dej est, non errare: Hominis errare: Sapientis vitare: Insip^entis,
perseuerare in errore. M D XCVII.

EPISTLE
To al such in the church of England as unfeignedly seek Jesus Christ in
incorruption, Grace and Peace be multiplied unto their Consciences, Amen.
MAny Spirits conceived in the Canicular days / hatched in the wayning of the
Moon / unreasonable men and as yet reprobate to the faith / gone ou^ from
among us / as being never truly of us / They abroad in England and elsewhere
/ (as Hollands Nightingals / I mean frogs) go croaking abroad / to the
diffamation of all such as profess Christ in syncerity.

In their Songue (that I call it not a Black santus) one / with M^^itheus and
the ^okits / sing an hy troble (Christ is only (in effect) God and his body
fantastical) Another helps Arius (he that voyded his guts at a Privy in
Constantinople) to sing as low a Basse: Christ is only a Creature: and because
they will have something by themselves: One says Christ was made the first day:
another says his beginning of days was from Mary and mere man. Between these
steppeth in Affricks Anababtisme / and his next neighbor Catabaptista / and
cozen German Polybaptista / they sing an hoarse Tenor to the former / but a
Contra-tenor among themselves: the orderly Mean none of them can keep: by
reason of which untunable harmony / many take occasion to scandalize me and my
brethren saying: lo these have had such a man their Teacher / with such a
people they walked: past question / Teacher and all of them are infected with /
these heresies. But past question / they are deceived / if so it please them to
give us leave (being old enough) to speak for our selves.

It is said of Eunomus / that one of his instruments strings breaking as he was
playinge / a Grasshopper suddenly skipped up to his Citherne and fell of
singinge in her kind (as willinge to supply the string lacking. It were to be
wished that when David's spiritual harp that spiritually syngeth in the ears
of the beloved) what time there is some breach by Schism or Apostacy / some one
of John Baptist his grasshoppers / would rather add tongue and hand to heal the
breach / then becawse of such untunable startback spirits to disgorge their
mawe upon the whole harp. This lesson of Charity / our Englische teachers at
Midleburgh had not learned / what time they writ their letters into Scotland /
to lessen their loves there to me and my brethren. They told the preachers
there I was a Brownist etc. Some preachers beleiuing yt: They insinuate it in
the pulpits. I wished thereupon a trial to be taken of my faith. A Convocation
was had. Clapham cold be convicted neither of heresy nor error. Mr. Go.
Bruice. thereupon reparired unto the right woe. Mr. Bows (our English
ambassador) and signified unto him / I had been unjustly charged. Thus my
contrymen at Midleburgh served me: and thus the lord served them. The lord give
unto them more love toward such who love christ (as suerly as they) though not
so rich and glorious as they. But Satan unable to subvert us / he labors to
overthwart us and gird us with virulent speeches. And so / all Satan's sectarie
spirits of (how contrary mynds soever) th^^ meet all in this period: vex the
faithful and root them out of the land of the living: They iumpe all in one
end: to work wickedness.

Whosoever therefore wills well to Jerusalem ruined and on heaps / let them
manifest the will in workinge well: or like the sluggard with his hands in the
bosom / let them stand by quiet / and not discourage / much less hinder /
those that are willinge to bear the burden of the day.

But if Sanballat, Tobiah and the residue of their mates will be wicked: we have
learned to beware of men / as also to do all our endeavor to further the lord
his work not doing it negligently.

What my brethren herein have briefly concluded / I have labored to make
plain by an homely examination. If there be any error herein (and we are
passinge suspicious of our Earth / it is so prone to bring forth weeds /
though without sowing or settinge) that / if it shall by the word of the lord
appear such / I hope (seeing we contend for nothing so much as the Lords will)
we shall quickly stoop. But if there be nothing but naked truth (whereof we
hope) then let not our symplycity / poverty / weakness etc. be any cawse of not
acceptinge the Lord his will to propine his golden treasure by earthen vessels:
And that oftentimes by such as the glorious world demes vilest.

I purposed next to my Bibles brief (which I also left in another land to be
published / in diverse things bettered and augmented though this xij. month I
hear not thereof) to have diuulged a work of some more worth yer now. By mine
elbowe it lies dead / because as yet some Mynt-oyle is lackinge for cawsing the
Printers press to slyp. Till the Lord give that passage / accept of this
Modicum for a little recreation. And if thou find thy self any thing helped
thereby / for the ways of holiness / give the glory unto God. So let it be.

Thine so far as thou art the Lords: Henoch Clapham.

XII THEOLOGICAL AXIOMS or Conclusions, together with their Examination.
Conclus. 1.
A visible Christian. He is to us a visible true Christian, who 1 beleiueth
that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is com in our nature, for the full
salvation thereof: and 2 upon that foundation builds in a new and holy
conuersatio, though with infirmity, so far as the Spirit of God (by the
ministry of the gospel) reuealeth thensforth unto him: and that, unto the
praise and glory of God.

Examination.
WHo is to us a visible true Christian / is a Question (in these days) not a
little turmoylinge the heads and hearts of many. Yea / the cross Conclusions
that mainy do thereupon infer / either gives (in effect to all / or takes
from all professinge and confessinge the name / JESUS / the title of True
Christian.

To avoid therefore the error of the right and left hand / and to sail
between these rocks of extremes (seeing our David's kingdom must remain as
fixed as the Son end Moon in the heavens materiaall) though somtijmes by
clouds end the schadowe of the Earth obscured to the ey of the Earths
inhabitants we (I. say) therefore have concluded that Person to us a visible
Christian / who 1. holds / and 2. builds to the praise of God / on the
corner stone Christ Jesus.

First the Person beleiuelh: what? That Jesus Christ the Son of God is com in
our nature for the full salvation thereof. First / he beleiuelh that God is:
Hebre. 11.6. secondly / that Jesus Christ is the Son of God: according tho the
Apostles their confession: Math. 16.16. Thirdly that he is already com: and 4.
in our nature. Gal. 4.4. Hebr. 2.16.17. fifthly / unto this end: namely / fully
to save us: Acto. 4.12. Heb. 7.25.

1. Atheistes / must believe that God is. ^for / how comes this world and
all the things therein to exist / and in their kinds to be conserved / if
there be not some Power (or God) eternal and incomprehensible / that gives
being hereto? The Atheist coming into a stately palace / senig no body there
/ is notwith standing forced to confess / that the Palace was made by some /
who was before it.

2. The Jews must believe / that Jesus is Christ. His blood remainge upon them
and their Children (Math. 27.25.) The expiration of Daniels prophetical 70.
weeks of years (that is / of 490. Years / from Cyrus edict for building
IErushalem / unto Messiahs ceasinge sacrifice) Dan. 9.24. etc. Isa. 44.28. end
2. Chro. 36.22.23.) and the full remouall of Iudahs Scepter (Genesis 49.10. Math
2.1.) May teach them / first / that Christ is com: secondly / that Jesus was
the Christ.

3. The Arrians and Samosatenistes must know that Christ is the Son of God /
namely / by eternal generation (and so without Mother: and beginning of days /
and If hais root / Hebr. 7.3. (Ioh. 1.1.2.)

This is / becawse the father and he is one in essence) Philip. 2.6. Hebr. 1.^.
Colos. 2.9.) and not only God by Office / as they wickedly teach.

4. The Anabaptists must believe that (as CHrist is God and one with the
father / so) He is com in our nature / and there fore also verily Man. If he
only had essence or nature with the father / then (God being a spirit: and a
spirit not having flesh and bone / he should not die and suffer Indeed / but
phantastically and in show: as was the Maniches fantasy. If he assumed some
other Nature then ours / then he and his Church should not be two in one Flesh
(as was the typical Adam and his wife: Genesis 2.25. Ephesians. 5, 31.32.) so /
neither God should be satisfied in our Nature / nor our Nature be justified /
sanctified / glorified. Nay / he was the first fruits in our Nature that rose
from under the power of Death (1. Cor. 15.20.) and by him (the First-fruites)
is the whole sumpe sanctified / that by faith is united unto him. If to be in
the form of God (Philip. 2.6.) be / to be One with God in Nature: Then what
lets (verse. 7.) that to be in the form of Man / should not (by like
proportion) be / to be One with man in Nature. Though it be a mystery: yet the
mystery herein is plain: namely / that he was the Son of god and the Son of
Man: verily God / verily Man: God verily his Father: woman verily his Mother:
passible (as Man) impassible / as God. In regard of which human nature: he is
thee seed of woman: Genesis 3.15. Gal. 4.4. And as the human nature was assumed
for the benefit of the faith full / he is called / Abraham's seed (Hebr. 2.16.
a root springing from Ishai: Isa. 11.1.

5. Romanistes (of what sect soever) must believe that this Jesus is our full
righteousness / and redemption: not leaving any thing in the work of salvation
imperfect that so we might add thereunto: least our flesh should rejoice in his
presence: 1. Cor. 1.29.30. Romans 4.2. Hebr. 7.25.

Secondly / the person so beleiuinge / builds upon this foundation of God /
in a new and holy Conversation / as God his spirit thensforth / by the
ministry of the gospel / shall teach unto him: and that unto the praise and
glory of God.

First he knows that there is a spirit of God / who speaks the will of God
by Man. This spirit must he know to be in essence one with the Father and the
Son. 1. Ioh. 5.6.7. Math. 28.19. and 2. Cor. 3.17. This article (it seems) some
Christians in the primative age / or beginning of Christian Churches / were much
ignorant of: or understood but confusedly: and this Definition concludes with
in it all such as have been accomted true visible Christians / though otherwise
laboring of many infirmities. Secondly / according to this Spirits ministry
thensforth he builds in a new and holy conversation (Iam. 2.18. Ephesians. 1.4.
Gal. 5.24.) And this holy buildinge is either in perfection (and that was in
Christ) or in imperfection: and that is in all his members: Romans 7.15.23.
Thirdly / he does is to the praise of God.

1. First / any Obedience (though voluntary and having a show of wisdom /
Colloss. 2.23.) is not true / or / holy Obedience: but only that which is
builded upon true faith in Christ (for this only is as Gold / silver end
precious stones: 1. Cor. 3.12. etc.) for that only is by the spirit of God
incommended to Man by the written word: 2. Tim. 3.15.16. Revel. 22.18.19. And
this ouerturneth all manner of Obedience (seem it never so glorious) as the
works of a transformed spirit / that is not grounded upon the faith of Christ
Jesus written / it being the inspired square of the spirit of God.

2. Secondly / he thensforth (namely / after the profession of true faith)
builds (though imperfectly) in a new conver^acon. He rons in Christ's rare /
though with many falls / but he still rises by the staff of repentaunc and
still sets on forwards: looking upon the Author / end finisher of our faith
set at the right hand of Majesty: Hebr. 12.1.2. Revel. 3 1.2.3.5. And this
ouerthwarteth first / such as return back to their former filth. (2. Pet.
2.20.21.22.) secondly / it convinces such as teach by word directly or by
necessary Consequent (in their Nouatian practice) that amie man or Church can
obey / or walk perfectly. To what end does our savior command so often
pardoning a brother (Math. 18.22.) or Paul will us to bear with the weak and
to support with meecknes such brethren as have fallen under some tentation (Romans
15.1. Gal. 6.1. etc.) if not because / the holiest may he ignorant in maine
things / as also fall often?

3. Thidly / in referring all to the praeise and glory of God / it stops
the mowth of every proud Pharisie (Luc. 18.9. etc.) who puffed up with
Nebuchadnetzar / do build end perform glorious worcks for the honor of their
own name: rawsing the trompet to sound forth their alms. Such already have
their reward: namely / a little praise of Man's mowth.

Conclus. 2.
Justification. As obedience growing from true faith in Christ, does justify
before man, who only can judge by that which is outward: so faith apprending
God in Christ, does ^mmediathly justify with God.

Examination.
Justification (that is / a being pronounced righteous / or / just) is of two
sorts: External / or Internal. Justification external (or outward) proceeds
from external Obedience / justifiable in the eyes of Creatures. And hereof S.
James speaks (2. Chapter 18.21.) Justification Internal / is a lively
apprehending of God by faith in Christ: And here of S. Paul speaks: Romans 4.5.
etc. 5.1. Such an inward faith / owtwardly workinge / rawseth Man to be able to
pronounce such a ones faith perfect / or / true / Iaco. 2.22. Paul's Doctrine
may lift up the despairing person: James his doctrine may knock down the
presumptuous spirit.

Though the present Act of our apprehendinge God a father by Christ: justify
with God: Yet / seeing God has placed / us amongst Men / as also he will be
glorified by us / in the sight of Men / he there fore has ordained us to bring
forth good works (Ioh. 15.8.16.) Neither let any of our Dead Fayth-linges
(that have time and opportunity to work well) let them not imagine their faith
true / that is barren / or brings forth rotten grapes. whosoever is
incorporated by the spirit of God (the finger of the father) into the Vine
Christ: they cannot but live by the sap of the same spirit / and so bring
forth the fruits of the Spirit. Till thou se such fruit / what assurance have
thou of such faith? specially seeing god has ordained faith to work / This
cawsed Frances Spiera ( ex Henr. Pantal.) to urge S. Peter's exhortation / 2.
Ep. 1. Chapter 5.6.7.8. with faith join virtue etc. Confessinge therewthall / that
the work assures us of the truth of faith. Who (because he had no testimony
of good works) died therefore wonderfully despairinge.

And as this may Rowse the idle spirit that thinks to go to heaven in hi^ old
deceivable Adam: so / in doing such holy works they must not thereby think /
that it is their ymmediate justification with God / but rather that is their
ymmedatie justification of faith / with men: unto whom we are enjoined to
testify the inward truth of faith / up an outward proportionable conversation.

The not discerninge of this Distinction / cauwseth some to teach / That so a
man bring forth external righteousness / (being of any religion speaking of
Christ) he is of us to be justified: but this in the 2. part of Conclus. 1. is
prevented. Others (as far on the other side) teach (at least by their
practice) that so a man hold the fondation of Christian faith / he needs not
so much to regard works. A third sort teaches / ymmediate justification with
god to be by faith and works.

1. The first Sect I call / Irreligionistes: for / while they tolerate all
religions / themselves are Irreligious.

2. The second Sect I call Diabolistes: becawse with the Deuell they know and
believe much good / but they will practice no good / further then brings in
worldly advantage.

3. The third sect / I call Mongrels or Confusionistes: for they mingle heaven
and earth / confoundinge where the holy ghost distinguishes: saying though
they would have Man partly justified by works / yet they abhor popish merit in
whole or in part, But alas poor sowles (were they not more confused then a
Papist) they would know / that whereby we are justified / thereby we merit. And
therefore (seeing we are justified by Christ) we well say / that we merit by
Christ.

Conclus. 3.
Natural man. In the Natural (or unregenerate) now naturally there is not any
fredom of will, for willinge, much less, of Power for doeinge any thing is
holy, for holynes-sake, or the glory of his creator.

Examination.
THe Soul of Man in his frist Creation / possessed not only with Mind will /
and Power / But also with a Mind / mynding rightly: with a Will / willinge
rightly: and Power (arisinge from them both) to do rightly / it may then be
said he had fredom of Mind and Will with ability to work well (for we speak
not of that hie incomprehensible Mind / will and Power communicated unto the
Creature: which the ignorant not discerninge they but troble the lords waters
with their Confused reasonings: speaking evil of the things they understand
not) but after Man (by Woman) had transgressed / lo / the former fredom and
power to Right / they are deprived of (consideringe / That abides and departs
with the Spirit of God in his peculiar work) but still in Man abode the bare
natural fredom and power (for they are natural and super-naturall) but by
Transgression they transgressed the bounds / and are through God his judgment
turned into the hy way of transgression.

This we se in Adam / who frist was willingly familiar with Jehovah / Gene. 2.
but afterward (having transgressed (neither was Jehovah / bound to uphold
him) he abhorred the very approach of the Lord: Genesis 3.8. Yea / afterward
they were so far from willing / approvinge or doing of Good / that they had
not in them a right thought or any will how to do or will good for them selves
or their seed / and therefore fall of shiftinge of and cloaking their
wickedness. God made Man righteous / but They have sough^ many inventions:
Eccles. 7.31.

Thus Natural Man (in his degenerate nature) now naturally dwells no good
thing Romans 7.18. the thoughts of his heart are only evil every day: Genes.
6.5. neither is it in the Natural Man to direct his steps: Iere. 10.23. and
therefore dead in trespasses and sins: Ephesians. 2.1. and in a word / stripped
naked of their former Rectitude Genes. 3.7. Cantie. 5.3. And therefore stands
need / not to put on a piece of the New Adam / but the whole new Adam / which
is created after God in Righteousness and true holiness: Ephesians. 4.24.

Look how much is given unto the Old Man / so much is taken from the New. All
the lusts (or affections of the former) are but deceivable: Ephesians. 4.22. And
from above is every Good and Perfect guifte: to look therefore for any good
thing below / James tells the brethren plainly / it is an Error: Iac.
1.16.17. Every such Fre-will man therefore is an Erratik: and if he peruersly
defend it / he is a Pelagiau Heretik.

Secondly / where as the Conclusion adds (For holynes-sake or the glory of
his Creator) it is / to put by the Unregenerate willing / and doying good and
holy things / neither regarding God his Glory / or the excellency of holiness:
but either it is for fear of hell-fyre / or for some worldly commodity: and
such was Balaam his will and Deed: Nomb. 22. etc. 23. etc. 24. chapters. And
this is but a slavish will and a slavish Deed^: plain servitude / no fredome.

Conclus. 4.
The Regenerate. The faculties of man regenerate are so far fre and enabled to
will and Do holy things, as is the measure of Sanctification administered. Yet
this always remembered, their will wills, approves, affects further
knowledge and practice of holiness, then yet is in their power.

Examination.
AS the old Adam (Apostate for him self and the seed of his Ioynes) introduced
Syn and death into our nature / captiuing the same unto Satan: So it is the
office of the new Adam (yea the end of his appearance in our Nature is) to
loose the works of the Deuel: 1. John. 3.8. This spiritual knot he vntyes by
his spirit / begininge there to rear up / where Satan begone to cast down.

Satan begone to darken the mind and understanding of ^euah: that do^ he
turns the will and all the affections after. For no sooner she conceived
wrongly of God / but presently / she affectioneth and then practices against
the Commandment. Now / our Serpent (but a serpent without sting / by his
virtue curing the stynged: Nomb. 21.9. John. 3.14.15.) he begins with our
Mind / illuminatinge it with supernatural light / and therewithal
sanctifyinge owr affections / for flying from Evil and doing of Good. Which
work of the Spirit is not ordinarily without thexternall instrument of the
word preached. And therefore Christ his ministres are called / Ministres of the
spirit. 2. Cor. 3.16.

The work thus wroughte / is called a New-man: a New creature: the Image of
God: the seed of God: in regard where of (for it is spoken respectively / not
/ symply) the faith full are said not to sin: 1. Ioh. 3.9. because / as the
Apostle exhorts / Syn (though it dwell) it reigns not in the bodies of such:
Romans 6.12. They henceforth being Denominated by the principal Agent in them:
namely / Spiritual / because the spirit of god reigns in his law: Romans 8.2.
over the law of the flesh: Romans 7.23.

I marvel therefore not a little / that Many (who seem to have the spirit of
God) are ignorant: yea / are afraeyde to say that the Regenerate Man has any
frewill unto things holy / for holiness sake. If the first Adam / captive us /
and the second do not fre us / what advauntage arises by the second? suerly
none. If thou say / to will good is from God: so say I / to will evil is from
the deuell: and thus in thy ignorant speech / there shall neither be good nor
evil in Man. But understand / that we speak of that essential will in our
nature / which (both in bad and good) is of god / or / god his Creature. This
faculty of the soul (called will) if it besaid to be fre unto evil / though
the deuel draw it: so I mean (as verily so / except the spirit of god be
weaker then the spirit of hell) the will of the regenerate is fre (according to
the strength of the Newbirth) unto Good. And for this cawse only / we are
taught / and find it true by experience / viz / That Christ his yoke / and
commandments are not greiuous / but light. Matthew. 11.30. 1. Ioh. 5.3.

Otherwise / the Spirit of hell / and the spirit of heaven should work upon Men
/ as upon logs or stones which as it is granted false in the first / so
(considereringe there is an opposition in the Spirits and their work: the one
to death / the other to life: the one to degeneration / the other to
regeneration) it must needs follow in the second. Need we have playners
Evidence then this The law of the spirit of life has freed me from the law of
syn and death: Romans 8.2. The Truth makes fre; and the son makes fre indeed.
Ioh. 8.32.36. And Paul speaks thus of experience: I am able to do all
things, through the help of Christ which strengthens me.

Secondly / where it is added: The will / will be more then the power: it is /
for that it fares with a poor soul freed out of Satan's claws / (as with a
poor prisoner escaped out of prison: who while he would ron / is (because of
some yrons / or iron frets) unable well te go / When he is not 2 foot from the
Iaples door / his Mind is a mile of. This Paul speaks to be in him self: To
will is present With me: but I find not means to perform that which is good:
That is / the means were nothing proportionable to the will. Romans 7.18. But as
the old man perishes / the New man increases: and blessed are they that so
honger and thirst / for they shall be filled. And no marvel / for the seed of
god (though but as a grain of mustersterde) is rooted in them / which must
grow till it be a big Cedar.

Conclus. 5.
Baptism by a false min. Baptism in his true form (though administered by a
false minister, and in a schismatical or Apostaticall church) it is not to be
repeated, or unto such a one again to be administered: yet neither is this
sufficient cawse, why anyone wittingly should repair unto such a minister or
church for Baptism.

Examination.
Saying the Minister observes a religious Baptizinge with water / and that /
into the name of the Father / of the Son and of the holy ghost / there is by
him performed what is essential in form / and therefore not to be repeated
without injury to the form. Besides / the unworthiness of Giver or Receiver
cannot annihilate the ordinance of God: and that we may se (1. Cor.
11.27.28.29.) where in the Church these that meddle with the supper unworthily
(that is / being unfit for the same) it yet remains God his sacrament /
though profaned. Even so this Baptism / though profaned: for imquitie has
no more (nap rather less) privilege within / then without the Churth.

As is Baptism / so was Circumcision / The seal of that righteousness that is
by faith / (Romans 4.11.) so that it should have been Given by the faithful and
to the faithful and their seed (as at the first institution / by Abraham unto
his household: Yet when any circumcised under the two tribes in Idolatrous
times: or under Israel the ten tribes / in the time of their Schism from Judah
/ and Apostacy from the service of God unto heathenich idolatry / such at the
time of their return unto the faith were not recircumcised. This is apparent
where diverse such repairing unto sacrifice and pas-ouer (unto which none might
be admitted who were not approved for circumcised) they were without scruple
admitted: 2. Chro. 15.9.10.11. and 30.11.18. both for sacrifice and Pas-ouer.

If any say / they could not be recircumcised / but these may be Anabaptised:
I answer / they were not to be recircumcised though they could / because so the
dignity of the ordinance should have depended on the worthiness of man. Secondly
/ in regard of ability they might have been cut again: because by natures
help the skyn might have been drawn / and this was not unknown unto the Jews
/ who under the tyranny of Antiochus Epimanes did vn-circumcise them selves
that so they might not be known for Iues / as appears in the registre of the
Machabees: 1. Macha. 1.16.

Thus / howsoever Baptism (as Circumcision his figure) be 'a sacrament
profaned / By and to the profane / and so a sacrament of vengeance and
judgment (as is the supper 1. Cor. 11.) yet / error repented of / it by the
power of faith is made holy: for the Sign or external ministry of man lies
as dead / until faith reviue it: whither in old or young / within or without
the true Church.

Neither is this a reason to embolden a man to fetch the sacrament so: no
more then it is lawful for a man of knowledge and holy profession / to go and
take to wijfe a Machumetiste or profane woman / because another man so marying
in ignorance and weakness / may still retain his wife / though now joined to
the church. If the Marriage be made / it must stand: if it were to make / he
should but tempt god so to match: os also (now saying her prophaine / he should
cawse others deem him prophaine. We are called Preistes (Revel. 1.6. etc. 1.
Pet. 2.5.) becawse according to the proportion of the law we should (as other
things / so) descerne between clean and vis clean in all our actions and
choises.

And if such Baptism heretofore reeeiued were utterly void / then all
Christians are and have been unbaptized these many himdred years: seeing /
either they have been baptized in false churches: or by false ministers: or by
such ministers who them selves (looking backward to the fountain) have had no
better Baptism. Where is there any Baptism that has not lyneallie been
diduced from the Corruption of Rome. The strength of our Baptism is in the
practice of the Apostles and primative church for the first hundred years: and
we cannot com back unto that age / but through the Corruptest age of Romes
Church.

If this Baptism then be wholly fallen / then we must be all unbaptized till
some other John Baptist / or Christ himself com down again to begin and lay
the foundation a new: Except it be lawful for every man to Baptize / and then
I se not why others before us / as well as now / did not well enough baptize.

These absurd errors / following upon the denial of the former conclusion /
have not been considered of many: for had they / many poor english sowles would
not so have hunted after new Baptismes. And if Baptisms administered in the
grossest popery / be notwith standing not to be repeated: how much less the
Baptism administered by the church / of England / where the foundation of
Christian faith is laid suerly?

If it now be replied: though Baptism have been administered in some tolerable
measure / yet it may (as the supper of the lord) be again administered / else /
why is the plural number (Baptismes / Heb. 6.2.) used? as also / why does Paul
(Act. 19.2.3.4.5.) Baptize some again / who be fore had been baptized by John /
or by Apollos?

1. I answer first to the word Baptismes or / washinges: the Learned have
affirmed (Beza in Heb. 6.2.) that it was the custom of primative churches to
refer baptism over unto the days of Easter and Pentecost / forwhich cawse
they were called the Days of Baptism / that is / of baptizinge Many
Catechumenistes: unto which practice Master Beza demeth this form of speech
had relation. That this Epistle to the Heb. should be so late written / for mine
own part I doubt / and therefore (though not easly be removed from such a
blessed man's judgment / yet) I cannot for the present urge it much.

2. Baptismes also may plurally be used / because Many were at one time
baptized / that being the time of the lords harvest / though not at the former
two times / as / Act. 2.41. etc. 10.47.48.

3. Thirdly / it was customarie with the western Churches to baptize with / 3.
dippings (as signifyinge the Trinity of persons / in the unity of one
essence) why may not Baptismata importe these immmersions in one baptism? 4.
Besides / if baptizing of feet (Ioh. 13.) were not a Civil / but an
Ecclesiastical ordinance (and who knows not that it was of ancient used?)
why may not Baptismes have relation to this and the other Baptism this being
called by some ancient the Consummation of the sacrament. Any of these 4.
senses are more probable then Anabaptisme / or / Rebaptization.

2. To the place in the Acts / I answer: such learned as deem Paul to baptize
those disciples / verse. 5. They expound this Baptism by ver. 6. not to be the
common Baptism with water / but the peculiar baptizing them with the holy
ghost: that is / a conferringe of extraordinary guif^es by layinge on of
hands. And of this mind is Mr. Calvin. Mr. Beza and others more attent to the
Original (or / Greek text) joining the 5. ver. unto ver. 4. they observe the
greek particle (de) to answer unto the particle (men) goinge in the former
clawse. Paul's speech (according to thenglish vers-section) lies in ver.
2.3.4.5. His Action / verse. 6. That therefore verse. 5. Paul relates to ha^t been
John's action: viz / That John baptized his disciples in the name of the Lord
Jesus / after he had taught his hearers to believe in Christ. Far enough
therefore is this place from Anabaptizinge / or Polybaptisme.

Conclus. 6.
Imposition in some corrupt manner. Imposition of hands to the ministry of the
word and sacraments, administered by an Ecclesiastical Ouer-seer or ouer-seers
by the appointment of that church whereunto He or They so ouer-se (it holdinge
the foundation of justifyinge faith) the hands so imposed being to a man
tollerablie qualified for the work of the ministry, (though otherwise, the
Imposer, Imposed and Church be notably corrupt in many things) such
imposition is not (upon any occasion afterward) to be repeated, or again don.

Examination.
THe equity of the 5. Conclusion / is unto this an invincible Ramper^. If
there be (as but One god / howsoever corruptly worshipped by Many / so) but
one baptism (Ephesians. 4.5.) though the same baptism be by many corruptly Given
and Taken: what should let / that layinge on of hands may not by like
proportion of justice / pass on (without interruption) the ordenance of god
vnreiterate / though otherwise corruptly Given and Taken* Specially / if
Baptism stand good (though administered in the grossest idol church and that
unto vnbeleiuers and their seed) what should let that Imposition by and to such
(as hold the main grounds of iustifyinge faith) it should not much more
remain effectual?

If they iumpe over the orderly Calling or Election / unto this Imposition: so
/ much more iumpe they over many Orderly Trialls and approbations / for
pitchinge upon Baptism. If the former more rude ouerships yet frustrate not
baptism: much less can this ouer-leape / annihil imposition.

But some will say / that hands may be of^ner imposed / as the Lord his Supper
ofter administered. This is easily propounded / but how will it be proved? Nay /
is there not far more seminge reasons why the former Baptism might be
repeated? Show me so much as one seminge argument drawn from Doctrine or
Example in the whole book of good. Sic volo, sic iubeo, or / autos ephe, will
not be sufficient ground for my conscience.

Now steppeth in one / with an imagination of a deep difference betwixt
Baptism and Layng, on of hands: for (says he) Laymen / or / the Common
people may (in a Churches begininge and first razing) lay on hands (as Nomb.
8.10.) so may they not Baptize.

1. First (for argument salt) let it be understood so / in Nomb. 8.10. Yet it
follows not / That watsoeuer was lawful to be don then of the common people
/ that also is still lawful. If they put out the universal (All) or /
whatsoever / and say / Somthynge that the Common people then did may now be
don: This I grant. But / that sacramental imposition is one of these
Somthinges / how will that be proved? Nay / mark the contrary. In the
Begininge of the New testaments church / people had no such liberty: and this
appears / in that Christ and the Apostles from Christ / and the Evangelists
from the Apostles did still set forward this Ordinance. If Moses were same in
this point: It follows not / that Christ is so unto his Tabernacle. Common
people might Circumcise / may they therefore now baptize? answer that: and then
I shall have somthinge more herein to say / and yet make nothing for
recapitulating Imposition.

2. But what if the place of Nombers teach not that? Mr. Calvin. and others
understand there a Part for the Whole: and comparinge it with a practice of
church which rather required the act of the vulgar sort / Nehem. 10.29. it
seems most like that by people / he means the princes of the people / as
Neh. 9.38. In diverse actions that appertained to the whole people / only the
heads of the Tribes / or the chief of the families were elected. In this place
/ common sense will tell us / that so many thowsands of people cold not
conveniently lay on hands.

3. Thirdly / whither people or the chief of the people did solemnize this
action / they had the Lord his ymmediate command for their warrant / and what
makes that for the other?

Except therefore such Imposition remain Good / we must (as for Baptism) a
wait some other callings from heaven / that may rear up this ordinance anewe:
or the Prophetical (or Evangelical) ministry stirred up here and there must
(as did the Apostles) incommend this ordinance unto others: which if: yet it
camnot make all the former of none effect: considering some true prophets have
had the conuoyance of the former.

Conclus. 7.
Infants bapt. Infants under the tuition of the faith full, are all within the
covenant, and capable of Baptism.

Examination.
THat al infants (under the tuition of the faith full) are all within the
Covenant / appears in Iehouahs pronunciate to Abraham / I am thy god and the
god of thy seed. But no body douts that the faithful) their infants vndes the
law were within the Covenant: but how is it apparant^ that their seed under
the Gospel / is within the Covenant?

1. Thus: If the law (who was but a whipping schoolmaster unto Christ)
accepted of Infants / then muth more the gospel.

2. Or thus: whom God once in truth accepts / them he never in truth reiects.
These two arguments can by scripture never be gaynsayde.

But to speak playner: the former promise and covenant to and with Abraham and
his seed is indeed gospel and the strength of the Gospel: Galat. 3.8.
from whence I thus reason.

3. Whom the gospel does accept / the gospel does not reject (except they
will have two Christ's / and two ghospells: but cursed is he that so says: Gal.
1.6.7.8.) And the Gospel accepts / as before / etc.

But the Catabaptist will not stick to grant Children of the kingdom and
within the Covenant still: Yea / the Anabaptisticall sort of them / that all
children in the world (by virtue of the second Adam) are within the Covenant:
but then they deny the seal of Baptism unto them all / until they have
Actual faith.

Only here concerning the infants of and under the custody of the faithful:
the former sorts of arguments that prove them to be within the Covenant / ^o
also prove that they are in infancy capable of the seal / thus:

1. If the law sealed infants to mercy / then much more the gospel.

2. If God once accepted of infants to the seal of mercy / then etc.

3. If the Gospel once sealed infants / it ever seals such infants? except
the gospel (and christ the foundation of the gospel) be yea and nay: But
this is false: 2. Corrinth. 1.20.

Obj. Not being able to give direct answer to these arguments / they thus
wrangle: Some may bewithin the Covenant and yet unsealed: for femals under the
law were within the Covenant / yet vnseald.

Ans. To omit this / that femals were then sealed in the Male / until a virgin
femall had brought forth a Male / for recovering that which Heuah lost (for who
knoes not that she was of Adams bone / and was also called Adam) to pass by
that / what ryme or reason is there in this argument: Some infants have been
within the covenant and vnseald: therefore all infants within the covenant are
to be vnseald.

In Cambridge / this would be called Tom Skuls argument. Some have / therefore all
are. From Some to Some / may be some conseqution: or from All to some. If because
some then within the covenant were unsealed: now some within the Covenant are to
be unsealed / then we pray them / le^ the seed of vnbeleiuers (whom they say
are within the covenant) be those Some that are to be unsealed.

Obj. For want of matter they give us more words / and say: Circumcision was a
sacrament of works / but Baptism a sacrament of Faith.

Ans. Like lips / like lettuce: for our savior says that Circumcision was not
of Moses / but of the fathers (Ioh. 7.22.) and blessed Paul says that
Circumcision sealed faith: Romans 4.11. and in the 13. verse. that it sealed that
promise that was not by the Law (that is / by the works of the law) but by
faith. And the time of the guifte thereof (vz / after he believed / not after he
wrought) makes the case playner.

Obj. Ey (says the blind Catabaptiste) after Faith they should be sealed /
because Baptism seals faith.

Ans. So Paul has taught that Circumcision only sealed Faith / yet I trow it
also sealed Infants of the faithful that yet professed no faith but in and by
the Parent: And therefore Abraham's children had faith Actual in the Parent (of
whose loins they were until they Apostated by rebellion) and faith imputed
unto them.

Having no reason they first ask / why the first day is not still kept?
Secondly / what one president we have in the new testament of an infant
baptized?

First / for the day I answer: That external ceremony is put away together
with thexternall sign Circumcision. The day and the sign came in together /
no marvel then if they depart together. Secondly / no man demeth it symply
unlawful to baptize the 8. day. Thirdly / if that 8. day was partly a figure
of the day. (after the 7.) wherein our Christ rose for our justification (which
is in a sense the 8. day. Ioh. 20.26.) and so therewithal of our lords day /
it may then teach / that the lords church (provided they be not in the
vnconstituted wilderness) it is (that being the special day of Convocation) to
be observed for Baptism.

For the other question / I will first answer with another question: Is nothing
warrantable whereof there is not direct and express warrant in the new
Testament? Indeed such teachers flatly reject the old testament. May a man
marry with his sister? No. How proves thou that by the new testament? The 1.
Cor. 5.1. is of a mother / and I talk of a sister. It may be / that that
Incestuous person was one of these madding spirits that thought nothing of the
old might stand with the New / without express warrant in the new. Secondly
/ it is said the whole household was baptized / Act. 16.15. et 33. as it is
said that all Abraham's household was circumcised / Genesis 17.23.27. (the one ey
looking to the other / for likeness of speech and action) shall we think that
there was no infant / nor any one but could profess true faith? It is absurd.
Nay the Apostle tells the Iaylor plainly / that if himself believe / his
whole household (that is / such as were under his tuition) were within the
compass of salvation. He does not say. If thou and all thine household believe:
but / If thou believe. And indeed so it was with Abraham / he beleiuinge (the
lord looked not if his household believed) together with him / his whole
household was sealed.

1. Let the Catabaptists know therefore / that with Herod's servants (Math. 2.)
they but butcher infants: denyinge that comfort now unto the faithful parents
/ which at first was given unto the father of the faithful.

2. Nay let them know that Christ his coming deprived none of former comfort
/ but indeed added unto the same. The bloody cutting / he has converted into
an easy washinge. The female that before (after a sort) stood of / he has now
received in: and therefore now no difference betwixt Male and female / for we
are one in Christ: and if Christ's / then Abraham's seed and heirs by promise:
Gallat. 3.28.29. and if hepres by promise / then to have the seal of the
promife / as before is proned.

Conclus. 8.
Sacraments. Ceremonial, or, sacramental Seals ordinary, incommended by
Christ unto the church of the new testament, are Baptism, the Lord his Supper,
Layinge on of hands.

Examination.
A Sacrament / or Ceremonial seal / according to Definitions later or Elder
/ with one harmony of consent / is / A Ceremony instituted by the lord,
bringing with it to the faithful receiver some celestial or spiritual
blessinge signified thereby. And therefore it is commonly said that a sacrament
consists of a Sign and a Signified thing. But because every Sign
signifyinge somthinge is not an holy signifier / therefore only the Author of
holiness / is Author of these sacraments that promise spiritual giuinge.

The first two / Baptism and the Supper is now a days commonly (as only)
received sacraments: therefore I need not to examine them. Only now thus much.

1. The Sacramentaries / who make them naked representative signs:

2. The Transubstantiatours / that thinck the Real signs to be turned into
the things signified.

3. The Consubstantiatours / that think the thing signified to be really there
present together with the signs:

4. The Polybaptiste, that would have Baptism administered 1. in Infancy: 2. in
Adolyscency: 3. after the committinge of every great sin? all these we
explode for fanaticall.

Touching Imposition (or / layinge on of hands) I have long wondered why men
durst not plainly teach it a Sacrament. It seems / because either men have
begone ministry of word and sacraments without it / what time they have
departed from Romes Church? or else esteming their whole Ordinacon there had
for an Idol and a thing of nothing? they therefore have (not knowing how to com
unto better) been contented to let it pass away on a sound / not saying so
much as / God save it.

Yet / because no iniquity of times shall utterly eat out the lords truth (for
then / contrary to Christ his promise / Hell gates should prevail) Therefore / as
the Church of Rome has kept the footinge of this (though with apish
spatterings and shavings) so Mr. Calvin in his Institution / Mr. Cartwright
against Doctor whitgiste / Mr Dudl. Fenner in his Method of Theology / and
others / they have not only taught the sign or external Ceremony / but also
the thing signified: first / The minister thereby was assured (being faithful)
to have the Lords hand with him: 2. The people they thereby are to learn
subjection unto the Lords ministry / with expectation of blessing^ thereby.

If our Prescisians of all sorts / dare not (because the Papists hold it)
pronounce it a sacrament / lo / their betters have taught it to be a Divine
Sign of a thing signified / and what call they that? If they say / it is a
sacrament indeed / but of another kind / they then say nothing: for they teach
not in their halpenie Catechismes / how many kinds / but how many Sacraments.
Yea / every where / they beat upon two / only two / because indeed they will
be examiners of them two: but not a word of layinge on of hands (though the
holy ghost teach it to be one of the beginings of Christ's foundation: Hebr.
6.1.2.) For if they thaught it effectually (as the two former) then it may be
some of the people would examine them / namely / if so hands have been laid on
them / with how / where / when? Then it may be / some of their sheep would bid
the sheopherd stand back from the supper (as well as he bids them) until he had
publikly by repentance put away his error. I would our other people would once
(while it is called to Day) look unto such Elders and Deacons / as never had
sacramental hands upon them.

But to cease harping on such an unpleasant stringe / we first understand that
there be three sacraments: and of these three / the first two are Common to the
whole Church: the third is peculiar unto Some. The profane administration of
Baptism and the Supper / it falls out through the neglect of the Third. For
if (as Paul admonishes 1. Tim. 5.22. Hands were laid suddenly on no man / Then
the lords people should not be so combred with Dunces and Pot-companyons.

That we speak of Seals ordinary / It is because we otherwise know that
Oyle-vnction (Ia. 5.14.) It is a sacrament incommended to Christ's church / but
extraordinary / for it was not to the whole church: as also / it contained a
miracle / namely / of giving soundnes to the sick body: verse. 15. and Mark.
6.13.

Till therefore the Romanistes do join the Miracle to their coniured ointment /
we can neither take them for such Elders / nor their work wrought any
sacrament / more then the Apothecaries vncting of stonned joints with
Nerue-oyle: nay / not so good as that / for I thereby have quickly seen a
chainge / from sore to sound? but most commonly after their unction / the
weakst holdinge the candle (it may be with the help of another hand) he tolles
out his passing-peale. If such had com unto Job / (Chapter 13.4.) He would have said
/ ye are all physicians of no value.

Conclus. 9.
Majestracie. A Majestrate becomminge a member of Christ's church, he may yet
bear the sword.

Examination.
THat the Maiestrate may become a member of Christ his Church / Anabaptist /
Catabaptist and all grant: but that he may bear the sword after he profess
the faith of Christ / that they deny: yea / many of them / that he may retain
no Ciuel office.

For Civil office / let them remember / that Eras^us (Romans 16.23.) Cornelius
(Acto. 10.) Sergius Paulus (Act. 13.) as also it is altogether vnlickly / that
the Saints in Cesars house hold (Philip. 4.22.) should carry no Civil office /
he being the great Monarch of the earth. But if it may appear that a
Christian by profession / he may lawfully bear the sword / then there is no
question to be made of the other: though the former presidents have put it out
of all question.

1. Tell the^e Men that John Baptist (Luke 3.14.) wills not the soldiers to
lay aside their sword / they answer: as yet the Law endured and the law
permitted that. But they must know this place sits nearer their sholders
then they are aware: first let them knoe that the Law endured unto John (Luke
16.16.) but then the kingdom of heaven (or new testaments church) begone to be
builded. Badly had John builded if he had not gathered unto Christ and his new
Church. Nay he prepared the way and hewed smooth the cragged things / and from
the beginning of his preaching they entered into this kingdom by vyolence. In
making John herein a legal and not an Evangelical preacher / they iniure his
ministry.

2. Tell these men that Isaiah prophecyinge of the glory of the new testaments
church (chapter 49.23.) he says that Kings and Queen's should be nource fathers and
mothers unto it: they answer: True: the Church being within their Dominions (as
we are now within this kingdom of hy and lowe-Germanie) they shall be compelled
by the lord to permit us an foster us. But herto I reply: if this be that
Glory he foresees in the spirit / then suerlie he foresees no new thing (for
Nebuchadnetsar, Euilmerodach, Cyrus, Darius, Ahashuerosh, etc. they brought
this benefit unto old mother Zion / yet stood aloof sor ioyninge in religion)
But Isaiah here foresees some new thing / and therefore ver. 22. he cries Behold
(as the Angel speaking of a new thing (Luke 1.31. etc 2.10) cries / Behold:
and as himselfs in the like occasion. Chapter 7.14. Behold a virgin shall conceive:
This Evangelical prophecy therefore is no otherwise performed properly / then
by Addinge kings and Queen's unto the Church together with their dignities? as
Revel. 21.24 26. The old church had typical kings raised up in her own bowels
/ but n^ Gentele kings added unto it: we never heard of any such to become
proselytes. This scripture therefore is by them as much abused.

3. Tell them that it is by the Apostle termed an Ordinance of god. Romans 13.2.
they answer yea: but an ordinance only without the Church. Tell them that there
is no Ordinance established by god unto the Conscience of his Saints / but that
Ordinance may be within the Church / and only in the Church receives his
peculiar sanctifica^ion: they absurdly answer: nay: the Ordinance of being a
king / as it was first without the Church / so it was afterward given unto
the Church in the person of Saul in the lords wrath for whipping Israel: 1.
Sam. 8.4. etc. I answer: first it is a lie to say that kings were not in the
church before: for / Judge. 17.6. etc. 18.1. etc. 19 1. the holy ghost
attributes the wrack of Israel to want of Kings namely / becawse there then
was not kings as before. Kings therefore were Moses, Joshua, and the Judges. By
the way / let some in Scotland / that ^arped at my calling Joshua (King)
hereafter lay their hand on their mouth. Secondly / the being of a king was not
given in wrath (for the want of a king before was a sign of Iehouahs wrath
against Israel / but the giving of Such a king: viz / a king like the kings of
the Gentiles: that is / a Tyrannus king: one that should transgress the lymits
of a King: and so afterward it is explayned in particulars: 1. Sam. 8.11.
etc. But this Tyranny of his (say they) was god his ordinance and therefore
lawful in Saul. I answer: If it were lawful / then it hewes their own
shynnes / who first said it was god his ordinance that only should have been
without the church / as also / then Tyranny is lawful both within and without
the Church.

To say / Ioshuahs spoiling of Jericho was lawful / true: because god had
appointed him (a figure of Jesus) to root out such as would not be one with his
church. This was no tyranny: but justice / not against / but for the Church.

Besides / to say that Saul's tyranny was god his Ordinance / therefore lawful:
they may so say: God Ordained Absalom to ly with his fathers wives (1. Sam. 12.
and 16.22.) therefore Absaloms fact lawful.

Nebuchadne^sar was ordained for Ierusalems destruction: and so were the
Romans (called by gabriel) the Army abominable: Satan ordained to smite Job
/ therefore their facts lawful.

Filthy Conclusions. Do we not talk of divine ordinances enjoined to the
Consciences of the saints? While they talk of an ordinance divine / they
neither know what is Ordinance, or divine. We talk of Callinges or offices
appointed by god / by reason whereof the faithful their consciences ar tied.
Nay the Apostle says / that is an Ordinance or conscionable office / for the
punishment of Evil / and for praise and wealth unto the good: Romans 13.3.4. and
1. Pet. 2.17.18.

Marriage is a divine Ordinance / though without the church: so is the place of
a Master: the place of a father: the calling of a Servant: yet none of them
but retain these divine Callings after they com to Christ: so fares it with
Maiestracie.

4. But all the former strings of their bow broken / they think to smite all
dead with this pitiful argument.

what soever was a figure of a thing to com, that is by christ his coming
abolished.

But the place of a king and the bearing of the sword civil, figured Christ and
his sword spiritual:

Therefore abolished.

THis their Argument stands in the Mood of pitiful complaining: A child will
wipe it of his fingers end. Not to meddle with the Proposition / they must know
their Assumption / if it be particular (namely / if it speak of Some king and
his sword, then we grant it: The typical king and his sword is abolished: But
if they understand it universal, of All kings and their swords, (as they do
/ or else they fight not with us / but their own shadows) then we flatly
deny That all kings and their swords figured Christ and his sword. Nay they
themselves grant all owr Majestra^es still to be God his ordinance / and an
ordinance not by Christ abolished: therefore themselves / confute themselves.

Some of their Basilisk faction from the words: Ye are Christ his fremen: did
teach servants to ron from their Masters / I look when (from Math. 23.8.9.10.
Be not called Mr. Doctor, nor call any on the earth father) I look (I say)
when they should affirm all Mastership / Doctership or Teachers place / and
fatherhood abolished by Christ.

They brag of speaking but as the scripture speaks: so may they teach children
and servants not to say Father / Master to any but to god / and yet speak but
as Christ speaks. Oh filthy spirits troubling the waters of god with there
feet: will they never leave perverting?

Maiestracy and all these are commanded in the first Commandment of the second
table. Abolish one / abolish all: Bar one without the Church / bar all: and
so we shall have but 9. Commandments.

The end of bearinge the sword is / to defend the Good / and to punish the
Evil: for he bears not the sword for naught: Romans 13.4. which is the same
end with that for which Isreal's Governors bare the sword. Least therefore I
should be like the fool (in answering his endless fooleries) I therefore
(according to Salomons advise: Prove. 26.5.) Will now answer him no more. God
save our Queen Elisabeth.

Conclus. 10.
The first day of the week, is by Commandment divine, enjoined the new
Testaments church (as the seventh unto old mother Zion) for peculiar exercises
spiritual.

Examination.
AGainst this Conclusion Anabaptists and Atheists bark. First we will hear
their barkings / and then cast a crust in to the Dogs throat.

What soever was Ceremonial, is abolished. But the observation precisely of a
day for spiritual exercise was Ceremonial: There fore every such day
abolished. What if I grant them the whole Argument (viz. That every Day that
was ceremonial is abolished) what then? I speak no^ of a Day that was / but
of a day that is: namely / not of such a Day as was once Ceremonial (for the
first day of the week / was never such a Ceremonial day) but of a Day that
now IS institutued in the new Testament: Their wynd therefore shakes no haner.

Yet because such a spirit shall not have his own will (to pass by the first
proposition) I demand of him what day it was / that was so Ceremonial? was
it the Day of Easter, of Pentecost, of Tabernacles, new Moon, months, Years?
None of these I plead for. But it was the Sabaot (or 7. day) that he
specially speaks of: and this day he would have Ceremonial / from Colos.
2.16.17. and therefore to end in Christ. What then / I speak not for that 7.
day / but for the Day after / which is the 8. in regard of 7. geingebefore /
and is the first day of the week in regard of the week / Ye (as before) to
cross the spirit in his way / who enuyes not so much the Day as the exercise
(becawse the standing and falling of Religion rests in the precise
observation of some Day) I demand of him how he proves that 7. day a Ceremony.

He says it was a Ceremonial day / because it enjoined Rest: Then / Rest is
the Ceremony: and what signified that? That Christ was our Rest / and in him
only we could have Rest. Well said: then when Christ the figured Rest is Com in
the flesh / we must no more observe a Day of Rest: for that (after a sort)
should teach that Christ were vn^om. But what if I should say that it figured not
only that Rest which we should have by his incarnation / but also (if not only)
that Rest which we should have by his repair from heavens / when in that
glorified appearance he shall restore all things: and so there upon / I should
infer a Day of Rest until his appearance / though partly Ceremonial / would
not this on the other hand / break the head of the latter part of your first
proposition? I troe / it would.

But he thinks that the former place out of the Colossians, proves that every
Sabaot is abolished by Christ his former appearance / But if I should say that
the plural number there sabaoths, signifies all the days of sabaot joined with
the Pasouer day / (which indeed liuelily set out the Rest and Life we should
have in the lamb Christ Crucified) and that it signifies not the weekly
sabaot, would not this put the strainge spirit to a fowl^ plunge?

But what if I deny the weekly 7. Days rest / to be a Ceremonial rest: Nay
what if I prove it thus?

All Ceremonies precise, figuringe the savior to be slaughtered for our syn,
were instituted for Adam only after he had sinned and so stood need of a
savior:

But the 7. days rest was enjoined Adam before he had sinned: Genesis 2. therefore
no such Ceremony, if any Ceremony:

HIere the adversary stands / as having looked on Medusaes head: And now he
demands this Questios: If the 7. Days rest were not Ceremonial / how coms the
day then to be chainged? I answer by another question: what if the number of
seventh was a figure / and therefore chainged / though not the Rest / because
it was no such figure / remains still: but translated unto the next day
after: seeing Bodies Rest is of absolute necessity far the Churches spiritual
exercises? Syllie people / why may not that days rest be translated now unto
another Day: as well / as the old Testament his laying of hands upon Leui be
translated unto the Evangelical ministry?

Thus the fanaticall spirit is every way hindered progress: it now remains
to prove the First day a divine Commandment for such exercise: and that thus:

That day was so sanctified by our savior in his own person: by the Apostles
and by the primative Churches, according to divine iniunction.

Therefore to us a Commandment divine. FOr the Antecedent: First our Savior
that day arisinge (and therefore called the lords day: Reu. 1.10.) he preaches
/ from Morninge to late nigh^ and that 5. sundry times. Secondly / the Apostles
the same day conuened / as also the 8. day after (it being the same day
seauen-night) what time (on^ savior omitting the week days) he schooled Thomas
/ who the former Lords day had been absent. Thirdly / the first churches so
meeted / Actor. 20.7.11.

Least this Trine-presedent / seem notwith standinge to leave it as a thing
indifferent (for usually the observacom of the day / is left to the liberty of
the Church) we must understand that Blessed Paul had incommended the religious
observation of the day / unto the Churches / as 1. Cor. 16.1.2. where flatly he
nombers it among the Ordinances he had enjoined upon the Churches: and I troe /
Paul was A master builder and that a skillful. (1. Cor. 3.10.) and if other
Ordinances (as estaelishment of Elders Deacons etc. were Divine and
commandments from God / because delivered unto the Churches by these skillful
Mr. Builders / suerly we must hold them very unskillful Builders / that either
abrogate this Ordinance / or do teach the observation of this Day / to be
indifferent / and human / Such unskillful builders / have been a cawse of
such absurd heresies.

Blessed John ( Revel. 1.10. etc. being in the isle Parmos exiled and alone) it
seems he religiously observed yt: Yea the Lord then (and no other day)
delivers the new Testaments prophecies unto him: he being fittest to be rapt
in the spirit / what day / he specially set apart for spiritual contemplation.
Why should the Apostle be so precise in mentioninge the day / if it were not to
teach us / specially that day to addict our mynds to spiritual speculation /
that so specially that day / we may be from above endued with Revelation?

If there be not not one day of Seven / by divine ordinance to be imposed on
the Church: then wype out the Decalogues fourth command / and so there
remains one less in the Lords calendar. Will they never learn that the
equity of every Command / is so far from giving us liberty / as it ^^eth us
more strictly under Christ unto all exercises of the spirit? And even herein
must our righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees:
else we are unfit to enter into this kingdom.

This is the Lords day and it is marvelous in owr eyes. Conclus. 11.
No Person may separate fully in fellowship spiritual, from such a
Congregation truly Christian whereof he has been a member, by peculiar
profession, except such a Congregation be first convicted of obstinate
Rebellion, or else do unjustly hunt after the spoil of such a member.

Examination.
FIrst / let the Congregation we speak of / be rightly conceived: and then we
shall speak of the separation.

The Congregation we speak of / is such a fellowship of people (more / or few)
as is truly Christian: that is / not only professinge Christ / but professinge
of him truly. And least any Catharist (that speaks of perfection) do stumble
at the word / Truly: we therefore notify / that by Truly, we mean not
perfectly (for we but se in part / and practice in a less part / as in the 4.
Concl. is proved) but a professinge of the true Christ unto their full
salvation, as in the 1. Concl. buildinge upon that foundation in a new and holy
conversation / so far as for the present they se and are enabled by god.

As for a Church whose prayers, preachinges, practices are laid upon a false
foundation / a new divised Christ, from such a Congregation a person (at the
first sight) may fully separate in spiritual Communion: only / seeing God has
now opened his eyes / and there he was a professed member / it shall be duty to
Communicate that he sees unto such a people / that so they (together with him)
may repent / and so lay a true foundation of faith. Revel. 18.4. Ier. 51.6.9.26.

But provided the Congregation be (as before) truly Christian / he cannot
symplie (that is / without all exception) fully separate / but he does violence
unto Christ the corner stone of that groundwork. If he epsy corruptions in
faith or Manners: such Corruptions he must at the very first insight separate
from / but keep one with them in the part uncorrupted. By such separation / he
teaches them both by word and practice (the best Manner of teaching that can
be) to separate also from Corruption: and by such an union with them / he shall
also teach that all union is to be in truth and for the truth. Such separation
and union was in some of Sardi, Reu. 3.4. some of Thyatira, Chapter 2.24. In not
seperatinge from such evil / they should first syn presumptuouslie / secondly /
strengthen the hands of the wicked: and by not keeping such union / they should
be found first cruel toward the truth: secondly be demed uncharitable:
thirdly / give suspicion of fallinge away from all truth in Religion / under a
color of hatinge corruption.

Two cawses therefore of seperating fully in fellowship spiritual / from such a
Congregation as has truly professed Christ / there seems unto us (for the
present) sufficient and lawful. The one / if so they / have been orderly
convicted of obstinate Rebellion: the other / if so they seek the spoil (or
life of such a member / unjustly.

Touching the first / we se that after the Lord his prophets had convicted
Judah and Israel, of obstinate rebellion (Hos. 2. Ezekiel. 16.52. Ier. 3.8.) They
put the Bill of Diuorcement into their hands / and so cut them of: Hos. 6.5.
until they returned by repentance. This course might the house of Cloe. (1.
Cor. 1.11.) Have taken with Corinth / had they (after Paul's conuicting them)
persisted rebellious in the matters convicted. But as Cloe (and others of like
spirit) did not presently reject Corinth (though no doubt they had dealt with
them about their Corruptions / before they writ to Paul thereof) but themselves
not preuailinge / they lovingly sought further means for their Conviction and
vrginge repentance: so / every person that in his own eyes / is presently
righteous in his own cawse (specially in matters disputable and doubtful) is
not redely to reject the congregation for not accepting his admonishment / but
charitablie seek further means (if yet further means be not dammed up) for
helpinge that which (in the body) is haltinge / to be turned in to the way and
healed: And this may be a coolinge ^arde to our right Brownistes (if so any may
rightly be so called) who (have they no more substantial knowledge / for
discerning things different / then Tom skul, or Balaams Ass when he was at
home in the stable) they upon every sly and unstaid crochet / buzzing in their
ytchinge ears / through the suggestion of Ahabs spirit / do fly the
Congregation / grinninge and barking like dogs of the Eueninge against all such
as will not presently conform to their Opinion: it may be / to slap up a little
of their disgorged vomit. Let such read / Heb. 10.24.25. and so to the end:
suerly / our sowles have no pleasure in such: and so much the rather / as we
cannot se these Schismatic Apostates com home by repentance: but seem to have
committed such a syn / as therefore the lord dammeth up the way to repentance.

The other cawse is cruel persecution / when as such a member cannot stay in
any communion with them / but with likly spoil and peril of life. In such
cases the prophets fled: 1. King. 18.4. end 19.3. The Apostles fled and were
bid to fly: Math. 10.23. The saints fled: Act. 8.1. and Heb. 11.37. Many such
/ as of whom the world were not worthy / wandered up and down in sheep and
Goats skins / being destitute etc. Nay our savior himself diverse times
(though he knew his time of suffering was not yet com) he secretly fled: how
much more in such case may we? If any say: few of these flights / were from
such people as were not first God his church: Let it be so. If we may fly from
an holy people by reason of outward persecution / then much more for inward
persecution. And this ouerthwarteth such (I speak only of such) pharisaicall
Prescisians as have taught their people that Clapham and others such / may be
known for false prophets / if but in this: they fly for fear of the sword.
If it be truth they teach, they would stay and seal it with their blood.

Of pestilent locusts / faced like Men / but tayled like scorpions: We are
willing (though not wilful) to offer up our lives when God will, we somtymes
fly hin the body / but stand by the Truth (though with some weakened) whereof god
has assured us: You stay grazinge upon the green things with your bodies /
but you fly from the truth / whereof your tongues have spoken / and your fingers
have written / what time your consciences / were first there with convinced.
But you must slubber your childrens bread over with a little such counterfeit
honey / or else they would not so easly swalowe the Leaven of the Pharisees.

The Arch-bisshop of Caunterbury (as I was told) sitting once in examination of
some / he said / that if he were of Cartwrightes opinion / he would be of the
Brownistes practice. He plainly saw your Opinions (I speak of many of you) and
your practices to be contradictorie. And suerly / were I of full mind with some
of your writers and teachers / I should with the right Brownist deem every
speaker and communicator with you to be flatly visible Antichristian; where (as
I cannot subscribe unto you in every thing) I verily believe many in that land
/ to give such testimony of Christian obedience grounded on saving faith / as
I need not fear to believe them to be true Christians. Leave you your halting
betwixt two: either practice that you teach men: or teach men no more then (if
your selves will not) you can be contended they practice: Some of you sent word
into Scotland / that I fell from your Sect / twice to the Bishops twice to the
Brownists (4. lies at a clap) if I had don so / first I had fallen to such as
whereof there have been as true Christians as you / at least: secondly / I
should but have played turn coat / as have a number of you: and so your
brother in that / though not in other things.

Conclus. 12.
That is to us a true visible Christian church, 1. Gathered, 2. Established, 3.
Absolute in her parts, which consists of a company of people, beleuinge
Christ Jesus the son of God by the holy ghosts ouershadowinge, to be com in our
nature for the perfect salvation thereof: buildinge upon that foundation etc.
(as in the 1. Conclus.) such a people Gathered together in the name of Christ,
are, 1. a Church gathered: 2. such a people entringe into Covenant of
spiritual buildinge together, is a church established: 3. such a people,
enjoyinge their house Officers, is a church absolute in her parts.

Examination.
THis Conclusion t^^ching the visible Church of Christ / does sever it self
into three Considerations: which by ignorant men not discerned / they
confusedly speak of a Church / as of other Things.

First into a Church gathered:
Sec. into a Church gathered and established:
Thirdly / into a Church gathered / established / and absolute.
IN the 1. Conclus. we have described a visible true Christian: now we affirm
/ that a Compaine of such people (so beleiuinge and obayinge) being now
Gathered together in the power of their Christ / are to us / a true visible
church / in the first sense. Sec. ^hey so gatheringe and couenanting / are a
Church in the second sense. Thirdly / they so gatheringe / couenantinge / and
possessinge their proper officers / they are a Church in the third sense.

In wihich sense of the three soever we speak of / it still propounds unto us
One sort of people (such beleiuers and Obayers) whereof the true visible Church
of Christ / can be said to consiste of. And suerly / the former Notes or marks
do propounde unto us more certainly / which is a true church / then the Common
received Marks of Preachinge / Sacraments / discipline. Becawse there may be a
Church of Christ / or / a visible people of God / where the said three Murks are
lackinge. As also / a people may enjoy some of the said marks (as true
preachinge) and yet be as far from a true visible church / as was the Court of
Festus and Foelix. If we desire infallible notes of a true people / we must
have such Notes as Deliver unto us the essential form of a Church: which is
such a Mark / as never can be lacking from the Church: else Logitians know /
the Axiom breaks the head of Kata Pantos, etc.

The General / or / Matter of a visible Church / is People: the Difference or
/ essential form / is / true faith with obedience / as before. where such
Matter and form meteth in Gue / there is an house spiritual: Act. 2.24.44. 1.
Ti. 3.15. the Efficient cawse whereof is / God: by the instrument Outward and
inward / the word and Spirit: the final cawse (in regard of God) is / God his
glory: in regard of his Church / their Salvation.

That such a people only do constitute a true visible body / as the scriptures
are open enough / as also the Ancient writers / so (becawse our late men are
so addicted unto some late writers / let them hear Mr. Cartwricht (1. Reply.
page 34. There be in the Churches of Christ no dronckerds nor whore mongres at
least which are known: and Mr. Oud Fenner. (in his Meth. Theol. lib. 6. Cap.
1.) Caetusille etc. That Company (speakinge of a particular Church) so
ordained / ought to be pure from all pollution etc. Psa. 15. etc. 27.8. etc.
29.9. Isa. 4.4. 1. Cor. 3.16. etc. 5.11. 1. Tim. 3.15. Revel. 1.13.20. and
harken unto Doct. Bilson in his privileged book (perpet. Gouernm. cap. 10.
page 155.) To the first Churches came none but such as were willinge and Zealous
/ without all compulsion (by Coming / I charitablie understand / Coming
into Communion) To ours com all sorts / Atheistes / hypocrites / and how many
forced rather by law / then led by Devotion: Yea would to god it di^ not often
so fall out / that in many places the richer and weal^hier men either regard no
religion / or secretly lean To the worst. All whith teach what kind of people
are to be received? 2. are to be retained in spiritual Comunion / or / Church
fellowship.

And indeed we se that the blessed ministry of the Gospel was first the ax
that hewed these living stones for our Salomons temple: as also that when any
stone burst out into spiritual defection or backslidinge / it was either
presently cured and faster mortized by repentaince / or else it was thrust out
of peculiar communion / until by the ax of excommunication / the rough things
were made smooth / and the hawtie things / humbled: 1. Cor. 1.5.11. with / 2.
Cor. 2.7.8.9.10.110.

Such a people therefore gathering and thus couenantinge to walk / are a Church
gathered and established: only / to the absolutinge or perfectinge of this
Churches Order / there is required further / an election and Ordination of
Officers. As a little City compact in it self / it must out of it self / or by
the coassistaunce of some syster-church / make choice of meet men for the
oversight and service of the City or house of god. Otherwise (if there be no
king in Israel) every man will do that which is good in his own eyes: every
man will be a prophet in his own conceit: Jack Cade will be Lord Mortymer: and
Hobbinoll set as good a gloss on scripture / as he that was brought up at the
feet of Gamaliel: flat Akephalistes. A while without officers / they may
happily walk well: but long (specially / after they have fit men and means)
they are not like to stand orderli together / without such instalment of
officers.

The Officers are of two sorts: Bishops (in english overseers) and Deacons) in
english / Ministers / or Seruitours) 1. Tim. 3.1.8. Philip. 1.1. Under the
term Episcop, Ouerseer: is contained / Pastor, Doctor / Elder, under the term
Deacon / is contained / 1. the Ministerial Man (whereof specially before) 2.
the Ministerial woman: Romans 16.1. 1 Timothy 5.9.10. These must hold the mystery
of the faith in a pure conscience: And in the former / there is required of
absolute Necessity / aptnes to teach / and ability to confute errors. Such
the Pastor and Doctor / every one graunts / must be: and such the other Elders
must be / as I have proved in my Bybles breife. As for the understanding of 1.
Tim. 5.17. (every of whose senses is to be preferred before the dream of Lay
elders) do look into D. Bilsons forsaid book. A plain print of the
footesteps of preaching Presbyters / or / Elders / se in all ancient writers
theological and historical: and that whersoeuer they mention presbyters in a
church (under the Episcop / or Pastor) they must be understood such Elders
commonly translated / Preistes.

If al Levies lips were to preserve knowledge / how much more was the law to
be fetched from Kohaths Leuits which were joined with the Chief priest / in the
work of Ouerseinge and peculiar government. The Priest dyinge / another came
into his room out of Kohaths family: so the Episcop / or Pastor dyinge / one
should specially (if not only) arise out of the same Ouerseinge family of
Elders: and how shall this be answerable / if the Elders be laymen / or men but
of private qualification? Let therefore our other Congregation put away this
their error: and let all that have held it / smite their hand on their thighe
and say: what have we don? while we sought to establish ordinances divine / we
have constituted an ordinance human. In a word: such Elders are but domb
priests: and ill may they call others Domb dogs / that establish such Stilborne
Elders.

Such pastor, such Doctor, such Elders, elected and Ordained by sacred
imposition of hands: they are fit to judge of the sons of the Prophets their
doctrine / delivered in the school of prophecy / 1. Cor. 14. which kind of
school and prophecy / Mr. Oud. Fenner. ( Meth. Th. lib. 7. cap. 7.) has well
observed / as also taught that such exercise is common to every particular
Church / which gainsaieth the Common practice of some reformed Churches: who
unto some one Church fetches a weapontake / or / circuit of Pastors to speak
and judge: as for their cyphering Elders / they stand by as mute fill hes: as
domb as a dore-nayle / that stands fast / but says nothing.

Such Deacons and Deaconisses constituted also in such holy form / they shall
not only be helpful unto the former functioners by serviceable duty / but
also unto the whole body of the Church / specially in lookinge to the poor
and impotent.

If Antichrist / shall unto one of these officers or offices attribute another
name / it may (through the iniquity of Men) derogate from the credet of the
person and his office / but the person truly (I say not perfectly) discharging
the duties of the office / he notwithstanding as also his office is yet of
Christ. Is also / Antichrist shall establish an office in the Church / not
incommended by Christ thereto / (Yea / if the Church her self should establish
such a new office) and give unto the possessor of yt / the Name and title of
Episcop, Doctor, Elder, Deacon, Deaconisse (officers standing in and to a
church constituted) or the title of Apostle, Evangelist, prophet. (officers
deputed to the Gathering / plantinge / and helping of the Churches) yet such an
Officer told not be of Christ / be cause his office is humanie and a vain
invention. The Apostle (2. Tim. 2.14.) has commanded Timothy / me
logo-machein not to ^ight about words / because they bring but a Katastrophe /
or subtle deception to the hearers. Least therefore any should imagine us
Logomachistes / we therefore add: Let others contend about words rather then
Things: about the shell / rather then the cranell / we freely deny to do so.
Things essential / substantial (not barely accidental) we do / and by the
help of our god will stand for: laboring in the mean time charitablie / for
the preservation of such pure names / as Christ has baptized his officies
into: but yet will proclaim no spiritual battle about Names / when the names
Subject shall be agreed upon / symplie good / or symplie evil. If every Action
/ or / Subject should be termed symplie good or evil / by reason of some good or
bad Accident / or outward hue / suerly / we should term Satan transformed / a
good Angel: and Christ spotted and mangled / Antichrist. This orderly
distinction (between the, Subject and his seperable adiunct) not observed of
many poor ignorant Zeloistes / does cawse them condemn and justify they
know not what / able to make a man of some knowledge / to tear his heads hair
of / to hear their sensles conclusions. Such Lochomachisme / is but vain
bablinge / and opposite to science / and therefore falsely called science / 1.
Tim. 6.20. such argumentation is not Logic / but error from Logic / commenly
termed / Sophistry. As for us / we (wittinglie) can nothing against / but
for the truth: though it may be / ouerweakly / and poorly.

A little Tractate / vtteringe the Truth of Christ his Two-Natures.
Mark. 6.3. Is not this the Carpenter, Mary's son?
OUr savior coming into a Synagogue he there opens his mouth and
preaches: ey / he so preaches / as the hearers were astonished at the
powerful excellency of his speech: in so much / as they fall of interrogating
from whence that learning should com / and where he should win it / considering
they knew him well enough to be but the Carpenter, Maryes son: one / who by
reason of his occupation / c^ld have no leisure also to become so profound in
the scriptures. Where / besi^es that the Auditorie tieth the knowledge of the
scriptures to the Doctors chair / we may mark that our Savior was a
handie-craftes Man / one who by his hand labor erned his bread until his
heavenly father called him to an hier calling. For no doubt the people speak
according to the knowledge they had of his trayning up in former time: the
consideration whereof makes them admire so much the more at the mightiness of
his doctrine.

The Evangelist Luke (Chapter 2.51.) testifies that he was subject unto his Father
and Mother. And can it be thought that Religions Joseph would not set him to some
work? Can it (howsoever some have carped at it in my Bibles breife) be imagined
that sweet Jesus / who came to call every man to some Christian calling / that
he himself would sit idle? No / no / his excellent carriage herein was so public
and famous / as the people had it on the fingers end / and so much the more was
his theological speeches to be admired.

Then I perceive / that a Manuarie science is no vile thing / seeing the
occupation of a Carpenter was sanctified in the person of our Savior. Then I
perceive / if the Master have not shamed to erne his bread with the sweat of
his brows / the disciple should not be a shamed to tread in the same tract.
What then? Whosoever will be a Christian / he must be possessed with a Christian
calling. A calling says one: a calling / says another: what means he by a
Calling? I mean / thou must have some such place in Church and common wealth /
as the use thereof may be profitable and necessary: as also / that room it
self / must be consecrated out of the lord his word / for lawful. Such a room
and calling (not any room and calling) the Apostele Paul (1. Cor. 7.20.24.)
under a general rule (applied there to certain particulars) he means of /
what time he says / Let every man abide in the saine vocation wherein he was
called.

The Catabasileyst would have the Maiestrate / becominge a Christian to cast
aside his Civil calling (a Calling notwithstanding / they are forced from.
Romans 13. to grant / a divine ordinance imposed on the Consciences of all
people) but affirm it an ordinance divine / and only without the Church. To
say / a maiestrate cannot stand a true christian: and to say / that Majestracie
is a divine conscionable ordinance / is / with one mouth to spit out black and
white / flat contradictories. Such choppers and chaingers of scriptures in the
Lord his Temple / stand much need that our Carpenter would also (as sometimes he
did / Mark. 11.15.16. Luke 19.45.) with a whip and whipcoard / expulse them the
house of prayer. Such scripture-choppers stand more need of a Maiestrates lash
/ then a scholars argument. If one should ask these fellows / what office or
Calling it was which Christ so exercised / can they say he did it / by virtue
of Preisthoode or Prophecy / or only as he was King / and so by power Regal
due unto him (as he was David's son) though at other times he would not use
it? Will they not give me leave to believe / that in the execution of this
civil power / he as well sanctified (in the practice of his own person) the
room of a Maiestrate? as by his Carpentrie / he sanctified Manuarie sciences?

But let the Despiser of government (as Jude calls him) go / the Apostle Paul
wills every man to abide still in that Calling lawful / where in he was
found / when he was called to christianity: presuming hereby / that every one
that should be called to Christ / should be alredie installed in some legetimate
calling: as though God would hardly call any / that were out of all calling.
And indeed / A man without a calling / is like a carcass without a soul:
fitter to be pitted for fear of infection / then to be tolerated amongst men.
Pharaoh (Genesis 47.3.) cold ask Joseph's brethren of what trade they were? Either
because he demed the religious Hebrews would not live without some trade: or
because it was common with the Egiptians to have trades: or / for that the
integrity of that age was such / as eueri where (ordinarily) people had
trades. Many Kings we have / and many people we have: but few kings or rulers
that enquire after trades: and too many people / that were not able to answer
unto the Demand / what trade? That is cawse so many drone bees fly by the
hy-ways / stinginge horse and Man: and that is cawse that Tyburnes Tripos
deuoureth a number of bodies / before their sowles have been initiated in any
rudiment of their redemption.

Paul / a great scholar / he would play the Tentmakeryer he would sit idle: and
Dorcas would make garments for the poor (few Dorcasses in these days) before
she would sit idle. It is neither Pismire / Cony / Grasshopper / nor Spider / but
Solomon (prove. 30.) he rancks her in a Calling and shames not man (who is
differenced from them by the hie guifte of Reason) abasheth he not to be out of
all calling? The pismire shall sit upon him / and the residue of the creatures
shall finally condemn him: for the word of the Lord fails not.

But thou replies / I thank god for it / I have a Calling: That may be: but
is it a lawful Calling? Jesus was a Carpenter: a calling lawful and much
necessary. Some are Callings shaped in the Deuels shop. and the more they are
used / the more returns to the Deuels advauntage. Such is the upholding and
keyinge of Cardinge and dicing howses: wanton dauncinge schools / and many
more of like vain nature. Such persons cannot call for the lords blessinge to
light on their labors / and that because they labou^ not in the lord: whereas a
Christian must neither in word nor deed do any thing but in the lord / Coll.
3.17. Famous are the Romans / as for other things so for this: not a Man went
in the streets but he carried in hand or in some other part an ensign of his
calling: were his calling singular or vulgar. If this law were enjoined upon
the people of England / Scotland and some other parts / what might many carry?
Some might carry a Midianitishe stale: some a box of face paintings: some a
Portuis book: And Othersom an even pair of cards in the one hand / and dyce
shaking in the other. Nay / infinite are the inventious that Hell and Vanity
have invented: and most painfully these are plijde / because their gain semes
to be greatest. But let such walk on: He that sets them on work / even he
shall pay them their wages.

But have thou an honest calling: be thankful unto god for that / and be thou
industrious and faithful in the exercution of his parts and offices. Call upon
the Lord by prayer often and many times? Bless thou oh Lord my handy works
etc. Thou may rise up early and sit up late and eat the bread of
carefulnes / and yet except the Lord his blessinge associate thy labors / thou
but watch^st and labourest in vain (ps. 127.1.) Be industrious then and
faithful / which don / commit the issue to him that gives and holds back the
rain / and ministers unto these that walk vprightlie / every thing that good
is (Ps. 84.11.) He that has a care over the field lillies and sparrowes / how
much more will he be careful for us / oh we of little faith?

Have thou a lawful trade? yea. Art thou the Mr. of it? I can do so / so. yea
/ but it is not sufficient that thou have a trade or Calling and that a
lawful one except thou can perform the parts of it well. It is not
sufficient to Do / but to Do well. It is not sufficient to council / but to
courncell well. It is not ^ufficient to tylle the ground / but to till it well
/ The consideration hereof incited Nebuchadnetsar (Dan. 1.) to select choice
youths and accordingly to initiate them in his learinge. This cawsed Pharaoh
(Genesis 47.6.) to bid Joseph only appoint over his cattle / Men of actiuitie.
And this urged holy Paull / not only to wish Timothi to Divide the-word (2.
Tim. 2.15.) but Divide it aright. The word signifies to Cut aright: alludinge
(no doubt) to the Cutting up of Beasts / wherein the Leuits were exercised: as
though he should say / even as the Leuits are Masters of their work in
cuttinge up every part of the beast aright: so show thy self dextere and fit
for diuidnige the word of the Lord.

To be out of all calling many shame / and therefore they undertake one thing
or other: but to live in the same according to knowledge and judgment / little
they regard. Look into the affairs of Rulers / and tell me how they rule?
Look into the actions of Ecclesiastical ministers / and tell me how they
feed. Look into the dealings of Merchants and tradesmen / and tell me the
breadth of their conscience. Look into the lives of subjects / and tell me /
how much obedience not for the sword / but for conscience sake / No / nor
Rulers have laid the raynes in Cruelties neck: who let loose for advauntage /
he fills heaven and earth with blood. Inowe / with Iehu they are zealous for
Jehovah / by and by they bow to Baal / and subscribe to the abominations of
Nebat. As for Churchmen / alas / alas: they are now in in the same predicament
as was Esekiels Pastors (chapter 34.) In stead of fedinge the flock / they feed
themselves / and cloth their wretched corpse with the fleece. Sowles Maladies
they know not / Or know They them / they then will press their patient no
more / then is fitting their patients humor. Nay / because they should not set
our Saviors sword and fire amongst the people / (for then it may be / Mr.
Parson shall be pincht of his tenth goose and calfe) they huddle sweetly up /
the wicked with the godly / the persecuting world and the persecuted church
into one Babilonish body / why forsooth? The Apostle calls all he writes
unto / Brethren and Saints by calling. Together with these Clawbaks (Dawbers
with untempered mortar Ezekiel. 13.) the poor people are pestred with stilborne
Mattens-men that can say nothing / but Coax / Coax / croaking in their Pues /
like a swarm of Marchfrogs in a pudle. Unto these / talk not of cuttinge the
word aright / but of cutting A pair of Cards (the Deuels common service book)
and those they can cut at a Knave. These are the Parson or Patron their ten
pound Cure-rats: and if the cursed people catch such a Companyon / oh they are
as well as Michah (Judge. 17.13.) with his figginge Leuit. But to leave that
vermin / cast an ey unto Merchants and Artificers / and what is there / but
slaights for soliditie? quid pro quo, Nay look into all callings and behold /
Gain is demed godliness: all is for self advauntage.

Thus / whereas our Carpenter Jesus / calls every man in his own practice to
labor / and to labor as A Christian / behold / Satan either debarreth men of
callings / or he inuests them withsom of his own infernal shoptrades: or
having a legitimate room / he cawseth them to invert all holy rule and order.
Well may he be called the Enuyous Man / for (as he envyes all / so) he would
abash to do good unto any. A few of his Tares / will give cawse sufficient /
of shedding many Tears.

But to shut up this paynt briefly: if thou woldst not be adjudged a Drone in
the common wealth / Do live in a calling: for though the ruler of the people
do tolerate thy lewdnes / Yet Christ the Carpenter will debar the his
commonweal / 2 Thessalonians. 3.10. Nay / will thou be seldom or never tempted / or
strongly assailed with ill / then live in a Calling / and labor painfully
therein: so shall there be no place to vain thoughts / nor shall the spartous
assailements of Satan be able to penetrate thy straits. While Jesus played the
Carpenter / we read of no tentations / but so soon as he was called from that
and went into the wilderness for solitary / then we hear of a Tempter and his
manifold tentations. So much for that.

Tho second part of this peoples question is this: Is not he Mary's son? Yes
forsooth: he is the son of Mary / and yet so her son / as neither blind
Jew / nor natural Gentile is able to comprehend. Mary's son he is: not
Joseph's son. Truer they spoke then they were aware. But as Caiphas prophesied /
and Pilate superscribed / so these pronounce their own condemnation
vnwntinge. Mary's son he is / and yet more then Mary's son: for behold / God
clothed in flesh / our nature assumed of God / whereby (oh ever worthy
meditation) God and Man is made One. This doctrine is termed blasphemy by the
many sects of Anabaptistrie / of our time. One sort with Arius, Denies him to
be eternal / and of the fathers essence / affirming him a Creature with the
beginning of time. Another crew term him also a Creature / but diduce his
beginning of Days from Mary: some of them making him bare man / with Artemon and
Samosatenus: some of them / make him a third thing (or a mixed Creature)
compounded on God and Man / not Distinguishing / but confounding the natures /
as did Apollinaristes. Another feet (and they are most common) do deny Christ
to exist one person in two natures: giving unto him with Manes one Nature / and
that mere Divine: some of them saing it was of the essence of his father: some /
that is came from heaven: some / they will not define from whence.

Thus the Heretics stumbel upon our Carpenters ax: Hacking their own shynnes /
while they permit not Mary's son and Mary's Lord to hew them.

Our Arrians say / he is called / the beginning of the Cratures of god, Revel.
3.14. therefore he had a beginning: foolishlie concluded: for blessed John
tellinge the (chapter 1.) that 1. he was the Word: 2. with God. 3 and was God 4.
that without him Nothing was made (he was Somthinge / did he make him self?)
they should rather conclud he is called the beginning of the Creatures / because
every Creature was begone by him: as we say: this Carpenter was the beginner of
the Ship? that is / the Maker or efficient cawse of the ship. Where as he is
also (Revel. 1.11.) the First and the Last / they may as well say / he was the
last creatuere / as the first creature. Our Samosatenists / from the former
place of John / as also from Phil. 2.6. He being in the form of god thought it
no robbery to be equal with god / they must knoe themselves to be theiues and
robbers / for robbinge him of the fulness of the God head / which (Collof. 2.9.)
dwelt in him essentiallie. Our Appollinarists / must go learn of Athanasius /
1. that Soul and body / for making one person Man / are two Natures distinct
/ not confounded or mingled / as it seems Aristotle (by calling Anima,
Entelechia) thought: which many laying hold on / did therefore believe / that
the soul died together with the body. 2. they must learn / that as to the
making of Man / there concurreth soul and body / even so / to the making of
the Messiah and Mediator Christ / there concurred / God head and Manhoo^e /
not confounded / but distinguished and united. This consideratiaon cawsed the
Author to the hebrews to say / he took to himself Abraham's seed. 2. 16. as
the soul in the resurrection is said / to take unto it the Body. And in this
sense / our Jesus says: He will lay down his life (or body) and then by the
other Nature distinguished (not mixed) he will take it up again. And so / when
the Iues had cast down the Temple of his body / lo by the other distinct
nature / he raised it up again / Let our Poly-baptist for shame therefore /
leave of to mix the natures / for making up a Christ that is neither God nor
Man. Our Anabaptisticall Maniches they start out cryinge: Mulier non habet
semen, the ^emall has no seed: or else if the woman have feed / yet of Mary
he cold assume no seed but such as was sinful.

To the first / what should I say / The woomans seed shall break the serpents
head / Genesis 3. This they say / is not spoken of Christ but of his mystical
body. Beastly spirits / has not the Apostle Gala. 4.4. plainly expounded it
Christ: or would they have the Body to be of one nature / and the head to be of
another / how should they then grow together? should the justice of God be
satisfied in another nature? They forget / that he which sanctifies / and they
that are sanctified ex henos pantes / are all of One / Heb. 2.11. as also / in
all things like unto us / syn excepted. And this exception of Syn gives also
answer unto the second: namely / that he assumed our nature / but without syn?
First / euerey mean Alchinist can tell them / that in the generatinge of
every creature (even in Minerals) there is the Nature Active, and the nature
Passive: secondly / that Syn is no substance / but a bare Axcident / or thing
happening to accompany man's nature / because of the first transgression. Now /
of Accidents / or things associatinge a Substance some are seperable. Now / if
any should say that syn is inseparable / they may as well say it is of the
Essence of Man / and that is apparently false / inasmuch as Man was perfect
without it: yea / in very deed / it is his imperfection. Besides / that which
is impossible with man / that is possible with God. And that this Posse sit
eius velle / is a possibility agreing with his will / let them remember that
the holy ghost (Luke 1.35.) whose office is as fire to burn and water to wash
/ lo he ouershadowes Mary for the perfectinge of this work.

And much I muse / that any should think it possible to make the first Adam so
glorious a Creature / and that of red earth: and in the mean time / deem it so
unable for the second Adam to arise out of our Nature. But say they / The word
was made flesh: true / what then? Then Mary's seed was not made flesh. I
answer: if the word Made / imply a turning of one Nature into another: Then our
Apollinarifts Christ will follow. Expound therefore the word Made or Became, by
the word Epilambaneraj, he assumed, Heb. 2.16. Nor think to ^lip away with
saying / he took a seed for Abraham and the faithful / but remember the
text / He took the seed of Abraham, and so the seed of the faithful. And
for this cawse is he termed so often David's son: and If haj the root from
whence he should grow / Isa. 11.1. though in regard of the Nature assuminge /
he be called David's son and Goote / Ps. 110.1. Reu. 5.5. And in vain had
Matthew and Luke labored to prove him genealogically of Adam / Abraham / and
David / if so he had not derived an human nature from them.

Oh says the false spirit / he was of David in regard of Joseph his supposed
Father / not by reason of Mary / for she was of Leuj / inasmuch as Elisabet of
Aaron / Luke 1.1.36. was cosen to Mary. Our English Samosatenists / some of them
deming this but plain cosenage in the Anabaptists / (and indeed / they
propound unto us so / but a supposed Christ) they say in secret / that they
were Cosens only in regard / that Judah and Leuj had one and the same Mother /
Genesis 29.34.35. This sense is far fetched and dear bought / good enough for
Botchers / that clap any clout on their garment. But consideringe the Shiloh
must spring from Judah, Genesis 49.10. Reu. 5.5. and David lineallie / I must
needs hold fast / that Mary his mother was of Judah, as also Elizabet by the
Mother-side (the surest side) thowgh a Daughter of Aaron by reason of her
Father.

Simple sowles / though Iudahs men might not Marry (no more then any of the
other 10. tribes) with Leuj / because of confoundinge the enheritaunce / Nomb.
36.7.8.9. Yet Leuies Men / who had no such enheritaunce / Josh. 13.33. (And
therefore no such confusion) they might (as they had their maintenance out of
the other Tribes / so) Marry with the other tribes. Such a Marriage se in 2.
Chro. 22.11. where the holy priest Iehojadah, is married with Iehosheba of
Iudahs kyng-seede. Besides / Joseph and Mary having the testimony of Just and
pleasing god / it cannot without villainous reproach to them and Christ / be
thought to make such an illegitimate mongrell Marriage / as the Anabaptists would
have it. Go therefore / which way they and their opposite neighbor Artemon will
to work / till they graun^ him true God and true Man / existinge of two
Natures distinct / not mingled their work but shutters in the joints / as
Belshassars knees knocking each other. The Iues saw him so verily Man / as they
could not believe him to be also God: but the Manichests so se him God / as
they cannot feel his human Nature*

These are the odd spirits / that teach the odd Doctrine / by which they
disire to be distinguished from allothers for odd. If they can dash me and my
brethren in the teeth / with holding Christ as does the Church of England / the
Church of Rome etc. oh then they have won the can^red spurs / and their Christ
must be the true Christ. These odd ones (for if they be Englishones they
commonly are in fellowship with none / no not amongst themselves / only at
league with the Deuell / who sets them all on work: Every one saying / he is
in the estate of Helias / (he sees no Saint but himself) but all of them lying
Elyasses. They must knoe / that the simplest member of thenglish church is
better then the Greatest of them: and whosoever in simplicity beleiueth of
Christ his natures and person in the General (as does Rome) they hold that
truth which ever has prevailed against Arius / Manicheus and all heretical
spirits. And were it not that this belief of Christ / has in all ages
prevailed against hell gates / I should suspect it / Yea / reject it. Nay / what
if The Deuel confess Jesus to be the son of David / and the Apostles to be
the servants of the euerliuinge god etc. should I therefore not profess the
same? I praise god for it / that the Corner stone is still bidinge visible
though the orderly building thereunto and thereupon / has been notably
lackinge.

He that looks into this Christ with the one ey / he cannot se in the
Carpenter two things: as scholars use to speak / aliud and aliud / another and
another thing / or nature: not alius and alius / another and another Person?
and because aliud and aliud therefore not one thing / either Divine / or
Human / or Mixed. Both eyes must exquire this Mystery. But the sword is on
the lest ey of Manes / on the right ey of Artemon: and on both the eyes of our
Appollinarists.

Thus / while the Lord Carpenter is hewing out his timber / some log^ prove not
only crooked / but knobby and knurry / unwilling to be cut and squared.. If
they give him Man / they will not give him God: if they give him god they will
not give him man: or give they him of God and Man / it shall be but a piece of
god / and a piece of Man: and thus they piece up A patched Christ amongst them.
Non est bonum ludere cum sanctis, it is not good jesting with edg-loomes.
Mary's son / was Mary's Lord / and Lord and son was A handicrafts man / a
Carpenter in our Nature / for hewing out A better ship / then Noah hewed out of
the Pynetrees. Noah's Arc was precious stuff / so is this spiritual chest the
church of gold and silver / and living precious stones / begotten by A seed
as im^ortall as god himself. 1. Pet. 1.23. by reason whereof they communicate
with the Nature divine. 2. Pet. 1.4. That Ark was One / so is the Church
wherein Christ dwells by his spirit unto the worlds end: though these
heretics would with the harlot / 1. King. 3. have the living child divided
into two: nay / into as many gobbets / as their schismatic sword can rut.
The soldiers would not diuyde Christ's coat / but these dogs of the evening that
go grinning about the city / they make no conscience to tear it with their
teeth in fitters. In Noah's ship / though one / there were 3. roumes / and
herein be sundry Mansions. Noah's ship rid upon the waves / and the Church must
flote through all tempestuous miseries. In it was a Cham and unclean
creatures: and in this will be the lurking hypocrite and many unclean sowles /
faring the better for the presence of our Carpenter. That / at the last rested
upon the tops of the Mountains: and shall not our Carpenters Church after all
hurly-burlyes / ariue at A haven of happiness / hier then the Mountains? Oh
blessed Carpenter / when god himself is the Carpenter: and oh work ineffable
when god in the nature of the work / must hew out the timber / square it /
join it / polish it.

Thus the head of our nature and first fruits of our lump / he followed the
occupation earthly / until he fell unto the occupation heavenly. In the first
he was serviceable to the earthly parent / in the second to the heavenly: but
Being once adapted to the second / he leaves of the first / to teach men to
cast aside earthly toil / when by ministering the ghospel / they fall of
building the Church. The Apostles / Act. 6. found by experience / that they
(though endued with gui^ts extraordinary) could not attend both on the Word
and Tables / but our odd spirits / would have us to wait on the word and
Stables. And indeed / metinge once or never in A month or two (for they deride
the Lord his day: Ismaels seed for profane mockinge) it shall be no great
matter to follow a manuarie science (though with some false stiches) and then
to fadge out A preachment: specially / such A sermon / as the Cobbler pulls
out of the Beasts hyde / as full of divinity / as Manes Christ of humanity. I
despise not / but commend the homeliest occupation / but when the following of
it / must be preferred to giving attendance unto readinge and study / I
despise it / as A darkner of Christ's learning.

Is not this the Carpenter Mary's son? The Jews hearing him speak so learnedly
and powerfully / they wonder it should be in A Man / that never had been trained
up in letters. They had learned (which I would the fanaticall spirits had
Learned) that with man it is impossible to attain to or comprehend great
guiftes / without such ordinary means / as are left to man. And indeed /
howsoever with god all things are possible / specially when he will work
miraculously / yet with man it is not possible: and therefore must walk in the
kings hy-way / as Paul had / who sat at the feet of Gamaliel, and many others
that kept the schools of the prophets. 1. Cor. 14. Act. 13.1. But our fugitive
ytchinge spirits / because each of them would be A teacher in Israel / they
skorne all learning / tongues / arts and readinge / and who so bold as blind
bayarde?

Some odd Philosophers held / that A man dying / his soul was conuaide into
some other Man / or Beast / or for some excellency seated amongst the stars: If
this dreane had been true / I would have thought that the Emperor Licinius his
ghost / were mingled amongst these men. He held Learning the Common wealths
ratsbane / and these cannot abide to hear of schools of Learning. They
magine their Brother learned enough: if he can (with some unlettered ministers)
reason thus: The Apostles were Fishermen and Paul a Tentmaker therefore beloved
brethren / A fig for Universities: God has chosen the foolish and the weak
to confound the wise and strong / Therefore A rush for Beza / Calvin / ey / for
all the Greek and Latin Fathers / and Doctors. And if this teacher can add:
Peter calls Christ the son of God / therefore Christ is only God: oh / he
shall have A Comic applause: he may put on the Tragic buskin / and thensforth
trudge from Conuenticle to Conuenticle / in the office of an Apostle. What if
his neighbor Artemon should step in / and oppose with this argument: Christ
calls himself the son of man, therefore he is not god but bare man (specially
seeing Christ must be credited before Peter) what would their pseudo-Apostle
say? I fear / if a third step not in and say / both scriptures are true / for
Christ is true God and true Man / the men would go nere to fire the house in
their heat.

Sweet Carpenter / thus they plowe furrows on thy back all the day long.
Though Eutiches and Manes should with Thomas Didimus, shoue their hands into thy
side / they will not believe thy humanity: Though Cerinthus and Artemon hear
thy Apostle say: In the / the plenitude of the god head dwells bodiy, they
will not believe thy divine essence: and though Apollinaris hear the say / My
soul is heavy unto the death: as also / Into thy hands I commend my spirit,
Yet he will not believe that the word God assumed with the body / a Soul / or
a reasonable soul. But rather in his followers make Christ an odd third
thing / as is water and wine mingled. If the Carpenters are smite not home
into the hearts of such Diuiders of Jesus / surely they are like to persist
reproueable Timber.

Is not this the Carpenter? Yes. Is not this Maryes son? Yes. When the Hearers
were offended in him (en auto) not by him (for the scandale was Taken, not
Given) they then fall to What Is and Ifs and all sorts of disgracinge
Interrogatories. Had he with Noah, Lot, Abraham, Isaac, Judah, David, Jeremy,
Jonah, Peter, Barnabas, Mark: Had he transgressed with these / they would have
had it up. But wantinge Syn (and therein he went before all Prophets) they
toss up and down (as with a Racket) his Calling and Birthe homely: not being
able to infringe his Doctrine / they labor to disgorge their stomach on his
Person. The pageant of our odd spirits / up and down. If they cannot except
with Reason against our Carpenters ministry their Doctrine / then they fly unto
their Persons / exquiringe insyde and outsyde / if any spot may be found for
stranglinge the Doctrine in their bodies. If they have dealt so with the Grene
stock / how will they deal with the dry (though not withered) branches.
Speak unto this generation as John did to the Pharisees / oh generation of
vipers (Math. 3.7.) that for bringing your selves to worlds light / do bore
holes in the belly of the Church: Or with Paul unto / Bariesus (Act. 13.) give
unto them their proper Attribute / 1. For resistinge the truth them selves: 2.
for seking to turn others also from the truth: Or with Jesus (Math.
12.32.33.34.) prem^nish them of the grand syn against the holy ghost / oh then
they put their fingers in the ear and with tooth / tongue and hand they
labor the Ministers disgrace / yea destruction final. They will accuse such
Teachers of want of Meeknes and humility (for they would rule over us by
humblenes of Mind / Colos. 2.18. Creping into howses for leadinge simple sowles
captive / 2. Tim. 3.6.) But let the two edged sword of the word be applied
closely to their Reins / our Philosophers that brag of such patience / will
let us se their venom that before juggled under the board.

In the Places of Heb. 6.1.2.3.4.5.6. and Chapter 10.23. unto 28. verse. is A syn
laid down termed Irremissible. To the effectinge which syn / two particulars
are mentioned: the One a forsakinge of the beginnings of faith, Called also
Hope: the other is a forsakinge of fellowship Or communion spiritual with such
as with whom they had community spiritual. This Collection is plain: and
other Collection there is not. Such Apostasy and Schism is termed Willinge:
because they do not (as Peter did) fall forcebly through fear of Civil power or
such external things. For the word ( ecousios) Willingly or freely, is such an
unforced fall as was Iulians in the whole foundation: of Arius and many other
heretics in the truth of Christ's person: and such has been the fall and
schism of Most of these who whetted my pen unto this treatise. Not Apostates
only in the Mouth (as was Ecebolius and Fr. Spiera) but that which is worse /
Apostates in the heart (the place of Faithes rootinge) as by their own
resistinge the truth (and that bitterly) which once they held and professed
with knowledge and much Comfort / it appears. For first they have been
enlightened / tasted of the heavenly guifte and stood in and for that Hope: But
afterward unconstrained by outward power / they have freely forsaken the
grounds / either wholly with Julian or in part with Arius: nor yet cold we ever
se any one of them possessed with Repentance: but either swalowe up more of
the Dragons water: or else are one with Papists / Anabaptists / Arrians / and
what sect not (yet condemninge them all) in A word / flat Atheistes. These
(consideringe the truth they once held) are said (Tit. 3.11.) to be damned of
their own selves. Nor is this the Nouatians doctrine / for they understood
this Syn in the Hebrews / not only of Faith / but also of Manners: which is
evidently not only against common experience in the faithful falling 70. times
7. times in Manners and yet arising again / but also) against the open textes
/ which propound unto us a fallinge from faith / or hope in the foundation / or
beginings of Christ. Which syn by some is held irremissable symply: by some
irremissable in respect: tha is / in regard it is almost never pardoned: unto
which sense Ise not how I may easly oppose.

Such Fallers and withdrawers / seem to us in worse estate then was Elymas /
for these once admitted / Yea rejoiced in the light / so had not he: these have
fallen backward from the stairs whereby with comfort they seemed to ascend into
the Temples Chamber: Elpmas so fell not / but labored to hinder others to
ascend. These as stars fallen from the firmament / labor with Lucifer to
hale others after. Bariesus labored but to keep others in the same darkness he
was borne and bred in. Peter calls such / wells drawn dry / clouds carried
about: and Jude terms them despisers of Government / twice dead / pulled up by
the roots / raging waves / Planets or wandering stars / denying God and our
Lord Jesus Christ. Not that ever any one possessed with the beginings of faith
did simply fall from all acknowledginge God and Christ (for never was such a
thing) and the two Apostles foretell that there should be many of these spirits)
but a fallinge freely (unconstrained) from the rudiments of God and Christ first
received from the Ghospel. These Apostates and withdrawing spirits / upon the
hearing and reading hereof / They will have what is and ifs and all sorts of
Narrations / whereby to be offended in me. Their fathers dealt so with the living
root of the vine: and must I (an unworthy dry branch / though through god his
grace vnblasted) must I escape scotfre? No / no. These spirits must speak evil
of the things they know not: and what they know naturally / Jude. 10.) as
beasts unreasonable / even in those things also they corrupt themselves. But
our Carpenter has set down A law / that persecuting his members (specially
his Ministers) it is a persecuting of himself (the better may we bear it) as
also that such but kick against the prick to their own Peril.

Amiable myld speeches are for such as yet have not com to the truth: or having
comprehended some things / have not yet attained unto other things (for we but
se in part) but Mosaical theratnings appertain to the former spirits. Secondly
Euangelical sweetness is for bruized reeds / not obstinat hearts. Thirdly / all
falling through in firmity / is to be supported with meeknes: but backslidinges
(as the former) are to hear this speech: The light of the Righteous increases
until perfect day / but the candle of the wicked shall be blown o^t: and unto
them is reserved (what time the Talent is deprived) this sentence: bynd him
hand and foot and cast him into vtterdarknes: there shall be weping and gnashing
of teth. He that puts not A difference (Jude. 22.23.) in the manner of
saving and calling people out of sowles danger / he therein is ignorant of the
Law and the Ghospel. The Niniuets prevented (by Repentance) the Judgment
denounced by Jonah. I would not with that Prophet fret but rejoice / if these
spirits by tymely repentance / would fly from judgment ensuinge.

Is not this the Carpenter, Mary's Son? Yes: this is the Carpenter / on whose
edged axe Many should fall: and this is Mary's son in regard of the flesh: but
the son of God by the first generation / whose goinge out was before beginning
of Days: A Rock of offense / and a stone whereupon many should fall till they
were grounded to powder: and yet the light of the Gentiles / and the glory of
his people Israel. This Carpenter is the Christ: His adversary is Antichrist.
Whosoever gather not unto this Carpenter / they scater to him / but gather unto
the Dragon the parent of Antichrist. His exalted Adversary is either Gog /
Covered: Or Magog / uncovered. The Covered Antichrist / is that heretical body
which is opposite to Mahomet, of how contrary sects soever. The Open adversary
is Jew and Mahomet: But Mahomet giuinge more glory to our Carpenter / then Does
the Jew accursed. But all of them prove Adversaries exalted against Mary's son.
All of them join (as do the Carpenters / Zechar. 1.20.21.) in One against our
Carpenters house / but in the end he shall with his Axe of vengeance Cut of the
horns of the wicked.

Well thou art the Carpenter and Mary's son: hew out thy work as thou will. Some
timber for thy ship / all the chips for the fire. And what (by the finger of
thy spirit) thou have begone in me / vouch safe thou to finish unto the smallest
pynne: and that according to the glorious Arch-type / thou brought out of the
bosom of the Father: so be it.

Crysostomus. There be Some which judge badly of all things: For if A man study
hum^lity / they say he is an hypocrite: If he recreate himself / he is fleshly:
If patient / he is fearful: If he strive for justice / he is impatient: If
simple / A fool: If prudent / then Malicious: If rypened / then Melancholik:
If merry / then dissolute* If religious / then they term him singular: If
socia^le / then secular: If silent and peaceable / a dissimuler. To the Reader.

sense is somtymes harsh. For Mutation and transposition sometimes of A Letter /
thou may easily pass over. As I shall have better means / expect better
work: mean time:

Something has some savor.
